    <Title>Netting of Financial Contracts Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Col N="1572" />
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The subject matter of the Netting of Financial Contracts Bill is something new, even to those involved in the area of finance, but the fact that such a Bill is being introduced only serves to underline the continuing commitment of this Government to fostering the financial services sector as a means of producing high quality employment and wealth for this country.</P>
      <P>The Bill is short, containing only five sections, and seeks simply to ensure that agreements between two parties to set-off their mutual liabilities so as to arrive at a single net amount owing by one party to another are enforceable.  The ability of both parties to reduce their mutual exposure to risk to the net amount owing between them at any time is clearly of benefit to both parties. The calculation of this net amount is called set-off or netting.</P>
      <P>It is only the netting of liabilities in respect of &ldquo;financial contracts&rdquo; that is provided for in the Bill.  These contracts are interest-rate, foreign exchange and commodity based contracts &mdash; more commonly called derivative contracts. The liabilities of the same two parties in respect of other trading activities between them will not benefit from the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Stability, through risk management, is a substantial concern of financial services companies, and banks especially, in view of the large size of their transactions and the volume of business they may transact with major clients.  In the case of banks and other credit institutions, there are special requirements that they hold reserves in proportion to their risk exposure.  These requirements are embodied in the EU Solvency Ratio and Capital Adequacy Directives and their implementation is supervised by the Central Bank.  The European Commission, however is currently finalising <Col N="1573" /> an amending Directive to the Solvency Ratio Directive which will allow supervisors, such as the Central Bank, to recognise the risk reducing effects of the type of set off or netting I described.</P>
    <P>Netting agreements are already recognised in many countries, particularly non-EU countries and, therefore, banks based in those countries benefit from increased stability because having enforceable netting agreements reduces their exposure.  Just as importantly, as they are permitted to carry lower reserves than their EU counterparts, they benefit from lower operating costs. The draft directive, which I expect to be finalised within the next two months, represents the Commission's response to concerns that credit institutions in member states are not disadvantaged <i>vis-à-vis</i> their non-EU counterparts.</P>
    <P>However, Irish law does not refer specifically to netting and so there are doubts about the enforceability of netting in cases of insolvency.  The company law area contains, as far as the provisions relating to examinership are concerned, specific barriers to the operation of netting or set off.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to address the issue of doubt and specific barriers only to the extent that they interfere with the operation of netting agreements, and even then, only to netting agreements that cover derivative contracts.  The more general issues in this area are the subject of recommendations by the Company Law Review Group and are being considered in the first instance by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte.  These issues have broader implications for business in general and will be dealt with by company law amendment, if appropriate.</P>
    <P>The Government, however, is satisfied that the very narrow case in relation to netting agreements should be dealt with separately because of the capital adequacy benefits on offer to banks and similar institutions like building societies and investment firms authorised under the Investment Services Directive, such as, fund management <Col N="1574" /> companies, collective investment companies, unit trusts etc. and recognised third country investment firms when the forthcoming EU Directive is finalised and because of the need to maintain the most favourable environment for financial services consistent with the highest regulatory and prudential requirements.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming directive will require those institutions seeking its benefits to furnish the Central Bank with written and reasoned opinion confirming that netting agreements are legally enforceable.  Many banks operating in the domestic market and from the IFSC have made clear the importance they attach to the new directive.  I understand that it was the undertaking to move ahead more quickly than many of our competitors in this regard that has secured one major international project for the IFSC already and that a number of major players in the North American market have signalled their interest in Dublin as a result of the enhanced overall package combining advanced communications, quality labour, high specification accommodation, and an accessible and responsible regulatory and fiscal environment now on offer in the IFSC.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the Bill is short and that its purpose is simple, however, some of its provisions are complex reflecting the nature of the transactions and the agreements which cover them.</P>
    <P>Section 1 contains standard definitions of the Central Bank of Ireland, the Minister for Finance, the Companies Acts, and party to a netting agreement is defined as a person, relying on the meaning of person in the Interpretation Act, 1937, so that an individual, partner, company of any kind etc. may be one of the two parties to a netting or master netting agreement.  The term &ldquo;money&rdquo; is also defined so as to include foreign currency.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;financial contract&rdquo; is defined to include those contracts, basically derivative contracts, which are contained in Annex III of the EU Solvency Ratio Directive.  Annex III is currently being revised and the definition <Col N="1575" /> anticipates the outcome of that revision, especially as regards the inclusion of commodity based contracts.  It is the contracts in Annex III that the forthcoming directive on netting will recognise. Other contracts which are regularly used in the market, but which are not recognisable by the Central Bank for capital adequacy purposes, are included in the definition, in particular, foreign exchange contracts of less than 14 days duration and contracts traded on exchanges.</P>
    <P>Finally, provision is made within the definition of financial contract for (i) the Central Bank to formally add to the definition any contract contained in Annex III or any contract contained in any revised Annex or equivalent, and (ii) the Minister for Finance to include contracts within the definition, thereby allowing for the inclusion of new contracts which are rapidly evolving.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;netting&rdquo; is defined to include the termination of individual financial derivative contracts, the calculation of the amount owing on each contract to either party and the addition of all of the amounts due and owing to each party to arrive at a single amount due by one party to the other.  A netting agreement would contain provisions setting out the circumstances under which it will operate.</P>
    <P>Netting agreement is defined so that any agreement providing for netting of financial contracts will be within the scope of the legislation.  Such an agreement may also provide for the use of collateral by either party, that is where one party to an agreement requires collateral to be supplied for use in the event that a net amount is owing to that party as a result of the operation of a netting agreement.  It is sometimes the practice in the industry that two parties would have separate netting agreements in relation to interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity based contracts and, accordingly, master netting agreements are used to sum the outcomes of each netting agreement.</P>
    <P>Master netting agreement is defined <Col N="1576" /> as any agreement where provision is made to offset the amounts due between two parties under a number of netting agreements.  For operational reasons two parties might have separate agreements in relation to their interest rate, currency and commodity based transactions but in the event of the agreements being triggered they would require that the net amount due under each, in both directions, be aggregated. Such agreements may contain provisions in relation to collateral, identical to those contained in netting agreements.</P>
    <P>Under section 2 the bank is given the power to include in the definition of financial contract any contract included in Annex III of the Solvency Ratio Directive or any contract added to same from time to time.  The bank will give effect to any changes by the issuance of notice under this section.  As I already indicated, the definition of financial contract in the Bill is based on, but is more comprehensive than, Annex III of the relevant EU Directive, so it is not anticipated that the bank will have to issue a notice under the section on enactment.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 the Minister for Finance is empowered to include, in consultation with the Central Bank, contracts or types of contracts within the definition of financial contracts.  He is also empowered to exclude contracts from within the scope of the definition and, therefore, from within the scope of the legislation whether or not they were ever included.  The Minister exercises his powers under this section by issuance of regulations which must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  As a safeguard, to ensure that contracts in Annex III are not inadvertently ruled out, any regulation by the Minister which excludes any contract from within the definition of financial contract, cannot exclude any contract which has been included by the Central Bank under its powers under section 2.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with enforceability of netting, setoff and collateral under netting and master netting agreements. This is the core section of the Bill. <Col N="1577" /> Section 4 (1) (a) provides certainty by disapplying any prohibitions which may exist in case law in bankruptcy, liquidation, examinership or receivership, or in the Companies Acts or the Bankruptcy Act, 1988, that netting is legally enforceable where a netting agreement exists.  It also ensures that, where collateral is provided for in the agreement, a party will be entitled to use the collateral against any net amount owing to it as a result of the netting provisions of the agreement.  The provision is drafted so that its terms will apply only to collateral, in the form of money, securities, guarantees and secured guarantees, provided specifically to meet any net amount due under a netting agreement. Identical provisions are included in section 4 (1) (b) in relation to the enforceability of master netting agreements and collateral and guarantees given in relation to them.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (2) ensures that the relevant rules of law and sections of the companies Acts and the Bankruptcy Act, 1988, in particular, which deal with fraud, misrepresentation, etc. will not be set aside by section 4 (1).  It also seeks to ensure that neither a netting or master netting agreement can be enforced by virtue of section 4 where the terms of the agreement would render it void or unenforceable.</P>
    <P>The final two subsections of section 4 provide for two other matters which are deemed necessary to ensure the removal of doubt in relation to derivative trading in general.  Section 4 (3) disapplies the provision in the Statute of Frauds, 1695, which obliges contracts with a duration of greater than one year to be committed to writing before being enforceable.  This recognises the industry practice of screen-to-screen or telephone based trading, and that such trading is often in relation to two and three year contracts.  Such contracts will now be immediately enforceable.</P>
    <P>Section 4 (4) clarifies, for the avoidance of doubt, that financial contracts are excluded from the scope of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956 to 1986, and that they were always <Col N="1578" /> excluded.  Clearly, that legislation was never intended to apply to derivative contracts.  Section 5 provides for the short Title of the Bill.</P>
    <P>To summarise, the main purpose of the Bill is to ensure that banks and other parties trading in derivatives will have the certainty that netting agreements entered into by them for the purpose of reducing their risk exposure will be legally enforceable in the event of bankruptcy, insolvency or examinership, providing always that the agreements are properly drafted.  The Bill will ensure, where collateral is provided by either party specifically to secure potential obligations in the event of a netting or master netting agreement being acted upon, that the collateral so provided can be offset against amounts owed to that party under an agreement.</P>
    <P>My appointment as Minister of State for the International Financial Services Centre demonstrates the commitment of this Government to the continued development of Dublin as a financial services centre that can compete internationally. The decision by the European Commission to extend the deadline for new entrants to the centre by an additional six years coincided with the formation of this Government.  This focused my attention on developing a strategy so that those extra years could be used to best advantage.  Having said that, six years is a relatively short time. I am also intent on looking beyond that again, where appropriate, to seek to secure the long term expansion and development of the centre.  To this end, I am currently engaged in a series of meetings with senior public sector and industry figures aimed at developing an agreed way forward to capitalise on the opportunities provided by the extension of the deadline.</P>
    <P>There is still a very significant flow of new projects being brought forward by IDA Ireland and the desired expansion for the centre will come naturally as the number of IFSC companies builds, as the range of products and services on offer grows, and as the experience and reputation of IFSC companies increases. <Col N="1579" /> I have set the following objectives in relation to the economic development of the centre: to substantially increase the level of direct employment from the current level approaching 2,500 over the next five years &mdash; it is hoped to double or perhaps treble this number to bring the total to between 4,000 and 6,000.  The creation of at least 1,000 jobs in related back-office activity &mdash; between these two, 5,000 additional jobs over a five year period is a reasonable target, maximising consequential employment in associated legal, accounting and general &mdash; software development and security, cleaning, catering and other &mdash; services in the domestic economy.  In addition, I have set up a long term review group, under my chairmanship and consisting of representatives at senior level from the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance, the National Treasury Management Agency and the IDA to plan in a concerted way the long term development of the centre.</P>
    <P>I am intent on taking a proactive role in the development of the centre which I believe has now achieved its critical mass stage and is accepted as a player on the international stage.  With this in mind, I recently visited Boston and New York and met some of the most senior figures in the financial world, many of them with interests in the IFSC or interested in locating there, to hear at first hand their views on Dublin.  It was clear to me that the chief executives of major companies were acutely aware of the centre and the benefits of locating there, indeed many of them were visiting Dublin to see for themselves.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to appoint an international ministerial advisory committee to advise on realisable targets to set to ensure that the great progress made in establishing the IFSC continues to gain momentum and is maximised.  As part of my overall strategy for the centre, it is my intention to ensure that a continuous programme of legislative change, consistent with a well regulated environment, is maintained, so that we can keep our competitive position.  This Bill <Col N="1580" /> is one such step in that programme and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Netting of Financial Contracts Bill, 1995, and I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.</P>
      <P>There have been serious doubts about the legal enforceability of netting agreements when one party to such an agreement becomes insolvent.  Such types of netting agreements are in regular use in the derivatives market.  They help to reduce risks for the parties involved and bring stability to the market in general. I understand this legislation anticipates a European Union draft directive currently being finalised which will allow the Central Bank to recognise the risk reducing effect of netting agreements for the calculation of the capital adequacy of credit institutions. Obviously, it is necessary to be legally certain that such agreements are enforceable.</P>
      <P>It is unusual for the Taoiseach's Department to introduce legislation of this nature, it would normally be the remit of the Departments of Finance or Enterprise and Employment.  I welcome the commitment to the development of the Irish Financial Services Centre. While the provisions of this Bill will affect financial institutions, it will improve Ireland's competitive position and enhance the attractiveness of the International Financial Services Centre as a location for foreign companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The growth in the development of the IFSC since 1987 is a wonderful success story.  In the debate on the budget I congratulated those who had the initiative and foresight to go ahead with its establishment, my party was then in power led by former Deputy Charles J. Haughey.  The idea emanated from Mr. Dermot Desmond who put his head on the block and pushed the project forward. He is a friend and I am proud to be associated with him.  His perseverance, with the support of the former Taoiseach.  Deputy Haughey, demonstrated that Ireland &mdash; despite the fact that some people may have doubted we <Col N="1581" /> could become a major international player &mdash; has proved itself in this area.</P>
    <P>As last year's figures show, there is now an enormous corporation tax yield &mdash; which has been increasing over the years &mdash; from companies within the IFSC.  Ireland has taken its rightful place as the location of a major financial centre comparable with any worldwide, in the views of many foreigners it outranks the services available in the city of London, our nearest and major competitor.</P>
    <P>Since the IFSC was established in 1987 successive Governments have committed themselves to supporting its development.  Tremendous progress has been made since 1987, with the IFSC in Dublin becoming a fast growing, internationally recognised financial services centre.  When the Taoiseach announced the establishment of Merrill Lynch in the IFSC last week it was known that the company was concerned that certain legislation was not on the Statute Book. I think I read some comment by the Taoiseach or Minister for Finance last year that this Bill would be forthcoming. It was brought about by the decision of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Bank to locate in Ireland.  I express a warm welcome to the company here, a bank which is an arm of the giant Merrill Lynch financial services group.  Its decision to locate in Dublin was announced in December last.  It has also been announced that the bank will locate initially in the Treasury Building prior to moving to the International Financial Services Centre.  It is reported that in time the new bank will take over most of Merrill Lynch's non-dollar capital market activities, with employment increasing to 50 by the end of this year, rising to upwards of 75 by the second quarter of 1996.</P>
    <P>It is extremely good news to learn that the IFSC captured such an impressive, well regarded United States giant, with the forecast that its employment levels will increase to 160 at full capacity.  It is particularly heartening on the last day of session that we can eagerly anticipate the arrival of a company <Col N="1582" /> the size of Merrill Lynch locating in this centre.  The sheer size of the company is breathtaking, its balance sheet is as large as that of City Corps., America's largest bank, employing almost 44,000 people, operating in 32 countries worldwide. It is well known that other European locations, including Zurich, were strong contenders for the Merrill Lynch operation, yet Dublin won.</P>
    <P>Merrill Lynch pointed to the superb support and co-operation it had received from everyone here, at every level, including industry officials and the Government.  Indeed the Chairman of Merrill Lynch congratulated the then Administration on its co-operation, working hand in hand with industry, in a constructive, productive partnership.  Of course, other prime considerations in its final decision to locate in Dublin, over the well established financial and banking hub of Zurich, included our well recognised, available, educated and skilled workforce, incentive packages offered by our Government, advanced communications systems and the availability of high quality technological support. The decision by Merrill Lynch to establish a headquarters facility in Dublin is the largest project yet attracted to the IFSC, representing a landmark.  We all hope that this decision of Merrill Lynch will induce many other financial institutions to view Dublin as a sound business location.</P>
    <P>In excess of 240 operations have received primary licences to locate in the IFSC, which do not include 100 treasuries and 90 capital insurance facilities, managed on an agency basis by licensed operators in the centre.  The development of the centre is due in no small part to the close co-operation between Government Departments and agencies, such as the IDA and the Central Bank, on the one hand, and local and international financial services institutions and professional firms on the other.  I know that Dublin is being marketed by the IDA as a location for access to Governments, regulators being available, where there is a commitment <Col N="1583" /> to ensuring an environment within which financial services are promoted.</P>
    <P>From my experience as Minister for Tourism and Trade I am aware of the need for a comprehensive marketing message to be delivered; we have the ready-made ingredients here at home. Companies considering locating here will be well aware of a number of factors which will encourage them: the highly skilled, well educated, computer-literate, flexible workforce.  From my experience of travelling abroad, that is the biggest selling point when one mentions Ireland to foreigners.  No matter where one travels when it comes to anything related to technology or finance, Irish graduates are at the top of their professions, they have given Ireland a name which must be the envy of others. Within the past month I met some international business people who told me they knew young Irish men and women, worldwide, heading various corporate institutions or treasury departments. They said those young people had given Ireland a tremendous name, resulting in all such international companies now seeking similar Irish graduates.  They are our best ambassadors, much more effective than anything the IDA could do in attracting foreign firms here and their expertise is our best selling point. This means that any foreign company considering locating here knows it will have the requisite support and expertise.</P>
    <P>It is nice to be able to boast about this because when one travels abroad and mentions finance, inevitably the response will be that Irish people head departments in the technology and financial sectors.</P>
    <P>We also have a world class telecommunications system enabling us to transmit information globally, including satellite links with the United States and Europe.  We no longer have exchange controls, there is a 10 per cent corporation tax rate guaranteed to the year 2005 and a range of favourable double taxation agreements with most of the world's trading nations, without any <Col N="1584" /> withholding tax on dividends and interest from the International Financial Services Centre.  Those are just some of the unique advantages Ireland offers companies in these areas.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the most important item on the agenda of any Government and that of all political parties here. Consequently, the IFSC is ideally placed to play a major role in this respect.  There are at present in excess of 2,500 people employed directly by IFSC companies, committed to the creation of an additional 2,000 jobs over the next five years.  Of course, there is a spin-off in employment associated with these jobs, with potential for employment in accountancy, legal and other general service firms from the development of the centre.  This Bill will be another component of the growing legislative framework which will improve our edge in attracting companies here and, in doing so, create many more jobs for our young people.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify a number of small points.  Essentially, I suppose this Bill constitutes an interference with freedom to contract although, in this case, it is desirable interference; otherwise, bankers would require additional security against the possibility of losing out to another creditor say, in the case of bankruptcy yet this is being forced on us because ordinary judicial law has not moved with the times.  Why has judicial law not moved with the times?  Another question that warrants consideration is who may lose out if and when this Bill is enacted since its benefits will accrue to traders in forward and optional contracts?  Therefore, is the price an increased likelihood of default on other loans by financial institutions? In addition, if the Central Bank is involved, does this represent a prime opportunity for the bank to be required to report annually on the level of trading of the type outlined in the Bill and its consequent implications for the Irish pound and economy generally?</P>
    <P>One section of the Bill states that the provisions of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 do not apply to anyone <Col N="1585" /> operating in this field.  I presume it is necessary to include such a provision because people operating in this field are, to use a loose term, engaging in a form of gambling.  That is not to say that the people in the international Financial Services Centre are gamblers; I am sure they would be offended by any such implication.  One must take a view, however, on how matters will arise in the future with respect to currency and the form of contracts.  The Minister was wise to include this provision because at some time in the future a court might have interpreted some transactions as constituting gambling.  Consequently, the provisions of the Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1956 would apply.  One of the benefits of that Act is that a debt incurred under the Act is not legally enforceable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I wish the International Financial Services Centre success in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy McCreevy, I welcome the Bill which is an appropriate one to bring forward.  If there was any doubt as to the capacity of netting agreements to be enforced under Irish law, and if this was in any way an obstacle to the establishment of financial service companies here such as Merill Lynch and others, then it was proper and timely of the Taoiseach's Department to deal with this issue.</P>
      <P>The law relating to setting off, in the context of insolvency and company liquidations, should be examined separately by this House and our time would be well spent in considering how the present judge made law in relation to setoff in the context of insolvency and liquidations is uncertain and unsatisfactory and could be the subject of a statutory restatement.  Without detracting from the urgency or aptness of this Bill, the upholding of netting agreements in respect of financial contracts should not deflect us from reflecting on the fact that there are good grounds for reviewing the whole law in relation to setoff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy asked why judicial <Col N="1586" /> law is not keeping up to date with developments. Do we want judges to act as legislators?  They can only interpret the law we give them and we cannot constantly cast on them the function of closing loopholes and modernising our law. It falls, generally speaking, on this House to carry out that function.</P>
    <P>I have a book of statutes at home which was published in 1702.  Obviously, some ancestor of mine had it on a shelf because the penal laws are contained in it.  Some of those are very interesting, for example, £5 horses not remaining in the hands of the Catholics, but among this set of Acts dating from 1695 was the original of the statute of frauds.  It is amazing that that Act is still law.  That is not the fault of the judges; it is our fault.  I do not know whether the period of one year chosen for enforceability by the statute is appropriate in this day and age.  It might be sensible to require long term contracts to be reduced to writing. We might now, 300 years later, examine that particular rule and the other rules in relation to the maximum value of contracts for the sale of goods that have to be put in writing.  We might also examine the law relating to guarantees and warranties set out in the statute of frauds and ask ourselves whether that measure might not be revisited.</P>
    <P>Contracts relating to the sale of land should be the subject of a statutory restatement.  The 1695 Act in relation to that issue, and all the case law that has accumulated, has led to the present complex position whereby one must pore over various judgments of the courts to determine what does and does not constitue a written contract for the sale of land.</P>
    <P>If we were to do anything in this 300th anniversary of the statute of frauds, we might set up a study, perhaps in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, to inquire as to whether that Act should be replaced by a modern statute which states clearly, in unequivocal terms, the contracts that are required to be put in writing and what constitutes a contract for the purpose of the statute of frauds.  In relation <Col N="1587" /> to that statute, it must be remembered that judges invented a rule of part performance, to the effect that even if there was not a written contract, and if there had been a verbal contract put into effect to a material degree by the parties, the absence of written agreement was overcome by that part performance.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy mentioned the other provision in section 4 (4) relating to the Gaming and Lotteries Acts, 1956 to 1986.  He made the point that there is an analogy between dealing in futures and gambling, and there is in one sense. There is also an analogy between insurance and gambling in another sense but my recollection of the Gaming and Lotteries Act defined &ldquo;gaming&rdquo;&mdash; and I presume we are not describing this as a lottery &mdash; as a game of skill or chance or partly of skill or chance for stakes hazarded by the players.  It would be a very obtuse judge that would find that dealing in financial futures was a game of skill or chance for stakes hazarded by the players.  To define it as a game might be colloquially acceptable in a pub but I do not think it would stand up in a court.</P>
    <P>If it is thought necessary to exclude the Gaming and Lotteries Act in respect of the enforceability of a financial contract as defined in this Bill, there are other rules of law on gambling contracts and their enforceability which do not derive from that particular statute.  It might have been wiser to extend the exclusion to any rule of law, either statute or common law, so that the enforceability of gambling debts would not apply.</P>
    <P>The International Financial Services Centre has turned out to be a tremendous project.  I should echo what Deputy McCreevy has said, that the credit for it goes to Mr. Charles Haughey who, as Taoiseach, pushed the project forward with great conviction and determination, and also to its originators, including Mr. Dermot Desmond and others.  The scheme to provide employment opportunities for young Irish graduates at home, of which <Col N="1588" /> Deputy McCreevy was speaking, was clever and imaginative.  It is an opportunity to bring worthwhile enterprise to Dublin.  Without it, those companies would not have located in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister of State well with its proposals to increase employment in the International Financial Services Centre.  I am glad he has brought his customary energy, determination and feistiness to this project.  There was a time when he devoted it to bringing the Olympics to Dublin.  I suppose he still does because he will never admit defeat. However, he is on a far more certain bet here and his efforts will yield far greater returns.  His idea of setting up an international consultative committee to try to draw in ideas and projects and iron out obstacles to the development of the centre is a very good one.  Knowing his tenacity and single-mindedness, if he applies himself to this project, among his many other responsibilities, I have no doubt the Irish people will be well rewarded by the dividend from that ministerial effort.</P>
    <P>This is obviously a worthwhile Bill which removes an obstacle which could have proved fatal to the Merrill Lynch project.  I do not want to lose sight of the other point I made, that our law, 300 years old in relation to the necessity for written contracts, needs to be revised generally.  Although it is sensible to tackle one problem by this Bill, the general problem still remains, that we are dealing with an antiquated law.  To read the statute is very difficult, but if the Members of this House address their minds to the Statute of Frauds Act and realise that this is still a cornerstone of Irish commercial law 300 years later, they might be surprised by some of its contents.  It is time to revisit the legislative underpinnings of finance and commerce. That it is 300 years old does not mean it is wrong but, from my experience, I know it is an uncertain law which could do with being tidied up and modernised. It seems a shame that we only consider doing so in the context of an immediate and pressing problem in one <Col N="1589" /> industry when there are many others where the same problem arises.</P>
    <P>The banking industry generally was consulted on the preparation of this Bill, and I am glad of that.  If the financial institutions come before the Government with an agenda for revision of outdated statutory rules on insolvency, company law, enforceability of contracts, etc., I hope they will not be given the brush-off because it would not be politically interesting or politically rewarding to face up to the need to modernise our statute law.  I hope the message does not go out that a big player coming on the scene can have the law changed but the ordinary Joe Soaps must continue to labour under 300 year old antiquated laws because there is no political benefit in using the time of this House to achieve the necessary changes.</P>
    <P>This Bill is being passed in one morning, and on the last day of the Dáil session. There are many other simple measures which could improve the commercial efficacy of this country which could be similarly passed in this House and in regard to which the Opposition, as far as I am concerned and, I am sure, as far as Deputy McCreevy is concerned, would equally co-operate. There is no reason sensible changes to our law which are non party political and which command general support should not be passed by this House in an hour or so from time to time in similar circumstances to these.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies McCreevy and McDowell for their contributions.  I also thank Deputy McCreevy for his personal good wishes.  I join with the Deputies in congratulating those who had the vision to take on this project. The former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, played a major part, as did the other gentleman mentioned by Deputy McCreevy, and nobody should seek to take that away from them. There are probably many people who would have said the same thing about the International Financial Services <Col N="1590" /> Centre as they say about the Olympics. I do not understand for one minute why a Deputy should decide, without ever having done a study, that Dublin can never host the Olympics.  If we allowed economists to rule this country we would not have had a Phoenix Park and we certainly would not have an international financial services centre.  A study by some of the major business and sporting personalities in this city and country on whether Dublin will make an Olympic bid is well under way and will be published later this year.  Any decision will be based on that study, not on the cynicism of the commentators who have put obstacles every inch of the way along my route.  As it has been raised, the purpose of the Dublin International Sports Council is not simply to look at bringing the Olympics to Dublin, but at bringing in major international events which will reflect well on the country after 25 years of negative advertising, so that people will know this country for a country with attractions not just our tax regime but our qualified and able young people.  That is something that comes through very strongly.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy asked why the Judiciary has not kept pace with the times.  That was answered in part by Deputy McDowell, but my head spins when I hear some of the new ideas for hybrid contracts and funds.  It must be difficult for the Judiciary to keep pace with them.  It is a job we will have to do here.</P>
      <P>This Bill will not restrict rights to contract but reinforces them.  The Central Bank could report on the volume of trading in this area.  We would need to check on the rights of access of the bank to pertinent information.  As to who would lose, the creditors of the defaulting party may lose; equally the creditors of the other party will benefit. Trades in this area will be more stable if they engage in netting agreements and, it is hoped, we will avoid domino effects from the major failures of one party only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> I agree with Deputy McDowell that there is a need to review the Statute of Frauds Act, 1695 and I will bring that to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for Justice.  Depending on the legislative timetable some of this law could perhaps be revised or reviewed.  I would not suggest that Oireachtas committees introduce Bills, but they could at least give their view on some of these very old laws without waiting for an initiative from the Executive.  I will also pass on the Deputy's comments on company law to the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who is examining the Bill.  I do not know where gambling stops and hedging begins.  However, I do know that chartered accountants deal with hedging and turf accountants deal with gambling.  Perhaps that is how one recognises the difference.</P>

    <P>I welcome this opportunity to debate the 1995 Estimates.  It is appropriate at this stage of the year to review progress to date on the economic and budgetary fronts.  It is also a good time to look ahead to 1996 and beyond and to assess our prospects for the future.  The economic data for 1994 confirm that Ireland continues to be one of the best economic performers in the industrialised world, with strong growth, low inflation and Government borrowing, rising employment and a strong balance of payment position.</P>
    <P>The employment figures published by the CSO last week are also very encouraging. They show that on average, the total employment in transportable goods industries increased by more than 4,000, or about 2.25 per cent last year. This was the largest such increase since 1990.  Moreover, there was a strong upward trend in industrial employment through the year, with the numbers at work in December about 8,000 higher than they were in March.  These figures demonstrate that strong economic growth is being converted into strong employment growth but we must build on this performance for the future.</P>
    <P>As is usual at this time of the year, we are currently reviewing our budget day economic forecasts, taking account of the most recent international and domestic economic indicators and, of course, the Exchequer returns for the first half of the year which were released last Tuesday.  We will, as usual, be publishing our updated assessment in &ldquo;Economic Review and Outlook&rdquo; before the end of this month.</P>
    <P>The indicators for the year to date broadly support our budget day assessment. Output is growing strongly and the volume of manufacturing output rose by 15 per cent year on year in the first quarter.  All the indications are that investment is continuing to grow strongly.  Payroll related tax receipts suggest that employment continues to expand significantly and while consumer spending in the early part of the <Col N="1605" /> year did not seem as buoyant as might have been expected, it is now strengthening. Retail sales showed weak year-to-year growth in the first quarter but recovered strongly in April.</P>
    <P>Consumer sentiment may have taken a knock in March because of the two increases in retail interest rates in quick succession and, perhaps, because of apprehension that interest rates might rise further.  Since then, interest rate concerns have eased and disposable incomes are now being boosted by the tax and social welfare measures I introduced in the budget.  Excise and VAT receipts for May and June, although still running somewhat below budget forecasts for the year, are recovering well and may catch up with forecast levels by the autumn.</P>
    <P>The year to year rate of consumer price inflation rose from 2.5 per cent in February to 2.8 per cent in May.  This was expected given the impact of the 1 per cent rise in most mortgage interest rates in March.  However, underlying inflation &mdash; excluding the impact of the interest rate rises &mdash; actually fell from 2.7 per cent in February to 2.5 per cent in May.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the average CPI increase this year will still be close to the budget forecast of 2.5 per cent.  The strong investment performance both last year and this year will increase capacity and thus moderate any inflationary pressures stemming from strong economic growth.  The phased abolition of third level education fees this autumn will have a significant moderating effect on the CPI and we have still to see the full unwinding of the unusually high fresh vegetable prices in the early part of the year.</P>
    <P>Despite strong employment growth this year, the reduction in registered unemployment is less than expected.  It is, of course, well known that a rise in employment does not inevitably result in a corresponding fall in registered unemployment.  Strong employment growth creates wider opportunities and choices for those who might otherwise have been forced to emigrate or might <Col N="1606" /> have been discouraged from entering the labour force.</P>
    <P>My budget day arithmetic was based on the assumption that the average monthly live register figure this year would be 266,000, some 16,000 lower than the 1994 average.  It now seems most unlikely that the average reduction this year will be as large as this.  So far this year, the monthly live register has averaged 277,000 which is 10,000 or more below last year's corresponding figures.  While I expect that it will fall further in the second half of the year, it is unlikely to fall sufficiently to achieve an average of 266,000 for the year as a whole.  We are in the process of reviewing the live register outlook and will be publishing our new estimate for the 1995 average in <i>Economic Review and Outlook.</i></P>
    <P>Looking beyond 1995, the prospects for continued strong economic growth both domestically and internationally over the medium-term are good.  In the OECD area, GDP growth is expected to average about 2.75 per cent in the next two years with growth in the European Union likely to be a little stronger at around 3 per cent.  The volume of OECD imports is expected to rise by more than 7 per cent next year and this will provide growing market opportunities for our exporters provided we remain competitive.  The OECD recently predicted that economic growth in Ireland in 1996 would be around 5 per cent &mdash; again well above the OECD average &mdash; with further gains in employment and a fall in unemployment.</P>
    <P>The general improvement in Ireland's economic performance has been reflected in the public finances. Ireland's performance in relation to the agreed EU convergence criteria to date has been among the best in the Union. Ireland's general Government deficit has been below 3 per cent of GDP each year since 1989, thus meeting the minimum required under the Maastricht Treaty.  The debt ratio, apart from the once-off effects of the 1993 devaluation, has been declining steadily, and is <Col N="1607" /> expected to be about 85 per cent of GDP this year.</P>
    <P>Our inflation performance has also been steady for the past five years.  We are one of only three member states out of 15 who are abiding by the Maastricht Treaty budgetary convergence criteria this year.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the level of the annual budget deficits in recent years, combined with a professional approach to treasury management, has meant that the burden of debt and debt-service costs has also declined as a proportion of GNP.</P>
    <P>The debt ratio will fall again this year and we are determined to ensure that, in accordance with our obligations under Maastricht, the level of debt will continue to decline in the years ahead.  We are now consistently satisfying these obligations but because of the large overhang of public debt still remaining, we must continue to keep our annual deficits low, even lower than those in other EU member states.</P>
    <P>The Government's focus in formulating the 1995 budget was on the need to maintain fiscal discipline while maximising sustainable growth in output and employment within a low inflation economy.  Accordingly, the budget set the Exchequer borrowing target at 2.4 per cent of GNP, compared with the budget target of 2.7 per cent of GNP in 1994.  Within that constraint, I identified three primary objectives: reward for work, promotion of enterprise and the strengthening of social solidarity.</P>
    <P>The tax and PRSI changes made in the budget combined with the pay increases agreed to under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> will lead to an increase in real take-home pay of about 2.5 per cent for a single person on the average manufacturing wage.  Most workers benefit, but those on low incomes gain most in percentage terms.  This focusing of tax relief on those with modest incomes will improve the incentive for low productivity workers &mdash; and hence low wage workers &mdash; to take up employment <Col N="1608" /> and remain employed.  The emphasis on improving the incentive to work was also reflected in the social welfare changes announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>The profitability of business should be enhanced through the budgetary measures to reduce taxation on labour and profits.  Employers' tax reductions were again concentrated on low-paid employment, which should help firms facing competition from low-cost countries, enabling them to retain workers, and possibly employ additional workers. The lowering of the standard rate of corporation tax from 40 per cent to 38 per cent will be of particular benefit to firms in the services sector, which includes many labour intensive areas.</P>
    <P>The mid-year Exchequer figures which I published earlier this week are confirmation that overall borrowing will remain in line with the budget projection. The profile of departmental spending is in line with expectations and, while corporation tax is not performing as strongly as in recent years, overall tax revenue should turn out in line with the budget target.  Payroll taxes and indirect taxes are reasonably strong, which are indicative of increases in employment and consumer confidence.</P>
    <P>There has already been considerable discussion and debate both within this House and in the wider public domain of this Government's approach to controlling public expenditure.  Certain Members of this House, in particular, have been to the fore in attempting to discredit and criticise this Government's expenditure policy.</P>
    <P>I need not remind the House that all of these attempts to undermine this Government's determined policy on strict expenditure control have failed dismally.  They have failed because the plain fact is that this Government is the first to commit itself in advance to specific and demanding targets for the growth in current public expenditure. These targets are clear and unambiguous. Equally clear and certain is this Government's commitment to achieve the targets.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated on many previous <Col N="1609" /> occasions in this House, the charges which have been levelled against this Government in relation to its alleged &ldquo;spendthrift&rdquo; and &ldquo;out of control&rdquo; spending policies are totally unjustified and nothing short of scaremongering. That this is the case has been confirmed by independent economic commentators from the Economic and Social Research Institute which stated in its quarterly economic commentary published earlier this week that &ldquo;fears that either public spending or fiscal policy are slipping out of control appear excessive&rdquo;.  This is independent confirmation that public spending is not out of control but is being managed in a disciplined and prudent fashion as a key part of this Government's overall commitment to firm management of the public finances.</P>
    <P>The importance which this Government attaches to strict control of public expenditure is manifestly clear in the commitments we have made in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to limit the growth in current supply services expenditure to 6 per cent in 1995 and to an average of 2 per cent in real terms over the two years 1996 and 1997.  This commitment was based on our concern that the economy's capacity to produce the maximum possible rate of substainable employment growth would be severely constrained if the rate of increase in Government spending of the last five years was allowed to continue unchecked.</P>
    <P>The lessons of the past must not be forgotten and the steady growth in public spending which has been evident since 1990 had to be stopped.  We are firmly committed to ensuring that the fruits of economic growth are not fully absorbed by higher public spending, as has been the case in recent years, but are used in substantial measure for tax reform which will favour the incentive to work, tackle the poverty trap and encourage enterprise development and growth.</P>
    <P>We have made a good start in 1995 in limiting the growth in gross current departmental spending to 6.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1610" /> This, of course, includes the exceptional payments of £200 million in respect of women's social welfare entitlements under the EU equal treatment directive. We plan to make more substantial progress in 1996 and to fully honour our commitment to contain the real growth in gross current spending to 2 per cent.</P>
    <P>Let me make one point absolutely clear.  Public spending in 1995 is on target. There are no indications of the emergence of any significant underlying pressures on spending this year.  The Government is determined to achieve its target for 1995 of a 6.9 per cent nominal increase in gross non-capital supply services spending.  The mid-year Exchequer returns which were published earlier this week provide confirmation that we remain on course.</P>
    <P>There has been some comment that inflation may be running slightly higher than anticipated at budget time and that this may cause problems for the 1995 departmental Estimates.  I can assure this House that inflation is not a cause of concern in so far as this year's Estimates are concerned.  Underlying inflation, exclusive of the recent change in mortgage interest rates, actually declined in the quarter to mid-May.  I am confident that the average rate of price increase over 1995 as a whole will be close to my budget estimate.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated, we are on course to attain our target for current expenditure growth in 1995 and are determined that our targets for 1996 and 1997 will be attained also.  We are fully aware that, as in any business, careful planning is required if one is to succeed in achieving one's objectives and targets.  We have, therefore, commenced our review of the 1996 budget so that timely decisions may be taken to optimise our chances of success.  This Government has demonstrated its determination to achieve its expenditure target for 1996 by taking decisions at this stage in preparation for the 1996 budget.</P>
    <P>I wish to make clear that the interim decisions on public expenditure which the Government took recently are aimed at containing the growth in gross <Col N="1611" /> current supply services expenditure in 1996 within the 2 per cent real increase figure to which it committed itself in its programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> A review of spending trends carried out recently by my Department pointed to a risk that, based on a continuation of existing programmes and policies, gross departmental current spending could grow next year at a rate slightly in excess of the 2 per cent real limit. Accordingly, in the interest of prudent budgetary management, the Government decided on a measured and appropriate response at this point to an emerging unfavourable trend in order to avoid excessive dislocation of public services which would have been inevitable had the response been delayed.</P>
    <P>The interim measures which were announced on 8 June were as follows:&mdash; all Ministers are to identify measures to control public spending within their Departments &mdash; this will involve all Ministers reviewing their existing policies and expenditures with a view to maximising the benefits to be obtained within the Government's spending target; there will be no recruitment to posts paid for out of public funds which would have the effect of increasing the numbers of posts above that on 9 June, unless there is specific prior Government approval &mdash; all Ministers are to halt the process of recruitment for additional posts with effect from 9 June 1995, unless and until the Government decides that such recruitment may take place in particular areas.  Their primary purpose is to ensure that the Government's 2 per cent limit on real current spending next year will not be breached and that there is thus sufficient scope in next year's budget to make further progress in reducing taxes in favour of employment.</P>
    <P>The impact of these decisions will be reflected in the detailed departmental spending Estimates for 1996 which are now being drawn up.  These Estimates will be examined in detail by Ministers over the coming months and final figures for each Department and agency <Col N="1612" /> will be published in the 1996 Estimates Volume.</P>
    <P>This Government has been accused of panic and kneejerk reaction in taking action on public expenditure on foot of what was described as a &ldquo;highly critical&rdquo; OECD report on the Irish economy. Nothing could be further from the truth. The prudent action which the Government has taken has resulted from a careful and timely examination of the outlook for expenditure in 1996.  The Government commenced its examination well in advance of the publication of the recent OECD survey on the Irish economy.  It is totally misleading to suggest that the Government decision to initiate action to control the emerging expenditure trends in 1996 was taken in direct response to the OECD survey. This is simply not true.</P>
    <P>Also, I reject allegations that the OECD survey is highly critical.  The survey, in fact, is very positive.  I acknowledge that there are some criticisms but these are in general constructive, in that the concern of the OECD is to ensure that the Government's present successful policies are maintained.  In this regard, I would remind Deputies that the OECD's comments in relation to the growth in public expenditure relates to the growth in the recent past &mdash; not to the Government's plans to contain the real increase in current supply expenditure to 2 per cent per annum on average over the next two years.</P>
    <P>This Government is taking positive and determined steps to ensure that the growth in public expenditure is kept firmly under control.  We are committed to curbing the excessive growth in current Government spending which has emerged over the last five years.  We are convinced that this positive action will yield significant benefits in terms of increasing the room for manoeuvre to improve the incentives for work through the tax and social welfare system, and in terms of keeping downward pressure on borrowing and thus on interest rates and inflation.  This disciplined approach will provide the resources to promote <Col N="1613" /> additional employment, reward work and reduce taxation.</P>
    <P>Our efforts to contain the growth in current public expenditure this year and in 1996 will be helped considerably by the pay agreement under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which has strict cost parameters built in.</P>
    <P>The pay agreement which forms part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> ensures that increases in pay in both the public and private sectors are limited to around the projected rate of inflation over the period of the agreement. In doing so it ensures that pay increases will be moderate and will not reduce competitiveness.  In giving certainty of pay costs during the period it will also contribute to the environment for continued growth in the economy.</P>
    <P>The arrangements in the public service under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement are that the projected increases over the period of the agreement are broadly in line with the private sector.  The provision in the agreement to deal with outstanding claims or unfinished business in the public service limits the level of increase payable and also requires, in return, agreement on flexibility and change and improvements in efficiency and effectiveness in the provision of public services.  Furthermore, the reform of pay determination systems within the public service, evidenced by the revised conciliation and arbitration scheme agreed for the Civil Service in 1994, will serve to make these systems more sensitive to the state of the public finances in the future.</P>
    <P>The 1995 Estimates include a provision of £25 million in respect of increases in pay and pensions in the public service resulting from unfinished business.  Negotiations are continuing on outstanding claims in a number of areas throughout the public service.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the Government has commenced its review of the 1996 budget.  The preparation of the 1996 Estimates is under way.  We have already taken prudent interim steps aimed at achieving our target of a 2 per <Col N="1614" /> cent real growth in gross current spending in 1996.  I can assure the Dáil that in considering the 1996 Estimates and possible budget proposals the Government will ensure that the real and substantial progress which has been achieved to date in the public finances and in the economy is secured and enhanced even further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate in its traditional form gives us an opportunity to comment on the Estimates and general matters.  The performance of the Government in its first six months has been lacklustre and the public is indifferent to it.  It is not a Government the people desired and it has not been a good substitute for the partnership Government of Fianna Fáil and Labour. There are few signs of vigour, significant new ideas or political leadership determined to get things done and decisions made.  It is a marriage of convenience between disparate partners, with little natural cohesion and shared vision. Being in power and trying to stay there is what holds the Government together. The most that can be hoped for is a competent but uninspired stewardship of the tremendous legacy of achievement and work in hand left by the Fianna Fail-Labour Government and its Fianna Fáil-led predecessors since 1987.</P>
      <P>On important issues such as social partnership and the handling of the peace process leading to the ceasefires, the Taoiseach freely admits, to his credit, that he was wrong and, in effect, Fianna Fáil was right.  We hear no quibbles these days about the billions of pounds we negotiated in Edinburgh and Brussels, which underpin the Government's investment programme.  Agriculture is thriving as a result of the CAP reform measures as applied to Ireland, for which Ray MacSharry and Deputy Joe Walsh deserve full credit.  This Government is largely living off the success of its predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for Finance, and his officials, for making available the <Col N="1615" /> full accounts of 1994 when I was Minister for Finance in the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government.  That was an outstanding year, perhaps even better than we thought considering the figures released this week.  I thought the Minister would have been happy to claim that he was a member of a Government that achieved so much, but he did not mention that. Those achievements made matters easy for the Government this year.</P>
    <P>In 1994 economic growth stood at 7.4 per cent, the highest since 1990 and the third highest in the history of the State. According to the Government's estimates, net employment last year increased by 36,000 people while average unemployment fell by 12,000.  The increase in employment of 2.6 per cent in 1994 was the highest in the European Union where the average was a fall of 0.5 per cent.  Exports increased by 13 per cent in volume and industrial production and tourism increased by about 12 per cent.  Tourism is receiving a huge boost from the peace process this year. In 1994 there was a balance of payments surplus of more than £2 billion, or 6.6 per cent of GNP, which was exceptional. Consumer spending increased by 5.5 per cent, investment increased by 8 per cent and production in the construction industry increased by 9 per cent.  Last year I achieved the first current budget surplus in 28 years, with a debt-GDP ratio falling rapidly.  Together with Luxembourg and Germany we are the only countries to fulfil the Maastricht criteria.</P>
    <P>The ESRI described 1994 as &ldquo;a year of exceptionally rapid economic growth&rdquo;, well balanced and with no sign of serious inflationary pressures developing.  This is mainly due, as the Taoiseach acknowledged in Killarney, to the price restraint provided by the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> of March 1994 which he opposed. It is amusing, but we are glad Fine Gael who opposed programmes and collective agreements, admitted this week that it was wrong.  The Taoiseach has gone back on many statements he made in <Col N="1616" /> the past five or six years when in Opposition and this is probably his final u-turn. At least he has acknowledged, if not in this House then publicly in Killarney, that he was wrong.  The ESRI stated that with a substantial carry-over from 1994 the annual growth rate should again be high.</P>
    <P>The economy is continuing to do well and we on this side of the House are proud of the tremendous progress and solid foundations we laid during our eight years in office.  Fianna Fáil worked productively with the social partners and with those who supported or worked with us in Government at different times, after turning the national economy around in 1987.  No one is in any doubt of the tremendous impact of the Government of Charles Haughey, with Ray MacSharry as Minister for Finance, in 1987 and 1988.  We also came through the subsequent recession in the early 1990s under Deputy Albert Reynolds, when I was Minister for Finance, in better shape than most of our partners, repeating in 1994 the high performance of 1989-90.  Even as an Opposition party we will take more pride in the Irish economy doing well during this Government's short period in office, than we will take pleasure in any setbacks it may suffer and which we do not need.  We can play a useful warning role when we see a danger of things going wrong, as we have done most of this year in relation to the public finances.</P>
    <P>From 1988, my party delivered steady tax reform and tax reduction, in tandem with reducing Government borrowing to a very low level.  We are not in favour of slashing taxes at the expense of essential public services.  There was a tendency to let go the spending reins early this year without sufficient prioritising. If we want real and lasting tax reductions, which is what this country needs, then in periods of high growth we should not be running a current budget deficit.  We should even be aiming to try to eliminate borrowing altogether in the longer run.  This is what New Zealand is doing, and it is the point at which very <Col N="1617" /> substantial savings in national debt servicing would help fund real reductions in taxation.  I regret that this year the Government has moved further away from that ideal.  This Government caused in its initial months in office a substantial outflow of funds through a loss of confidence.  Our currency is still at the bottom of the ERM.  We need to create more room for budgetary manoeuvre for the years ahead for at least three reasons: given the economic cycle, we will not always enjoy high economic growth &mdash; we must keep public finances under control in anticipation of the next world recession; we have no guarantee of a combination of Structural and Cohesion funding at present levels after 1999; we have to keep open the option of joining European Monetary Union, if necessary without Britain, and this will be realistic only with an ultra-fit economy.  For those reasons the Government should continue to implement the economic policies followed since 1987.  The real test of this Government's prudence will be the next downturn in the world economy.</P>
    <P>The Government's performance has been disappointing on a number of issues.  Unemployment is likely to be on average 5,000 higher than forecast at budget time.  This is largely attributable to the fact that community employment schemes have not been maintained at last year's level, to the disappointment of local communities throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that decisiveness is lacking in regard to the third banking force as we had a good plan and a range of partners lined up.  I know some of those potential investors are very disappointed at the Government's delay.  We do not need State owned banks but more competition in the banking sector. The Government has a series of competing plans from the different ideological viewpoints of its members.  It is long past time for decisions in the national and consumer interests, leaving ideology out of it.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed there was no effort in this year's budget to move on the <Col N="1618" /> many issues identified by the Government Task Force on Small Businesses, which must be the main source of future employment.</P>
    <P>There has not been an ESB price rise in the past eight years with the result that its prices have become very competitive, 20 per cent below those in Northern Ireland.  I accept we cannot reasonably expect an indefinite price freeze, but the last thing we need is sudden, sharp price increases.  Increased competition in our semi-State bodies must not become a euphemism for a deteriorating service, higher prices and larger fees for directors and consultants. The Government should pay close attention to the French Government's attitude to EDF, the French electricity company, in its discussions with the European Commission in Brussels.</P>
    <P>I regard the report on CIE produced by Deputy Kavanagh of the Labour Party on behalf of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies as unduly negative.  We need an efficient public transport system, bus and rail, if massive road congestion is to be avoided and to reduce pollution, for tourism and regional development purposes and a social service for those who do not have their own transport.  By and large those who work in the three transport companies do a good job, but there is obviously further scope for improvement, better service to the public, better use of existing facilities and reducing the real level of subvention.  Fianna Fáil backed the investment in public transport in the National Development Plan and we expect this Government to carry it through without cutbacks.</P>
    <P>There is a huge law and order problem related mainly to drugs.  My party has always been supportive of the Garda Síochána whose record in solving murders and many other serious crimes is second to none.  I congratulate them on their drugs finds; in the past we congratulated them on their arms finds.  The Garda can be very proud of their contribution to maintaining stability in this State during the past 25 years of troubles.  There are many signs, <Col N="1619" /> however, of low morale and a lack of confidence in the Minister and the Government.</P>
    <P>The shilly-shallying over the bail laws and the deferment of the prison at Castlerea, as well as the new women's prison at Mountjoy, sends the most negative signals about this Government's real commitment to law and order.  Making all due allowance for the peace process and more efficient alternatives to custodial sentences in some cases, we need more prison space, so that our penal system remains a credible deterrent and protection to the public, and to solve the problem of overcrowding.</P>
    <P>This Government has shown little commitment to the west or the Border counties.  The cancellation of the prison at Castlerea says all that needs to be said about this Government's lack of commitment to tackling crime and its lack of commitment to the west notwithstanding the appointment, as an afterthought, of a Minister of state for the west, whose function seems to be largely decorative.  The Border counties do not have a single Minister or Minister of State and do not even enjoy the full additionality of funds earmarked for these regions by the EU.</P>
    <P>There should be a small budgetary reserve for special capital investment projects that crop up during the year that will be of lasting value.  In the mid-1980s, the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition provided funding for UCD's new engineering school and in 1991, Fianna Fáil provided funding for the Smurfit Business School in UCD from a budgetary surplus.  It is wrong that projects of this kind, of lasting benefit, should be confined to Dublin.  I note that the Minister for Finance believes he will underspend on Central Fund services and on EU budgetary contributions.  I believe there is a strong case, following precedents established by successive Governments for examining sympathetically with University College, Cork, grounds for State assistance for the acquisition of Our Lady's Hospital, while the window of <Col N="1620" /> opportunity remains open.  Cork is entitled to the same favourable treatment as Dublin.  We negotiated with University College, Cork, last year and I had talks with the college president and all the main bodies, including the Higher Education Authority.  That commitment should be honoured.</P>
    <P>The Government initiated studies on the Constitution and devolution and has a long programme of institutional reform largely drawn up by Fianna Fáil. There is no evidence, at the pace it is going, that anything concrete will happen in any of these areas prior to the next general election except that more boards, commissions and committees will be set up with the appointment of consultants and others to run them.</P>

      <P>As we go into the summer recess, Members must be concerned about the stalemate in the peace process.  I complimented the Government at the time for bringing the Framework Document to a successful conclusion.  However, since then we have had a political impasse that has now become dangerous &mdash; with disturbances on the streets.  There have been limited exploratory talks at ministerial level but the only real success in the past number of months was the Washington Investment Conference.  I commended the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and his officials who were involved in organising it.  My party played a full role in every possible fora.  Week in week out we had by far the best attendance at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and we contributed to every debate on the matter in this House.  There has been a lack of progress on the main issues and a marked slowing down of the vigorous momentum that characterised the first few weeks after the cease-fire.  I am concerned that this Government is no longer playing the central role in the peace process its predecessors did under <Col N="1621" /> the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  That is not just my observation but a view expressed by many independent commentators.  The other constitutional partners are frustrated that the political process seems to be reduced to a stand-off between the British Government and Sinn Féin.  This morning for the first time we heard from the Sinn Féin spokesperson that this Government could do more to speed up the process.  Every other party has made similar comments in recent days.</P>
      <P>There is only a limited amount that we can do in Opposition but we have done our best to keep the focus on the issues where movement is needed and to try to help maintain confidence in the peace process.</P>
      <P>I would be concerned that the British Government is not paying the same attention to the views of the Irish Government.  I need do no more than remind the House what happened this week.  The Government's role has to be more than that of a facilitator.  I criticised the Government in the past for acting only as a facilitator which is not enough if the process is to work.  The Government should have its own views of what needs to be achieved and seek the support of the British Government and other parties for their views.  The Government must set out its views clearly.  The views of the Fianna Fáil Party are set out in the Joint Declaration which was signed by both Governments in 1993, in the Framework Document which was set out at the beginning of this year and in the Anglo Irish Agreement which was signed some time ago.  These documents should form the basis of progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No other party has presented a document of major assistance since the Framework Document.  There has hardly been any discussion during this Dáil session on the Framework Document and no progress has been made on it.  I am concerned that the Government is not putting forward a clear, strong coherent viewpoint.  The feedback I am getting from America suggests there is <Col N="1622" /> confusion as to the Government's position, with one message coming from the office of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and another from the Taoiseach's office.  We have had confusing and contradictory statements from the Government on decommissioning armaments.  The Taoiseach in Washington and Moscow appeared to back the British line but at other times he has taken issue with it.  I regret that the wooing of Unionist opinion which the Taoiseach carried out in Opposition with the Unionist parties does not seem to have brought any benefit to Government as he hoped it might.  Fianna Fáil in Opposition has been able to further develop our party's relationship with the UUP and the loyalists which I am sure will help the peace process.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document is a fine document which, with the British internal document, focuses on the central issues which have to be addressed in talks.  I would have expected that after its publication there would have been some weeks or months of political debate on its contents and that talks would have followed.  Instead, we have been diverted down a track of arguments about decommissioning and who is eligible to take part in substantive talks.  Our view is &mdash; and always has been &mdash; very clear on these issues.  After ten months of the IRA and loyalist ceasefires, Sinn Féin is fully entitled to take part in talks, North and South, on the same basis as everyone else, in accordance with paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration and public undertakings given to Sinn Féin by the British Government prior to 31 August last.  The loyalists must also be directly involved and represented in the talks process on similar grounds.  With a clear understanding on how decommissioning will be carried out, the modalities would obviously be helpful to the start of talks.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the Dalton-Chilcott talks, no doubt involving other officials, which were initiated as far back as October last year by Deputy Albert Reynolds and John Major are only now being intensified in a crisis <Col N="1623" /> atmosphere, having been effectively in abeyance for some months.  This sense of urgency is not before time.  If Unionists have a difficulty sitting opposite Sinn Féin then the talks should begin with a bilateral phase.  If they have a difficulty taking part in political talks, playing their full part in consolidating the peace process and working towards a peaceful settlement then they should say so.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week I set out my views on the prisoners' issue.  The unilateral release of Private Lee Clegg means that this issue must be addressed as a matter of urgency and independently of progress on any other issue.  The Government has no more important task than to try to break the dangerous impasse which is developing in the peace process. The anniversary of the ceasefire must not come upon us with no further progress having been made.  There is a sense of frustration among communities in the North that the peace process is producing nothing and that the British Government is doing nothing and is not keeping faith with what it said before the ceasefire.</P>
    <P>There has been no movement on the prisoners' issue.  Everyone knows that any reversion to violence would be an unmitigated disaster for all concerned and must be avoided at all costs. However crucial the situation becomes, violence is an option which cannot be contemplated because of its proven evil and futility.  The battle for full recognition and rights must be fought politically and Fianna Fáil pledges that it will remain fully engaged with the people of the North in working to overcome the obstacles to progress.  We will continue to raise without fear or favour the issues of most concern in the maintenance and consolidation of peace.  The Government must adopt a firm approach and ensure that the British Government and wider international opinion fully understand the necessity of making early progress on a realistic basis.  The peace must and will endure.</P>
    <P>We want to see public expenditure <Col N="1624" /> controlled and funding spent in a proper manner.  The Minister's Department of Finance speech, with which I am well familiar, contradicted Labour and Democratic Left policies.  I look forward to the implementation of the policies referred to in his speech, which was not ideological &mdash; I could name the two officials who wrote it for him.  I hope in the interests of the country that the Minister will implement those policies.</P>

      <P>When the Government came into office seven months ago it made great promises.  I have with me its programme for Government and last night on my way back from Ballina I reread most of it.  I urge the Government to read page 1 of the programme in which it promised that there would be new openness and transparency and our national and local institutions would be reformed to ensure accountability, transparency and freedom of information. In the section dealing with Oireachtas reform the Government promised that the Oireachtas would be reformed with the aim of gearing it to the 21st century.  It went on to say that various organs of the State and holders of high office would be more answerable and accountable to the Legislature <Col N="1627" /> and that the Executive would be fully accountable to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Only this morning the Government voted down a reasonable Fianna Fáil amendment to the Government motion requiring the Taoiseach to answer questions on two days during the 96-day recess of the Dáil.  It is difficult to believe that a Government let by the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, who championed Dáil reform since his election to the House, would vote down such a reasonable amendment.  It is clear that the Government is not committed to changing the procedures of the House, is not committed to more openness and accountability, is not interested in making the Executive accountable and is not gearing the Oireachtas to meet the demands of the 21st century.</P>
      <P>The Government has said that the civil servants need a holiday.  I cannot think of a more pathetic excuse.  The amendment was voted down this morning because the Government is not interested in answering questions.  I have a file of questions which have been either transferred by the Taoiseach or ruled out of order.  There is no openness or transparency.  In a parliamentary democracy the only way an Opposition can make the Government of the day accountable and effective is by having the opportunity to ask questions and by ensuring openly, in public, that the Government answers them.  That has not happened and is not happening.  I regret this very much.  There is no reason for the Taoiseach to refuse to take oral questions in the House on 26 July and 20 September.  In voting down the Fianna Fáil amendment this morning the Taoiseach can no longer claim to be a champion of Dáil reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a very interesting article in yesterday's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> by a commentator who looks in on the proceedings of this House.  He said that this Chamber is almost moribund, which it is and the committee system is killing the House.  The committee system is <Col N="1628" /> particularly difficult for party spokespersons and smaller parties.  It is extremely difficult for the eight Deputies in my party to serve on these committees.  People will probably say I should try to get more Deputies elected. Deputies are working extraordinarily hard and at the very least the Taoiseach should answer questions on the two days the Dáil pretends to meet.  The Government is trying to create a mirage that the Dáil is working harder. Deputies, particularly those from the Opposition parties, are working harder but the Government is going into recess for 96 days.  This is no different from what happened before and there is little point in the Taoiseach and the Government pretending that the Dáil will sit in July and September.  From the point of view of accountability, that is not the case.</P>
    <P>Last May the Government committed its greatest <i>faux pas.</i>  It could be seen from the way he dealt with questions on the Fr. Smyth case that the Taoiseach's glass is no longer transparent.  When an effort to transfer the question was unsuccessful on 23 May in this House, the Taoiseach refused to give vital information on that matter.  He refused to tell the House that the Attorney General, whom he had appointed, had a conflict of interest in his dealings with the senior legal assistant.  This House and the committee that investigated that matter were entitled to have that information. On 24 May, when questioned on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; the Taoiseach told the nation he did not give the information because he was not asked the question.  Yet, he came to the House later that morning and said he did not give the information because he could not breach confidentiality; the client was entitled to confidentiality.  Who was protecting the public interest in that whole affair?</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that this Government came to office on the back of the Fr. Smyth controversy.  Promises were made to the victims and to the public at large.  As soon as the Government got into office the file was locked <Col N="1629" /> away and that was the end of the matter until the questions were tabled.  That is not good enough.  The matter was not handled well and there was no accountability.</P>
    <P>I worry about the Government's attitude to parliamentary questions and, indeed to this House.  It is not a reforming Government, but a conservative Government that wants to give as little information as possible.  It is composed of three parties that have not much in common except their desire to be in office.  One has only to look at its confused attitude to the Estimates.</P>
    <P>This morning the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, told us that public spending would be maintained at 6 per cent.  We know that is not accurate.  Public spending on a year on year basis this year is rising by 10 per cent.  At no stage in his speech did the Minister acknowledge that, never mind seek to deal with it.  Only six weeks ago the Minister for Finance sought to put a brake on public spending and announced there would have to be cuts totalling £77 million this year.  We are still not clear about where the cuts will be made because the Government has not agreed.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Government will stick to its target of 2 per cent growth in public spending in real terms for 1996, because the Labour Party more than Democratic Left love to spend money. We have only to look at the attitude it has adopted to third level education where the principles of fairness and equity and giving children from a disadvantaged background the opportunity to have a decent standard of education, has been cast aside in the interests of the Labour Party maintaining the core vote it got in the 1992 general election. When we get nearer to a general election next year, that party will not have the courage to control public spending and Democratic Left will also be paralysed. I look forward to being proved wrong because the excessive public expenditure here has destroyed our capacity to compete and to deal effectively with tax reform and competition.</P>
    <P>Since 1990, public spending has risen <Col N="1630" /> by about 42 per cent, when inflation is 17 per cent.  This year public spending is rising at the rate of 10 per cent, three times the rate of inflation.  During the next three years, this economy will grow by 5 per cent or 6 per cent.  I have some reservations about the growth figures. Whatever is the accurate figure, it will yield the Government at least £1 billion in additional revenue over the next three to four years.  We can do various things with that £1 billion.  We can spend it on more projects or we can use it as a stimulant for the economy that will encourage enterprise, reward effort and give those at work a real incentive to go to work and work harder.</P>
    <P>A single person who takes home £172 per week pays the Government £5,000 per year in tax and PRSI: A single worker pays 57 per cent of his marginal earnings in tax and PRSI to the Government. A married man with four children living in local authority housing with a dependent spouse has to earn in excess of £15,000 per annum to be as well off working as unemployed.  One does not need me to tell you how crazy is that scenario.  The only way we can deal with it is by having a sensible and radical approach to tax reform.</P>
    <P>I am a member of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses which has met during the past two months or so.  One message that comes across loud and clear is that those involved in enterprise and development want less tax, less bureaucracy and less red tape.  They want the State to get off their backs and allow them to do the job they are more than capable of doing.  That £1 billion could be ploughed into tax reform.  We could reduce income tax to 20 per cent and 40 per cent, abolish employees' PRSI or we could use it to abolish employers' PRSI which is just over £1 billion per annum.  We could do a combination of any of those things to help employment reward effort and encourage enterprising people.</P>
    <P>Another area in which the Government is not making a determined effort, despite the commitment and courage of the Minister for Transport, Energy and <Col N="1631" /> Communications, is competition.  Competition, as IBEC said recently on the renewal of the European Union treaties, should become a core principle like European Monetary Union and other aspects of the treaty dealing with social justice, social equality and so on.  Competition should become a core principle of EU policy because Europe is losing out to the Asian Pacific countries, to America and to Japan.  Europe in the global economy is not as competitive as the other trading blocs.</P>
    <P>We are a small open economy and need to export about 70 per cent of our manufacturing and traded services products to maintain our existing jobs base. We have a small internal market and even if we take the island as a whole it is still a very small market.  The only way to survive and grow is to sell goods and services at competitive prices. Obviously quality has a huge role to play but so too has price.</P>
    <P>We need to examine the role of the State and examine whether the State needs to be exclusively involved in the range of activities in which it is currently engaged.  The State runs our ports and airports, is involved in running hotels, and, even, a restaurant and until recently was running a bar in Temple Street in Dublin.  There is a host of activities in which the State's involvement no longer makes sense.  While the capacity of the market to take up any privatisation floats that might be made is not enormous, we need to have a phased programme of disengaging the State from some of these activities.  I am not suggesting we replace a State monopoly with a private monopoly because what would not be the answer.  We need competition at every level to ensure the economy develops, reaches its capacity and provides the jobs we need to provide opportunities for our people.</P>
    <P>Let us take the area of transport.  An island nation such as ours has to be accessible.  Since Ryanair became involved in air transport, ten years ago, traffic on the London-Dublin route has grown by nearly 300 per cent, from <Col N="1632" /> 983,000 to 2.7 million passengers per year.  Fares in 1985, before Ryanair, were on average £208, unless one booked 28 days in advance.  Despite an inflation rate of 29 per cent in the intervening years, air fares to London have come down in real terms by 80 per cent.  That has happened because of competition.  It has been good for tourism, business and the economy.  Ryanair is a growing company.  Its employment this year has increased by 100.  With 11 aircraft it is transporting 2.3 million passengers in and out of this country.</P>
    <P>Earlier today I suggested we need a second airport in the capital city.  Passenger numbers into Dublin airport are projected to grow to 14 million, double the present level, within the next seven to ten years.  Dublin airport does not have the capacity to deal with that.  It would be bad for the environment there.  It would be over-congested.  More importantly, we need competition.</P>
    <P>The project being promoted by Ryanair to develop a facility at Baldonnel, although it is not being enthusiastically supported by many of my constituents because of the noise and traffic implications, is needed in the interests of the city and the country as a whole.  It would make the single greatest contribution to reducing the cost of access fares which is so essential for trade and tourism.  The company is seeking a preliminary decision on its submission by November. I hope this will be granted.</P>
    <P>An all-party approach to the peace process in Northern Ireland has been adopted in this House for some considerable time.  It is important that it be maintained.  A similar approach has been adopted at Westminster.  I have been saying for the past couple of weeks that there is stalemate.  I have my own views on how the problem can be resolved.  We need to marry the issue of decommissioning with the issue of prisoners' release; it is not a question of either or.</P>
    <P>The main stumbling block to the development of the peace process is the political leaders in Northern Ireland, in <Col N="1633" /> particular the leaders of mainstream Unionism.  I very much regret that Unionist politicians have been dragging their feet and constantly reject everything on offer.  For years Unionists wanted a commitment from Nationalists that they did not seek Irish unity by coercion, that they were prepared to accept this would only come about if a majority in Northern Ireland wished it to happen.  All of Nationalist Ireland, with the exception of Sinn Féin, has accepted that there will be no change in the status of Northern Ireland unless a majority wish it to happen.  Unionists should see this as a victory and as something positive.  They will not be coerced against their will into something they do not want.  Instead of sitting on the sidelines they should get involved in the process and represent the people they are supposed to represent.</P>
    <P>I know from my contacts in Northern Ireland and the many people I have met from the Unionist tradition that they feel they have been let down by the manner in which their representatives have sought to represent them since the peace process was initiated ten months ago.  I appeal, as I did ten days ago, to the leaders of the Unionist people, in particular the Official Unionist Party, to stop saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; all the time, to get involved in the process and to realise that, because of the geography and their numbers, nothing can happen unless they participate.  Politicians can never achieve anything for the people they represent unless they participate and are prepared to negotiate.</P>
    <P>Before he took office the Taoiseach was subjected to criticism on the question of Northern Ireland when he was seen as a big threat to the development of the peace process but he has consolidated and developed it.  Many difficulties will be encountered along the route in turning Northern Ireland around and transforming it into a real political society.  This will take a considerable time.  The violence, the bitterness, the ignorance and everything which has flowed from it have left their mark.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1634" /> I never believed we could turn the peace process initiated ten months ago into an all-inclusive settlement within a short space of time.  It will be some considerable time before people begin to trust each other.  It is important that the momentum be maintained.  After the Cannes summit I was heartened when the two Governments announced that they had adopted a clear, single strategy to deal with the issue.  A difference in approach between them would only play into the hands of those who do not wish to see the process succeed.</P>
    <P>While the two Governments have a major role to play in stimulating and encouraging the participants to get involved, it is the politicians in Northern Ireland who will either make or break the process.  Unless John Hume, Gerry Adams, James Molyneaux, Dr. John Alderdice and others like them sit down at the table, reach agreement and recommend it to their supporters we will not see a normal society in Northern Ireland.  I appeal to each of them to play their part and be generous.</P>
    <P>On the issue of decommissioning, I appeal to Sinn Féin not to see it as a request from the British Government but to do it for the Irish people.  The weapons of war &mdash; the semtex and other weapons in the hands of the paramilitaries &mdash; were used to kill fellow Irish people.  For the sake of the Irish people a gesture should be made.  It is unreasonable to expect prisoners to be released if the paramilitaries still have those weapons.  I also appeal to Sinn Féin to use its influence to ensure we do not see any more street riots because street rioting and punishment beatings are not compatible with democratic politics.</P>
    <P>The Government promised to take action on many issues during this parliamentary term.  I am disappointed that it has not delivered.  We have yet to see the legislation dealing with the issues of freedom of information and compellability of witnesses.  Neither have we seen the Government's proposals on divorce. As we reach the end of this session the <Col N="1635" /> Government can be assured that the honeymoon is over and that there will be vigorous opposition next term.</P>
    <P>Let me say to the Minister of State who referred to the Leader of the Opposition that Deputy Ahern is the Leader of the largest party in Opposition but there is no leader of the Opposition as I used to remind the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, when he was on this side of the House seven months ago.  There are two parties in Opposition under the rules of this House.  The Government can be assured that it will be vigorously pursued on its programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i>  We will hound it at every opportunity until it delivers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Harney said there was a need for openness in Government and to provide answers to questions in this House.  There has been <Col N="1637" /> a dramatic change in the manner in which questions are answered.  I recall countless occasions in Opposition when questions I tabled were repeatedly transferred or ruled out of order.  On many occasions I received answers to questions I did not table and long replies of 20 minutes.  Having regard to my Opposition experience during the past seven to eight years, Deputies have little grounds to take issue with the manner in which questions are dealt with now.</P>
      <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate.</P>

As a Government, we are determined that our sound economic policies will be maintained and those who depend on social welfare will also share in the fruits of our success.</P>
      <P>The amount shown for my Department in the Revised Estimates of Expenditure for 1995 does not do justice to the overall level of social welfare spending in Ireland today.  Total social welfare spending this year is estimated at around £4 billion, exclusive of the £200 million being provided to cover the cost of equal treatment payments.  Of that £4 billion, the Exchequer will contribute almost £2.3 billion and the balance will be met mainly by employers, employees and the self-employed by way of PRSI contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We now spend almost £11 million every day of the year on social welfare, or £77 million each week.  In doing so, we provide a weekly payment to around 800,000 persons which, in turn, benefits almost 1.5 million persons when adult and child dependants are taken into <Col N="1638" /> account.  This includes: £2.9 million a day in payments to elderly and retired people; £2.9 million a day in payments to unemployed people; £1.2 million a day to the sick and disabled and £3.4 million a day on family income support including widows, widowers, lone parents, carers, child benefit and families at work on low pay and other miscellaneous allowances.</P>
    <P>The scale of social welfare spending which I have described gives a useful opportunity to reflect a little on the scale and activities of the Department of Social Welfare today.</P>
    <P>When it was established in 1947 &mdash; and I mention this is the context of its forthcoming 50th anniversary &mdash; the main task of the Department of Social Welfare was to co-ordinate under one agency the fairly rudimentary social insurance and assistance schemes then in operation.  The Department developed in piecemeal fashion in the 1950s and 1960s when its impetus stemmed from the welfare state policies of developed and developing countries. Major development occurred in the 1970s with the introduction of many new schemes and services which reflected the changing nature of Irish society.</P>
    <P>The 1980s saw further change which marked a significant departure from a role based almost exclusively on income maintenance.  This no doubt was an effort to meet the growing complexity and diversity of Irish society with a particular emphasis on equal treatment and equality of opportunity for all its citizens.</P>
    <P>Special schemes for the unemployed, second-chance education and community sector supports were all initiatives outside the mainstream social welfare activities which focused on the holistic development of citizens rather than just income maintenance in a time of need.</P>
    <P>Today, the Department is the biggest spender of all Departments and one of the largest employers in the country. Total spending this year will be £4.2 billion, over £11 million each day.  That <Col N="1639" /> accounts for 35 per cent of all Government spending and around 13 per cent of GNP.  Total staff in the Department is now around 4,400.  A total of around 50 million payments are issued each year.  The total number of beneficiaries is now over 1.5 million, comprising 800,000 recipients and their 700,000 dependants.</P>
    <P>This year the Government has provided an additional £212 million in a full year for social welfare improvements announced in the budget.  This is the largest single allocation of resources for budget improvements in the history of the State.  Furthermore, it is 35 per cent higher than last year's allocation.</P>
    <P>That allocation has enabled: the payment of increases in weekly rates of payment, six weeks earlier than normal; a 35 per cent increase in child benefit &mdash; the biggest ever; significant PRSI reliefs for both employees and employers, which will help to stimulate business, create more jobs and ensure the low paid have more take-home pay; the introduction of a new adoptive benefit scheme and the extension of the carer's allowance to those on occupational pensions.</P>
    <P>In addition, we have provided an extra £3 million to bring financial support for voluntary and community activity this year up to £10 million; provided an extra £1 million for improvements to the students summer jobs scheme which is proving to be a tremendous success this year; made further improvements to the back-to-work allowance; taken over responsibility for the National Social Service Board from the Department of Health and allocated an additional £250,000 to develop integrated citizens' information systems; provided £200 million this year to resolve the long-standing issue of equal treatment arrears and introduced legislation providing for changes to the social welfare code so as to ensure that no person will be disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements as a result of his or her spouse's <Col N="1640" /> legal status being changed from married, separated or deserted to divorced.</P>
    <P>The 2.5 per cent general increase of those on social welfare is in line generally with current inflation levels.  It is also in line with the official forecasts for inflation made by the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  Furthermore, the increase is consistent with the 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent increase which most workers are getting this year under the pay agreement of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>For families with children, the total increase in family income is greater than 2.5 per cent because of the unprecedented £7 per child per month increase in child benefit.  In the case of most other families and individuals, the increase is greater than 2.5 per cent when account is taken of tax and PRSI improvements, changes in some of the free schemes and allowances for groups such as carers and pensioners and the substantial increase payable in the minimum rate of unemployment assistance payable to certain young people.  Many of these apparently minor improvements were missed by budget commentators who focused extensively on the general increase rather than particular improvements targeted at those in greatest need.</P>
    <P>Another important point that appears to have been missed by virtually all commentators is that by bringing forward the 2.5 per cent increase to the middle of June rather than the end of July, six weeks earlier, social welfare recipients will get more money this year than they would have got if a 3 per cent increase had been paid in July.  It is the intention of this Government to give the benefit of the increases at an even earlier stage next year so that social welfare recipients will be on a par with taxpayers as far as budget changes are concerned.</P>
    <P>Child benefit is one of the best ways of targeting poverty in Ireland because those most at risk tend to be members of large families.  In the vast majority of cases child benefit is paid to women and, in many cases, it is the woman's <Col N="1641" /> only independent source of income. Recent studies have shown that women tend to spend more of their income on children and on general household expenses than men.  Therefore, directing payments to women is more likely to benefit children.  We are talking about children in mainly low and middle income families.  After all, only 7 per cent of child benefit goes to families with incomes in excess of £25,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>The substantial child benefit increase also serves to facilitate employment. Since child benefit is a universal payment which is not taxed and not withdrawn if employment is taken up, it does not act as a poverty or unemployment trap or a disincentive to work. This is a further important rationale for chanelling as much support as possible to families through that payment.  It is one of the reasons the Government intends to proceed with the development of the child benefit supplement next year.</P>
    <P>This new child benefit supplement is the foundation stone for meeting the Government's commitment to create a form of basic income for children.  It will involve a major restructuring of our present system of child income support. The child benefit supplement will be payable in addition to child benefit to all families whose income is below a certain level irrespective of whether that income stems from social welfare, employment or a combination of both. It will incorporate the child dependant allowances currently paid in respect of children to social welfare recipients and the family income supplement currently paid to people on low income from employment.</P>
    <P>The Government has come under strong attack from the Opposition benches over the general increases of 2.5 per cent in weekly payments provided for in the budget.  Much of that comment was ill-informed and mischievous and was pursued for reasons of political expediency.  It lost sight of the fact that an attempt is being made to capitalise on the most vulnerable group in our <Col N="1642" /> society for political purposes.  Opposition parties should be careful not to proceed down that road.  They appear to call for increased payments but also for increased cuts.  It is difficult to understand how the Opposition envisages that formula will work, but I am sure they will elucidate further on that in time. The ongoing campaign to vilify the Government over the general increase of 2.5 per cent in weekly social welfare payments will not succeed.</P>
    <P>It is time to put that criticism to rest by considering a number of concrete examples which show the impact of budget improvements as a whole.</P>
    <P>A husband and wife with five children on long term unemployment assistance will be already receiving a new weekly payment of £200.62, including the child benefit increase.  This weekly increase of £10.48 represents a 5.5 per cent increase which is more than double the general increase of 2.5 per cent.  If one of their children is 21 years of age and still in full time education, the family could benefit from a further £13.20 a week by way of the continuation of the child dependant allowance up to age 22.  Similarly, if one of the children is 18 years of age, child benefit of either £27 of £32 a month will be payable for them from September until they reach 19 years of age.</P>
    <P>A couple with three children on either disability benefit or unemployment benefit are now getting an extra £7.25 a week when account is taken of the child benefit increase.  That is a 4.8 per cent increase on their current payment. In addition, as set out in the example given, this family could also benefit from the continuation of child dependant allowances up to age 22 and additional child benefit up to age 19.</P>
    <P>From next September families in receipt of child benefit will get one of the biggest increases ever in the history of the State.  The monthly payment for each child is being increased by £7, giving a new monthly rate for the first two children of £27 each, an increase of 35 per cent.  The new monthly rate for the third and subsequent children will be <Col N="1643" /> £32 each which is an increase of 28 per cent.</P>
    <P>There are significant improvements for those beneficiaries without children also.  For example, the minimum payment for a young person on unemployment assistance whose only means are assessed on the basis of parental income, has been increased from £10 to £25, an increase of 150 per cent.</P>
    <P>A pensioner getting a contributory old age or retirement pension with a spouse under 66 years of age and additional income of £8 a week is now getting an 8.3 per cent increase to bring their new weekly payment to £125.90. This increase includes the fuel allowance of £5 a week.  They will also get the benefit of a free colour television licence.</P>
    <P>There are significant improvements also in the carer's allowance which is being extended to those caring for nonsocial welfare pensioners aged 66 or over.  This will bring 1,000 new carers into the scheme, at a cost of £3 million in a full year.  The means test for the allowance is also being improved.  The earnings disregard of £100 a week in respect of working spouses is being increased to £150 a week, an increase of 50 per cent.  The new earnings disregard will apply not only to earnings from work but to all types of income such as pensions.</P>
    <P>The back to school clothing and footwear allowance is being increased by 14 per cent for each primary school child and 10 per cent for each secondary school child from next summer. Students participating in the students' summer jobs scheme this year will receive a total payment of £600 this year compared to £540 last year, an increase of 11 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is an increase of £3 million &mdash; which represents a 43 per cent increase in the amount to be provided this year for voluntary and community activity and to help disadvantaged communities improve the quality of their lives.  An increase of 25 per cent is being provided <Col N="1644" /> this year in the funding provided to the Combat Poverty Agency.</P>
    <P>In the implementation of equal treatment payments, a major achievement this year to date has been the initiative taken by this Government to resolve the long standing injustice concerning the non-payment of arrears due to 70,000 women under the 1979 Equal Treatment Directive.</P>
    <P>The payment of the arrears due will consist of increases for adult and child dependants and unemployment assistance. They will also receive the transitional payments as provided for in the recent High Court decision.  In addition, compensation will be payable based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index from the date of entitlement in December 1984 to the date on which the payments are made.  All of the married women involved will receive payments on account by next month.</P>
    <P>The total cost of these arrangements are estimated at some £260 million of which up to £200 million will be paid by the end of this year.  The remaining payments, estimated at £60 million, will be paid from January 1996 onwards over as short a period as possible.</P>
    <P>I regard the work of the expert group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems for which I have responsibility as Minister of State as very important.  I readily accept the complexity of this subject and I value very much the work already done by the group in this area.  There is a commitment in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, to publish the working group's report this year and I understand the group hopes to report in good time to meet that commitment.  I look forward very much to its report.</P>
    <P>The programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, contains an important commitment to the development of community information.  Under the programme we will overhaul the facilities available for community information by building on the network already in place in both the voluntary and statutory sectors.  This process will be undertaken in consultation with the National Social Service <Col N="1645" /> Board and the Director of Consumer Affairs.</P>
    <P>My Department has a close working relationship with the National Social Service Board, mainly through contact at local level in the dissemination of social welfare information.  We have a highly developed information service which operates through 59 information officers attached to social welfare local offices around the country.  The National Social Service Board operates through 83 citizens information centres. In addition, some 50 per cent of all inquiries to citizens information centres relate to social welfare matters.</P>
    <P>The Government has already decided that the commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> would be best served by responsibility for the National Social Service Board being transferred from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare.  That process has been completed since 1 June 1995.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the change of departmental responsibility will not affect the statutory role of the National Social Service Board which will continue to carry out its functions in accordance with its parent legislation.  The board will operate at arm's length from my Department and will be able to develop its services through the provision of additional resources.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional funds is central to our plans for the proper development of community information. In the budget earlier this year, a sum of £250,000 was provided to develop computer-based integrated social services information and to improve the value and accessibility of that information.  The focus of this initiative will be the computerisation of the system of information files administered by the National Social Service Board which is available to all citizens information centres and a wide range of non-governmental information providers. The objective is to ensure a more co-ordinated approach to the needs of the community while at the same time <Col N="1646" /> making the best use of the benefits of modern information technology.</P>
    <P>The objectives of a good and effective information-giving service must be simplicity, accessibility and impartiality. Every citizen has a right to that type of service whether from a statutory agency or otherwise.  We are committed to that level of service in our programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, and have taken the first steps with the National Social Service Board coming under the aegis of my Department.</P>
    <P>Ireland's social welfare system is among the most modern and progressive in the world today.  It has a wide range of income maintenance and support mechanisms to cover a variety of circumstances.  Few will disagree that the system operates well for the benefit of our citizens.  However, the development of a social welfare system must always involve an ongoing review and evaluation of its effectiveness in meeting the challenges of our diverse society, particularly where financial constraints dictate that the limited resources must be targeted towards areas of greatest need.</P>
    <P>Social welfare expenditure will be significantly increased this year and we have taken a fair and balanced approach to the distribution of these funds for 1995.  The progress we have made so far this year is further evidence of our concern for those most in need.</P>
    <P>I sincerely thank the staff of the Department for their continuing good work in the delivery of social welfare services.  We have about 4,400 people working all over the country, many of whom are front line staff dealing directly with our customers.  They have shown great flexibility in the light of the ever-changing nature of our schemes and services.  I look forward to their continued support and commitment in the future.</P>

      <P>With respect to the two Ministers of State in the House, the Government is remiss in not ensuring that a Cabinet Member is present for such an important debate.  On the last <Col N="1647" /> occasion Fine Gael was in Government the Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, did not come into the House for a similar debate.  He later apologised and stated it would not happen again but, unfortunately, yet again a Fine Gael Taoiseach is absent for an important debate.  I hope he apologises for demonstrating such scorn to the House.  As we represent the public, this is an insult not only to Members but to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a discussion on the Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and other Members of the Cabinet apologise for their absence.</P>
      <P>The Government is held together by the glue of hyprocrisy.  The events surrounding the Office of the Attorney General in May and, before that, the handling of the matter involving the former Minister for Defence and the Marine, surprised even the most cynical of the electorate.  The rabbits retreated to their burrows in the face of events which would have brought them scampering to the plinth outside this House a few months earlier to talk to the television cameras.</P>
      <P>There now appears to be a dual code of ethics in politics, one for the Government parties and another for Fianna Fáil, which led the <i>Irish Independent</i>&mdash; a paper we all agree does not generally demonstrate enthusiastic support for my party &mdash; to comment in an editorial on 27 May regarding the Attorney General affair:</P>
      <P>Two of the most disturbing aspects of this fiasco have been indulgence in hair-splitting and what amounts to double standards.  Fianna Fáil are presumed guilty until proved innocent, Fine Gael innocent until proved guilty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Members of the House remember only too well the Taoiseach in November last, in a fit of moral indignation, accusing the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, of engaging in what he, <Col N="1648" /> Deputy Bruton, engaged six months later.  Obviously the Fine Gael Leader has brought into Government a set of moral goalposts he moves with the help of the Labour Party whenever circumstances require.  It used be said that Labour wrestled with its conscience and always won; those were the days when the Labour Party at least had a conscience. Of course, the Taoiseach and his party do not care any longer; safely ensconced in Government Buildings, Fine Gael Ministers have abdicated all responsibility for our economy.  They sit back watching their new left wing colleagues go mad with taxpayers' money, spending all around them, with little regard for the consequences.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil handed over a sound economy to the Government as our public finances were well managed and the current budget surplus last year was the first in almost three decades.  Our growth rate in 1994, of 7.4 per cent, was the second highest in 26 years, the average inflation rate was maintained at 2.4 per cent and interest rates at the very low level of 6.25 per cent while employment grew by approximately 35,000. Much of the credit for those policies which achieved such good results rests with my party Leader, then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>
    <P>Our performance this year will not be as good, our growth rate will be lower although our economy will benefit from the favourable carry-over effects of last year.  Inflation is forecast to reach 3.6 per cent, interest rates have been increased twice, with further increases predicted, unemployment will be higher than expected and our public finances grossly mismanaged.</P>
    <P>On Tuesday last the half yearly Exchequer returns were published by the Government, they appear good but, because of promises already made, there is no doubt that expenditure will increase sharply over the remainder of the year.  Last month the Minister for Finance spoke at considerable length about his planned corrective measures, <Col N="1649" /> yet no action was taken and the situation has been allowed to drift dangerously. Successive Cabinet meetings failing to agree the package of cuts he proposed, required to prevent State spending getting completely out of hand, is further evidence of the lack of leadership required to get things done. By now, surely the Government should be well aware that overspending in good times brings only severe pain when the economic cycle changes.  Of course, only tight control on spending can result in requisite tax reductions.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister for Finance succeeds in having his package of cuts approved in full, he will be hard-pressed to meet his aim of a 2 per cent rise in public spending in 1996.  Already he has a bill of £125 million on the carry-over costs of this year's social welfare increases, in addition to which public sector pay will rise by another &mdash; approximately &mdash; £175 million, as well as hepatitis C reimbursement funds amounting to £70 million, while unemployment is not falling as fast as we would like.  Interest rates are also rising, thus adding to the cost of servicing the national debt, leading to a weakening in consumer confidence.  In such circumstances it will be almost impossible for the Government to meet its target of a 2 per cent rise in public spending in 1996. Unless drastic measures are taken now to curb such spending, the only action that will also reassure the financial markets. Foreign investors gave their verdict on the Government's fiscal policies earlier this year when there were capital outflows of an estimated £1.6 billion. The simple fact is that the markets do not trust Governments with a left bias and, correctly, fear the worst when it comes to public spending.  Therefore, the Minister for Finance and his Cabinet colleagues must persuade foreign investors and the markets that they are prepared to adopt the successful policies of my party.  They should remember that my party handed them a sound economy which they should restore to its former healthy state.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1650" /> Earlier in this debate there were references not only by my party leader but by others heckling from the Government benches to the handling of the peace process.  All Members should act responsibly and not allow the type of approach we witnessed this morning by some Ministers of State &mdash; who made personal attacks on the Opposition and lowered the tone of this debate.  It should be remembered that the Opposition in any democracy has an obligation to its electorate to ensure that the Government is kept on the right track.  Therefore, when the peace process encounters difficulty it is the obligation of parties in Opposition to point out that fact and to remind the Government of its responsibilities in that respect.</P>
    <P>Surely the Government does not have to be reminded of the seriousness of this overall matter.  We are all aware of the sensitive, precarious state into which the peace process could fall if talks do not go ahead soon.  To keep the peace process on track, we need to ensure movement on those talks, to ensure, in turn, that everybody is given an opportunity to sit around the table to discuss a genuine resolution which will bring about lasting peace on this island.  In addition, we should all be aware that the release of Private Lee Clegg has caused enormous hurt and frustration among the Nationalist and Loyalist communities alike.  Prisoners, Nationalists and Loyalists, want to see movement on their case straightaway but it is my firm belief there will be no such move unless the Government takes its courage in its hands and submits firm proposals to its British counterpart; the certainty that such talks will take place &mdash; and their results &mdash; is dependent on our Government.</P>
    <P>It is disingenuous of the Government to endeavour to cover up for its mismanagement and embarrassment by engaging in the type of heckling we heard by its Members, saying that we are attempting to make a political football of the peace process.  Let it be remembered that there would not have <Col N="1651" /> been a peace process if it had not been for the leadership of Fianna Fáil; that surely means that we, above all, wish to see that process continue and brought to successful fruition.</P>
    <P>I might now refer to my area of responsibility as spokesperson for my party on Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. It appears that the Minister, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, has become the Minister for boards rather than for bards, having appointed many people to various State or semi-State agencies, known only for their political affiliation with them rather than for any particular expertise and/or knowledge.  Could the House imagine the hullabaloo if a Fianna Fáil Government had appointed the RTE Authority announced last month, with a new Chairman who had spent the preceding few months helping the Minister, contributing to the ideological diatribe contained in the so-called Green Paper on Broadcasting? Indeed, what would the newspaper columnists and the parties now in Government have said if a Fianna Fáil Minister had appointed, say, former Taoisigh, Jack Lynch, Charles J. Haughey or Albert Reynolds a member of the RTE Authority and, for good measure, had thrown in a failed MEP candidate?  In his Green Paper on Broadcasting the Minister proposes the new super authority which will supervise RTE and the Independent Radio and Television Commission without giving cogent reasons.  Therefore, one must assume he had some political purpose in doing so.  Could that reason be to influence broadcasting even further through the appointment of certain individuals to this new board?</P>
    <P>The legislative record of the Minister, Deputy Higgins, is appalling.  Three items of legislation are promised under the programme for Government but not one of those has been brought before the House.  The only Bill dealt with by the Minister of State this year was the Heritage Council Bill, initiated by the last Government.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" /> How will the mini budget of the Minister for Finance impact on the Minister's Department, given that the arts plan is already £3 million short for the year?  How can this be implemented? Does he have proposals to deal with it or can we expect a new diluted arts plan?  Some time ago we were told by the Minister, Deputy Higgins, that he planned to have detailed discussions with the Minister for Finance about the long term financing of the arts.  Did those discussions take place and, if so, what was the response given to the Minister by his Labour colleague in Finance? It is interesting that we have not heard a word from the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht about this matter since he made his original statement.</P>
    <P>I could raise many issues in this debate but I do not wish to take up the time of the House as my colleague, Deputy McCreevy, wishes to contribute also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make some brief comments on the Estimates for 1995.  The publication of the Estimates in January is the first of a series of events.  Following their publication we have the budget, some adjustments are made to the Estimates and finally the revised Book of Estimates is published in May or June.  On occasion, the Government is required to introduce supplementary Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In publishing Estimates for any year, a Government should have regard to what it realistically expects to spend in that particular year.  I made the point in January that the Estimates did not take account of a number of areas of expenditure of which the Government was aware.  I understood the political reasons for publishing a Book of Estimates at that stage &mdash; it was said the Estimates would be less than 4 per cent of the outturn for the previous year &mdash; but it is unwise to publish Estimates which have to be changed some months later.  I am sure previous Governments used that technique but it does not fool anybody.  It may be intended to fool the <Col N="1653" /> public or perhaps Members of this House, but it will not fool the men and women working in the financial services sector who know what is going on.</P>
    <P>I recently advised the Minister for Finance that there is little point in calling journalists in the middle of the night in the hope of headlines to the effect that spending is under control and the big boom is on the way if they do not do anything about it.  The people who know the real figures and who are involved in the decision-making know that is not the case.  One may spend a lot of time putting a political spin on a story but the financial markets, politicians and the public have become so sophisticated that such a practice is simply a waste of time.</P>
    <P>The mid-term Exchequer returns were published recently and, at first glance, appear to be fine.  They contain, however, some worrying features.  The Government decided not to include a provision for Christmas bonuses in the original Estimates for 1995.  That is not unusual.  Governments do not make provision for Christmas bonuses at the beginning of a year although they know they must be paid.  Given that the figure for total social welfare expenditure was based on a projected annual live register figure which turned out to be much lower &mdash; the Minister for Finance referred to this in his budget speech &mdash; there will not be sufficient consequential savings in the Department of Social Welfare to allow for the payment of Christmas bonuses.  It is hoped that the money received from PRSI will overshoot the projected figure and that that money will be used to make up the shortfall arising from the underestimation of the live register figure.  The Department of Social Welfare will have to bring forward a supplementary Estimate to make up for one or the other.</P>
    <P>Another worrying feature of the mid-term Exchequer returns is the sluggishness in corporation tax receipts. Various reasons have been put forward for this but I believe that figure will undershoot the projection for 1995. Another feature which concerns me <Col N="1654" /> relates to EU Exchequer receipts.  Perhaps there is a reasonable explanation. I am not saying the Minister for Finance did this deliberately or was advised to do so in the Department of Finance but, for some reason, a figure in excess of £100 million, due to be received from the EU by 31 December 1994, was not received until 1995.  If it had been received in 1994, there would have been a larger current budget surplus.  Perhaps the receipts were delayed in order to make the figures look better for 1995.  I received this information from the Minister by way of parliamentary question in January or February last.  It is amazing, therefore, that the EU receipts seem to be running somewhat behind target given that £130 million, attributable to receipts for 1994, must have been received in 1995.  Perhaps there is some other explanation for this but it is an area of the Exchequer returns which baffles me somewhat.</P>
    <P>For many years I have spoken about the dangers of running current budget deficits.  The main mistake the Government made in its economic policy to date was its lack of a plan for a current budget deficit in 1995.  Given that the economic predictions were favourable and that it took 27 years to achieve a balanced current budget, any sensible Administration, having broken that particular threshold, would be unwise to go down that road again.  I have referred to this many times both inside and outside this House.  When the economy is booming it is foolish for a Government not to make provision for when times are not so good.  This Government will have severe difficulty in meeting its expenditure targets in 1996.</P>
    <P>There has been much confusion in the recent past about official Government statistics, a problem that has plagued successive Governments.  In the past few weeks, the Central Statistics Office has revised its growth figures for the past few years.  I suggest to the Minister for Finance, and to the Taoiseach's Department with responsibility for the CSO, that there might be a case for having two sets of growth figures, one <Col N="1655" /> reflecting the real economy and another which would include the multinationals.</P>
    <P>Recently there were further revisions to the figures for the past few years.  I am not saying anything incorrect is being done.  It is probable that international practice is followed.  However, it has been pointed out by an eminent academic in this city, who has been proved correct, that there is something fundamentally wrong with the national income and growth figures when the CSO has to revise the growth figures relating to years for which they have already given figures.  There cannot be great reliance on those figures.  My experience is that such problems arise because of the treatment of the multinationals.</P>
    <P>Regarding the peace process, if politicians and Government Ministers in the last Administration had taken the line that we could make no progress if people did not take the big jump, nothing would have happened.  I hope this Administration will not allow the phrase &ldquo;the decommissioning of arms&rdquo; to become the new mantra which will stop progress.  I wish the Government success in that area.</P>

      <P>Despite the relatively unfavourable international environment, the Irish economy has recently performed well and this Government will ensure that this trend continues.  For example, real GDP growth in Ireland has been the highest in the European Union in recent years and the economy will grow by more than 6 per cent this year.  This compares with an annual average of only 2 per cent for the EU as a whole. Our GNP growth has been equally impressive, averaging 5 per cent annually. This growth performance has been underpinned by solid fundamentals in relation to the public finances, inflation and our external balance.  Since the late 1980s when the national debt-GDP ratio was about 116 per cent, we have improved to the point where this year's <Col N="1656" /> ratio will be close to 85 per cent.  In A Government of Renewal this Government has made clear its commitment to continuing to meet the debt and deficit criteria specified in the Treaty on European Union.</P>
      <P>Recent economic indicators show that strong growth in output and employment, with low inflation and a strong external balance will characterise Ireland's economic performance in 1995.  Continued moderation in domestic pay settlements will maintain, or even improve, Ireland's competitiveness. The outlook for Ireland's exporting firms is healthy.</P>
      <P>Domestic demand is expected to grow strongly this year.  The combined effect of the changes in tax and pay-related social insurance contributions introduced in this year's progressive and imaginative budget have led to significant increases in real incomes this year. This increase in disposable income, allied to strong recovery of consumer confidence, will support a strong increase in consumer spending.  Furthermore, the combination of continuing wage moderation and an exchange rate policy oriented towards price stability will mean that the level of inflation will remain at the moderate level of 2.5 per cent forecast in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Ahern earlier and also to Deputies Síle de Valera and McCreevy who repeated what he said. Deputy Ahern today reiterated some of the gross inaccuracies of today's tabloid treatment of economics in the <i>Star.</i>  He referred to the need to continue meeting European Monetary Union criteria and to the decline in Structural Funds post-1999.  What the Leader of Fianna Fáil did not say is that this Government is the first to set itself expenditure and borrowing targets necessary to meet these objectives.  Up to now we have had guestimates, estimates and a certain amount of hoping that the figures will pan out.  On this occasion we have a Government that has set down in clear detail precise expenditure and borrowing targets.  For all their professed interest in the economy, Deputy Ahern <Col N="1657" /> and his party never indicated an interest in setting such precise targets.  It is worth recalling in the context of what Deputies Harney and McDowell have been saying at the Progressive Democrat party conference and elsewhere that the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government presided over the highest levels of growth in spending in the past decade.  It is worth noting in particular that in 1991-92 Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats allowed public expenditure to grow by 10 per cent annually.</P>
    <P>In the interests of accuracy and comprehensiveness, I will address the points raised by Deputy Ahern in today's tabloid newspaper article.  Deputy Ahern's first allegation is that the country is back in the red.  It is obvious that Deputy Ahern did not read the half-yearly returns which clearly show that the current economic position is on target. Deputy McCreevy said the EU receipts were somewhat delayed, in other words, they would have had a bigger budget surplus had the EU Exchequer returns arrived on time. What Deputies McCreevy and Ahern conveniently forgot to say is that the 1994 position benefited substantially from the tax amnesty and other once off gains amounting to almost £300 million which again distorted the 1994 figure. Another allegation was that inflation would be at 2.8 per cent, but Deputy Ahern ignored the fact that the core inflation rate forecast by independent expert commentators for 1995 is 2.5 per cent which, if it pans out &mdash; the indications are that it will &mdash; will be 5 per cent down on the 1994 figure of 3 per cent.  I pay tribute to previous Administrations for helping to chart the course of fiscal rectitude.  This Government has continued on that path.  It is generally acknowledged that the low inflation performance is spectacular, significant and unique in European terms.</P>
    <P>Another allegation made by Deputy Ahern is that interest rates have risen. Although Deputy Ahern might wish otherwise, we have a small open economy whose interest rates are affected by <Col N="1658" /> external factors.  We have avoided rate increases which have prevailed in other countries.  Our interest rates are low by international standards and by comparison with our peers in the EU, and all the indications are that they will remain so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern also alleged that outflows in the first quarter realised £1.5 billion.  In making such a statement Deputy Ahern again displayed a frightening lack of understanding of the external reserves position.  It is obvious that his statements are made on the basis of state information or misguided prejudice.  Had Deputy Ahern bothered to read the monthly statistics from the Central Bank published and released yesterday, he would know that external reserves have risen by almost £400 million since December 1994.</P>
    <P>I was a teacher and if I were still in that profession I would award Deputy Ahern a low grade.  Economic and monetary union offers many advantages for both Ireland and the EU.  It will ensure the completion of the internal market and eliminate transaction costs and exchange rate risks for trade, tourism and investment among participating member states.  It should also ensure low and reasonably uniform interest rates among them.  These potential benefits are of major significance for a small open economy like ours and the Government will continue to wholeheartedly support the goal of economic and monetary union.  In order to do this it will be necessary for Ireland to meet the convergence criteria set out in the Treaty on European Union.</P>
    <P>In the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, the Government set itself a demanding task, namely, to constrain the growth of current supply services to a maximum of 6 per cent in nominal terms in 1995 and to an annual rate of 2 per cent in real terms over the following two years of the programme.  This tight spending limit is the cornerstone of the Government's policy on public finances. The recent prompt and decisive action of the Minister for Finance is evidence <Col N="1659" /> of our unwavering commitment to this objective.  The Government intends, through prudent management of the public finances and the economy generally, to ensure that Ireland will be ready to participate in economic and monetary union whenever it comes about.</P>
    <P>We are one of three EU members who are on target for economic and monetary union.  We hope other countries will meet the criteria so that the 1999 deadline will be met.  Although the economy is performing well there remains one outstanding problem &mdash; unemployment.  However, we do not regard this problem as uniquely intractable. Effective action continues to be taken to deal with it and is showing results.  A strong increase in employment is expected this year as the economy continues to expand.  Total employment is expected to grow by 2.5 per cent, with the services sector providing the bulk of these jobs.</P>
    <P>Continued progress in structural and tax reform is vital to make the economy more efficient in translating economic growth into accelerated employment growth.  Measures already taken, or those that the Government is committed to take such as tax reform and reform of the system of public service pay determination, are set to play a significant role in improving the environment for jobs.  The high priority afforded in the national development plan to investment in the development of skills through educating and training the long term unemployed is fundamental to making the labour market more competitive and tackling one of the root causes of long term unemployment.  The tax and social welfare changes in the 1995 budget were focused specifically on the need to reward work and promote enterprise.</P>
    <P>The prospect of peace and political stability will greatly enhance the climate for investment and offers an opportunity to reap the benefits of greater economic linkages and co-operation between the two parts of Ireland.  While <Col N="1660" /> the impact of peace and stability on output and employment will be positive and significant, it is difficult to measure the economic damage to the island as a whole that has been caused by 25 years of conflict and violence.  The new image of peace and stability has already been of special benefit to tourism and will add to the general perception of Ireland as a stable location for investment. Overall the Government anticipates substantial economic gains for both parts of the island derived partly from peace and partly from increased co-operation.</P>
    <P>The past few years have seen the successful introduction of many changes in the Defence Forces.  Representation for military personnel and the many changes introduced as a result of the Gleeson commission have had a major impact on the working conditions of those who serve in the Defence Forces. Computerisation is beginning to revolutionise routine administration.  The Government is committed to reforming the Defence Forces to meet the challenges of the next century.  The most important initiative taken in this regard occurred earlier this week when the Government announced that it had accepted the broad conclusions of the efficiency audit group and that a phased programme of reorganisation would now begin.  Its objectives are to implement the major structural and administrative reforms considered essential in order to develop the Defence Forces as a modern, properly staffed and adequately equipped organisation, capable of effectively fulfilling the roles assigned to it.  The Government's decision is a milestone in the evolution of the Defence Forces.  The Government has set out its vision of the Defence Forces as we move into the 21st century.  These changes will be a watershed in the development of the organisation.</P>
    <P>There is widespread agreement among commentators on the need to modernise the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces.  Its basic underlying framework had remained <Col N="1661" /> unchanged for decades.  We have a structured set of reforms to modernise the Defence Forces, both in terms of organisation and skill levels, which will be introduced on a carefully planned basis in order to allow the organisation to adapt to the necessary changes.  The EAG's examination has been the most comprehensive study of the Defence Forces to date.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that a number of commentators misunderstood the objectives and thrust of the review, seeing it merely as a cost-cutting exercise.  The EAG was not asked to review the Defence Forces in order to produce a programme of cut-backs and closures. The key phrases in the group's terms of reference were &ldquo;efficient&rdquo;, &ldquo;effective&rdquo;, &ldquo;optimum&rdquo; and &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo;.  The Government wants an organisation that is best suited to discharge its assigned roles efficiently and effectively.  A key objective is to release more personnel for operational duties.</P>
    <P>The first stage in this process will be the establishment of an implementation group to oversee the programme of reform.  This group will prepare a fully costed implementation plan for phase 1 of the proposals which will address the more important issues, including structure, personnel and resources, and will set out the detailed action to be taken over the next three years.  This plan will be presented to the Minister for Defence not later than 31 October 1995 for submission to Government.  The first phase will concentrate on the internal reorganisation of the Defence Forces and on addressing the age profile.  It will include a voluntary early retirement scheme which will be the subject of consultations with the representative associations.</P>
    <P>Due to unfounded rumour and media speculation some issues have recently caused undue anxiety.  An important element in the organisation of the Defence Forces is their deployment in barracks.  There has been much alarmist talk about the closure of Army barracks. I reiterate that the Government has decided that no barracks will be <Col N="1662" /> closed as part of the three year plan. There will, however, be a study of facilities occupied by the Defence Forces in the course of the plan.  In the conduct of this study, full regard will be had to the socio-economic importance of local barracks.</P>
    <P>Price Waterhouse recommended that the number of military bands should be reduced from four to one.  This proposal is not acceptable.  For many years the Army School of Music and the generations of military musicians who received their training there have made an invaluable contribution to the life of the Defence Forces.  Army bands have an important role on many State ceremonial occasions and make a valuable contribution to the community.  They are in constant demand to give public performances at major events.  For many years Army musicians maintained an admirable standard of excellence.  The presence of Army bands adds a unique lustre to important national events. They have an important role in maintaining the <i>esprit de corps</i> of the Defence Forces.  The implementation group will be asked to take cognisance of the importance of the Army bands when proceeding with its work.</P>
    <P>Following the unauthorised publication of extracts from the Price Waterhouse report in July last year there was speculation about the Army School of Equitation.  As has been made clear, there is no question of the school being closed.  In the course of implementing the EAG report the focus will be on ensuring that the school has an adequate supply of first-class horses and riders.  The school has a long and distinguished record in showjumping, at home and overseas.  It has played a major role in promoting the non-thoroughbred Irish horse.  The Minister is paying particular attention to the equitation school and addressing the question of ensuring that a continuing supply of good quality horses will be available for teams competing in the international arena.  The question of <Col N="1663" /> how best to achieve this is being examined and one possibility is the introduction of sponsorship arrangements.  I am confident that the school will continue to produce top class riders to represent Ireland.  In this year's intake of cadets, two cadetships are being specifically preserved for the equitation school.</P>
    <P>The rising age profile of military personnel has been the subject of public comment for some time and is one of a number of issues which will have to be addressed in implementing a programme of reform of the Defence Forces.  A voluntary early retirement scheme will be introduced and there will be a process of consultation with the representative associations before the details are drawn up.  It would be premature, therefore, to engage in speculation about them.  However, it has already been made clear that there will be no compulsory redundancies.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate and prudent that recruitment measures should be harmonised and synchronised with the reform plan, particularly in the context of the age profile problem.  Thirty-five apprenticeships in the Army and Air Corps will be awarded.  In addition, advertisements for the award of cadetships in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service were placed in the national press some time ago.  It is envisaged that about 35 cadetships will be awarded.</P>
    <P>The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the EU.  The Naval Service's efforts in this regard are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps.  In addition to surveillance work undertaken by Dauphin helicopters working in conjunction with the <i>LE Eithne</i>, two new CASA aircraft have been acquired for the Air Corps for aerial maritime patrols.</P>
    <P>I thank the Members for this opportunity to address the House.  I am confident the economic thrust of Government policy is well on target and that, despite the dire predictions and grave <Col N="1664" /> prognostications, it will meet those targets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to comment briefly on aspects of the revised Estimate for the Public Services.</P>
      <P>The Dáil needs to be empowered. The policy document a Government of Renewal contained a commitment to openness, transparency and accountability but, after six months in office, this promise is already in tatters.  The Government is comprised of the most secretive, introspective and arrogant assortment of Ministers and parties that Dáil Éireann has witnessed in many years.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach.  Deputy Bruton, has been groomed and tutored on how to avoid transmitting information at Question Time.  With studied avoidance he has repeatedly refused to answer with openness the many questions put to him.  Instead he has relied again and again on the old tactic of saying that the Deputy did not ask the right question. The Minister for Social Welfare introduced a further innovation by refusing to provide facts &mdash; which are in his briefing material &mdash; on Committee Stage of a Bill, which is unprecedented. He claimed that he was not ready to deal with the matter and, consequently, would not allow Deputies to have the material.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accountability has disimproved.  The Taoiseach refused to be accountable for the Attorney General or for the head of the Office of the Attorney General. Although the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, were all aware of the client relationship which the Attorney General had with Official A, none of them saw fit to inform the Dáil or the special committee of inquiry that this <Col N="1665" /> relationship existed.  This concealment was at a crucial time and the rainbow trio have never explained satisfactorily their reason for such secretive behaviour. Was it any wonder that, with this cover-up, further serious errors were made in that office?  On this occasion it was the hapless civil servant who was sacrificed.  So much for accountability. The Minister for Social Welfare also shirked his responsibility for a premature leak of the budget details.  The buck stops on the Minister's desk.</P>
    <P>Central to openness, transparency and accountability is the Government's much lauded programme of Dáil reform. However, no real support has been forthcoming for Deputies or for the many extra newly formed committees.  This is where the real power lies.  If the Dáil is properly empowered, as envisaged in the Constitution, there will be real openness and accountability and the Dáil is where that development must take place.  The rest of the Government's approach is just window dressing.  The patronising approach of the Taoiseach, his handlers and Ministers is not acceptable. Oireachtas Éireann is constitutionally independent of the Executive.  This is a fundamental tenet of our democracy and of the separation of powers.  It should be independent &mdash; and clearly seen to be &mdash; in its operation and, to achieve that, the Oireachtas needs a proper and substantial secretariat, an adequate resource allocation and modern library and information facilities.</P>
    <P>Government Departments have too much power and influence in Leinster House, this matter must be addressed and counterbalanced.  Dáil Éireann must be responsive to the needs of a modern democratic society and geared for the 21st century by enhancing the role of Members and ensuring that the Dáil has real powers.  I would greatly welcome such a development but could the rainbow coalition live with it?  What is the reason for its reluctance?  Why is it afraid of such real vigorous openness and accountability?  There was another example in the House this morning of a <Col N="1666" /> refusal by the Taoiseach to be accountable by not agreeing to have written questions dealt with while the Dáil continues its work in July and September.</P>
    <P>The issue of divorce appears to be on the back burner, although how far back we do not know.  The Fianna Fáil parliamentary party decided to support the principle of changing the Constitution to allow for remarriage.  We regarded it to be particularly important that provision is made for the protection of children and vulnerable spouses.  We said we wanted to see any outstanding legislation expedited, and that our preference is to specify in the Constitution the period of separation required before remarriage.</P>
    <P>However, we are faced with an awful silence from the Government, not a word has been heard on the referendum wording.  Is there a problem between the three parties?  How realistic is the Government's date of 30 November for the referendum?  Is it cynically trying to restrict discussion on the referendum in Dáil Éireann?  Do children feature in the Government's thinking on divorce? The Government decided that no spouse should lose as a result of the introduction of divorce but children must also be considered fully before the referendum and divorce Bill are passed. We are happy to participate in that discussion to ensure that we have the best possible referendum and divorce Bill.</P>
    <P>The tax treatment of separated or divorced couples has not yet been resolved. If the Government does not know what to do, it is time it shared its problems in this regard with the Opposition and with the public in general.  The Government has promised that people will not be worse off in terms of tax following the introduction of divorce, but it seems to be unable to spell out how exactly divorced couples will be treated by the tax system.  Meanwhile the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, following his minimalist approach, in bringing forward the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill has spurned the opportunity to provide extra support for families and independence for women in the context of the possible changes envisaged.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1667" /> There is an onus on the Government to be less secretive about its intentions and to indicate the possible course of events between now and 30 November. From the Taoiseach's reply to my question at the start of business today, the referendum Bill will not be published until after the summer recess, that is after 11 October.</P>
    <P>The largest and most vulnerable group who suffer greatly from inequality are pensioners, people with disabilities, unemployed people, widows and lone parents.  With one fell swoop the rainbow coalition, particularly its Democratic Left Minister, has degraded and reduced the status of these people. By increasing personal and adult dependant rates by only 2.5 per cent, the lowest in 30 years, the Minister has undermined the confidence and financial independence of these people.  The mid-May increase in the CPI is 2.8 per cent, and from the speech of the Minister for Finance, he agrees with the CPI figure, not with the Minister for Social Welfare.  Where has all the surplus money left by the previous Government been spent?  The Minister should answer that question in the interests of transparency.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform has introduced useful measures. The setting up of his Department was welcomed and its work is important and helpful.  I question the Government's decision to undermine the independence of the Legal Aid Board in the course of making it a statutory body.</P>
    <P>We have participated in worthy programmes of decentralisation, regional development and revival of rural areas, which have added greatly to the life and viability of the country, but we want to give our capital city back to the people, to communities, businesses, voluntary organisations and the ordinary decent people who aspire to live in peace and harmony.  We must tackle the problems of unemployment and crime.  We need more gardaí on the streets, a fast-track process to deal with habitual offenders in the courts, more specialised units of <Col N="1668" /> experienced detectives to put the drug barons out of action, an education programme on drugs and an end to the revolving door syndrome.</P>
    <P>As a small country on the periphery of Europe we must manage our resources well, and that is where the Government is failing.  The drift in expenditure control shown in the half-year Exchequer returns should be a warning to the Government.  It is the first clear indication that day to day management is slipping.  By playing down this drift, as the Minister for Finance did today, the Government is not helping.  There was a surplus of £137 million last year compared with a deficit of £34 million this year.  Any sensible manager would tackle this problem. Ignoring it will not help.  After its first six months in office is this Government capable of managing the economy?  The indications are not good.</P>
    <P>I thank the staff of the House and the Ceann Comhairle for their help during the session.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The single crucial issue that had to be dealt with by this Government on coming to office was to build on the work of the previous Administration on the Northern Ireland issue.  We spent the first session of this year pleading with the Government to stop acting as facilitator and take the role of initiator.  Since the Framework Document was published last February, regretfully the Government has been sending confused signals, some from the office of the Taoiseach, some from the office of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and elsewhere on its policy on this most crucial issue of building on the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will outline Fianna Fáil's view of what should be done.  As a party we want to sustain the peace process and make it permanent.  We want to move to inclusive all-party negotiations at the earliest possible opportunity and towards negotiation of an agreed political settlement along the lines set out in the Framework Document.  We want to encourage closer North-South economic <Col N="1669" /> co-operation and integration, between the North and South as a whole, along the Dublin-Belfast corridor and along the Border, with a concentrated effort on creating employment in areas of high economic deprivation.  We want to clear up the legacy of the past 25 years, the proposed release of prisoners, fundamental reform of the RUC and the replacement of emergency legislation.</P>
    <P>Let us not be ashamed to say that our long term aim and our ideal remains a united Ireland, achieved by agreement and consent, as set out in the report of the New Ireland Forum.  Unfortunately the opportunity that has been presented in terms of the peace process has not been grasped by the Taoiseach.  He has shilly-shallied on how to move forward. The only precondition before 31 August last for all-party talks was the cessation of violence.  Since then a series of preconditions has been set down, particularly on decommissioning.  Decommissioning must be on the agenda and must be tackled, but it should not be a precondition to talks.  We had ten months of peace up to the last few nights of violence in the North when millions of pounds worth of damage was done.</P>
    <P>While we in this House have actively supported a policy of bipartisanship, we would be less than honest if we were to say we are satisfied with the progress and effort made by the Taoiseach.  He must stop being the facilitator and become the initiator.  For too long he has been led and delayed in action by British political expediency and the problems of internal British politics. The role of prisoners, loyalist and republican, in bringing about and maintaining the ceasefire must be taken into account and recognised.  As a first step the British Government should restore the 50 per cent remission rate rather than continue with the 30 per cent rate that exists at present.  Difficulties have been created by the release by the British Government of Private Clegg.  In that context questions arise about British justice while other prisoners languish in jail.  In an overall peace settlement <Col N="1670" /> the position of prisoners must be tackled.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on its release of 20 Provisional IRA prisoners since the ceasefire.  That compares with the British Government's approach whereby a more strenuous, restrictive regime was adopted to releases at Christmas 1994 in the middle of the peace process than at Christmas 1993 in the middle of the conflict.  It is essential that the Government has a clear mind on which direction it is going.  It must speak with one voice, not reflecting divergent views between the Taoiseach's office and Iveagh House.  The people will be harsh in their judgement of this Government if it allows the opportunity of the peace process to slip away.  We want to see the peace process built on.  My party leader and I have been in the North on a number of occasions to speak to republicans. Nationalists, Unionists and loyalists.</P>
    <P>A White Paper will be published in the course of the summer recess but it should have been published when the Dáil was sitting to allow proper debate. Let me set down a marker for the Government here and now: this Government White Paper must build on the 60 years of progress that Fianna Fáil has made in the area of foreign affairs, from de Valera, Aiken, Lemass leading us into Europe, our first Commissioner, Paddy Hillery and the work done by the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, during the last Presidency.  The question of military neutrality has to be set out clearly in the White Paper.  We want an open and public debate on it when the Dáil resumes in October.  The achievements of Fianna Fáil in guiding foreign policy for 60 years must be recognised and the Government must build on this. I look forward to the debate on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree strongly with the Deputy's suggestion that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have not been working painstakingly and patiently to advance the peace process. There is no doubt that a great deal <Col N="1671" /> of work has been put into it.  It is a fragile flower that has to be nurtured.  It is less than fair of the Deputy to suggest that there is not the same degree of commitment and effort being put into this process.  It is absolutely clear to every fair minded commentator that this is not the case.  Of course, I recognise the contribution of the previous Government and I would not be in the least ungenerous to it in respect of what it has done.  It is important that we maintain cross-party work in this area.</P>
      <P>This Government is performing extremely well and is presiding over a period of good economic progress.  This year, employment outside the agriculture sector will grow by 37,000.  That is a very significant increase.  In the past with an increase of 20,000 to 25,000 in the labour force we only produced a net increase of 1,000 or 2,000 jobs.  That has been the case for many years and we have seen the constant attrition through emigration of young talented people. There has been a great sea change and we have the opportunity to provide good employment opportunities for our young people.  It is quite clear that our young people are seizing the opportunities. In the first six months of this year, industrial redundancy figures are down by 21 per cent on the same period last year.  Clearly there is greater confidence in the economy and we are building on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has been very prudent in its approach to public spending. This is the first Government in my memory &mdash; perhaps Members with longer memories will correct me &mdash; that has set clear public spending targets for itself.  In the past Governments have talked about borrowing targets &mdash; borrowing is the gap between spending and taxation and it is easy to meet borrowing targets if one is willing to increase taxation indefinitely.  This Government, however, has set itself not only borrowing targets but targets in respect of public spending and is determined that the fruits of growth should be shared equally between providing <Col N="1672" /> improved services through public spending and tax relief in order to underpin good employment performance. The Government is taking prudent measures to meet the public spending targets it has set itself.  The Minister for Finance is to be commended for adopting such a prudent approach, ensuring the Government makes the necessary adjustments in good time to ensure that public spending is on course and leaves room for tax reform and for the economy to continue its path of employment growth.</P>
    <P>I indicated to Deputy O'Rourke that I would afford her a couple of minutes at the end of my time.</P>

      <P>Today we are introducing a Supplementary Estimate for the Irish Productivity Centre.  As Members will know, the Irish Productivity Centre, the IPC, is jointly owned by IBEC and the Congress of Trade Unions.  It was established back in 1963.  Its work predominantly is building on the notion of partnership and disseminating it in the workplace.  It has provided a very valuable source of expertise on the theme of adjusting to change.  A very important part of its service has been in dispute resolution and particularly in providing expert opinion that has the support of both sides of industry.  It can go into a dispute and help to advise on technical matters that will help to resolve the dispute.  I availed of its services in our efforts to deal with the Packard Electric dispute where clearly there were technical issues of great importance that needed the services of outside advisers to assist in bringing things to a satisfactory conclusion. Last year the centre received a grant-in-aid of just under £500,000. Pending the development of the business plan to make the centre fully commercial and financially independent over a period of years an initial provision of £330,000 is made in the Estimates. The business plan to make the <Col N="1673" /> IPC financially independent has now been finalised.  It already raises a substantial part of its funding through fees and it plans to restructure its workload to achieve financial independence in the short term.  It will require additional moneys and the moneys made available today will enable it to discharge accumulated debts and continue its operations on a sound financial basis. These funds are required urgently in order to implement the plan and to avoid a possible closure of the centre.  I am providing for these funds to be sourced from savings of £299,000 from subhead D.2, the loan subsidy for the small businesses expansion scheme, without in any way curtailing that scheme, and £1,000 from the Supplementary Estimate before the House today.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware of the important element of the work that the Irish Productivity Centre has been involved in linked to the Programme for Competitiveness and Work.  This includes acting as a national participating agency where they have been closely monitoring employee involvement in both the public and private sectors and providing reports to the Central Review Committee.  It has also been pioneering partnership initiative at enterprise level.</P>
      <P>It is participating strongly in the new unit in the Department dealing with new forms of work organisation and it will be one of the leading consultants in an EU funded project under the title &ldquo;New Work Organisation in Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a sea change in industry throughout the world.  We are moving from high volume to high value forms of production and are moving away from the old structures of control with repetitive tasks, hierarchy, supervision, long conveyor belts and mass production. Companies and their work-forces must adjust to the need to be innovative, produce differentiated products which are customised to the needs of people, meet very high quality standards, cut down stockholding by &ldquo;just in time&rdquo; methods and move away from <Col N="1674" /> demarcation of tasks to multi-skilling. These changes pose huge challenges and the Irish Productivity Centre, among others, will play an important part in helping both sides of industry to respond to these.  We are facing global competition and we must meet world class manufacturing standards and produce high quality products.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased that one of the bodies leading the debate about change is the Irish Congress of Trade Unions which has published a document entitled &ldquo;Managing Change&rdquo;.  We have moved away from where industrial relations were introverted and concerned with demarcation, dispute settlement and grievances to where industrial relations is increasingly about teamwork, sharing information and responding to shared challenges.  It is important to develop this area and I am glad the IPC will play a role in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Estimate for the IPC which will ensure the necessary funding to make a change in the &ldquo;stop-go&rdquo; arrangement which was at the root of its problems for many years. The centre's business plan has been deposited with the Minister and this funding will ensure that it will be able to work to a structure and raise fees in a more intensive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Productivity Centre was way ahead of its time when it was set up in 1963.  At that stage disputes led to major confrontation and the IPC was given the task of working in partnership, which was unheard of 32 years ago.  My father used the fledgling IPC to solve industrial difficulties which arose in his textile firm.  The way the centre has structured its work is very much in keeping with the way industrial relations, community relations, partnership programmes etc.  have been developed between the Government and the social partners.  I am pleased that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is taking the social partnership seriously &mdash; it took a while for <Col N="1675" /> his older brother to do so.  The fabric of industrial life will be all the better for this.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions' conference was held in Tralee this week and on the radio the new ways of working, dealing with strikes etc.  Were referred to.  If people want to take up part-time or casual employment that is fine, but there must be some structures whereby they can be given training and motivation.</P>
    <P>I commend the Estimate to the House and I look forward to working with the IPC.  The title of Irish Productivity Centre has an old fashioned ring to it and perhaps consideration could be given to changing it.  This modern organisation with modern ideas of which it can be proud should consider a more modern title.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject Deputy Harney's assertion that we were not being factually correct in the presentation of the figures of public expenditure or the increase for the gross current supply services in 1995.  At all times, we have clearly published the figures and the basis on which they have been calculated.  The efforts by the Progressive Democrats to suggest that public expenditure is somewhat out of control and that this centre left administration has lost the run of itself compare very badly with the apparent lack of control in terms of public expenditure during the period 1990-92 when the Progressive Democrats were in Government.  I do not want to score political points but I had to reply to that point made by Deputy Harney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions in the Book of Estimates for 1995 and the outturn at the mid-year point for receipts from Exchequer returns and other components which go to make up the public finances clearly indicate that we are on course to meet the objectives we set ourselves and the obligations which will fall from those.  In other words, the arrangements and the management of <Col N="1676" /> the public finances are on course to do precisely what they were meant to do. People can take comfort from that.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the social partnership and the way in which in various national agreements since the Programme for National Recovery &mdash; I have supported all of them &mdash; it has enabled a climate of consensus, conciliation and dialogue to prevail within which very difficult issues, some of which were painful, have been addressed and in most cases satisfactorily resolved.  In this context I refer to the unique contribution the former President of the ICTU, Phil Flynn, made to that process during the past two years.  It may well be that his closing remarks and his contributions to the conference in Kerry this week will be as enduring as was his contribution during his term of office.  He and his General Secretary, Peter Cassells, and all the associated members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, have identified not only the necessity to embrace change but the absolute imperative for working people, in all aspects of life, to determine that agenda and to ensure that human values and concerns are uppermost on the agenda when change is being negotiated and implemented.</P>
    <P>The House will at 3 o'clock approve the Estimates for expenditure of millions of pounds of taxpayer's money on a whole array of activities to deliver services and commodities to our citizens.  It is a vast sum of money which will be spent responsibly and in a manner that is accountable by both civil and public servants.  Those who deliver and receive those services will have to ensure that the agenda of change, so clearly staked out on the ground in Kerry by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, is embraced in full by the public sector and Civil Service unions.</P>
    <P>There are demands for improved services at all levels in society, in the health care area, in education, applied services in the fields of agriculture, the environment and culture.  There is an endless list of areas where we have to do more and do it better.  We have come to the point where doing more and doing it <Col N="1677" /> better means doing it with the same amount of resources.  This unique lesson which the Irish Congress of Trade Unions prescribed in Kerry will have to be taken on board.</P>
    <P>I commend the leadership of senior officials in the Civil Service and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, who launched the strategic management initiative, which is designed exclusively to address the matter to which I have referred and to ensure it is implemented in a way that is shared in terms of ownership by all the participants who will be affected by it and all the political parties who have the honour to be represented here.  We will not be able to do the things we want or need to do on behalf of our diverse constituencies unless the efficiency and the productivity of which the people are innately capable, and which they have demonstrated in other sectors, are transferred and translated into the broad public service.  Many people in the public service who have given their lives working on behalf of others must realise this is an opportunity which creates great possibilities in a positive sense for them as individuals.  In many cases the working environments with which they have to contend are antiquated, the procedures they have to observe by the letter of the law are ludicrously outdated and the reporting relationships &mdash; which are based on a structure of societal hierarchy and owe more to the Victorian age than to the age in which we live &mdash; treat many well qualified adults like children.  All those things have frustrated people who work in the public service and, ultimately, turned them into, at best, passive and, at worst, cynical participants in the system.</P>
    <P>As a young man I worked for over two and a half years as a junior architect in the housing architects' department of Dublin Corporation.  I reject out of hand the trite criticism many people in the private sector make of those working in the public service.  Frequently, those people have never worked in the public service and do not understand the sense of frustration felt by people working in <Col N="1678" /> it.  They simply want to do their own job better and in a more satisfactory and fulfilling way, not for themselves but for the people for whom the services are designed.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate in discussing the Estimates and the vast amount of money that will go into many different aspects of society that we look at questions which we ignore at our peril.  How do we get value for money?  How do we unlock the potential of adults working in the public service in 1995 and not in 1905?  If one looks at some of the terminology, rules and regulations and attitudes one would think we were closer to the beginning than to the end of the century.</P>
    <P>We will be coming back in the autumn with a reform package based on the programme, A Government of Renewal, setting out how, among other things, we intend to revise and amend the fundamental administrative legislation known as the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924.  We will be making suggestions and proposals for reform in a number of areas.  In the presence of the Chief Whip of the main Opposition party, Deputy Dermot Ahern, I hope we will be able, once those proposals are put on the table, to ensure they are discussed comprehensively at the appropriate Oireachtas committee.  Every Member who aspires to deliver public service as a member of Government or as a Minister of State has a vested interest in ensuring we have the best possible system of administration that will take us comfortably and efficiently into the next century.  The Estimates we will vote on are the financial foundation upon which so much depends: the enthusiasm of the teacher, the dedication of the nurse, the creativity of the cultural worker and so on.  All these bring together that wonderful array of people who work in the extended public service and who deliver the State's services to us.  The delivery of those services is not harnessing all the energy, enthusiasm and creativity which those individuals have in the public service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1679" /> The agenda of change, identified so courageously by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in Kerry, is one we ignore at our peril.  It is an agenda we have to embrace critically and uniquely because of the dominance in some aspects of the public service unions within the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  It is an agenda of change that must be embraced wholeheartedly by the constituent parts of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
    <P>So far as we will have responsibility for the next two years, this Administration &mdash; I have no reason to believe that successive administrations will be any different &mdash; and I as Minister for Finance will reach out to and enter into constructive and positive dialogue with the public service unions to ensure that the strategic management initiative, the basis upon which we can all move forward, is properly identified, discussed and disseminated within the public service and consequently is comprehensively owned by all the participants and employees within the public service so that not only can their working conditions be improved but the services can be more effectively and more efficiently delivered.  Nobody has anything to fear or lose from that agenda.  Everybody has something to gain from it.  The people who have most to gain are the many public servants who have been trapped for too long in the bureaucracy of rules and regulations which are no longer relevant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purposes of this Bill are: to amend the Industrial Development Act, 1993, to remove unnecessary restrictions on the operations of Forbairt and IDA Ireland; to enable Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland to establish subsidiaries; to allow Forbairt and IDA Ireland to invest moneys in funds aimed at the development of industry, as opposed simply to investment in specific companies; to increase the aggregate limit of grants that may be made to SFADCo to enable it to discharge its industrial development functions and make a number of other minor amendments to the SFADCo Acts, 1959 to 1991; and to provide statutory authority for the payment to county enterprise boards, out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas, of grants to meet their administration and general expenses and to discharge the obligations and liabilities arising out of the performance of their enterprise support functions.</P>
      <P>While a number of the provisions of this Bill are &ldquo;housekeeping&rdquo; in nature, overall it will allow the operating agencies to respond to the needs of industry more effectively, thereby adding to the policies aimed at increasing employment and reducing unemployment.  I expect a further significant rise in employment in 1995 following from employment growth of 2.6 per cent in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Bank forecasts that nonagricultural employment could grow by 37,000 jobs in 1995.  Undoubtedly, employment is growing strongly.  The ESRI, in its recent quarterly report, states that despite some well-publicised job losses, the underlying trend in employment remains firmly upwards. Notified redundancies for the first six months of this year show a significant fall of over 21 per cent compared with the same period last year.  Against this <Col N="1681" /> positive background, the trend in unemployment figures is disappointing.  The ESRI has recently pointed to lower net emigration or a rise in the participation rate as being among contributory factors for the poorer trend in the live register.  There is also evidence that those leaving full time education are getting jobs ahead of people who are already unemployed.  These factors point to the difficulty not just in addressing the general unemployment problem, but also, in particular, the stubbornly high numbers of those who are long term unemployed.  The most recent figures, up to the end of April, which Deputy O'Rourke has probably seen, show only a slight decline as a proportion of the total number unemployed.</P>
    <P>I have recently taken a number of initiatives specifically geared towards dealing with this issue.  I have increased the numbers who will benefit under the community employment programme this year, giving an average of 40,000 for 1995.  In addition, I have proceeded with the recommendations of the task force on long term unemployment to establish a local employment service.  The task force is continuing its work to refine community employment type programmes to make them more effective in dealing with long term unemployment. When its report comes to hand in October I will take it very seriously and act upon it.</P>
    <P>In parallel with that process I am examining employment strategy to ensure we are doing the best we can to increase employment and reduce unemployment. To this end I have embarked on a policy review in the areas of foreign direct investment, indigenous industry and the broader actions that can improve our ability to turn the good growth we are enjoying into reductions in unemployment.  We must raise our sights higher to ensure that people who are unemployed can be reintegrated into the active labour market.  This is not a simple task, but a highly complex one that is fundamental to tackling <Col N="1682" /> unemployment, particularly long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Government policy on employment has many facets.  The purpose is to ensure that sensible macro-economic policies are pursued.  Business confidence is high.  Business recognises the Government has taken action not only in the budget but also to ensure that prudent provision is made at this stage so that the 1996 budget will comply with the spending standards set &mdash; real growth of 2 per cent in public spending. This is in stark contrast with the position adopted in the previous four years when public spending was increased by between 5 to 7 per cent.  A stringent approach is being adopted so that the benefits can be shared in terms of improved public services and reform of the tax code to sustain the good employment growth we are enjoying.</P>
    <P>The operational programme for industry for 1994-99 which I launched last January sets out a framework within which policy can be developed.  An overall target of 20,000 gross new jobs per annum has been set.  This target was exceeded by Forbairt and the other development agencies in 1994.  I am confident they will maintain this excellent performance in 1995 and in years ahead. The figures to date indicate they are again ahead of target.</P>
    <P>While the last operational programme for the period up to 1995 had significant successes &mdash; it achieved its 20,000 gross jobs per annum on average target and saw Ireland achieve the highest growth in output and employment in manufacturing in the European Union &mdash; it also showed up continuing weaknesses in our industrial performance. These include the static Irish share in European Union markets; the continuing high level of job losses &mdash; while 60,624 new jobs were created in the indigenous sector there were 59,043 job losses leaving only a meagre 1,600 extra at work in that sector at the end of that considerable five year programme; the wide discrepancy in performance of the hi-tech mostly foreign owned and traditional sectors and the difficulty in <Col N="1683" /> increasing the Irish economy purchases by overseas industry &mdash; the figures show that we are in a rut with the proportion of purchases sourced in Ireland remaining fairly rigid.</P>
    <P>The new operational programme is setting itself explicit targets not just in gross job creation as in the past but other targets that must be achieved if we are to transform our industrial performance. These include increasing indigenous exports by 66 per cent in value, almost twice as fast as the overseas sectors at 35 per cent.  That would be a dramatic turnaround increasing our share of world trade by 20 per cent, the share of raw materials used by foreign companies sourced in Ireland be 15 per cent and the share of GDP devoted to research and development by 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>While the gross job target of 20,000 is the same as for the last operational programme much greater emphasis is being placed on strengthening the long term capability of industry to reduce job losses.  The operational programme has set itself a target of doubling the net number of jobs from 2,400 over the last programme to 5,000 jobs per annum on average.  I want to see these targets exceeded.  The agencies have accepted a higher target.  The measure of our success is the net number of jobs created rather than the gross number.</P>
    <P>Increasing competitiveness is a vital component of our employment strategy if we are to reduce job losses.  The House will be aware that I established a new Task Force for Industry Adjustment to identify areas of business at risk from competitive forces and to propose enhanced competitive strategies.  It is not a fund for dealing with the rescue of companies in crisis which have let matters deteriorate, it is designed to anticipate changes and help companies to change their product line, operating process, marketing strategies and positioning to respond to increasing competition. The task force includes the social partners as well as the State agencies and is developing a strategy aimed at <Col N="1684" /> areas where avoidance of job losses requires major changes and adjustment. I expect it will complete its work of identifying a process for the way forward in the coming months.</P>
    <P>In addition to that task force, the IDA and Forbairt work closely with their clients to identify at an early stage Irish or Irish based companies in danger of becoming uncompetitive.  The IDA and Forbairt can help companies to improve their competitiveness in a number of ways.  They can help them to achieve ISO accreditation, to introduce world class manufacturing standards, to establish research and development functions, to reduce their overheads and work closely with companies which wish to become sub-suppliers to major multinational enterprises.  I am pleased that a pilot programme initiated in Galway and Mayo during the past 12 months has been successful and we hope to extend it to other areas as it has helped to develop sub-supply.  Forbairt also provides support under the management development programme.</P>
    <P>We are eager to encourage development in the small business and services sector, traditionally high providers of wealth and employment in Ireland, but that sector was confined to something of a cinderella in the past.  It is important that its role is recognised as it has been in our Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>We have put in place structures like the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Small Businesses and Services under the chairmanship of my colleague, Deputy Creed, which I hope will ensure that the House will not forget the needs of small business and services.  Deputy Creed is assisted by many Members on all sides who devote a good deal of energy to that work.  The committee is reviewing policies, examining the effectiveness of State assistance, considering compliance costs, bringing in front-line small business operators, examining the role of financial institutions and the North-South dimension.  That is important and the committee has a heavy work schedule.</P>
    <P>I have been keen to put in place a <Col N="1685" /> consultative body which will interact directly with me, as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, so that I can hear at first-hand the views of business people.  I am establishing a small business forum under the chairmanship of Mr. Aidan O'Boyle, who I am sure is known to Members.  He is a man of immense experience spanning Ireland and the EU.  He set up a small business and is familiar with national and international markets.  He will bring a good deal of energy to the forum.</P>
    <P>I am keen that the forum will be representative of all interests interacting with the small business sector.  I will contact the representative groups, including small business practitioners. The role of the forum will include, among other things, assessing new initiatives that will help to build the capacity of small businesses as they must respond to rapidly evolving changes in the marketplace in which they must survive and prosper for the future.  It is important to examine new ways in which they can meet those challenges and equally important to review progress and refine the recommendations of the valuable Task Force on Small Business set up by the former Minister, Deputy Brennan.  That task force set an agenda we are anxious to carry through.  The forum will also consider administrative simplification.  A repeated plea of the small business sector is that it faces too great a bureaucratic burden of compliance costs with various State regulations and it is important to address and minimise that burden.</P>
    <P>I will introduce a new scheme to provide long term fixed rate finance at a subsidised rate to small business.  It will be the main element of the small business operational programme that will be developed by my Department, the European Union and the banks.  We will build on the success of the last scheme and improve the new scheme in a number of significant respects.  We will provide a larger fund which will be open to new classes of small business, such as the service sector and start-up firms and <Col N="1686" /> we will reduce the minimum loan of £40,000 under the old scheme to £20,000.  That will open up opportunities to many smaller businesses that may not have pursued projects because of that high threshold.</P>
    <P>The financial institutions have demonstrated keen interest in running a new scheme and I am pleased that tenders from banks have been positive.  We will soon have a consortium of banks running that scheme, an innovative approach that will draw on the experience of a number of financial institutions in their dealings with small business and secure better value for taxpayers' money.  The fund for the new scheme will be at least £200 million, double the amount available under the previous scheme.  I hope we can succeed in achieving a higher fund.  I am confident that the interest rate will be at least equal and, I hope, lower than that available under the first scheme.  The money will be available over a seven year period and I will announce details of the new loan fund in the very near future.</P>
    <P>While those measures will create additional jobs.  I am conscious of the need to ensure that all members of society, especially the young and unemployed, have access to those new opportunities. I am committed to pursuing a range of active labour market measures to improve access to jobs that will include the provision of work and the development of job-related skills.  A local employment service is now established in a unit within my Department. The first 12 partnership areas are putting together plans which will be submitted by the committees in the near future.  It is important that the new unit recommends policy proposals and initiatives to tackle the issue of long term unemployment.  I am enthusiastic about the approach of local communities in responding to local needs.</P>
    <P>I am also working on a White Paper on Human Resource Development and Training.  One of its main objectives will be to raise the horizons of Irish companies to enable them to plan a strategic position for their companies that <Col N="1687" /> emphasises high value added and the use of high skills to achieve a competitive edge.  We must seek to develop learning organisations that view staff development as an integral element of the fight to maintain and increase competitive capability.  The White Paper will also address important policy issues such as skills gap, in-company training and ensuring maximum value from the training budget.  I am engaged in extensive consultations with the social partners in preparing that paper.  It is clear there will need to be a strong and sustained national effort to tackle unemployment and no one measure can solve it.  The Bill has developed from many initiatives outlined in the broad framework of the operational programme for industry in so far as it represents new initiatives, but some housekeeping issues need to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Forfás has made a significant contribution to maintaining the broad policy focus recommended by Culliton and Moriarty, particularly in respect of the wider business environment.  The issues being addressed by Forfás, including industrial costs, taxation, telecommunications, finance for industry and the State's future role in the provision of industrial property, are crucial to the competitiveness and growth of enterprise.</P>
    <P>The policy and co-ordination functions of Forfás include an important science and technology component.  That includes co-ordination of Ireland's involvement in the EU Framework Programme for Research and Development. In addition, Forfás provided extensive back-up to the recently published report of the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council.  In the coming year Forfás will continue its work with STIAC and Mr. John Travers, chief executive officer of Forfás, is currently chairing the task force established by the Government to respond to STIAC's recommendations.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the main provisions of the Bill.  The Industrial <Col N="1688" /> Development Act, 1993, which established the three new agencies, Forfás, IDA Ireland and Forbairt in January 1994, confined to Forfás only the power of the former IDA to acquire, hold and dispose of land and property.  While the original intention was to give Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland the basic power to acquire, hold and dispose of land and other property, paragraph 1 (2) of the First Schedule of the 1993 Act confines that power to Forfás only.  That has had two main effects, neither Forbairt nor the IDA can hold land either for administrative or industrial development purposes and neither of them can acquire, hold or dispose of shares in their respective client companies.  The fact that the operating agencies did not have these powers to date did not constrain them in the performance of their industrial development tasks.</P>
    <P>Section 3 rectifies this anomaly by allowing Forbairt and IDA Ireland to acquire, hold and dispose of land and other property, in accordance with such assignments of those powers as Forfás, under the supervision of the Minister, approves under section 9 of the 1993 Act.</P>
    <P>Section 4 is related and provides for the transfer of shares in client companies, currently vested in Forfás, to Forbairt or IDA Ireland, as the case requires.  Currently the executive agencies may only invest moneys in specific undertakings, on a project by project basis.  My Department and the agencies are, however, developing certain options for the creation of development funds, some specific to particular industrial sectors &mdash; for example, software &mdash; and some more general in nature. Section 6 provides for the necessary powers in respect of seed and venture capital.  The funds involved could include moneys sourced from the Structural Funds or other EU funding sources.  Activity by the agencies in this area would be subject to ministerial supervision.</P>
    <P>An equity capital survey of indigenous industry, carried out by my Department in 1993, found that 34 per cent of <Col N="1689" /> respondents had a current equity requirement and 58 per cent had either a current equity requirement, or would have one in the next three years.  A total of 78 per cent of firms which an equity requirement considered that raising equity would be difficult.  These findings, together with other work in this area, indicate that many small and medium sized manufacturing firms have difficulty raising the required equity and the growth of such companies is constrained through a lack of availability of equity capital.</P>
    <P>Under the EU Operational Programme for Industry 1994-99, a sum of up to approximately £33 million will be available for seed and venture capital investment.  The object of the fund for seed and venture capital support from Structural Funds is to provide equity and management support to growth oriented small and medium sized enterprises.  This support will be expected to facilitate significant growth in the investee companies that, in turn, will be expected to generate employment opportunities in these companies. To date venture funds have not strayed into the smaller end; they have tended to want more gilt edge investments. These new funds will be important for access to equity by business.</P>
    <P>Financial support from the EU Structural Funds would be made available to applicant organisations involved in seed and venture stage equity investment in growth oriented firms.  Under the scheme, Structural Funds would be entitled to rank equally with private sector funding in terms of dividends and repayment of capital.  In addition, any allocation of EU support funding would be conditional on an equivalent level of matching private sector funding.</P>
    <P>Overall, during the lifetime of the scheme, it is expected that equity support will be provided to many small and medium sized enterprises which would otherwise find it difficult to raise the necessary equity for the particular ventures. Section 6 will enable the agencies to be involved in the disbursement of these funds and enable them to set up <Col N="1690" /> other funds, as required, using their own money in partnership with private sector third parties.</P>
    <P>The Bill also proposes in section 5 an enabling power to allow Forfás, Forbairt or IDA Ireland to establish subsidiaries. While there is no proposal to set up specific subsidiaries at present, there are areas of activity, particularly in relation to Forbairt, that may in future be considered more appropriate to be carried on outside the mainstream of the agency concerned.  The creation and operation of any subsidiaries would be subject to controls exercised by me, as Minister for Enterprise and Employment, and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I am taking the opportunity provided by the introduction of this Bill to provide for the further financing of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited.  Specifically, the Bill provides in section 8 for an increase from £150 million to £200 million in the upper limit on the aggregate amount of grant-in-aid, voted annually, that may be made to the company.  The grant-in-aid moneys are applied towards meeting the company's running expenses and enabling the company to provide financial assistance to companies at the Shannon Free Zone.  The last occasion that legislation increasing the aggregate limit on grant-in-aid was enacted was in December 1991, when the limit was increased from £105 million to £150 million.</P>
    <P>In the years 1992 to 1994 Shannon Development has assisted in the creation of 4,352 gross new jobs in the industrial areas for which it has responsibility, resulting in a net increase of 844 jobs in the Shannon Free Zone and Irish-owned companies throughout the mid-west region.  At the end of 1994, employment at the Shannon Free Zone had reached an all time high of 5,600. The company also completed work on the first phase of a 250 acre extension to the National Technological Park, and by the end of 1994 employment at the park had reached approximately 3,000.</P>
    <P>The company has continued to adopt a more commercial approach to its <Col N="1691" /> operations and to reduce its dependence on direct State funding to meet its operating costs.  The Exchequer contribution to the company's operating budget declined from 22 per cent of the budget in 1992 to 16 per cent in 1994 as a result of increases in the company's income from other sources.</P>
    <P>The proposed increase in the statutory limit on the aggregate amount of grant-in-aid that may be issued to the company is expected to be sufficient to cover the company's operations for the next four years.  In 1994 the EU Commission approved an extension to the end of the year 2000 of the cut-off date for the availability of the special 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for new international service industries establishing in the Shannon Free Zone.</P>
    <P>The company also has ambitious plans for the future development of the National Technological Park, including additional capital investment of £100 million by the private sector in new industrial facilities and the achievement of 5,000 jobs at the park by the end of the century.  The company will, of course, also be continuing its industrial development role throughout the entire mid-west region.</P>
    <P>Other technical provisions in the Bill are also proposed in relation to SFADCo concerning pension arrangements for employees of the company's wholly-owned subsidiaries and a proposed exemption from stamp duty in relation to land acquisition, to align the arrangements applicable to SFADCo, Forfás, Forbairt and IDA Ireland.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 10 will secure to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment the power to make grants to the county enterprise boards from Exchequer funds to enable them to undertake activities in support of enterprise.  This power has not been required to date as the boards have been functioning under the direct technical supervision of my Department, which has managed their financial transactions. The boards will soon be moving to a new basis of operation, in which <Col N="1692" /> they will function as independently-controlled local enterprise development companies limited by guarantee with direct responsibility for the management of their finances, hence the need for this provision.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise boards are now in a position to provide an expanded range of services to enterprise, including financial supports and, notably, business advice and counselling and management development support to small firms. Their central role in the formulation of the local economic agenda through their enterprise plans and the promotion of an enterprise culture at local level will also be strengthened.  Much of this activity will be eligible for European Union cofinancing under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the achievements of the county enterprise boards to date. Already, their enterprise plans constitute a major advance in securing local input to national enterprise planning and their existing counselling and referral services provide a valuable resource to potential entrepreneurs and existing small businesses nationwide.</P>
    <P>The interim county enterprise fund grant scheme managed by the boards, which provides fixed capital, employment and feasibility study grants to assist small business start-ups and expansions, has evoked a major response.  Since the inception of the scheme in late 1993, assistance has been approved in respect of some 3,723 projects with an aggregate grant value in excess of £32 million and the potential for 5,726 full-time and 1,429 part-time jobs.  Figures supplied by the boards indicate that, from their establishment to the end of 1994, 1,776 full-time and 263 part-time jobs were created in county enterprise board projects. Almost £5 million was drawn down by the boards in grant support in 1994. They have already achieved that target in 1995 and their level of activity is increasing.  This provision can only strengthen the performance of county enterprise boards in their key role in the <Col N="1693" /> drive for enterprise development locally and nationally.</P>
    <P>The boards work closely with other industrial development agencies and with the Leader groups and area partnership companies.  Each board is assisted by an evaluation committee, the purpose of which is to provide technical assistance to its board on the evaluation of projects with a view to ensuring the commercial viability of those projects. The evaluation committee is a unique and valuable arm of the county enterprise board structure in that it provides an independent means of examining projects at local level in the cold light of day.  This will help ensure good value for taxpayers' money in the future.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of contributing to this debate and particularly pleased that the attempt to have all Stages passed today was resisted so that we can table amendments. If the debate had ended at 4.30 p.m. we would have had half an hour only within which to debate amendments which I intend tabling for Committee Stage and to take Fourth and Fifth Stages.  This affords us an opportunity also to look at the overall structures of IDA Ireland, Forbairt and Forfás and examine them in some detail.  I was even more surprised at the attempts to have this Bill rushed through at the eleventh hour because on an Adjournment Debate, when Deputy O'Malley shared his time with me, it clearly emerged that this Bill would have to be introduced to increase the limits for SFADCo but no such decision was taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important Bill whose provisions warrant careful consideration, and highlight a number of issues with regard to the accountability of Government Ministers which need to be addressed.  It also raises questions about the status of the industrial development agencies, State-sponsored bodies and the operations of the Oireachtas committee system.  I have no difficulty with the industrial development promotion <Col N="1694" /> agencies, which undertake much useful work, in particular within competitive international marketplaces and at home in encouraging indigenous industries and enterprises.  IDA Ireland has a remarkable record of achievement and, as one of the longer established industrial agencies, is envied on the international circuit, which can be seen from United States industries moving to Europe, of which it takes a quarter of the total market share.</P>
    <P>On occasions such as these one has a brief opportunity to look back on the historical development of agencies. Looking back through the Official Report, I found the first debate was in 1950.  It made interesting reading, during a period of strong protectionism, in the post-war depression, when the then Government set out cautiously on the route to such development, little knowing then the ultimate result.</P>
    <P>The first Industrial Development Authority, as we knew it, was formed in 1969.  I read the Official Reports of that debate, to which my father made a major contribution.  Even then his questions related to the accountability of the new agency to Ministers and the Oireachtas and posed similar questions on the duplication of agencies, asking where it was all going.  My reaction was: &ldquo;<i>plus ça change, plus ça, la même chose</i>&rdquo;.  He believed then too many agencies were emerging.  One wonders what he would say now with the proliferation of industrial promotion agencies ranging from IDA Ireland to Forfás, FÁS, Leader, county enterprise boards, area partnerships, social welfare schemes, five Ministers in total, with many Minister all concerned to be involved in job creation and yet the figures are not good.</P>
    <P>The latest structures for the industrial promotion agencies have come about with legislative changes made in 1993, some of which I piloted through the Seanad when the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, was not available.  When the Industrial Policy Review Group chaired by Mr. Jim Culliton reported at that <Col N="1695" /> time it did not examine the accountability of Government Ministers in relation to the activities of those agencies. It was not within its remit; perhaps it should have been.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that additional information is not available to the Oireachtas and the public on the work of IDA Ireland and other State agencies.  As often pointed out by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, I am not suggesting that sensitive information should be furnished.  Nonetheless, an amount of detailed information on projects is held in the Department of Enterprise and Employment and other Government Departments which should be released and which would not prejudice the ability of IDA Ireland to attract industry here.  Information that should be furnished relates to the operations of companies locating here and all the grants available to them.  At present the IDA Ireland annual reports give information only on the grants paid within that year, which might comprise a small instalment of a total grant.  I strongly believe if such information were given on the signing of contracts it would not prejudice the work of IDA Ireland.</P>
    <P>Because of the failure of the 1993 and earlier Acts to make greater provision for accountability, I propose that such accountability provisions be included in this Bill, in respect of which I will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Dáil committee structure should be amended to provide for the attendance of executives from IDA agencies before them and to furnish relevant information.  I understand that would be their wish but, before doing so, various Government Ministers must make a decision to free up such executives, allowing them to furnish relevant information which would help to direct industrial policy, thus guiding legislators and others in determining the value of money for the vast amounts of money being expended.  That can be done in various ways.  While not suggesting that we should establish another public <Col N="1696" /> expenditure committee. IDA Ireland and other State agencies could appear, for example, before the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies, for which there is already a precedent, as pointed out by the Minister, when in Opposition, when he was very much more scathing of IDA Ireland than I would ever consider appropriate. Therefore, I hope he will view amendments I table in the light of the much greater quantity of information I want provided to the public and this House than is the case at present.</P>
    <P>Committees have already been given powers to call for persons, papers and records from various bodies and to summon appointees to high office which, theoretically, could allow the chairmen and chief executives of the industrial promotion agencies to appear before them.  However, such appearance would be useless since they are bound by confidentiality clauses specified in legislation and regulations.  Since this can be regarded as innocuous information, such agencies should be freed from ridiculous gags on their operations and a Government decision taken to allow them to furnish as much information as possible.  For example, the Department of Enterprise and Employment has direct computer links to IDA Ireland, Forbairt and Forfás, which provides the Department with important detail much of which can and should be furnished to the public and Members.  It must be remembered that we are talking about taxpayers' money, rather than of any Government of the day.</P>
    <P>Whenever I raise an issue on an Adjournment Debate or by way of Private Notice Question, I am constantly irritated that the Minister always begins by saying: &ldquo;We must all be very careful on this occasion lest rash words might have the effect of A, B, C, or D&rdquo;. That is wrong.  While one should have due regard to the sensitivities of any given set of circumstances and have trust in the knowledge and expertise of an Opposition spokesperson, regardless of his or her party affiliation, we are entitled to such information.  Indeed I <Col N="1697" /> have a litany of answers furnished by the Minister detailing reasons he could not furnish me with information I sought.</P>
    <P>While aware that the Taoiseach said people had not asked the right question, advancing that as the reason they had not received the correct answer, I have endeavoured to pose questions in so many varied ways, yet the answer always is: &ldquo;I am precluded from discussing this matter&rdquo;.  Yet the information I seek is that which should readily be available to any citizen.</P>
    <P>IDA Ireland is a State-sponsored body that does not have an accounting officer.  Under our present legislative provisions, accounting officers are Secretaries of Departments who appear before the Committee of Public Accounts and others to furnish them with information.  If the system were amended, rendering IDA Ireland a fully fledged semi-State body &mdash; under which it would receive a grant from the Department of Finance instead of forming part of the Vote of the Department of Enterprise and Employment &mdash; it would have an accounting officer for such purpose.  Therefore, the chief executive officers of the industrial promotion agencies must be freed up by ministerial decisions.</P>
    <P>An example of the important information required is in figures relating to job realisation rates.  Each month IDA Ireland, or rather Government Ministers on its behalf, announces large numbers of new jobs but, several years after, we are never aware whether they have been delivered.  When one asks whether they have or whether there has been any financial clawback because of employment targets not having been achieved, invariably the reply is that that information is confidential between the industrial agency and the relevant company and cannot be released.  I do not know why.</P>
    <P>Under the new reporting structures IDA Ireland and Forbairt will, through Forfás, furnish annual reports merely on net jobs and gross figures whereas it would be valuable to know how many <Col N="1698" /> such earlier announcements turned to ashes.  While such information would be sad at least such action would be more realistic and leave everybody more fully informed.</P>
    <P>It would be helpful to know which companies create the greatest number of jobs and those that shed jobs each year.  I have now received that information which has not been made available previously.  If I have time at the end of my contribution, I will read the names of those firms into the record. This information should be made available to everyone.  It is not sensitive or commercially damaging but it is important.</P>
    <P>Under the new legislation introduced in 1993, there are to be three-yearly reviews not just of industrial policy.  That should be done on a yearly basis and it will be the substance of one of the amendments I will be tabling on Committee Stage.  Technology allows rapid analyses of statistics and such data should be available each December rather than at the end of a three-year period.  That would help the development of a responsive and focussed industrial policy.  Without those annual reviews, we are all working in the dark. Yearly reviews would also encourage greater political accountability because at the end of a three-year period the Government may have left office and, therefore, would not be accountable.  A new Minister may say the review was not his or her responsibility.  If the review was undertaken on an annual basis, there would be greater accountability and availability of information.</P>
    <P>It is 26 years since the IDA and the various industrial agencies came into being in one form or another and it is time we had greater accountability and information available to us.  This is the 1990s, not the 1960s, and while we hear much about the wonders of technology, they have not had an effect in Government Departments.  There seems to be a type of culture in individual Departments to make available as little information as possible, and in saying that I <Col N="1699" /> do not exclude ourselves.  I do not know why that is the case because when we are talking about job creation targets, it is vital that we know whether the figures being bandied about are accurate.  If large numbers of jobs are announced, it is important for us to know whether those jobs are realised, if money is given back to the State in the clawback to which I referred and, if not, why not.  It is important to know also if we are engaging in employment promotion in the wrong areas.  Such data would be very useful.</P>
    <P>Part of this Bill has come about because of the difficulties in Shannon Aerospace.  I endorse the efforts made by the Minister to support jobs but I am greatly concerned about his reluctance to provide information in relation to the deal that has been signed with Shannon Aerospace shareholders.  The Minister has declined to give information about the grant clawback.  He has also declined to say why the other shareholders in Shannon Aerospace are unwilling to put up equity along with the State.  The Exchequer has put up £35 million for Shannon Aerospace and while that is worthy because it will provide employment in the mid-west, greater detail should be made available on that expenditure, the deal that has been signed and the arrangements which I read about in <i>The Irish Times</i> in regard to German workers.</P>
    <P>While this legislation is welcome because it rectifies serious problems which emerged in the legislation governing the dividing of the original IDA into three bodies, I have some concerns. What is the motivation for this legislation? Is there a plan to dispense with Forfás?  The Minister praised Forfás but I particularly want to praise the chief executive, Mr. John Travers.  In my dealings with him at the Department of Enterprise and Employment I found him to be a man of fine ability coupled with an entrepreneurial spirit and a social conscience.  The Minister referred to Forfás in an odd manner.  He seemed to be hinting at something and I would <Col N="1700" /> like to know if there is some intention to diminish the responsibilities of Forfás in the future or even to have it abolished. It appears there is a move to give greater powers to Forbairt and IDA Ireland.  I would like the Minister, when replying, to give an explanation for those changes.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that section 3 gives back to the IDA the power to hold and acquire property.  Since the split, the IDA could not offer an integrated package combining finance, buildings and land and investors had to go to another agency.  Such toing and froing is not helpful.  I welcome the section but it should be extended further than is proposed in the Bill and I will be tabling an amendment to that effect.  The property and lands now in the hands of Forfás should be transferred to the IDA and Forbairt.  The IDA and Forbairt should have explicit powers to enter into mutual arrangements with the private sector to provide land and buildings and to enter into financial arrangements to secure the development sought.  The lack of buildings and land is becoming a severe constraint on IDA Ireland in particular.</P>
    <P>Some years ago, many so-called &ldquo;advance factories&rdquo; lay derelict and were subsequently vandalised.  As a result, those factories were rendered useless. That approach to the building of factories was incorrect.  Perhaps it was born out of heady optimism.  We all thought the behind every bush in Ireland there was an American, a Japanese or a Chinese investor waiting to offer us huge sums of money to build factories for which they were getting huge grants in return.  We have grown up since those days and we know we must fight to attract firms in the international market.</P>
    <P>The decision was made to put an end to the building of advance factories, I am not sure by whom.  That decision, however, went a little too far.  We now have a situation where there are almost no advance factories and that is wrong. Such unoccupied buildings cost a lot of money in terms of security but there must be some way they can be leased <Col N="1701" /> by the IDA.  It should be able to attract investors to, say, Athlone which has good employment prospects, a very good workforce and all the relevant infrastructure, telecommunications and third level institutions.  The IDA could woo investors and show them these unused buildings in which their firm could be located.  Such ideas should be considered.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that section 4 might create more bureaucracy.  It gives powers to Forfás to order a switch of shares in the IDA and Forbairt.  Surely the IDA and Forbairt can agree this between themselves rather than having it put into law.  Are there high walls around these agencies?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I speak of metaphorical walls, not physical ones.  Are there high walls of misunderstanding and alienation between the agencies?  I hear stories of two branches of Forbairt and the IDA set up in the one building who are engaged in turf warfare of a politically ferocious kind as to who answers the phone for whom, whose post goes into which pigeon hole and who answers queries on subjects that are the province of another.  That is just plain silly.  If they are engaged in getting much needed jobs into this country, surely there is no room for preciousness about putting one's foot on another's turf.</P>
      <P>Although the Minister says there are no current proposals to set up subsidiaries under section 5, perhaps he would clarify what types of subsidiary he has in mind.  He said earlier:</P>
      <P>The Bill proposes in section 5 an enabling power to allow Forfás, Forbairt or IDA Ireland to establish subsidiaries. While there is no proposal to set up specific subsidiaries at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>I would bet the idea is lurking in somebody's mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;there are areas of activity, <Col N="1702" /> particularly in regard to Forbairt, that may in future be considered more appropriate to be carried on outside the mainstream of the agency concerned.</P>
    <P>County enterprise boards have been a success.  The Department and the Minister have been slow to give them proper funding.  They have been slow to loosen the apron strings.  However, these boards are now taking up what was previously regarded as being of too small a nature to come within the ambit of the IDA or Forbairt.  The executives in those agencies were accustomed to thinking in megabucks so that the man or woman who approached them with a modest proposal requiring modest funding, etc. was not greeted with alacrity by the IDA or Forbairt.  However, county enterprise boards were receptive to small businesses and were active at parish, county and community level.  What has happened now is that more turf wars have sprung up between Forbairt and county enterprise boards.  Forbairt is now realising that there is much activity within the county enterprise areas and wants to get in on the action.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there are areas of activity, particularly in relation to Forbairt, that may in future be considered more appropriate to be carried on outside the mainstream of the agency concerned. We now have county enterprise boards, Forbairt, FÁS, IDA Ireland, county leadership teams, social welfare back to work schemes, subsidisation schemes, etc.  Will other agencies be set up under Forbairt on a regional and county basis?  It appears Forbairt wants to get in on the action of county enterprise boards.  I suggest that they forget the idea of setting up more subsidiaries and concentrate on the remit laid out in the 1993 legislation.  This section contains just the kind of proposal I do not like to see in legislation. It betokens that deep in somebody's mind &mdash; I rather think an executive mind talking to civil servants &mdash; is the idea that this should be included in the legislation so that they can plough <Col N="1703" /> ahead and set up whatever they want without having to answer questions from the Opposition or be accountable.</P>
    <P>The provision in section 10 to give legal powers to the county enterprise boards to give loans is welcome.  The boards have been starved of resources and of power since their establishment. I know from my time in the Department of Enterprise and Employment that they were on a wing and a prayer as to when, how and where they would get their money.  Some would argue that they are an unnecessary duplication in the industrial promotions services, but if they are to exist they should be given the power to give loans.  Loans represent a better option for the county enterprise boards than grants.</P>
    <P>County enterprise officers have told me they want to do away with the grant mentality and have the chance to put their money towards the subsidisation of loans at a fixed rate of interest for a decent length of time so that people putting money into a business will have security rather than having to cope with vacillating interest rates on the open market.  Grants induce the feeling that everything will be fine, but when the efficacy of the grant wears off one is still in the same situation.  Grants often force the promoter of a project to spend a corresponding or a greater amount to achieve the grant.  This is not always satisfactory.  Loans concentrate the mind of the promoter as he must get his business up and running in order to repay the loan.  Loan powers for county enterprise boards represent a more focused approach.</P>
    <P>County enterprise boards could be further strengthened by giving them flexibility to give moratoriums on repayments for the first year of a new business or subsidies by way of interest relief.  In general the county enterprise boards need to be given greater resources and their work needs to be given greater priority by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister made much play of employment.  I wish the same intensity of effort were given to unemployment as is given to employment.  When the <Col N="1704" /> economic forecasts indicate that all is rosy, so to speak, I imagine that there is all over Ireland a weariness about reading another set of rosy statistics which mean nothing to the long term unemployed man or woman who wonders if there is any reason for getting out of bed.  It is alarming that there are now 134,000 long term unemployed people, 51 per cent of whom are in the Dublin and greater Dublin areas.  That is a huge statistice, and we hide behind it and say it is terrible.  However, each person among that number is a person with hopes and aspirations now dimmed, perhaps with a family, with self-confidence slipping and assurance long gone as the length of time of unemployment grows.</P>
    <P>The Minister has set up his unit and there are excellent people in charge of it.  He has set certain targets, but he has not set number targets for the long term unemployed.  Although the percentage rate has gone down, there is an increase of 1,000 people from 1 November to 30 April this year who are long term unemployed.  That period is mostly within the term of the present Government. We did not pay intensive attention to unemployment.  The buzz word was entrepreneur.  It was as if everyone was caught up in the good ship enterprise.  The mates on the good ship employment did not receive the same degree of social concern as did those on the entrepreneur ship.  They can co-exist but it requires hard work.  The ESRI reports state that we must give political thought and direction to the problem of long term unemployment.  The lives of thousands of people will be blighted because this and previous Governments did not attend to the problem.  We said the rising boat would lift everyone but it is not doing so as recent statistics show.</P>
    <P>I will take the opportunity on Committee Stage to refer to the number of firms who created jobs and the number that lost them.  It will make salutary reading and it has a distinct bearing on the point I made about hyped-up job announcements that amount to dashed hopes.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give information to the House and not hide behind <Col N="1705" /> phrases such as &ldquo;it would be incorrect to do so&rdquo;; &ldquo;my hands are tied&rdquo;; &ldquo;it is confidential&rdquo;; &ldquo;it is sensitive and I cannot disclose it&rdquo;.  We are fed up with that. This Government was supposed to be all things to all people.  It was to be open and transparent.  This was to be practised every second of every day.  I have a file of replies that state: &ldquo;I cannot give the information&rdquo;; &ldquo;I am precluded from giving the information&rdquo;; &ldquo;I cannot disclose the information&rdquo;.  I want the information to formulate policy.  Public money is given to employment agencies and the public have a right to know if targets are realised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the Bill gives us a brief opportunity to consider industrial policy as it stands in the mid-1990s, three years after the Culliton report.  At this juncture, policy is in a confused and fragmented state.  The various agencies are in a mess and constantly complaining.  Both the letter and the spirit of the Culliton review group's report have been abandoned.  The vision which Culliton and his colleagues had and expressed so articulately is cast aside in favour of short term expediency and pressure response.</P>
      <P>As is usual with industrial development Bills, this Bill largely confines itself to making recommendations about agencies as if they were the be all and end all of industrial policy.  Although Culliton states on page 59 that &ldquo;the activities of the agencies are now less significant for industrial performance&rdquo;, on page 77 he states that &ldquo;industrial policy interventions need to be delivered in a more integrated and cost effective manner&rdquo;.  Neither of these recommendations is met by the Bill.  On the contrary, the Government choose to go in the opposite direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Culliton recommended in Chapter 9 that we should have one overseas agency and one domestic agency, for the good reason that overseas promotion is different from indigenous development. We have an extraordinary proliferation <Col N="1706" /> of agencies as set out in the 1993 Act and copperfastened in this Bill.  Where Culliton recommended two, we have 40 statutory agencies directly involved in the promotion of industrial development.</P>
    <P>Having served approximately eight years as Minister for Industry and Commerce I am the most experienced surviving holder of that office.  With the benefit of that experience I can say with confidence that this proliferation of agencies is sheer lunacy.  The 40 agencies are made up of 35 separate county enterprise boards each with its own board and chief executive and each competing with the others plus the IDA, Forfás, Forbairt, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta.  In addition, I am informed by the Department that we have 33 area partnership boards which, in some respect, are like county enterprise boards.  On top of that we have various marketing boards which should be included under Forbairt but which are autonomous.  These include ABT, An Bord Bia and BIM.  There is at least one important non-statutory board in An Bord Bainne.  So far we are at 77 and still counting.</P>
    <P>Among our national blessings I have not yet counted FÁS.  It is truly something special.  Its greatest problem is it cannot spend all the generous funds it gets every year from Irish and European taxpayers.  However, it must get full marks for trying.  There is almost nothing on which FÁS has not spent money.  It outdoes Gay Byrne &mdash; it does not just have something for everyone in the audience but for everyone in the country.</P>
    <P>Another jewel among our national treasures is the Irish Productivity Centre. Some years ago, I suggested it might consider dissolving itself or at least operating without public funds but I was not successful because I see the House was asked today to almost double the IPC's grant-in-aid for this year.  It is clearly determined to maintain itself, to what purpose I am not clear.</P>
    <P>In giving this list, where we reach almost 80, I have not dealt with the Leader groups and boards which would bring the total to over 100.  I fail to see <Col N="1707" /> why in a rural area we need the Leader group in parallel with the county enterprise board.  I would have thought the Leader group would be the appropriate body to carry out these functions. This alphabet soup of endless agencies for every conceivable economic and semi-economic purpose can be perceived to have at least one advantage: the job creation industry is thriving. There are so many thousands of people employed in creating jobs for others that the job creation industry is now bigger than many sectors of real industry.</P>
    <P>Our priorities are topsy-turvy.  Our fundamental thinking is woolly and unfocused.  We are obsessed with more and more boards and agencies using public moneys and State subsidies to create artificial, make way jobs.  This unreal, shadowy, quasi-economic activity takes precedence over real value adding wealth creating jobs and activities.</P>
    <P>Our national statistics on unemployment and GNP are dubious.  Most of us know that but we are expected to nod, wink and pat ourselves on the back for doing a great job.  It should be remembered that when published in January 1992 the Culliton report received almost universal welcome and considerable acclaim both at home and abroad.</P>
    <P>For someone who cares about Irish industrial development and the level of unemployment which has continued to grow since then, I find it distressing that we should turn our back on something we know is right.  While I believe that the Culliton philosophy is right I am not so attached to it that I would be unwilling to try something else if it worked. However, since 1992 we have seen a steadfast refusal to implement the report and a deterioration rather than an improvement in our unemployment position.  It is important to remember also that while most of the national debate about industrial policy, particularly on Bills such as this, tends to revolve around agencies and their powers and jurisdictions, the Culliton group saw agencies as being rather less important than the broader considerations of policy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1708" /> It is worth looking at some of the chapter headings in the Culliton report, such as &ldquo;It is time to change important aspects in the national approach to industrial policy&rdquo; and &ldquo;It is time for the Government to take the hard political decisions needed for a decisive reform of the taxation system&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Irish educational and training system has serious gaps when it comes to technical and vocational education&rdquo;.  Although lip service has been paid by successive Governments to these principles, none of them has been implemented.  By far the most important is the question of personal taxation which, at our levels, is a huge disincentive to work and a penal imposition which acts as a severe discouragement to enterprise and economic activity.  It drives up payroll and other costs and it damages competitiveness.</P>
    <P>We are now no better off in terms of personal taxation than we were at the end of 1992.  In some respects, it could be argued that we are worse off.  More importantly, there is an obvious lack of commitment or political will to do anything meaningful about personal taxation. All calls for reform are declined by successive Ministers for Finance who continue to underwrite and perpetuate a system that is universally regarded as crazy.</P>
    <P>This is where the real disappointment lies.  It lies not just in the mess that has been made of the agencies, but in the unwillingness of successive Governments to take a global, comprehensive view of the need to co-ordinate policies for the purposes of industrial and business development and genuine employment creation.  The departmental ethos and the jurisdictional jealousies with which we must contend are stifling us and are preventing progress.  Culliton said: &ldquo;It is the time for change, time to recognise that borrowing for short term gain has a huge price tag in terms of high taxation to pay the interest bill&rdquo;. That lesson has not been learned.  We have resolutely refused to change over the past three years.</P>
    <P>This year our public expenditure will increase by nearly 10 per cent.  We have mucked around with a totally unsuitable <Col N="1709" /> and penal tax system and a fiscal regime that is unnecessarily negative in its effects.  We have refused to insist on adequate infrastructure and competitive utilities.  I repeat the message given, not for the first time, by Deputy Harney to this House earlier today when she spoke on the Estimates.  She pointed out that, based on figures supplied by the Department of Finance, a married man with four children needs more than £15,000 per year before it is worth his while to give up the dole.  In certain circumstances, the take home pay of such a man is actually greater if he earns £6,000 less.</P>
    <P>With regard to the lack of competitive utilities, we protect State utilities at all costs even though we know that they are over-manned, inefficient and damaging to our national interests and our prospects of successful job creation.  The interest of the utility and of its employers is always paramount; the national interest or the public need is secondary.  With a list of such problems &mdash; which we have resolutely refused to confront let alone solve &mdash; a Bill such as this is of little importance or value and is no substitute for real action.</P>
    <P>I am doubtful about the proposals to put the county enterprise boards on a statutory basis.  The thrust of the Culliton report was to confine grant giving power.  Under the arrangement proposed in section 10 these grant giving powers are hugely extended to a large number of additional agencies and there is almost no activity that they cannot assist.  We badly need to try to kill the grant aid mentality with which this country is infected and afflicted. However, the proposals in this Bill will foster this mentality rather than diminish it.  We could do away with the plethora of grants and other assistance that the State is forced to give to economic activity of nearly every kind if we had a sensible taxation system.  We are caught in a vicious circle already because, in order to compensate for our penal levels of taxation, we must spend more and more public money which in turn requires more taxation to raise it.  We must break that circle.  Not alone does this Bill not break it, it strengthens it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1710" /> I am also doubtful about the power of investment proposed in section 6, where agencies are empowered to invest in funds rather than in specific companies. As this section is drafted, there can be no proper accountability for the moneys so invested.  Up to now agencies had to account for each investment or grant they gave and it was possible to form a judgment on whether it was successful. I agree with Deputy O'Rourke's comments on the lack of accountability on the part of the Minister and the Department <i>vis-á-vis</i> this House.  Under this Bill &mdash; if it is enacted as drafted &mdash; it will be possible for the Minister to come to the Dáil and say, in reply to questions, that he has no responsibility or he can have the questions disallowed on that basis.  That is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I also agree with Deputy O'Rourke's attitude to the question of information. I have a high regard for the former Department of Industry and Commerce but I remind myself that it is the same Department in which a senior official commended, in writing, a junior official for confusing a Deputy and preventing him obtaining the facts.  The wide powers to form subsidiaries and to operate through them should be carefully examined because of the unhappy experience the Department has had with one agency circumventing controls and limits by forming subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>Several provisions in the Bill seek to rectify mistakes made in the 1993 Act. That Act was the result of a Bill rushed through this House just before the summer recess that year which was not properly examined or debated.  Various points must be made on the detail of the Bill on Committee Stage and I will reserve those comments until then.</P>
    <P>Overall, one must take the view that the Bill is of little value.  It tinkers with a system which is fundamentally flawed. It makes permanent and statutory the proliferation and multiplication of agencies that is totally at variance with what was recommended.  It locks us into a bureaucratic nightmare.  It ignores the real problems and implies that unemployment <Col N="1711" /> can be solved by a combination of public spending and evergrowing bureaucracy.  It adopts the philosophy that if one has a problem one sets up a board and splashes out large dollops of public money.  That philosophy is fatally flawed.  The approach to industrial development and job creation that is encapsulated in this Bill is, therefore, fatally flawed.  By spreading public money everwhere, as this Bill envisages, for almost any purpose rather than fostering industrial clusters around niches of national competitive advantage we will perpetuate failure and an uncompetitive approach.</P>
    <P>We should remember that, for the last quarter century, Northern Ireland was not effectively a potential base for normal industrial investment, except of a limited nature.  It is now a competitor.  It has many substantial advantages over us.  It will erode our industrial base unless we make the necessary changes to prevent that.  Personal taxation and lower costs are its principal advantages. We must remind ourselves once again of the patent truth of the statement in the Culliton report about tax reform: &ldquo;In no other single area does the Government have at its disposal the tools to make as far-reaching and effective a reform to support an enterprise economy as in taxation&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Malley's analysis of the Bill is at variance with what is in it.  He suggested that we have a fundamentally flawed system of support.  The background to the establishment of Forbairt and the IDA was the Culliton report.  I was not privy to the various altercations that resulted in the establishment of three bodies &mdash; Forfás, Forbairt and the IDA &mdash; but Forfás has not been a failure.  I would have shared the Deputy's misgivings that it was not wise to establish three bodies when two were recommended.  I would also have shared some of the other concerns about the structure.  Forfás has brought analytic capacity to industrial policy which perhaps the Department should rightfully have had, <Col N="1712" /> but nonetheless there is ongoing creative policy thinking by Forfás.  It is well led by the present chief executive officer and dynamic chairman and it contributes considerably to new thinking in our approach to industrial policy. I do not agree it is an unmitigated disaster and that we are on a huge spending spree that is contrary to the national interest.</P>
      <P>It is very easy to lampoon county enterprise or area partnership initiatives and suggest they are a waste of money. However the Deputy's party as well as other parties have continuously lamented the extreme centralisation of our Administration and our unwillingness to devolve power to local areas where people may make decisions about their future.  In partnership companies local unions, employers and the local community address problems such as long term unemployment and give people who are far from the large State agencies and the established financial sector a chance to respond to their economic challenges.  Based on the experience of groups such as the North-side Partnership, they are of value.</P>
      <P>I had the opportunity to visit the Deputy's city where I saw some of the work of the Limerick County Enterprise Board which identifies how Limerick can respond to the economic challenges facing it.  It gave 23 fledgling businesses an opportunity to sell their wares to a much wider public.  The development agencies also offered a one stop shop, for which people had appealed.  A change of attitude to enterprise development is being nurtured through the local schools there and the enterprise board deserves an opportunity to prove itself.  It is easy to dismiss local initiatives but many of them are adding value to their areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is determined to evaluate closely the work of these bodies and ensure they provide value for taxpayer's money.  We are committed to evaluating their performance.  If the Deputy visits some of these boards and reads their plans, he will realise they are genuinely trying to assist their areas to respond to the strategic challenges facing them.  Answers will never be found <Col N="1713" /> in the IDA or Forbairt alone, or in national agencies or Departments.  We need to extend to local groups the opportunity to shape their own future.  I will certainly give them the benefit of the doubt.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill we are moving away from the idea of grant giving bodies who dole out money for feasibility or capital investment.  We are providing that they be more flexible, that they consider soft supports such as giving advice, introduce initiatives such as the PLATO scheme to network training opportunities for small businesses and give loans instead of grants.  Many of the Border counties who have had access to loan funding through the IFI have been extremely successful in getting businesses off the ground at a lower cost to the Exchequer.  We are giving legal recognition to bodies that have been established for a considerable time and giving them powers to make them more effective in their work.</P>
    <P>One may say that the other provisions in this Bill are amendments to measures introduced in haste in 1993.  Nonetheless they are sensible.  It is sensible that Forbairt and the IDA should have the right to buy and sell land and to hold shares and we should respond to the needs of SFADCo which is a successful agency. Even the Deputy, in his great thrust for rationalisation, would not suggest that body be abolished.</P>
    <P>I agree with some of Deputy O'Rourke's comments about accountability. Changes have been made, but a distinction must be drawn between individual projects.  To publish information on negotiations between the IDA or Forbairt and management about weaknesses in the company or recommendations about support or developments, to give away the IDA or Forbairt's negotiating hand in their approach to foreign companies would be treading on the commercial confidentiality of the company and on its competitiveness in attracting foreign industry.  There are many important aspects that must be confidential, but on the other hand, there has been a tendency to exaggerate what is truly confidential.</P>
    <P>The Deputy was critical that the IDA <Col N="1714" /> gives information only on grants it pays out rather than on prospective grants, but to do that would be to disclose its negotiating terms.  If the company disclosed the claw-back clauses that will be applied it would be publishing its negotiating package, and it would be very difficult to go down that road.  There are many ways of improving information dissemination and the Deputy made an interesting suggestion about providing information on companies that are increasing employment over target and I would have no difficulty with that.  The IDA and Forbairt recognise that in terms of overall accounting they should provide that information.  The net cost of a job is based on sustained employment. Companies produce net figures for employment and no longer publish job approvals as the basis of their targets.</P>
    <P>Job approval numbers are not now published, instead each year the target for first time jobs on the ground is published. The net change in employment figures is also published.  It provides on an aggregate basis the type of information the Deputy seeks.  The Deputy is seeking similar information on the 6,000 Forbairt and the 1,000 IDA companies. Clearly, the problem arising from that request is providing a data bank on 7,000 companies each year.  It would have to be considered whether that is feasible but perhaps in the era of the Internet it is simpler than we might have thought.</P>
    <P>Deputies raised the question of the accountability of the IDA, Forbairt and such agencies to Oireachtas committees. My Department is certainly not restraining the Dáil from deciding that committees should have the right to assess the work of the IDA and Forbairt. I certainly would have no misgivings about having such agencies answerable to Oireachtas committees if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or the House decides that is the way to proceed.  I was a member of the Committee of Public Accounts some years ago when the IDA, as it then was, appeared before it and that was clearly done with the support of the Department.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1715" /> The Deputy raised the question of annual industrial reviews.  There is merit in providing annual information as the IDA does, but to undertake a serious review of policy each year runs the risk of tilting the balance between review and assessment and implementation too far in the direction of bureaucratic information gathering instead of getting on with a job.  A balance has to be struck.  I think the time would be absorbed in meeting the target of a review rather than in developing and applying policies.  There will be differences of opinion.  It is going too far to have annual reviews and the three-year review strikes the right balance.</P>
    <P>The Deputy raised concerns about a hidden agenda to disband Forfás.  There is no such hidden agenda but we are clarifying its role.  It was never intended that Forfás would be the exclusive holder of preference shareholding that Forbairt or the IDA might issue.  Forfás will concentrate on its intended role of focusing on policy development and coordinating the bodies that comprise it such as FÁS and An Bord Tráchtála.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Rourke and O'Malley raised the issue of subsidiaries and clearly these will have to be closely scrutinised. I agree that we should not be spawning subsidiaries at a great rate but there are situations where subsidiaries might be justified.  In the case of technical tasks such as metrology or some such task assigned to Forbairt which is not in its mainstream interface with companies there might be a justifiable reason for saying they could be handled by a subsidiary.</P>
    <P>A sensible proposal is the development of seed and venture funds as a way in which Forbairt could develop and in this Bill we are moving away from simple grant aid to individual companies to the idea that Forbairt would enter into joint ventures with the financial institutions to provide seed or venture funds.  That would be a good development and I look forward to seeing the type of proposal that will come forward. <Col N="1716" /> Already there is a number of such initiatives under way, one in relation to the softwear industry which is commanding considerable support.  It has the capacity to ensure that good softwear ideas coming from young talented people at university are developed in Ireland with Irish seed capital instead of running the risk of successfully developing them only if there is a foreign multinational partner willing to develop them further overseas. There are equity gaps in these types of funds and there is a need to fill the equity gap between the gilt edge companies that can gain easy access to equity and smaller companies that find it harder to access funds.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the broad thrust of Deputies' contributions and I look forward to the Committee Stage debate when we can deal with the Bill in more detail.</P>
