      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy McDaid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a knee-jerk reaction to the unfortunate happenings in Tokyo recently as I tabled a question for an oral reply to the Minister for the Marine some three weeks ago.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I seek leave under Standing Order 30 to move the <Col N="2" /> Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss a matter of grave importance, namely, the fact that the British Ministry of Defence has admitted for the first time that hundreds of thousands of tonnes of chemical weapons and poison gas were dumped off the Donegal coast.  It has admitted that 3,500 tonnes of 23 pound artillery shells containing mustard gas, tabrun and sarin nerve gas were dumped in sealed containers &mdash; that is, one foot of concrete &mdash; over the side of British vessels about 30 miles off the Donegal coast.  This is but the tip of the iceberg in terms of the information that is available to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matter fully I do not consider it to be one contemplated by the <Col N="3" /> Standing Order and, therefore, I cannot grant leave to move the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take No. 9.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that the proceedings on Second Stage of No. 9 shall be brought to a conclusion at 4.30 p.m. today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business yesterday I raised the question of the local loans fund.  I thank the Minister for Finance for making his officials available to finally clarify the matter: that there has been no sale, that no ingenious financial methods have been adopted, that it constitutes straight public sector borrowing.  This marks a cynical change having regard to what was announced here last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to facilitate the Leader of the main Opposition party but he must have regard to what is appropriate at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should control himself; the Government is shuffling paper money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Byrne had any interest in the exchange rate policy of the Minister for Finance he would not follow that line.  It appears that we have only seen two or three Bills since the Christmas break.  Will the Taoiseach outline the Bills that will be published before Easter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already given the Opposition a tabular statement setting out various elements of the Government's legislative programme and the approximate timings for the introduction of this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge that we received a list of 49 Bills of which we have seen only two.  As we approach the Easter recess this is not of much benefit. I can arrange for 49 of my colleagues to ask the Taoiseach question after question each morning but that would be a waste of his time and mine.  During the weekend will he produce an updated list?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>He should list them in order of priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The list provided to the Opposition is a serious one and we are proceeding in the normal way.  All legislation has to be approved and the heads formed.  It is then drafted, approved by the Cabinet and circulated. All the items on the list are proceeding through this process in the normal way. There is nothing unusual about this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there should be a continued argument about this matter which can be clarified in so many other ways.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me ask the Taoiseach about a Bill which I know was ready last November.  When will the Bill providing for the privilege and compellability of witnesses be circulated?  He <Col N="5" /> told me in January that it would be circulated within a fortnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If that Bill was ready last November it would have been introduced but it was not ready.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the implications for the appointment of the Judiciary and the training of judges when will the Courts and Court Officers Bill be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, that Bill is before the House at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When I asked the Taoiseach about this previously he said the Government was considering the Bill with a view to bringing forward amendments. Has the Government considered the amendments and when will we see the Bill in the form the Government wishes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is on the Order Paper.  If the Deputy is not satisfied about this, she should table a question to the Minister for Justice.  She will then obtain information as to when those amendments are likely to be available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach prioritise the 49 items of legislation on the list because on Tuesday the Tánaiste indicated at a meeting of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body that the transfer of prisoners legislation would be published within two months.  The next day the Taoiseach told the House that it would be published within one month.  Which statement is correct? <Col N="6" /> What are the Taoiseach's priorities for legislation to the end of this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy undoubtedly understands, those statements are consistent, one month is within two months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach tell us whether the juvenile justice Bill will be published before Easter?  I note that additional custodial places have been provided today for juveniles and while that is a key component it is only a small part of what needs to be put in place to tackle the problems of juvenile crime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Quill for her persistence in this matter but when she raised it in the House two weeks ago I told her that the incoming Government was amazed to discover what little work had been done by the outgoing Government on the juvenile justice Bill.  This Bill was at a very early stage of preparation when we came into office and, unfortunately, there is no chance of it being ready before Easter.</P>

      <P>Before concluding my speech last night I referred to the carer's allowance.  Most of us appreciate the changes in carer's allowance in this year's Social Welfare Bill.  The allowance has been modified taking into account the financial circumstances of applicants and this will give further encouragement to carers.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome what the Minister has tried to achieve for people on social welfare, particularly the long term unemployed.  At last we are trying to determine the skills and knowledge of those people to assess their potential opportunities for employment.  Too often in the past many of these people, in order to depress the unemployment statistics were put into job schemes in which they had no interest and in many cases to which they were not suited. There is now a much more responsible approach to those schemes.  FÁS schemes dovetail with the social welfare objective of trying to induce people to return to employment.  They have had a great impact in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Limerick County Council area 100 people are employed in the Community Enterprise Development Programme to work on projects such as improving roads and their work is much <Col N="12" /> appreciated.  The big issue in rural Ireland at present is the condition of the roads.</P>
    <P>There are many good elements in the Social Welfare Bill, particularly the further increases made.  I am particularly pleased that Deputy Durkan is the Minister of State in the Department of Social Welfare because for many years he spearheaded the causes in social welfare.  He has close affinity with the social welfare scene and fully understands it.  I have no doubt he will call on his experience in running the Department efficiently.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare has a tremendous impact on public representatives. In many cases we are thrust into the role of facilitator because many people do not understand the complex regulations and social welfare schemes.  Will the Minister ensure that the social welfare system is made more user friendly?  It is time to get rid of the gobbledegook particularly in assessing criteria for eligibility for schemes.  On occasion I have become confused about the means testing system and I can understand the confusion of the ordinary people when seeking their rights. If the Minister makes the system more user friendly he will do much to benefit social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>I have great praise for the staff in the Department of Social Welfare whom I contact on a daily basis.  They are concerned about the people who avail of the social welfare system.  This is one Department that has been brought into the 21st century in terms of computerisation and other improvements down the years.</P>
    <P>Significant improvements have been made to social welfare offices around the country and in many cases new premises have been built.  Changes have also been made in regard to signing on. In many cases, instead of going to the social welfare office people sign on at the local post office.  Quite often people have to queue in small post office premises whereas greater use could be made of the larger social welfare offices.  Will the Minister consider making better use <Col N="13" /> of large social welfare offices?  Many of the changes that have taken place in simplifying the social welfare system are very desirable and worth while and we welcome them.  The stigma once attached to drawing social welfare is long since gone and the changes made are in the interests of the consumer.</P>
    <P>In the past I raised the question of county boundaries as it relates to this matter.  People from the western half of County Limerick have to cross the border to County Kerry for health and social welfare assistance even though there is a modern social welfare office in Newcastle West.  Perhaps that is due to the geography of the area, but if the Department is serious about the one stop facility which it advocates, it should consider this matter and the confusion caused when people must get advice from different offices I cannot give specifics in this regard but it is a matter I have raised with Department officials in the past.  In the case of the social welfare office in Newcastle West with which I am familiar, greater use should be made of that modern building.  Many people who have to go outside the county for assistance could be facilitated in those premises.  Perhaps there are logistics involved and it is not feasible, but as a local politician I would like to deal with constituents inquiries within my county. In our work as politicians we have much contact with local social welfare officers. We develop a rapport with these officials and appreciate the work they do and the advice they give.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKenny" hpid="Mr. S. Kenny Mr. S. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 20 years since the late Frank Cluskey, the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, introduced fundamental reforms of the social welfare system.  He introduced new benefits for lone parents and other categories of recipients who had been outside the system for a very long time.  There are further improvements in this year's budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a number of years from 1987 onwards there was a slight rowing back on improvements made during the years, for example, increases were paid <Col N="14" /> at a later commencement date.  For the first time since then the increases this year will take effect from early to mid-June. I welcome the reversal of this trend which affects the least well off in society.  It is the Government's objective to try to synchronise the payment of social welfare benefits with tax and PRSI changes made in the budget.  It is important that the two systems are in parallel so that people are compensated at the time changes are made in the system. For example, local authorities determine rents payable at the beginning of the financial year so it is important that tax, PRSI, social welfare, local authority rents and charges systems are synchronised.  For that reason the changes in this year's budget are welcome.</P>
    <P>The increase of £7 per month in child benefit, a 35 per cent increase, is welcome. The families most in need are those with children who very often may be caught in a poverty trap.  This targeted increase will help them as it is not means tested or assessed for tax or local authority rents and is, therefore, a real increase for those dependent on social welfare.  The objective of the increase is to ensure that it will help children in these circumstances.</P>
    <P>The extension of the carer's allowance to carers looking after pensioners aged 66 and over who are not in receipt of a social welfare pension is very important.  Somebody may have given up their career or private life to ensure an elderly relative is looked after and it is important that the carer's allowance scheme includes categories who up to now have not been covered by it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of maternity leave to all female employees provided for in the Maternity Protection Act, 1994, and the provision of a similar payment for fathers who are awarded leave in accordance with the provisions of this Act.  It is important that the State recognises the role of the father as well as the mother in rearing a child during the formative years and it is important for the <Col N="15" /> child's development to see the father in a caring role.</P>
    <P>The increase from £10 to £25 in the minimum rate of unemployment assistance payable to young people living at home who do not qualify under the present means testing is welcome. Because young people living at home did not qualify under the means test for unemployment assistance the trend had been to move into accommodation and then qualify for a rent allowance from the health board as well as unemployment assistance.  If young people voluntarily leave the family home, nobody should put any obstacles in their way. However, many young people may wish to live at home but are forced to leave it.  The family may wish them to live at home and parents are concerned that their children have to leave home at 18 or 19 years to qualify for unemployment assistance and may go their own way in life at too early a stage.</P>
    <P>The increase in the social welfare budget is £212 million this year compared with an increase of £157 million last year, a 35 per cent increase on that of last year.  This is indicative of the Government's commitment to dealing with the inequalities of the social welfare system.  There is a strategy to help the long term unemployed with the provision of job facilitators who will deal individually with each long term unemployed person, assess their needs and skills and build their confidence.  This will give people an opportunity to get back into the workforce through the aid of the local employment service.</P>

      <P>The Minister said he was particularly pleased with the social welfare provisions in the budget.  In February he said that the 2.5 per cent increase in weekly personal and adult dependant payments guaranteed that everybody receiving a social welfare payment will keep pace with the predicted rate of inflation this year.  That may have been true at the time but the rate of inflation is now projected at 3 per cent.  The Minister obviously got the message about what the people think of his 2.5 per cent increase since he did not mention it yesterday.</P>
      <P>In my constituancy when mention is made of Ernest Blythe some people say: &ldquo;He was the Minister who reduced the old age pension by one shilling&rdquo;.  The Minister is fortunate that the budget will not go down in history as the worst in the history of the State for those who depend on social welfare payments; it is the second worst budget.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke at length about introducing equity into the system.  The household budget scheme is available to those who are long term unemployed and works very well.  They are able to pay their local authority rent, electricity and gas bills through the post office at no cost to the Exchequer.  That scheme should be extended to include all those who depend on social welfare for their income.  Anyone who wishes to do so should be able to avail of the household budget scheme.  Recently a deserted wife and mother of four children under 12 years was the subject of a court order sought by the local authority to evict her for non-payment of rent.  She would have been happy to avail of such a scheme but it is not available to those receiving lone parent's allowance.  The scheme should be extended to cover such people or a similar scheme should be introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a recent Parliamentary Question I put to the Minister for the Environment he stated that over 82 per cent of local authority tenants depend either solely or mainly on social welfare payments.  I raise this matter because it is wrong that a deserted wife with four <Col N="18" /> children should be evicted from her home particularly as she is in receipt of an income from the State.  There should be some method of transfer between different arms of the State where the person is agreeable.  If they do not agree that is a different matter.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare provide the money and pay officials to administer the various schemes.  The money is given to the local authority tenant many of whom employ people to collect the rent.  If the local authority does not receive the rent it goes to court at great expense to obtain an eviction order.  The tenant is put out on the side of the road and then the health board houses the family in private accommodation at a cost which is four or five times that of the local authority rent until such time as the local authority can re-house them.  It is time we moved away from that and there is scope for the Minister to extend the household budget scheme, which is very good as far as it goes, to all social welfare recipients who wish to avail of it.</P>
    <P>As regards the carer's allowance there is a big difference between looking after someone in their 80s who may be feeble but mentally alert and able to do some things for themselves and looking after a person, for example, who may have suffered a stroke and is totally paralysed.  Such a person may need to be spoon-fed three or four times a day. I welcome the decision to increase the disregarded income from £100 to £150 but the allowance should be targeted at those who care for people with a major disability or who are totally incapacitated. In such cases, unless the income is particularly high, there is a case to be made for disregarding the total income. Those dependent on social welfare payments do not benefit from disregarding any income.  Anomalies are creeping into the system.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the case of a widow whose sole income is the widow's pension, looking after a severely mentally handicapped child.  None of her income is disregarded nor does she receive a carer's allowance.  Her neighbour, also a <Col N="19" /> widow with a handicapped child, has the same amount of income.  In one case the widow is unable to leave the home.  I understand the difficulties the Minister might encounter but if we increase the disregarded income for those who are working from £100 to £150 perhaps that militates against having equity in the scheme.  The Minister should consider that aspect.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to make the payments under the equality treatment legislation.  I suppose it should have been paid in 1984 when the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government was in office but I am concerned at the method by which the Government intends to raise the requisite funds.  Yesterday the Minister referred to the fact that the Government would raid the local loans fund consisting of £490 million and said: &ldquo;The intention is to securitise a portion of the fund by selling on the debt and using the yield to fund the equality payments this year&rdquo;.  I do not know what that means.  Perhaps, when replying, the Minister or his Minister of State might explain it because, as far as I am concerned, this is a three card trick.  The local loans fund forms part of the Exchequer funds and it is the Minister's intention to raid that fund to the tune of £140 million.  My understanding is that it will not be privatised but transferred to a semi-State organisation which, in turn, will have to borrow this money from the private sector.  If they do not borrow from the private sector &mdash; which would be even worse in many ways &mdash; what will happen?  It would mean that the money now available under the provisions of the Small Dwellings Act would be raided.  I see the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, shaking his head, but the money must come from somewhere. The Government has two choices only, to borrow the money &mdash; which I understand is its intention &mdash; from the private sector, which will increase public spending to in excess of 7 per cent, greater than the increase of 6 per cent in public spending the Minister for Finance told us on budget day <Col N="20" /> would not be exceeded or to increase the public sector borrowing requirement. Assuming the Housing Finance Agency will provide the money.  I do not know what will be the effect if it has to borrow the money at a higher rate of interest than applied to Exchequer borrowing many years ago.  I understand the last occasion on which the Exchequer paid out money from the local loans fund was in 1986 but, following legislation passed in 1987, that practice ceased.  I perceive it to be a circular transfer within the system which will do nothing apart from adding to the State's borrowing requirement and increasing public spending this year.</P>
    <P>In this respect it is fair to make two points.  One is the wide diversity of ideology among the three parties in Government which does not allow them to examine alternative means of funding these essential equality treatment payments. This is another example of that diversity of views on how the State should be run.  We warned the Government at budget time that they had been handed the national finances with a surplus of £15 million and should have endeavoured to remain in surplus. Instead, the Government went on a spending spree, like the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government in the early 80s.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>They decided they would borrow £310 million this year. The chickens are coming home to roost, leaving the Government no room to manoeuvre in many areas, not having taken our advice at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the Minister for Social Welfare said the PRSI changes are innovative and will, for the first time in a number of years, ease the burden on low paid workers in particular.  That is wrong because, in most instances, the Minister is merely increasing the allowances first announced by his predecessor, Deputy Woods.  He should have recognised that rather then make an <Col N="21" /> issue of the fact that he was being so generous.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in child benefit and the proposal for a localised employment service about which the Minister informed me yesterday.  Perhaps he would inform us when it is hoped to establish that service.  He might have recognised also the contribution of his predecessor and his Department on the establishment of the employment support service in 1993. We all accept the need for counselling, guidance, training and work experience for the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Recently, a person on unemployment assistance inquired of me why people could not go to their local post office for payment like some other recipients of social welfare, such as those on unemployment benefit.  In this respect the long term unemployed are being discrimated against, they have to go to the labour exchange whereas those on unemployment benefit can obtain payment at their local post office: at least that is the position in my town: I do not know how prevalent it is nationwide.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the decision to transfer the disabled person's maintenance allowance to the Department of Social Welfare, something I had advocated during my term as Minister for Health. Indeed I had initiated negotiations for its transfer.  Over many years while in Opposition I raised the fact that there is unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, disability benefit but no disability assistance, leaving a wide gap. Bearing in mind all the changes effected in the social welfare system overall this vacuum led to much unnecessary administration and time wasted while people awaited their entitlements from their health boards.</P>
    <P>I commend the Department of Social Welfare and its officials who have effected tremendous improvements in the overall administration of social welfare in recent years, they utilised information technology to put a human face on the Department, not always associated with high technology.  I also compliment the Minister's predecessor, <Col N="22" /> Deputy Woods, who held that office for eight years but particularly his departmental officials because, at every level, one receives nothing but the height of courtesy, efficiency and a recognition of the in-depth knowledge of those officials of their many-faceted tasks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I might lay out the background against which this Bill is being discussed.  When its provisions are examined within the context of the overall economic strategy outlined in the budget, the remarks of the Minister for Finance are worthy of repetition when he said that this latest was one of three budgets this Government intend introducing before the next general election, containing three main objectives: first, reward for work, second, the promotion of enterprise and, third, strengthening social solidarity.  The Minister cited work as the key to our success, saying it is through work that we create wealth for our society overall, adding that more people must be at work and appropriately rewarded. Finally, he said we must also provide the opportunity for those people without work to work.</P>
      <P>I should like to address the third of those objectives &mdash; strengthening social solidarity &mdash; which falls within five separate headings: first, to protect the spending power of social welfare recipients; second, to take the first step towards a basic income for children; third, to reform deserted wife's benefit and lone parent's allowance scales; fourth, to considerably improve the carer's allowance scheme and, fifth, to give additional assistance to voluntary and community organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of newspaper headlines at the time of the Minister's Budget Statement and the budget debate outline the background against which this Social Welfare Bill is set and the reaction to the social welfare and other provisions in the budget.  They include &ldquo;PRSI tax changes to boost jobs&rdquo;; &ldquo;All workers will be better off&rdquo;; &ldquo;16,000 houses to escape the tax net&rdquo;; &ldquo;Tax relief introduced on rented property&rdquo;; &ldquo;Guidance <Col N="23" /> and placement plan for jobless to be introduced&rdquo;; &ldquo;£2.1 million to fund sports and cultural projects&rdquo;; &ldquo;Arts sector jubilant at rise in funding&rdquo;, which I am sure pleased many people.  It is a long time since we saw such headlines regarding reactions to budgets.  Other newspaper headlines include &ldquo;Warm welcome in North for concessions to the elderly&rdquo;; &ldquo;Overseas funding now at record levels&rdquo;; &ldquo;£23.6 million for court and prison buildings&rdquo;; &ldquo;Tax incentives for resorts welcomed&rdquo;; &ldquo;Motor trade urged to top up Minister's £1,000&rdquo;; &ldquo;Step in right direction but not enough say employers&rdquo;; &ldquo;Services sector poised to reap the rewards of new 38 per cent tax&rdquo;; &ldquo;Entrepreneurs should benefit from seed capital&rdquo;; &ldquo;Farming organisations give a muted welcome to tax concessions for their sector&rdquo;; &ldquo;Adult rates should keep pace with inflation in social welfare&rdquo;; &ldquo;Lower and middle income earners gain most from the budget in terms of take home pay&rdquo;; &ldquo;Exemptions and deductions cut the individual liability to income tax&rdquo; and &ldquo;£8 million earmarked to reduce waiting lists in the health area&rdquo;.  That is the background against which the Bill we are dealing with today is set.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure on social welfare will be £90 million this year and £250 million in a full year.  That represents an increase in expenditure of more than 35 per cent on the 1994 budget allocation which was also significant in respect of provisions for social welfare dependants.  Government spending on social welfare for 1995 will break the £4 billion mark for the first time, a colossal sum of money.  Despite many critics of the budget, particularly of social welfare provisions, the evidence is that the principles of strengthening social solidarity have been achieved in many areas.</P>
    <P>Everybody recognises the importance of child benefit.  An increase of £7 per child per month is a major contribution to the family unit.  It brings child benefit payments to £27 per month for the first <Col N="24" /> two children and £32 per month for subsequent children, but it does not end there.  It is welcome and significant that it will be extended also to include 18 year olds in full-time education, 18 year olds with disabilities as well as those on certain FÁS courses.</P>
    <P>By now many people will have forgotten the major increase in child benefit negotiated by the Labour Party with the Fianna Fáil Party in the formation of the previous Government.  That resulted in a child benefit provision of £20 per month and the provision has been increased in subsequent budgets. It has made a major contribution to a significant method of addressing the problem of poverty and the poverty trap.  It is significant also that it is paid to women who are the mainstay of households who manage finances in difficult circumstances and keep families in a state of reasonable comfort.  The real benefit of this payment is that it does not relate to work and tax status and, in that way, it gets to the heart of the problem.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill addresses major criticism of the delay in payments to social welfare recipients.  That delay is being addressed for the first time by bringing the payment dates forward by six weeks.  Everybody welcomes the bridging of that gap, particularly social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>The changes in PRSI contributions are designed to relieve those on low incomes and also people outside the income tax net.  Fifty pounds of weekly wage will be disregarded in calculating PRSI contributions and that will result in a significant reduction in PRSI to those on low pay.  For those paying 27 per cent income tax, the gain will be just under £2 per week.  Those improvements are introduced in conjunction with other budgetary income tax reliefs and will be welcomed by all workers.  It will be particularly welcomed by the Packard workforce who recently experienced difficult and worrying times when faced with the closure of their factory due to the fierce competition from low cost producers in Eastern Europe.  That <Col N="25" /> important employment unit in Tallaght now has a breathing space to address the difficult conditions in the markets in which it deals and has initiated measures which will assist them in their efforts to survive.  This measure is not the whole answer.  The future of the plant must be secured by a variety of measures.  The workers have already made a major contribution and we now look to the Government to safeguard the security of that important employment sector in Tallaght.</P>
    <P>Everybody welcomes the improvements in the carer's allowance.  We are beginning to recognise the important contribution of people who care for the weaker suffering sections of our community, who do not want to go into institutions and who, in many cases, are better cared for in their home environment. The assistance given under this allowance will facilitate the care of people in their homes.  I look forward to further developments and I hope the next two budgets will contain further evidence of the Government's commitment to this area.</P>
    <P>The change in minimum unemployment assistance is welcome.  The increase from £10 to £25 in the minimum rate paid to qualified young people living in the family home is an incentive for them to live at home rather than in rented accommodation. Assessments which included board and lodgings greatly irritated many young people and left them virtually penniless while seeking employment.  The expenses incurred in that process meant that many had to fall back on their families who, in some cases, were not in a position to support them.  The provision is not major but it is significant that this area is being recognised and dealt with. I hope it will be part of the continuing process of providing support for young people who wish to remain in the family home until they decide to leave and live on their own.</P>
    <P>I would like to address a matter not directly associated with the Bill, the equality payments, which should have been made a long time ago.  The price is <Col N="26" /> now being paid for that delay and as a result a large bill must be met.  There is only one way to deal with it, to pay the money to the people entitled to it.  The original idea was that it would be paid over a four year period and £60 million was provided in the budget for the initial payments.  I am glad the Government has succeeded in doing what I advocated, to pay it as soon as possible and in as large a sum as possible to ensure that those who waited so long will reap the benefit.</P>
    <P>The arrangements for payment being made by the Government are largely welcomed by the women who have waited so long.  Three quarters of the payment will be made before the year ends.  This will be a substantial sum of money for many people who have never had the pleasure of having such a large sum at their disposal in such a short space of time.  Many are waiting with bated breath for this money to finance projects which they have been unable to undertake previously.</P>
    <P>I note comments from the Opposition benches as to whether these matters are being addressed properly.  They criticise the method used to find the finance while at the same time they welcome it. There is only one way to deal with a problem such as this; you either cut expenditure or find the finance elsewhere. If you welcome the development you must find the money even if it means cutting expenditure, not something with which Members would agree. The sourcing of this money is most important, it must be found by whatever means and the people must be paid.  We can deal with the position as we find it afterwards.</P>
    <P>The Government has been criticised for embarking on a spending spree.  In the same contributions we are told we are not spending enough on social welfare and that the unemployed have been let down by the Government with a meagre 2.5 per cent increase.  In many cases they disregard the contribution made in the area of child benefit. Because it is paid under a separate heading, announced under a separate <Col N="27" /> heading &mdash; and not included in the list of social welfare payments &mdash; it is disregarded. For many unemployed people with large families this benefit, in conjunction with the 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare payments, will make a significant contribution to the household.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of the long and short term unemployed.  The scheme announced by the Minister to deal with the unemployed &mdash; 100,000, 200,000, or 300,000 &mdash; does not take account of the humanity involved.  In the past we have not been able to identify them as individuals who need specific attention and special help.  I am pleased that the number of long term unemployed is falling.  We need to examine precisely how many people of various categories are involved in the unemployment figures.  We must target the people we need to address.  It is no good saying we need to produce schemes and target various things at the unemployed unless we know precisely their needs.</P>
    <P>Prior to becoming a Member I had been involved in the area of education and, in particular, in second chance education for the unemployed.  When you become aware of their needs and requirements it is amazing how quickly you can focus help in the right direction. Many officials in the Department of Social Welfare do not have the time or resources to target these people, to speak to them and find out their interests and the help they need. Because we are not doing that we are not addressing the problem and I am pleased the new proposals will do so. When we become aware of their needs the resources can be targeted more effectively at those who need to get back to work as quickly as possible.  This is the first and most obvious sector to deal with.  The needs of the short term unemployed can be addressed with certain types of support and we can put State resources of a more appropriate kind at the disposal of the long term <Col N="28" /> unemployed &mdash; those who have the greatest difficulty.</P>
    <P>For the first time the Department of Social Welfare is beginning to address the problem of how to speak to recipients. Many young people have expressed an inability to understand precisely what they are told at points of contact, such as unemployment exchanges.  If they cannot understand it why can it not be written down so that it can be taken away and considered? This would take only a few moments. However, as the staff are under pressure with larger numbers signing on they do not have the time to do that.</P>
    <P>We must use the technology in place to ensure people are adequately informed; first, of their rights, second, how to go about acquiring those rights and, third, to ensure they have the correct amount.  That is an essential part of the social welfare system.  Many of the people who are dealt with in unemployment exchanges need that type of support and I am pleased that technology may help them in that regard.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on the Social Welfare Bill and remind it of the context in which it was delivered.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Social Welfare, having introduced <Col N="29" /> his first Social Welfare Bill, is not present for the debate.  I had hoped that between the introduction of the Bill and Committee Stage he would have considered some major amendments.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill and the budget, as far as it relates to social welfare, were a big disappointment.  The lack of innovation in any direction in social welfare policy is regretted.  It would appear that the general feeling in Government was that social welfare recipients were doing too well compared with working people and that the best way to create incentive was to pull back on social welfare increases.  I am surprised at this policy from a Minister for Social Welfare from Democratic Left, particularly in view of the statements made in previous years on social welfare increases introduced by Fianna Fáil led Governments.</P>
    <P>I express my utter shock and dismay at the low general rise in social welfare rates this year.  When compared with the general increase of 3 per cent last year, this year's increase is totally inadequate. In addition to the general increase last year, there were increases of 10 per cent in unemployment and disability benefit and a widower's, or survivor's, pension became payable for the first time.  I congratulate the previous Minister for Social Welfare on the major changes he introduced to the means testing system. I will refer to this point in greater detail later.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the excuse given by the Government for the low general increase in social welfare this year, that is, it is interested in creating an atmosphere of enterprise.  When one looks at the means testing system one will see that this excuse rings very hollow, particularly for the 385,000 pensioners. I presume the Government is not proposing to put pensioners back to work in the near future.  The situation is further exacerbated when one realises that there was no increase in the child dependant allowance for social welfare recipients.  While there was a major increase in child benefit, this applies to everybody with dependent children. <Col N="30" /> Social welfare recipients would, in the normal way, have expected an increase of 40p per week for each dependant child.  The real increase in child benefit for those on social welfare is not £1.61 per week but £1.21.  Everybody will receive an increase of £1.61 and one would have expected there to be something extra for those in receipt of social welfare.  However, that has not happened this year.</P>
    <P>This is particularly interesting when one considers the number of people caught in the poverty trap and about whom we heard so much when Democratic Left was in Opposition.  The poverty level is arrived at by ascertaining the number of people earning less than 60 per cent of the national average income.  Given the increase in the rates for child dependants, the Government has done nothing to narrow that gap.  A person earning a gross salary of £100,000 has received the same increase in child benefit as a person totally dependent on social welfare.  I welcome the increase in the number of women in the workforce, but they will also receive the same increase as social welfare recipients.  Instead of directing resources towards the alleviation of poverty, the Government has put social welfare recipients at the bottom of the pile.  The budget hit hardest the poorest and least vocal in society and gave the lie to all the fine words spoken by Democratic Left in Opposition.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the payment of child dependent allowances for children in full-time education.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not move to remove the anomaly in the social welfare system whereby people in receipt of short term unemployment and disability benefit are not eligible for the child dependant allowance for children between the ages of 18 and 21 years in full-time education.  I thought the Minister would continue the progress made by his predecessor and extend child dependant allowances to all child dependants up to 21 years of age in full-time education.  Is the Minister trying to convince us that the children of people <Col N="31" /> in receipt of disability or unemployment benefit who are over 18 years of age and in full-time education do not cost their parents money?  It is time this anomaly was removed from the social welfare code.  I call on the Minister to put down an amendment to the Bill which will ensure that child dependant allowances are paid to all child dependants in full-time education up to 21 years of age. This is particularly important as under the present regulations people can be in receipt of disability benefit for two years, three years or longer without being granted an invalidity pension.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to this point in greater detail.  All too frequently we meet people who have been in receipt of disability benefit for long periods.  The Department seems very reluctant to grant these people an invalidity pension, even when they have been in receipt of a disability for longer than two to three years.  Even if he is not willing to change the eligibility criteria for invalidity pension, the Minister should introduce a system similar to the one for short term unemployment assistance so that a person on disability for a fixed period would be put on long term disability benefit where the rates and privileges enjoyed would be exactly the same as those enjoyed by people on long term unemployment assistance.  This would be a small but practical improvement in the present system.  We all know people who have been on disability benefit for years and who cannot qualify for an invalidity pension.</P>
    <P>Like most Deputies, I welcome the introduction of a PRSI free allowance.  I hope this innovative measure is a first step in amalgamating the levies, PRSI and tax systems into one coherent system. However, I find it totally inexplicable as to why this allowance was pitched at £50 rather than £60 per week. It should have been set at £60 per week as there is already an exemption from PRSI for employees earning less than that amount.  This anomaly in the system has been created without good reason.  A person earning £59.99 per <Col N="32" /> week pays no PRSI but if his income is increased to £60.01 he will have to pay 55p in PRSI, giving him a net reduction in income of 53p per week.  This is another inconsistency in the system. Each year we introduce further inconsistencies into the system, yet we wonder why there is a disincentive to work.</P>
    <P>I thought the Minister would put his money where his mouth was last year when there was severe criticism about the liability threshold for the health and employment levies.  I welcome the marginal increase in the threshold but there are still faults in the system.  The Government did not address the obvious problems the threshold creates. A person earning £177 per week pays no health or unemployment levy while a person earning £178 per week &mdash; £1 more &mdash; will have £4 extra taken out of his wages as he is liable for the full health and employment levies.  I thought the Minister would have the courage to rationalise the system through the introduction of an employee's PRSI allowance of £60 per week and two rates so that a person pays nothing on the first £60, 6 per cent on the next £120 and 9 per cent on the balance of his income. By adjusting the upper ceiling, such a system can be made revenue neutral. The health and youth employment levies could be incorporated in those figures, thus simplifying the system.  It would then be easy for the State to decide what proportion of the PRSI collected should be given to health or youth employment.  In that way we would have a coherent, simple and effective system that everybody could understand.  Instead we create complicated systems.</P>
    <P>The Minister professes to be a friend of the poor.  I, therefore, hoped he would have grasped the nettle and introduced radical reform in the means testing system so that people on social welfare could better their position. Instead, only marginal changes were introduced to improve their lot.  The means testing system is riddled with inconsistencies, anomalies and irrational <Col N="33" /> contradictions and it is time that the concept of means testing as we know it changed.  It derives from a Victorian attitude towards social welfare, that such payments are something for which the recipient should be grateful and that any conditions can be imposed by the State rather than considering it a right to a basic income, as most progressive people see it.  As it would take far too long to cover all the complications associated with means testing, I will highlight merely a few.</P>
    <P>I represent a large number of small farmers, currach fishermen and people involved in small craft industry and seasonal tourism and one of their greatest difficulties is the penal system of means testing.  I pay tribute to Deputy Woods who, as Minister for Social Welfare, took some small steps towards improving the lot of those on means tested payments. I compliment him, in particular, for exempting from the system the Mná Tí and seaweed gatherers and for doing away with the concept of &ldquo;own produce consumed&rdquo;.  Under the iniquitous system if, for example, a small farmer in Connemara sowed a field of potatoes, his social welfare payments were reduced by £50 or £100 per annum for his efforts.  The system needs to be radically overhauled.</P>
    <P>Out of a total population of 20,000 in Connemara, there are 5,000 herd owners.  If one takes account of spouses and children, approximately 85 per cent of households in Connemara own cattle, that is typical all along the west coast. Many of those depend on means tested payment from the Department of Social Welfare.  Does the Minister honestly believe that anyone in Connemara could make a viable living from agriculture? The number could be counted on one hand.  The majority of herd-owners are either pensioners or people on unemployment or small farm holders' assistance and they are means tested pound for pound for their State payments.  They pay the highest rate of tax in the State.  For example, if a married person with three or four children <Col N="34" /> in receipt of unemployment assistance earns £1,000 from farming, bed and breakfast facility, craft work or fishing his or her income will be reduced by that amount.  If that person increases his or her income by, say, £500 social welfare payments will be decreased by £500.  It is like being on a merry-go-round, they are caught in the ultimate poverty trap.  For a Government that claims to encourage enterprise, this is a totally anti-enterprise culture.</P>
    <P>We frequently hear city dwellers complain about the large premia payments paid to farmers.  The greatest beneficiary of headage payments in the west, from Donegal to Cork, is the Department of Social Welfare.  Under our system, for every £1 increase in headage payments and premia, the Department of Social Welfare claws back £1 in social welfare.  In this context, the Department of Social Welfare is the ultimate beneficiary in the largesse from Europe. The system needs to be changed radically.</P>
    <P>The Government appears to believe that the banks pay 10 per cent interest to small deposit holders.  If a person on unemployment assistance has, say £2,000 on deposit in a bank, under the means testing system, the Department, with the exception of a few hundred pounds, assesses that amount at a rate of 10 per cent.  Can the Minister tell me what high street bank pays 10 per cent interest on small deposits?  For some reason widowers are assessed at only 5 per cent.  While we talk about encouraging thrift and getting people out of the clutches of moneylenders, in reality, we penalise honest people at a rate of 10 per cent per annum.  Furthermore, if a person receives a lump sum in a redundancy payment, for unemployment benefit purposes that lump sum will be means tested at 10 per cent per annum. I call on the Minister to exempt redundancy lump sum payments from means testing.  This was done previously for pensioners in the case of spouses' houses.  I also suggest that capital under £5,000 should be exempt from means testing and any higher amount should <Col N="35" /> be assessed at 50 per cent of the bank interest earned by the recipient of social welfare.  We should encourage saving.</P>
    <P>I now want to address the anomaly in the way a dependent spouse is means tested when the husband or wife gets a job.  Let us take the example of a person in receipt of unemployment assistance whose dependent spouse earns £59 a week and has £5 travelling expenses. The person in receipt of unemployment assistance would be entitled to £92 per week.  Therefore, the household income would be approximately £147 per week. If the person's income increases to £150 per week &mdash; an increase of £90 per week &mdash; the household income will increase by less than £2.  The Minister can check those facts for himself.  That is the way the system works.  That is the penalty imposed on people who better their position under the present code.  I could highlight many more crazy anomalies of where the more one earns the less one gets.  The system must be radically overhauled, but this Bill does nothing in that regard.</P>

      <P>It is traditional for an Opposition to find fault with the Social Welfare Bill each year.  It is traditional also for the Government to be criticised about the need for radical overhaul of the system.  We have not been disappointed.

It must be pointed out that for the past seven years a Fianna Fáil-led Government had many opportunities to radically overhaul the system.</P>

      <P>It would be simple to say that no improvements were effected over the past seven years, but I will not. That is not correct, some improvements were effected by the Fianna Fáil-led Government in the past seven years, but we still have a long way to go.  I am sure my namesake will not mind being reminded that one of the legacies left by the Fianna Fáil-led Government of the past seven years was the &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo;. Has that been forgotten?  There can be convenient lapses of memory when discussing, apparently objectively, major matters of State when such matters are overlooked.  I do not intend criticising what has happened in the past seven years &mdash; there were some improvements. This year there were considerable further improvements.  I am not saying that all the problems have been resolved.  It will take at least the next seven years in Government to achieve that but this year's measures are a major advance.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the overall cost.  Of the £350 million a year the new Government will devote to improvements, £200 million is for social welfare improvements, and a further £150 million represents the tax foregone in respect of the PRSI improvements.  This is not bad to begin with.  It represents some effort to direct resources particularly at those in low paid employment who are often much worse of, when fringe benefits are taken into account, than those on social welfare.  In the interests of justice and equity, it is right to ensure that the lot of those in low paid employment is improved, and I am delighted that our new Government had directed resources towards that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a major Bill because social welfare is paid to virtually every home in the country.  Up to 40 per cent of households are totally or partially dependent on social welfare payments. <Col N="37" /> The annual bill will henceforth exceed £4,000 million so it is of major import to every citizen.  Let us try to be objective. The general overall increase of 2.5 per cent could not be classified as exceptionally generous.  However, the available funds were directed towards specific areas of high priority, for example, children, the low paid and people in receipt of the carer's allowance.  The 2.5 per cent increase keeps pace with inflation and, in the case of those who have children or who will gain otherwise, the increase is much more substantial.</P>
    <P>The cornerstone of the Bill is the 35 per cent increase in child benefit.  That is a major leap forward and, it is worth mentioning, it goes to every home in the country where there are children, irrespective of income.</P>

      <P>I will argue about the universality of child benefit with anybody and will comment on it in a moment.  As to other supports for children, I approve fully the proposal to set up a committee to examine all the other payments because I am not particularly satified that there is such a low uptake of family income supplement.  Neither am I completely happy that the best course is not to have tax allowances for <Col N="38" /> children in our tax code.  In the context of child support both the social welfare and tax systems must be examined.</P>
      <P>On the question of the universality of child benefit, Fianna Fáil proposed a few years ago the introduction of a means test for child benefit.  Deputy Ó Cuív does not remember that &mdash; he was not a Member of the House then.  As Opposition spokeman on Social Welfare at the time I opposed the proposal on the basis of justice and equity, strange as that may seem.  What is even stranger is that my case was accepted and the proposal was dropped because it is clear that in relation to child benefit we must not create poverty traps.  We must also examine the demographic trend of similar families.  This problem has existed on the Continent for some time where there are now huge child allowances.  I am not saying we should pay people to have children but families who have children, whether in employment or otherwise, should be given reasonable support by the State.  The role of child benefit is to redistribute income from childless individuals to families with children.  The objective is to achieve horizontal equity which is very important in the absence of tax allowances.  Child benefit is not a policy instrument for vertical redisdribution across income groups, and that is the way it should be.  I am glad to have agreement from the Opposition on that. We must not have worsening of poverty traps.  The approach being adoptd by the Government is the correct one and I make no apology for it because I think that, on reflection, Deputy Ó Cuív will agree with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>

      <P>Child dependant tax allowances, family income supplements etc. must be tackled next.  I do not want to forecast next year's budget, but I am quite sure that Deputy Ó Cuív will have <Col N="39" /> the opportunity to congratulate the Government again on improvements in that area.</P>
      <P>I welcome the improvements in regard to PRSI because it is important to encourage employment, particularly low paid employment.  The £150 million package will be of benefit not alone to the individual concerned but to the country as a whole.  The employee will be exempt from PRSI on the first £50 of income.  Furthermore there is a raising of the income threshold for the lower rate of PRSI for employers.  I have some employees in my own legal office who strayed over the limit of £173 as a result of receiving an increase and would, prior to the change that has now taken place, have ended up with less take home pay than they had before receiving the increase, having been catapulted from the lower rate of PRSI to the higher rate on all their income.  The new lower rate will apply to incomes of up to £231 per week.  This is a major improvement and I fully suport the change.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the improvement in the carer's allowance in which I have a particular interest more remains to be done.  When I was my party's spokes-person on Social Welfare I tabled an amendment to the 1989 Social Welfare Bill to introduce a separate allowance. While the improvements are significant I hope further improvements will be made.  Of approximately 60,000 carers, half of which are full-time, only 10 per cent &mdash; 6,000 &mdash; receive the allowance. As a result of the changes made in this Bill a further 1,500 will receive support. I applaud this as a step in the right direction and I will be encouraging my colleagues to ensure further progress is made.  We do not pay enough attention to those who provide a selfless service to the old and disabled in many households throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Bill marks an improvement on what has gone before I wish to concentrate on a number of areas where changes could be made.  It is important to continue to strive to ensure equity <Col N="40" /> and justice.  Many of the complaints I receive relate to the anomalies, real or perceived, in the system.  We must continually try to rectify these and improve the complex system.  Someone said that for every complex problem there is a simple solution which does not work. The problems in society are complex and we have developed a social welfare system which is equally complex to cope with them.  We must continually try to improve it and rectify the anomalies.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that in assessing the income of pensioners in particular for pension purposes, from savings and capital, a rate of 10 per cent is used. However, in the bad old days under the previous Government interest rates were of the order of 15 per cent but now they are at historically low levels despite the recent changes.  It is unfair that in assessing their income from a nest egg &mdash; sometimes this is just burial money &mdash; a rate of 10 per cent is used.  It should be changed although this may be awkward and difficult.  We could do this by using their actual income &mdash; in many instances this may be no more than 2 or 3 per cent, sometimes less &mdash; or by reducing the figure of 10 per cent to 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>There is a further anomaly in that those who paid contributions under the self-employed pension system four to five years ago will never qualify for a pension.  I know of people in my own area who are well off and paid contributions for nine years but on reaching the age of 66 did not receive any pension. This is unfair.  Some way has to be found to rectify this anomaly.  We could do this, possibly, by introducing a <i>pro rata</i> pension whereby if a person has paid contributions for eight years they would receive an eight-tenths pension.</P>
    <P>The question of the multiplicity of means tests may be more difficult to tackle.  This matter has been considered but no satisfactory solution has been found.  It is ridiculous &mdash; I speak from experience having dealt with constituents' problems &mdash; when a person in receipt of unemployment assistance or small farmer's assistance applies for a <Col N="41" /> medical card a different method of assessment is used.  During this assessment the farm income is further considered with the result, when small farmer's assistance is added, the person concerned may not qualify for the medical card.  There should be one uniform means test to determine whether an individual qualifies for social welfare, a medical card, other health benefits, third level grants for their children, civil legal aid and so on.</P>
    <P>Because of the lack of flexibility in the system the unemployed &mdash; in common parlance, those on the dole &mdash; either do not take up part-time or temporary work or operate in the black economy.  We should focus on this issue to encourage those on the dole to take up part-time or temporary work by ensuring there will be no loss of income. That is what happens at present and in a society with such a major unemployment problem this is crazy.  It should not be beyond the ingenuity of man to provide for flexibility in the system to encourage those who find themselves in this position to take up work.  The system will continue to be a failure until we can provide for this exit route for those who want to return to work but cannot obtain full-time employment.  This is probably the greatest challenge facing us.</P>
    <P>In this Bill considerable improvements have been made and these must be applauded.  Despite this, much remains to be done.  I am glad the Government is committed to tackling this work and I look forward to further major improvements being made.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for this opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on this important legislation which will affect large numbers of people in society.  We should view it as much more than an opportunity to provide additional allowances; we should take the opportunity to discuss the philosophy behind the social welfare system and lay down clear public policy guidelines as to how best social welare issues can be dealt with in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a sad feature of the times in <Col N="42" /> which we live that 1.3 million people are dependent on social welfare payments of one kind or another.  That is almost 40 per cent of the population and is a reflection of certain highly unacceptable features of our society.  The total cost of meeting those social welfare demands this year is £4,000 million.  That is an enormous sum by any standards and it raises a number of questions.  To what extent will that expenditure improve the lives of many social welfare recipients, particularly young, able bodied people who are now sadly dependent on social welfare?  To what extent is it helping to eliminate poverty or is it merely helping to entrench poverty?  We must demand answers to these questions.</P>
    <P>Is our social welfare system, in some of its elements, helping to cultivate a culture of dependence or is it helping people to break away from that dependence? To what extent is it fair and equitable between the needs of the old and the demands of the young?  Is the taxpayer &mdash; a shrinking specimen in Irish life due to unemployment, ageing and other factors &mdash; getting good value from the expenditure of that £4,000 million?</P>
    <P>There are some features of the Bill that I believe are praiseworthy and I welcome those.  In particular, I welcome the increased provision for child benefit. The most harrowing poverty in this country is being experienced by families where there is a large number of children &mdash; four or more &mdash; and where that coincides with long term unemployment. There is a sufficiency of statistical evidence to prove that this is the area where the greatest poverty exists and where we must target most resources, not by giving handouts but by providing educational and recreational resources. This problem is acknowledged in the Social Welfare Bill and I commend the Minister for the increase in child benefit which is the most positive element of the Bill.  I hope it will have the desired effect and will help children in poverty.</P>
    <P>It is very sad to see children in our constituencies living in poor housing and with poor educational prospects.  In <Col N="43" /> such cases the mothers suffer also because they are the ones who must stretch the inadequate family budget. They put their own needs &mdash; and sometimes their own health needs &mdash; to one side.  That is a sad feature of Irish life which must be tackled in a much broader way than it is being done in the context of this Bill.  It is an area which I hope will be addressed over a series of budgets.</P>
    <P>There are other key aspects of the Bill which I welcome but I will deal with those later.  I wish to refer now to a feature of our social welfare system that is working to the detriment of young people, namely, the manner in which household incomes are used to preclude young people from drawing unemployment assistance.  There are many young people who would ordinarily have resided at home but who, because the total income of the household being taken into consideration in assessing their eligibility for social welfare entitlements, have been precluded from claiming assistance.  Consequently, they are forced into renting private accommodation, particularly in our cities.  Their parents cannot continue to look after them; they are adults and their demands for food and clothing are considerable.</P>
    <P>The cost to the taxpayer last year in regard to the people in the situations I have described was approximately £30 million.  In Cork city, approximately £3 million was paid out by the health boards last year in providing rent subsidies for young people in that position. I consider that to be the worst possible value for money because if the social welfare regulations were re-cast and if these people were allowed to live in their own homes, 99 per cent of them would do so.  That £3 million would be better spent in building new houses for people who cannot provide for themselves. If it had been given to Cork Corporation last year we could have built 60 new houses thereby taking 60 families off the housing list on which there are now more than 1,300 eligible applicant families.  That regulation must be <Col N="44" /> changed and I ask the Minister to ensure that it is changed in the context of this Bill.  My party will be tabling an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>Another effect of the Bill &mdash; probably unintended &mdash; is that these young people are living in sub-standard accommodation and the State is inadvertently subsidising the slum landlords involved. I ask the Minister to examine that issue and bring in the kind of regulation that will enable young people to live at home with their families.  There is a number of social reasons they would be much better off living at home but the economic reason is the one I choose to highlight today.</P>
    <P>When young people move out of their homes they are entitled to maximum benefits and a number of them, between the rent subsidy &mdash; which goes directly into the pocket of the landlords &mdash; and other benefits get a minimum of £110 per week from the State.  That policy is wrong and is disturbing.  Will the Minister ensure it is changed?  If the system is to be maintained and it is a matter of public policy, let us say so, but do not let the position continue whereby health boards are expected to provide the money under these regulations and housing authorities, who could usefully use that money, are left badly off.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly &mdash; this may more properly relate to the Finance Bill &mdash; about the adverse effect of the taxation of social welfare benefit, particularly on workers taking part in community employment schemes.  In my experience the majority of those workers are women in the home, some of whom have never worked and most of whom have never worked since they got married. With the introduction of the community employment schemes, for the first time in a long time these people have an opportunity for training and to do part-time work.  The psychological boost that gives to women is tremendous. This is a major step in breaking the cycle of dependency.  Not alone does it give a great boost to men and increase the family income but children see their parents going out to work, and we <Col N="45" /> should not under-estimate the importance of that in forming attitudes of young people and breaking the culture of dependence.</P>
    <P>As a result of the taxation of social welfare benefits many workers on community schemes are taking home very little pay.  I have cited a number of cases to the Minister for Social Welfare of women working a 20 hour week who take home only an additional £8.  This is a very poor return for a 20 hour working week.  If it is Government policy to break the cycle of dependency that is a key area that must be considered in the context of the Social Welfare Bill and the Finance Bill.  I ask the Minister to take on board that point.</P>
    <P>Since its inception the Progressive Democrats has always argued that the best weapon against poverty is a job. Even if it is only a part-time job it means a great deal to the people I describe, most of whom are women. Schemes that are beginning to radically change the prospects of women who in many cases have never earned income should not be cut off by ill thought-out taxation measures.  The Minister should consider this matter.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the improvements in carer's allowance but there is great scope for further improvement in that area.  We should, by our taxation, social welfare and education policies, encourage and enable as many young people as possible to earn a living and become net contributors to our overall benefit. Our policies should not discourage people.</P>
    <P>We must make proper provision for the old, sick and disabled.  The one great fault of the budget is that provision for pensioners is absolutely derisory.  It is the lowest increase in any year in my recollection.  My colleague.  Deputy Clohessy, said that the increase given to pensioners this year would not cover the cost of a razor blade per day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely pointing out the facts.  The increase would not make up half the price of an <i>Evening Echo.</i> Our thinking in regard to pensioners must be changed.  In the year 2020 the ratio of people aged 66 and older to those in the working age may increase by about 50 per cent.  We cannot ignore that.  I have every reason to believe that with improved health care this figure will be realised.  Now is the time to begin to make better provision at every level. I fault this budget on a number of fronts but mostly for the poor provision it made for our senior citizens.  That matter will have to be addressed and a greater increase given next year, ma bhíonn sibh ann an bhliain seo chugainn.</P>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the adjustments in PRSI are sufficient to encourage people to walk away from the social welfare system and look for jobs.  They are certainly not sufficient to encourage employers to create more employment. It makes better economic sense for many employers to buy machinery than to employ more people because of our PRSI and taxation system.  That is major weakness that has not been addressed to the extent it ought to have been.  A great deal of work needs to be done and my party will frame amendments in the hope of making this a better Bill.  I hope our amendments, all of which are based on common sense, will be taken on board by the Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there are 70,000 cases <Col N="47" /> outstanding where women are due payment as a result of equal treatment legislation.  One would think, having heard the main Opposition party speakers discuss the financial issues that have gone through the House in the past number of weeks, that they had not been in Government up until a few short weeks ago.  They now can see so many things wrong with the present system. Women will appreciate the fact that they will be paid most of the outstanding money due to them this year. In this context, however, I hope the Minister for the Environment will be able to find much needed resources for repairs to the potholes in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan.  The Government has shown ingenuity in finding the extra £140 million for these payments.</P>

      <P>I hope it will find the extra money needed for the county roads.  The Government inherited the problem and is trying to deal with it.</P>
      <P>This Government also inherited the situation where 135,000 people have been on unemployed benefit for 12 months or more.  The first steps of a three year programme to improve that situation are being taken in this Bill. Under the changes in PRSI, employees will not be liable for PRSI in respect of the first £50 of weekly earnings and the bands have been widened.  Deputy O'Keeffe said that when the law clerks received a salary increase of £3, they were worse off because they had moved out of the lower tax band.  It does not go as far as we would like but at least it is a step in the right direction and I hope it will improve the situation for low paid workers.  The anomaly where the number of children are taken into account in social welfare payments &mdash; but not for tax purposes &mdash; must be rectified so that there are no obstacles to people taking up employment when the opportunity arises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members from the main Opposition <Col N="48" /> benches have dwelt on the 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare payments.  I would also like to have seen a higher rate of increase paid.  Generally social welfare increases are promised in January and February but are not paid until August of that year and we have brought forward the payment date by six weeks.  I look forward to further improvements in the next two budgets. This Government will be judged on its record on how it looked after the aged who need help most.</P>
    <P>The increases in child benefit and the carer's allowance are welcome.  The carer's allowance was improved by the previous Minister and I pay tribute to him.  One of the first cases brought to my notice after my election to Dáil Éireann two years ago was the case of a wife whose husband was on a social employment scheme.  She was delighted when she found out she was eligible for the carer's allowance but the following week she found out she was only £6 better off because her husband was no longer entitled to claim benefits for her. The means test for the carer's allowance is being eased and the first £150 of household income a week is being disregarded.  Even more important is that the carers of those in receipt of an occupational pension will now be eligible for the carer's allowance.  The Minister is to be congratulated for recognising the part these people play in society and improving their situation.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has made much of the 2.5 per cent across the board increase but families are delighted with a 35 per cent increase in child benefit. This is the single biggest increase ever. The Minister has assured us that this is only part of his programme to ensure that this group is properly looked after.</P>
    <P>An unemployed son or daughter living at home was assessed for assistance on their parents' income and eligible only for the minimum payment of £10 a week if their parents' income was over a certain level.  I do not know how a young adult would live on £10 per week. In this budget it is being increased to £25 per week and I hope this is only a <Col N="49" /> start.  As previous speakers rightly said, when these young people were driven out of their homes they went to live in flats, which the health board subsidised by paying a rent allowance.  This had the effect of breaking up the family unit. This measure, with the introduction of a tax regime on flats, may improve the situation dramatically.</P>
    <P>Measures to bring about a new structure so that people are encouraged to work rather than sign on must be developed.  I am aware of a case where a young man wanted to take a job of driving a school bus two hours each day. If he worked for two or three days each week he could sign on for the remainder of the week but because he was working every day, but only for two hours, he was not allowed to sign on for social welfare.</P>
    <P>The Minister must ensure that anyone who wishes to work is facilitated. Deputy O'Keeffe raised a number of other issues with which I agree.  The self-employed pay PRSI and some have been paying it for nine years.  However, they do not receive any benefit.  They must be allowed to pay for the remaining year even if they have reached the age of 65 years.  This anomaly cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>People are assessed for income tax, social welfare, medical card and third level grant purposes but all the assessments are made differently.  We must streamline such assessments.  I welcome the improvements in child benefit, carer's allowance and the changes in PRSI. One of the issues we campaigned on was lowering the tax wedge.  We said people needed to be given an opportunity to work and a young person working should be better off financially by at least £25 than a person signing on the dole.  This Bill will begin that process. I hope it will be improved in the next two budgets so that somebody who wants to work will be better off financially.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="50" /> We pay out £4 billion a year in social welfare payments, over £11 million per day.  This is a big drain on the economy. One of the most important roles the Government can play is to bring down that high cost by providing job opportunities for all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I was elected to the House last June when my party was in Opposition. I listened to Deputies De Rossa, Durkan and McManus fight for the poor during that time.  During the budget debate I heard Members say this was the 14th budget for which they had been present and in one case the 26th budget.</P>
      <P>I make no apology for what the Government did in the budget to look after the less well off in the community who must be protected.  I compliment those Ministers on their efforts in the budget to help the weaker sections in society.  However, it is still not enough and much more is required.  Those in business are well able to lobby and put their case for whatever grants are available but people on social welfare have no-one to speak for them.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for his good work, particularly for the provision to pay benefit six weeks earlier. The £7 increase per month in child benefit is to be welcomed.  It is great that the Government recognised that families need help and has given them a decent increase.  Our biggest problem is unemployment.  There are insufficient jobs to go around and we must look after those who cannot get employment. I welcome the change in PRSI as it will help small employers who have been penalised over the years by income tax charges, water charges, service charges, rates and so on.  They are visited by health inspectors, egg inspectors, etc. and soon there will not be enough Government offices to house the paper work which small business people must furnish.  The pressure should be taken off the small business person.  I hope the changes in PRSI will encourage small business people to take people off the live register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was glad the Adoptive Leave Bill <Col N="51" /> was introduced.  I raised this matter as a county councillor before being elected to the Dáil.  Even though adopting women pay the same levies to the State they were not entitled to paid maternity leave.  I am glad that is being rectified.</P>
    <P>It should be made easier for people to qualify for the carer's allowance as it is cheaper for the State to have carers look after the elderly at home.  I welcome the new developments in this area.  When it was introduced many people did not apply for it as there was too much red tape involved.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Government for finding the money to pay those entitled to equality payments.  This matter has been ongoing for years and at last we will have action.  I hope those entitled to the payments will receive their money this year.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has set up a telephone line but he must go further and place advertisements in the media so that those entitled to the money know how to go about applying for it.  Many people come to my clinic inquiring if they are entitled to the payments.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and the increases provided this year.  It is only a start for the Government and I know it will look after the underprivileged.  I make no apology for that.  I had intended speaking about mothers who remain at home to look after their children and I hope the Minister will give something to them in the next budget.  There are mothers who would like to remain at home were they given some incentive, many do not work outside the house through choice but of necessity to pay house mortgages and other expenses.</P>

      <P>I am sorry Deputy Ring did not have an opportunity to say all he wanted; perhaps he could fax the remainder of his speech to RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the Finance Bill, it is necessary <Col N="52" /> to introduce a Social Welfare Bill annually to give legal effect to the social welfare changes announced in the budget. This is the thirteenth Social Welfare Bill I have seen introduced in this House, each containing some improvements.</P>
    <P>I searched this Bill closely and found it almost impossible to give an unqualified welcome to any provision.  While the Bill represents what the Minister for Finance announced on budget day it consists largely of a combination of tinkering and tokenism.  I suppose I can give an unqualified welcome to one or two provisions, such as the adoptive benefits scheme and the extension of the maternity benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crawford referred to the increase to £25 per week that a person living at home can receive by way of unemployment assistance.  That is designed to save money for the State rather than being an unwarranted outburst of altruism on the part of the rainbow Coalition.  It may be barely sufficient to keep many people at home who would otherwise have gone to live in flats and been dependent on their health board.  The £50 per week exemption from PRSI contributions is a step in the right direction.  However, my enthusiasm for it is tempered by the fact that it is considerably clawed back by the reduction from £286 per annum to £140 per annum in the tax allowance for PRSI purposes.  The latter will reduce the benefit of that exemption to a taxpayer on the 27 per cent band by 30 per cent and that to a taxpayer on the 48 per cent band by 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>While I am pleased with the increases in child benefit I do not welcome the fact that, generous though they be, they are being used as an alibi for the insult to the disadvantaged forming the core of this Bill.  It appears that resources are being deliberately targeted at those most likely to vote in a general election, which includes the wealthiest at the expense of the poorest.  Apparently some programme managers have calculated that the electoral turn-out among the poorest is lower among certain other classes.  This Bill, and the budget on <Col N="53" /> which it is based, is designed to target that sector of the electorate.</P>

      <P>This is cynicism on a hitherto undreamt of scale.  Deputy Dukes and the Government of which he was a member had a chance and doubled the national debt; he should hang his head in shame.  Even the child benefit increases are being clawed back to the extent that the child dependency allowance on social welfare has not been increased but rather reduced in real terms.</P>
      <P>The core of the Bill is the 2.5 per cent overall increase.  This allocation to the weakest and poorest in our society is irrefutable evidence that the left's rhetoric in Opposition was a cruel, cynical deception, nothing short of a fraud of the electorate.  In 1989, despite the best efforts of Deputy Dukes, when the overall economic position was less benign, the general increase in social welfare &mdash; I am talking also about the increase in the child dependency aspect of social welfare &mdash; was 3 per cent and the long term unemployed received an increase of 9 per cent.  At that time, the present Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, then in Opposition, described that level of increase as &ldquo;particularly cruel&rdquo;.  That same Deputy now has his opportunity.  What has he done?</P>

Therefore, he has reduced social welfare in real terms for the <Col N="54" /> weakest and most disdvantaged.  The alibi being presented by Democratic Left is the increase in the child benefit which will be paid to everybody in society, including the wealthiest.  Apparently, it is to be funded exclusively by targeting the poorest, who are already targeted by a social welfare increase of less than the prevailing rate of inflation, thus representing a real reduction accompanied by no increase in the child dependency aspect of their payments.</P>

Countless thousands of others are in receipt of unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension, disability benefit and disabled person's maintenance allowance.

      <P>They must be examined within the overall budgetary context, standing as they do, cheek by jowl, with the abolition of third-level fees which I welcome in principle.  Nevertheless it serves to put the level of these increases to the poorest into sharp focus.  The abolition of third-level fees will mean that, per child, people who can satisfy the means test, the better off, will be the only people who will benefit to the tune of £40 per week.</P>
      <P>According to the Bill, an old age pensioner living alone will benefit by £1.60 per week and £40 per week per child in the case of people who can satisfy the means test for third-level grant purposes. According to my calculation the daughter of one Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry lawyer is worth 27 old age pensioners on the Democratic Left scale of values.  The moral would appear to be that the more loudly a party trumpets its left wing ideology in Opposition the quicker it abandons it in power; action is in inverse proportion to rhetoric, that is the new law.  Democratic Left and Labour are the ultimate political acrobats, maintaining their balance by doing the opposite from what they say.</P>
      <P>The buzz word used by Democratic Left in Opposition was &ldquo;targeting&rdquo;.  All sides of the House accept that resources are not inexhaustible.  At least they have kept part of their promise in that respect &mdash; they have targeted the better off, have framed a budget and its accompanying Social Welfare Bill to target resources at the more affluent at the expense of the weakest, the latter being targeted only in as much as it will be they who will pay.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister of State and I hope she will do a good job, but the accolades end there. Given the involvement of Democratic Left in Government, the less well off in our society thought they would benefit greatly.  They thought there would be a crock of gold when the rainbow coalition took up office.  Unfortunately, their great expectations, particularly of the Minister for Social Welfare, who was their friend, their champion and their succour, did not materialise.  The crock of gold they anticipated came in the form of a 2.5 per cent increase for the single unemployed, widows and old age pensioners.  It could be said that the Democratic Left, like a banana, went in green, turned yellow and came out shop-soiled or perhaps the order should be reversed.  It must be accepted that the 2.5 per cent increase for the social welfare category will not keep pace with the rate of inflation, particularly having regard to changes in recent weeks. Everybody is amazed that they were let down by the Government.  The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn had an opportunity not to give Democratic Left an inch, ensure on this occasion that they would give it as little as possible, so that the poor in the electorate would note that the necessary resources would not be given to the Minister for Social Welfare with responsibility for this Bill <Col N="57" /> to provide adequate increases in social welfare&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the supplementary benefit allowance paid by health boards, an area in which I have a particular interest.  The Minister of State will recall that in 1989 the amount of money paid in supplementary welfare allowances was in the order of £7 million and I understand that figure will increase to £57 million, an extraordinary increase.  The Minister of State will also recall that the supplementary welfare allowance was introduced to deal with emergencies, but effectively it is dealing with the housing crisis because not enough local authority houses are being built.  That problem existed when we were in office and still exists today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the supplementary welfare allowance, £57 million will be paid directly into the pockets of private landlords.  The health boards do not have the opportunity to cross reference information with the Revenue Commissioners and, therefore, we are not getting any return on this money by way of taxation.  That area is worth examining.  The value for money being derived from such health board payments should be closely scrutinised.  In a study I carried out of the total amount paid in rent supplement I established that 69 per cent of recipients of rent supplement were single with no dependants, an astronomical figure.  A further breakdown of figures reveal that the married sector received 12 per cent of that payment and cohabiting couples received 3 per cent.  The age profile for that allowance is significant, 5 per cent <Col N="58" /> of those who receive rent allowance are under 20 years of age, 28 per cent are between the ages of 20 and 25 and 23 per cent are between the ages of 26 and 30.  It is time that scheme was examined to ascertain if the problems in that area are being addressed.  A young person in receipt of social welfare benefit living at home is means tested and up to now has received as little as £19 or less.  I admit the minimum payment has been increased to £25 in the budget, but that still does not resolve the problem. Effectively, the Minister for Social Welfare and the Minister of State will have to ascertain whether, as part of an economic policy, we are deliberately splitting families.  Young people who live at home would be better off financially renting accommodation, receiving a full social welfare unemployment assistance payment and a substantial sum towards the payment of private rented accommodation. The present policy is one of economic madness.  This issue should be addressed immediately as it has major consequences for families in terms of the break-up of homes and the structured environment within which people live is being broken down for economic reasons.  The present policy does not make good sense and the Minister should address it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the back-to-work scheme and the employment scheme operated by the Department of Social Welfare.  I am aware that 70 people were called to participate in a community enterprise programme.  Of that figure only 50 turned up and five were willing to take up places.  Why did the rest of those people not turn up and why did they not have an interest in it?  Is the Minister interested in establishing the reasons?  The back-to-work scheme and the enterprise scheme operated by the Department of Social Welfare are not enjoying the same success as the predecessor of those schemes, the enterprise allowance scheme run by FÁS.  The Minister of State should consider an anomaly in the enterprise scheme whereby applicants must be over 23 years of age and unemployed for 12 <Col N="59" /> months to qualify and benefit from that scheme.</P>
    <P>Cork FÁS office figures for the enterprise allowance scheme which operated in 1992-93 reveal that 300 people in Cork created employment for themselves under that scheme.  On a national level the figure could be even below 300 and therein lies the difficulty. The Minister of State and her ministerial colleague in the Department of Enterprise and Employment should consider the possibilty of re-establishing the enterprise allowance scheme.  The present scheme does not cater for 18 to 23 year olds in receipt of social welfare benefit and that anomaly has serious consequences in terms of what we wish to achieve, the creation of as many sustainable jobs as possible.  It has been fairly well proved that the previous scheme worked well as a high percentage of the jobs created under that programme were viable, sustainable, long term and provided an opportunity for people to come off the dole and become involved in the real business of creating jobs.</P>
    <P>There were 25,000 people on the live register in Cork in January 1991.  In January 1995, 30,000 people were signing on despite the fact that the number of people on community-social employment schemes had doubled.  This indicates that we are not making the inroads we would all wish.  What is the point in people signing on with FÁS if there is no co-ordination, no take-up of jobs presented and if other people are not matching the number of jobs created under the enterprise allowance scheme?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>A point being missed to some extent in this debate is why the Department of Social Welfare spend so much.  The total Estimate for this year is over £2 billion, of which £801 million is allocated to unemployment assistance. That is a slight reduction on last year, which I hope will be justified, but it constitutes 37 per cent of total expenditure under this Estimate.  The reason is that so far we have been remarkably <Col N="60" /> unsuccessful in expanding total employment. Any debate on social welfare that does not at least refer to that and draw some lessons from it is a little unreal.</P>
      <P>If 37 per cent of social welfare expenditure is on unemployment, it behoves us to look at some of the things that prevent us from increasing employment or some of the things that produce unemployment here.  There have been a few cases recently and we will hear more of it in this period of currency turbulence which is less than helpful.  For example, last year we had a long running debate about what was going on in TEAM Aer Lingus.  That came to a conclusion with the production of a rescue plan.  More recently we find that the so-called rescue plan was posited on the expectation that TEAM Aer Lingus could charge somewhere in the region of £45 an hour for the work it was doing. Now we find that its competitors are doing the work for £30 an hour.  The rescue plan was doomed to run into difficulties very quickly and it has with potentially serious consequences for the workers in TEAM Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>We had a continuing dispute and difficulty about the financial position in Packard.  This company suffered competition from two sides: in some cases from other companies who had lower wage rates and perhaps lower productivity than Packard and in others from companies with higher wage rates and much higher productivity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the currency situation I heard a comment on a television news programme one evening recently which illustrated how a company was having difficulties with what is happening to the punt.  I will not name the company because it should not be singled out for analysis.  This company makes food products which it sells to British supermarket chains for retail under their own labels.  It was pointed out that this company bears transport costs that are about three times the level of those borne by its competitors in the UK.  It was also pointed out that the wage rates in the company here are 10 <Col N="61" /> per cent higher than those of its competitors in the UK.  That was presented to us as an explanation for the fact that the company has some difficulties and that the Government here should take some action to remove those difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is fashionable to talk about our transport disadvantage but the plain fact is that we are further away from the main markets for our products than are a great many other people.  That should encourage us to be more competitive and more productive than they are in order to be able to compete with them. It takes the biscuit when we find that wage rates here for a similar operation are higher than elsewhere.  I will not say that is due to one reason only.  It is due in part, I think, to the kind of consensus being built up here over a series of agreements that posits agreement on a level of wage increases as being more important than the absolute level.  That is an unwise policy to follow and one which tends, on the whole, to divorce wage rates from productivity.  It is due also in part to the fact &mdash; this is well documented and much spoken about in the House &mdash; that we take a huge bite from gross pay in taxation and that inevitably creates competition problems. It is because we take such a huge bite in taxation that 37 per cent of our social welfare budget is taken up by unemployment assistance.  As long as we refuse to do anything substantial about the tax wedge in our payments system and about the deficiencies in the &ldquo;consensus&rdquo; approach to wage bargaining in recent years we will continue to have difficulties on the employment front.</P>
    <P>The scene on the social welfare side and the background to the Bill reflects something of an imbalance in this year's budget.  The budget, just as did the four I introduced, tries to do too many things.  The result is that although it tries to do the right thing, it is done on a scale that does not have a huge effect.  If we look at the balance in the expenditure changes in the budget we find that the budget allocated £90 million to social welfare and gave back the equivalent of <Col N="62" /> £177.6 million in taxation and PRSI. About twice as much was given out in tax reliefs and PRSI changes as was given out in social welfare.  I am not criticising the tax reliefs &mdash; far from it &mdash; but there is an imbalance, given our position, which should be pointed out.</P>
    <P>The figure of £90.2 million provided for social welfare does not include the action the Government has commendably taken on the back payments due for equal treatment.  The budget provided a gross figure of £60 million for this year, £50 million of which was funded by balances in the social insurance fund.  The Government has since &mdash; again wisely and commendably &mdash; made a provision of £140 million so that all the arrears can be paid this year by selling off mortgages.  The antics of the Opposition in the House during the past eight days would make a cat laugh. They have been sitting there claiming they do not understand how the Government got it hands on this £140 million.  I would be the last person to claim that I have more wisdom on these matters than the assembled intellectual might of the Fianna Fáil Party but I find no difficulty in understanding the Government's statement on this issue.  I find it totally unmysterious that the Government has adopted this standard practice and put it to an unstandard, unusual and utterly commendable use. Yet the assembled geniuses in the Fianna Fáil Party have put down a priority question today asking how this can be done.  This morning the Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party complained that he had been asking for eight days how this was being done when the whole world and his mother outside the House and most of us on this side of the House have no difficulty in understanding the Government's statement.  I have never seen a more slack brained contribution to a debate on anything.  Fianna Fáil Deputies in sack cloth and ashes should be beating their breasts and asking why they did not think of doing this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It took the Government <Col N="63" /> only a few weeks in office to come up with the answer.  I was amused to see Deputy O'Dea sitting on the Opposition benches while his party was parading its collective conscience before us and wondering about this.  During the recent by-election campaign in Cork North Central &mdash; happily Deputy Lynch was elected &mdash; I met decent Cork women who were entitled to arrears and who had been told personally by Deputy Willie O'Dea that their payments would be made by the end of last year.  He did not have the slightest clue how this would be done, and now that it has been done his party is still trying to understand the astuteness the Government has brought to bear on the matter.  This is a very simple, straightforward, direct and commendable measure and Fianna Fáil should be congratulating the Government for doing what it did not have the wit to do when it was in office.</P>
      <P>I wish to make another point which is small enough in terms of the entire social welfare scene and which I have raised with successive Ministers for Social Welfare.  I am referring to a widow under the pension age whose deceased husband was of pension age and was entitled to a certain number of the free schemes and where she not only has to deal with the trauma of losing her husband but very often finds that her level of income is substantially reduced very quickly.  I gladly acknowledge that in 1994 the then Minister for Social Welfare moved on this issue and extended the scope of the free schemes to cover surviving spouses of old age pensioners between 60-65 years of age. That was an excellent move and many surviving spouses, most of whom are widows, had their situation alleviated by it.  The Minister for Social Welfare kindly pointed this out to me in reply to a question on 21 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had also asked him if he could generalise the system and what it would cost to extend the continuation of those benefits to all surviving spouses of people who had been entitled to the free schemes.  On 21 February he told <Col N="64" /> me he would send me the information as soon as it was available.  I have not yet received it and I ask the Minister of State to jog the memory of his ministerial colleague and inform him that I would still like an answer.  This small step would not cost much and would substantially alleviate not only the financial problems but also the psychological trauma for a number of surviving spouses.  I fully recognise that hard cases make bad law.  However, I always follow up that statement by saying that bad law makes hard cases.  In some cases there may be a large age gap between a husband and a wife and the woman may be widowed at a relatively young age.  I know a woman in her 40s who was recently widowed and who has been left with a number of children, some of whom have disabilities.  Her level of income has been reduced and her access to certain benefits has been cut off under the system.  Substantial progress was made in the area in 1994 and I am very glad to acknowledge that. However, we have another bit to go and it would not disrupt any year's budget if this was done.</P>
    <P>I am glad some progress has been made in regard to the rate of unemployment assistance paid to young people still living at home.  This year the minimum rate has been increased from £10 to £25.  I ask the Government to think again about the rationale behind this set of rules.  Children cease to be regarded as dependants from the age of 18 if they are not in full-time education.  I welcome the provision in the Bill which extends support for children in full-time education up to the age of 21.  While this is a very good idea, children who are not in full-time education cease to be regarded as dependants and if they are unemployed, drawing unemployment assistance and still living at home they are regarded as beneficiaries of the family income even though the other provisions of the social welfare system specifically does not regard them as dependants.  Deputy Quill referred to young people who feel compelled to resort to the stratagem of moving out of <Col N="65" /> home and getting a flat and rent subsidy in order to qualify for the full personal rate of unemployment assistance.  I am sure the Minister of State and Deputy Browne know as well as I do that in some cases a good deal of ingenuity is deployed in order to make it appear that that is the situation and there is bad feeling all around.  I suggest to the Government that once we no longer regard children as dependants for the purposes of any part of our social welfare system we should apply that logic across the social welfare system, treat them as adults in their own right and give them the entitlements to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government on the improvements in the carer's allowance scheme, which is very worthwhile both socially and psychologically in terms of morale for many people in the community. However, the income disregard of £100 per week for the caring spouse is still rather low, especially when one considers that it is set at that level for somebody who is caring for an incapacitated spouse who does not have any social welfare entitlement.  People in that situation are still living on what we used to call very short commons and further consideration should be given to providing additional assistance for them.</P>
    <P>While improvements have been made in recent years there are still too many different approaches to means testing for various purposes.  For example, we have different approaches to third level education grants, social welfare etc.  A greater effort should be made to bring more coherence and unity of approach into the system.  My constituency colleague, the Minister of State, has a particular brief in respect of the integration of the taxation and social welfare systems and as part of that brief could, perhaps, examine the way means tests are constructed.</P>
    <P>I would also like more attention to be given to the way we assess the value of capital for means testing purposes. Section 23 provides for disregarding, in <Col N="66" /> certain circumstances, the capital value of property where the property is not personally used for a limited period, for example, because of illness.  When we reach the point of asking people seeking State assistance if they are using their property or if it has been unused for some time because of illness, and assess their assistance in that light, we are down to the fine details of rather excessive and almost mischievous and pointless intrusion into people's lives.  Like other Members, I am aware of cases where the method used for assessing the value of capital produces an answer that gives a notional return on the capital that is larger than the stream of income earned by the owner of the capital.  In that context we are oppressing people rather than helping them.  I would like the Minister of State and his Department to pay more attention to rationalising the system.</P>
    <P>Progress is being made, albeit slowly, in a number of areas, but I hope in the next budget the Government will resist the temptation to cover so many areas and instead concentrate its efforts on a few.  A programmed approach to a number of the difficulties in the social welfare area could yield better results in terms of satisfaction of the beneficiaries and a contribution to employment expansion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne (Wexford) Mr. Browne (Wexford)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  As the Minister said yesterday, total social welfare spending for 1995 will pass the £4 billion barrier for the first time, working out at approximately £11 million per day being spent on social welfare. That spells out clearly the dependency of people on social welfare payments, the need for the Government and the Department of Social Welfare to get value for money, to ensure that social welfare payments are spread evenly and reach those who require them.  Our serious unemployment problem &mdash; probably our greatest social evil &mdash; goes hand in hand with social welfare payments.  There are approximately 135,000 people long term unemployed, <Col N="67" /> that is unemployed for a year or more. Many are unemployed for much longer.</P>
      <P>As was the case at the end of 1994, 1993 and 1992, at the end of this year the long term unemployed will remain long term unemployed, despite the plethora of schemes that have been introduced.  I often wonder what value we are receiving from such schemes which are supposed to help solve our unemployment problem.  We have set up Leader programmes, county enterprise boards, partnership programmes, county development offices, job facilitators, FÁS, the new localised employment service announced by the Minister a few weeks ago and centres for the unemployed.  Yet the long term unemployed remain long term unemployed. I am not blaming this Government, when we were in Government the same applied.  New boards and structures are set up annually, sometimes two or three per annum, but if I take a number of unemployed people to Wexford tomorrow morning they cannot walk into one office and receive all the advice or information they need.  In Wexford County Council, the county development team operates from one office and the county enterprise board from another, even though they are both located in the County Hall.  The Leader programme operates from an office a mile out the road and other offices are located in Enniscorthy.  I fail to understand why we cannot have one-stop-shops in every county to help those who want to go back to work or create jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is far too much bureaucracy and red tape attached to the system. Chief executives will be appointed to the county enterprise boards and the Leader programme and county development officers and other staff will also be appointed.  Much of the money which should be used to provide jobs for the unemployed is being used to create five or six bureaucratic systems in each county.  It is time for some Government to seriously examine if all those bodies could operate from one office, under <Col N="68" /> the one staff and chief executive.  We should stop the wasteful expenditure on all those boards.  In most cases those new posts are merely copperfastening jobs for people who are already in well paid jobs.  Staff from county councils and health boards frequently take up the posts of chief executive in these new structures.  I have yet to see a long term unemployed person, even though he or she might be a graduate, securing the post of secretary or chief executive in any of those boards.  If we are serious about tackling the unemployment problem and reducing the amount of social welfare payments, we must examine the structures we have set up for job creation purposes in recent years.  With more than 135,000 people long term unemployed we are failing in our duty to create jobs.</P>
    <P>The social welfare benefits paid out by the Government are miserly and an insult to those who will receive them. Old age non-contributory pensioners will receive an increase of £1.50 per week, deserted wives will receive an increase of £1.50 per week and the lowest rate of adult dependant payment will increase by 90p per week.  Those on supplementary welfare allowance and the lone parents allowance, with one child, will receive a miserable increase of £1.50 per week while the long term and short term unemployed will receive an increase of £1.50 per week.  The Government appears to be stuck on an increase of £1.50 per week.  This is at a time when we are told our finances are in the best position for 25 years.  A current budget surplus was recorded in 1994, the first in 27 years.  The 1995 budget returns to the policy of planned current deficits of £310 million and plans for a total Exchequer borrowing for the year of £813 million.  As the Government had plenty of money to allocate to the various sectors, one would have expected a greater allocation to people on social welfare payments.  The people who made the sacrifices in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the low income earners and the people on social welfare, should be rewarded and have their pay returned <Col N="69" /> to parity now that the country is in a good financial position.</P>
    <P>Between 1987 and 1994 business was booming, employers made huge profits and the majority of the farming community did well, but they did not give a good return.  The number of jobs created was not commensurate with the benefits businesses gained from low interest rates and inflation and the generally good economic climate.  The people who could have created jobs held on to their profits instead of ploughing them back into their companies. They did not respond to the efforts of the Government to create the climate in which the number of jobs could have been increased.  That has to be criticised particularly as most of those people will again benefit under this Government while people on social welfare will have nothing to shout about.</P>
    <P>There were some good features in the budget.  I welcome the fact that the carers' allowance can be more easily paid to people who deserve it.  The means testing of the carers' allowance was too tight in the past and the many people looking after the elderly received little in return.  For the sake of a couple of pounds over the limit they were denied any allowance.  We are told that it costs between £600 and £700 a week to keep an old person in hospital, but by paying the carers' allowance, those people can be looked after at home at a great saving to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I welcome the changes made by the Minister in regard to unemployment assistance for young people living at home.  The Minister should have gone further.  The means testing of young people who live at home is a false economy.  These young people get anything from £15 to £25 a week yet if they move out of their family home to a flat they automatically get full unemployment assistance and, in addition, between £35 and £40 in rent assistance from the local community welfare officer.  I am baffled by the idea that that <Col N="70" /> makes sound economic sense.  The Minister has made an effort to change it &mdash; previous Ministers did not.</P>
    <P>Giving the full rate of unemployment assistance to young people living at home would result in major savings to taxpayers and the Departments of Social Welfare and Health.  In most cases they are dependent on unemployment assistance because their parents are in the middle income bracket, pay the highest rate of tax and PRSI, have a mortgage and do not have a medical card.  Their weekly outgoings are very big but because their total income is taken into account their son or daughter receives only the reduced rate of unemployment assistance.  I would be the first to compliment the Minister if he were to pay these young people the full rate of unemployment assistance instead of forcing them out of their family homes, where they could be of some benefit.</P>
    <P>I understand that the payment of disabled person's maintenance allowance will be taken over by the Department of Social Welfare.  In the South Eastern Health Board region a cheque is sent every Thursday or Friday to Kilkenny and, if the post is delayed, the cheque might not arrive until the following Monday or Tuesday.  It is ridiculous that the health boards cannot see their way to issuing disabled persons with a book similar to that given to an old age pensioner. I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, to issue books to people in receipt of diabled person maintenance allowance as soon as the change-over takes place so that they are not treated as second class citizens. Instead of waiting and hoping that their cheque will arrive on time they should be able to go to the post office with their book and claim their benefit when it is due.</P>
    <P>I welcome the equality payments to women.  It seems the Minister will avail of the local loans fund to pay this money.  There are many views about this and the legality of the Minister's decision has been questioned.  I am sure the Government, with the best legal <Col N="71" /> advice available to it, will not do anything unlawful.  I am no economic genius, but I read in one of the Sunday papers that if the Minister were to sell off the local loans fund to a building society or a bank he would be able to pay the equality payments and have money left over.  Local authorities have been sympathetic to people with council loans who get into difficulties, and councils have been known to extend loans for a year or to freeze the arrears for a year or two and allow people to continue making current payments.</P>
    <P>I hope that what the Minister intends to do will not affect that because that would be disastrous for the thousands of low income families who, from time to time, have to make representations to their politicians to get the local loans officer to make certain adjustments in hardship cases to the conditions of their loans.  For one reason or another they may seek to have the loan frozen for a certain period.  In general the county councils adopt a flexible and compassionate approach to such requests and in most cases the family concerned will eventually pay off the arrears.  If the Minister transfers responsibility for the local loans fund to an independent body which is only interested in making big profits it may not adopt such a flexible or compassionate approach.  The banks and building societies do not adopt such an approach to any of their customers when loan payments are in arrears.  No matter what happens I ask the Minister to ensure that the local authorities will continue to be in a position to recommend to whoever takes over responsibility for the local loans fund that they should allow house owners some breathing space and time to pay off the arrears.</P>
    <P>When the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, was on this side of the House he heavily criticised the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition Government and the Fianna Fáil-Labour Coalition Government for failing to provide sufficient increases in social welfare despite the fact that the <Col N="72" /> increases ranged from 3 to 6 per cent. Now that he is in the hot seat in the Department of Social Welfare he should consider encouraging the Minister to increase the figure of 2.5 per cent to 3.5 or 4 per cent.  Are we saying to the poor that although the national finances are in the best state for 27 years they do not count and are not in the thoughts of the Government?  The Government has no interest in the less well off, the poor and old age pensioners.  The Minister of State should make a name for himself by stating this is unacceptable and that changes will be made before this Bill is passed by the Dáil to ensure that these people are looked after.  While the Bill contains a number of positive measures which will be of benefit, the increases in social welfare payments to the less well off and the most vulnerable sections of society are inadequate.</P>

      <P>I compliment Deputy Browne on what was for the most part an enlightening and positive speech.  It is a pity he deviated from this approach and went down the road followed by his colleagues during the past four to five weeks.  Since the budget the only thing the Fianna Fáil Party has been able to do is make derogatory remarks about the increase of 2.5 per cent.  My colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, will deal with this matter at some considerable length when he replies to the debate.</P>
      <P>Deputy Browne referred to the disabled person's maintenance allowance which may be paid by way of a payable order book issued by the health boards. This is a more reliable system which makes for fewer mistakes.  A person will find it much easier to travel to a post office than wait for the post to arrive. That is not intended as a criticism of An Post.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad that members of the Opposition have adopted a negative attitude. One of the reasons for this is that they want to cloak the negative measures they introduced when they held the <Col N="73" /> reins of power.  Let me remind them of some of the consequences of their actions.</P>
    <P>On the question of the taxation of social welfare benefit, the subject of an ongoing debate, the previous Government decided to tackle this problem but only succeeded in exacerbating it by punishing those who decided to return to work.  I have spent the past five to six weeks trying to unravel the atrocious difficulties which have been created and which I hope, with my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, we will be able to resolve.</P>
    <P>Let me give a classic example.  If a deserted wife in receipt of a lone parent's allowance of up to £64 per week decides in mid year to return to work for which she will receive an income of £80 per week, as a result of the decision made by the previous Government the social welfare payments she received in the first part of the year will be added to the income she will receive from employment and she will be taxed on the combined income. She will receive a tax free allowance of £15 per week approximately.  Such a system militates against the rights of the individual and fails to provide any incentive to return to work.</P>
    <P>The two Members sitting opposite are well aware that this anomaly exists.  I took the liberty of speaking to the former Minister for Social Welfare to inquire if he has any secrets which would be of help in resolving the difficulties created by the introduction of this system.  In addition, the projected savings to the Exchequer are highly questionable for the simple reason that at the end of the tax year the individual concerned will be entitled to apply to the Revenue Commissioners for a tax refund.  The system is, therefore, unworkable and I fail to understand why it was introduced.  There is no question that it cannot continue although I do not know to what extent we will be able to address the problem in the short term.</P>
    <P>Let us take another example.  A person who has had to leave the workforce <Col N="74" /> for a certain period due to a serious illness and is in receipt of sick benefit, as in the case of the deserted wife, will be penalised on their return to work.  Their tax free allowances will be slashed because of the decision of the previous Government to tax social welfare benefit. What annoys me intensely is that not a word was mentioned about those atrocities in the past few weeks by the people on the opposite side of the House.  Surely somebody must have brought it to their attention in the period since last April, when these measures became operable for the first time.  By the middle of last year it must have been patently obvious to the then Minister for Social Welfare that serious anomalies existed and that people would be seriously disadvantaged as a result of the operation of that system.</P>
    <P>There has been ongoing debate about taxation of social welfare benefits but at every meeting I have attended recently with trade unionists, employers and public representatives this issue has arisen.  The reality is that the scheme, as set out by the previous Minister for Social Welfare, is inoperable.  It cannot and will not work.  It militates seriously against people who wish to work and it also penalises, in a most outrageous way, people who, through no fault of their own, become ill and may require hospitalisation in the course of a particular year.  Some alleviating measures already have been introduced in the budget.  I cannot predict to what extent we will be able to address all of these problems in the short term but the Government is patently aware of their existence and dealing with them is its high priority.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer now to the criticisms made about the 2.5 per cent general increase in social welfare payments. Those people who criticise it forget to mention the 35 per cent total increase. When they say that old age pensioners will receive only £1.50 or £1.80 extra per week they should remember the other improvements made to the carer's allowance, the free television licence <Col N="75" /> scheme and so on.  Of course, the Opposition do not make any attempt to refer to those improvements.</P>
    <P>During the budget debate the Leader of the main Opposition party suggested an across-the-board 3 per cent increase. That was a fair and reasonable suggestion but the irony is that by virtue of bringing forward the initial payment dates for the increases to the earlier date now proposed, the recipients will actually get more than 3 per cent.  I realise that will only apply to this year but that is the reality.  If members of the Opposition want to refer to the present year &mdash; they certainly have not referred too often to their own responsibilities in previous years &mdash; they should at least identify the positive aspects of the budget.</P>
    <P>The other issue which has taken up some considerable time and energy on the Opposition benches is that of equality payments to women, an issue which has been contentious for some time.  The Government has made the correct decision in that regard.  Notwithstanding decisions of the courts, it could have decided to postpone dealing with this matter for a further four or five years.  What began originally as quite a small problem involving a cost of perhaps £20 million to £50 million could have progressed to a stage where the cost of dealing with it would have been £500 million or perhaps £1 billion in ten or 12 years time.  The Government has decided to take the bull by the horns and deal with this issue once and for all in the course of this year and next year. It should be congratulated for that because if it had postponed dealing with it, like many other issues, it would have become greater and more expensive to address.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies &mdash; perhaps with tongue in cheek &mdash; raised the question of where the necessary money will come from and made references to the local loans fund.  I accept the point made by Deputy Browne earlier in relation to the manner and method of the operation of local loans through the local authorities. <Col N="76" /> The proposed system will not change in any way the manner and method of collection; it will be equally amenable from the point of view of the general public, as it was previously.  Nobody would suggest that we should devise a system which would militate against the people currently dependent on the resources of the local loans fund.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil was amazed at the suggestion that the local loans fund be privatised but it did that during the time of the last local authority tenant purchase scheme.  At that time, applicants for the scheme had to refer, first, to the banks and building societies where previously this was dealt with by the local loans fund.  For the benefit of those on the opposite side of the House who should know more about these matters, since 1987 the Housing Finance Agency has become a dominant player in that particular area.  In fact, the particular sell-off in this instance could be underaken by the Housing Finance Agency, the National Treasury Management Agency or by somebody else if they were willing to pay more.  Obviously, the highest bidder is the one that must be entertained in these sort of circumstances.</P>
    <P>I could mention other positive aspects of the budget but I would need more time than what is available to us for debate on this Bill.  One area that has caused confusion and created poverty traps and obstacles to employment is the discrepancy between the taxation and social welfare codes.  This matter is receiving direct and positive attention by the Government.  It is an area that is part of my responsibility through the work of the expert group currently examining the possible integration of the social welfare and taxation codes. That will have the effect of setting out a framework within which it will be possible to devise a system that will be fair to those employed and eliminate the multiplicity of swings and balances that have existed over the years in the social welfare and taxation systems.  Instead of working independently, the two systems will be married so as to eliminate any possibility of conflict in those areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="77" /> A measure that has been welcomed, belatedly, by some Opposition speakers is the improvement in child benefit.  This is regarded by the Government as an area of priority and it is hoped that the maximum impact will be made on the finances of the family by its being specifically targeted.  It will ensure that the maximum amount of money is made available to those who need it most. Deputy Ó Cuív seemed to put forward the suggestion that these increases should have gone only to some families and should have been means tested. That is an indication of the thinking on the opposite side of the House in relation to what should be done in this area.  It is obvious, because it would have been means tested, that only some women would have received an increase in child benefit if Fianna Fáil had been in power.  Surely if benefit is to be paid, women are equally entitled to it.  Fianna Fáil should qualify what Deputy Ó Cuív said and indicate what it has in mind as to who should qualify in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have recently announced the Government's decision to introduce arrangements to give full effect to the decision of the High Court in relation to the equality payments for married women affected by the delay in implementing the 1979 Equal Treatment Directive.  Under these arrangements, the estimated 70,000 married women involved will receive payments on the basis of the rules applied to married men in the period of delay in implementing the Directive.  These payments will consist of increases for adult and child dependants and unemployment assistance, and they will also receive the transitional payments as provided for in the court's decision.  In addition, compensation will be payable based on the increase in the consumer price index from the date of entitlement in December 1984 onwards to the date on which the payments are made.</P>
      <P>The total costs of these arrangements are estimated at some £260 million, of which up to £200 million will be paid by the end of 1995.  The remaining payments, estimated at £60 million, will be paid from January 1996 onwards over as short a period as possible.  All the married women involved will receive payments on account by September next at the overall cost estimated at £110 million. Further payments on account will be made up to the end of December 1995 at a cost of £90 million.</P>
      <P>A special unit is being set up in my Department to process the payments in question.  All the women who have received payments under the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992 (S.I. No. 152 of 1992), will be notified of the arrangements for the payment of arrears and an extensive advertising campaign will also be undertaken over the coming weeks.  In addition, a special telephone inquiry unit is being set up in the Department to deal with inquiries from the married women concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a means of funding these payments the Department of Finance will sell a portion of the debt owing to the <Col N="79" /> local loans funds to the Housing Finance Agency or the National Treasury Management Agency.  The technical term for the procedure is securitisation. It will not affect in any way the agreements between mortgage holders and local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that this payment will be made.  Will the Minister clarify the system of payment of £140 million through the local loans fund?  He said on the radio a couple of weeks ago that this fund would be capitalised; now we are told it will be securitised. Why was the money not borrowed directly by the Exchequer?  Will the money not have to be borrowed as part of public service borrowing rather than direct Exchequer borrowing? What is the need for this sleight of hand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not an economist and I do not know &mdash; I do not know whether Deputy Walsh knows &mdash; the difference between capitalised and securitised.  There is a £449 million debt owing to the local loans fund.  That is a fund from which moneys were loaned to local authorities.  The moneys in the fund were borrowed by the State to pass on to local authorities.  The local authorities in turn lent the money to people buying houses through local authority loans.  The £490 million due to this fund will be paid by borrowers to local authorities who in turn will pass the money to the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income stream from local authorities will be sold, I expect, to the HFA or the NTMA.  It may be sold to a private institution; it depends on the offers received.  One set of debt is being swapped for another.  As a State we owe £260 million to 70,000 married women who have been denied their rights since 1979.  In turn we are owed £490 million by local authorities and we are simply bringing forward the income from that debt to pay the debt we owe to women. No offer to buy the debt will be entertained by the Government which would <Col N="80" /> change the relationship between the mortgage holder and the local authority. The only change will be that instead of the local authority paying the money to the Department of Finance, it will pay the money to the agency which acquires the debt concerned.  I do not think I can make the position clearer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the income stream; I understand it is in the order of £55 million per annum. How much of that income stream accrued to the Department of Social Welfare?  As a result of the latest transaction, what element of that will accrue to the Department in the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There are all sorts of income streams to the Department of Finance, ranging from PAYE tax, capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax, corporation profits tax and profits from various State companies, including the local loans fund.  I am sure it would be impossible to define what proportion of that income stream would be allocated to the Department of Finance.  I am proud that of the expected income stream this year I have managed to get £212 million for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>I am not talking about the overall income stream, I am trying to elucidate how much thinking went into this whole matter.  The Minister said he does not know the answer but I want him to find out how much money accrued to the Department of Social Welfare from this income stream &mdash; I am referring to the £55 million per annum from the £490 million fund. What will the result of the transaction be?  Will there be a charge against the Department of Social Welfare in the annual estimates or will there be a reduction in services?  There will either have to be a reduction in services or an increase in borrowing by his Department as a result of this way of raising money.</P>

      <P>I can appreciate <Col N="81" /> fully why the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on social welfare is unwilling to acknowledge that this Government has finally, in spite of the ham-fisted way the previous administrations in which the Fianna Fáil Party held the social welfare portfolio handled the issue of equality payments, set about resolving a debt to the married women who have been denied their rights since 1979.  It would be more gracious for the Fianna Fáil spokesperson to acknowledge that the party made a complete hames of the issue of equality treatment and forced women into the courts to establish their right to this money.  This Government, of which I am proud to be a part is finally paying the married women concerned their entitlements in this regard. If Fianna Fáil administrations in the past had attempted to find the money to pay this debt earlier, it would have been much less than £260 million.  Had it been paid up front back in the early eighties it would have cost the State only £18 million instead of the £260 million it is now costing us.  That is a gross mismanagement of resources and the taxpayers money.  At this stage the Deputy should move on to the next question as he will be only increasingly embarrassed by the facts.</P>

Is this not a clear breach of <Col N="82" /> the Government's programme.  <i>A Government of Renewal</i> where it is stated quite specifically that over the period of this programme it is intended that the growth of current supply services spending will be constrained to a maximum of 6 per cent?

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 24 together.  The Government has welcomed the National's Forum's sixth report, Quality Delivery of Social Services.  The report focuses on improving the quality of delivery of a variety of social services. In particular the report focuses on services in the areas of social welfare, health, housing, and on services provided by FÁS and by An POST on an agency basis for my Department.  The report is particularly welcome at this time when the Government is pursuing a radical programme of legislative and administrative reform to ensure that the interests of the citizen are paramount in the development of our public services.</P>
      <P>The Government has referred the report to the Minister for Finance for examination by the Minister of State at his Department to assess the implications of the various recommendations with a view to formulating a co-ordinated response.  My Department will play a full part in this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="84" /> On the specific recommendations of the forum it is worth nothing that my Department has made significant strides in a number of areas, through a process of modernisation and improvements over the past number of years and, indeed, this has been acknowledged in the NESF report.</P>
    <P>The Strategic Management Initiative presents an opportunity to build on these developments.  Central to this initiative is the improvement in the delivery of services with the aim of ensuring value for money, high standards of service, efficiency, courtesy and accountability.</P>
    <P>A better and more caring service for people is the key feature of my Department's action programmes.  The objective is to foster a customer-service culture. A strong programme of action over the next few years to build on the progress made to date will include the following: transforming social welfare offices into local one-stop-shops where people can access all the information and services they need; expanding new payment facilities; a concerted drive to simplify social welfare supports, access to them, and information about them; improved access to services through upgrading public offices, better sign-posting and more privacy facilities; better information about entitlements in individual circumstances, the means of redress if dissatisfied and the right of appeal; greater involvement and participation for people in matters concerning the delivery of the services.  Customer service advisory groups are being set up to get regular customer feedback about services.</P>
    <P>The efficiency and effectiveness of the services for people will be measured and the best practices in financial management will be introduced.</P>
    <P>Local access to the full range of social services is an important objective of my Department's action programme.  A continuing programme of investment in accommodation is resulting in an ever growing number of modern offices.  My Department is in the process of modernising its computer systems in its local <Col N="85" /> offices, to support a wider range of information facilities for people.  This is a programme that will go on throughout the rest of this year.</P>
    <P>We will continue to build on these changes and to enhance the employment support services and facilities for the community and voluntary sectors at local level.  Every opportunity is being taken to co-operate with both statutory and other agencies operating in complementary welfare fields.</P>
    <P>In summary, my aim is for an efficient, professional and responsive system that will serve the needs of all those who come in contact with the social welfare system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to implementing the main recommendations of this report. While acknowledging that some considerable improvements have been made in social welfare in recent years, it is still a humiliating experience for recipients who have to go into a dingy office, call to a hatch and have no great privacy.  The least that is needed in all offices is a confidential consulting room and a reduction in the degree of bureaucracy as these people in many cases are the least well off not only financially but educationally.  Only 20 per cent of people sign on a weekly basis for unemployment benefit or assistance.</P>

      <P>Legislation governing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme allows a health board to make a single payment to meet an exceptional need including assistance with the cost of clothing.  Such payments are made normally to persons in receipt of social welfare or health board payments. Health boards recognise that Confirmation and Communion times <Col N="86" /> involve families in additional expense and all boards assist with such costs under this provision.  Health boards decide each application on its merits having regard to the income and circumstances of the applicant.  I have no plans to introduce an alternative statutory scheme at present.</P>

      <P>There is a trend emerging whereby schools encourage children for First Holy Communion or Confirmation to wear their school uniforms.  We should welcome and encourage that. However, there still appears to be need for the kind of scheme I described in the question.  Is the Minister aware that sometimes families are not paid until well after the event and parents are forced to borrow money which they must pay back with interest?  Can the Minister take steps to enable payments to be made well in advance of the event so that people shop around, get the best value for money and obviate the necessity to borrow from credit unions and other such lenders?</P>

      <P>I appreciate that parents who have children for Communion or Confirmation face a particularly expensive time.  I welcome any move by schools to encourage the wearing of school uniforms on these occasions.  As we know, there is a lot of competition in dressing children for these events.  They are important occasions for the children and for the family.  If we were to introduce a statutory scheme it would have to be on a non-denominational basis.  It could not be available only for Communion and Confirmation ceremonies.  There are other religious denominations in society and we need to be conscious of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current back to school allowances developed in an <i>ad hoc</i> way in much the same way as assistance for children making their first Holy Communion or Confirmation is evolving.  We need to look at it carefully from a cost point of view.  I would be concerned if parents who qualify for this kind of assistance do not receive it on time and <Col N="87" /> have to borrow.  I would be interested in hearing any cases the Deputy might have so that I could check them.  There are many reasons payments might be late.  It may be that parents did not apply in time, were unaware of the facility until late in the day or that, on first application, they were not entitled to it and appealed the decision.  The appeals system for supplementary welfare allowance can be quite slow.  I am trying to improve that area and will seek ways to prevent undue delays in future.</P>

      <P>The Minister has given a thoughful reply.  He said he is not prepared to bring in a statutory scheme and I accept that.  Does he accept that there is ample scope for improving the scheme as currently administered?  I will provide him with examples.  Will the Department carry out an investigation into this scheme to see how improvements can be made?</P>

It is an important scheme for thousands of families and individuals.  It evolved over time on the basis of need and should be fundamentally reviewed and reformed. I will do that as quickly as I can.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 16 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The persistence of poverty and social <Col N="88" /> exclusion in our society in the face of favourable economic conditions is indicative of the complexity of the issue. It has become increasingly apparent that the best way to tackle this persistence and eliminate poverty is to adopt a strategic approach.</P>
    <P>Speaking on behalf of the Government at the United Nations World Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen earlier this month.  I made a commitment to implement proposals to substantially reduce overall poverty in the shortest possible time and to reduce inequalities.  I am at present considering how best to implement a strategy in this area.  The formulation of the strategy will take place in partnership with the non-governmental organisation sector and with the active participation of target groups.  As an initial step, I am forming a small co-ordinating group to do some preliminary planning in this regard.  This group will include representatives from the Combat Poverty Agency, officials from my Department and my special adviser.</P>
    <P>The process of consultation with relevant organisations including the Combat Poverty Agency, community groups and organisations representing the unemployed will get under way shortly and it is intended to have the national strategy in place by the end of 1996.</P>
    <P>I have already begun the process of addressing social exclusion and poverty in the recent budget with a significant improvement in child benefit; in Ireland, households with children have a higher risk of poverty than those without children.  I increased the monthly payment for each child by £7 and provided for a number of other improvements as a first step in tackling poverty effectively and reducing poverty and unemployment traps.</P>
    <P>An overall comprehensive strategy will give impetus and further direction to efforts to combat exclusion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the commitment to publish a strategy to combat poverty.  I do not see why the Minister had to go to Copenhagen to make that <Col N="89" /> statement as it would have been preferable to announce it in the House. However, I welcome it.  Voluntary agencies have a major role to play and are doing tremendous work, not only through offering practical help of a tangible kind but in organising literacy classes for the poorest of the poor to teach them how to read and write. There is still a major difficulty in that regard.  It is well worth making a major input to the area of poverty and exclusion.  The voluntary bodies should have substantial representation in any such group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his appreciation of the announcement of my strategy.  It is intended not only to publish but to implement it.  It is also intended that the voluntary sector will be consulted and involved in its formulation and implementation. We are endeavouring to develop within society a more inclusive way of doing our business, of avoiding exclusion, ensuring that people with disabilities are not excluded, as they are at present and that those few who manage to obtain work are not left for most of their working lives at the bottom rung.</P>
      <P>On why the announcement was made in Copenhagen, the answer is quite simple, the summit took place there, rather than here.  It would not appear to make sense to make the announcement here when the discussion on and negotiation of the declaration were taking place in Copenhagen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While measured by traditional economic indicators, such as growth rates, inflation rates, balance of payments, interest rates and so on, our economy appears to be in a very healthy state, the distribution of the wealth generated by years of economic growth is more problematic and there is evidence of widening disparities within our society.  An example, of the growth in the numbers of long term unemployed is that in 1980, 2.8 per cent of the labour force had been unemployed for one year or more, on the basis of live register data and by <Col N="90" /> 1993 that figure had increased to 10 per cent, based on the report of the National Economic and Social Forum, No. 4, <i>Ending Long-Term Unemployment,</i> of June 1994.  Despite economic growth, clearly there is a growing gap between those who have and those who have not.  The anti-poverty strategy I announced in Copenhagen is intended to address that disparity in the share of wealth created by society.</P>

      <P>While welcoming the Minister's decision to devise and announce a new national anti-poverty strategy and the fact that he will consult directly non-governmental organisations in the drawing up of that strategy &mdash; they have a valuable role to play in that process &mdash; he did not mention a particular group especially disadvantaged, the travelling community.  Would he be prepared to accept that the travelling community have special difficulties in this area?  Will he consider having them represented on any body or group he establishes to implement this strategy?</P>

      <P>Travelling community representatives comprised one of the non-governmental organisations which my Department assisted in travelling to Copenhagen for the United Nations world summit.  They participated actively in the NGO forum there and had an input into the outcome of that conference.  When I met the Irish NGOs in Copenhagen I made it clear I would involve all of them in the widest possible consultative process, in the devising and implementation of this strategy.  No group, whether they represent travellers, people with disabilities or the unemployed, will be excluded from that process.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister publish this study?  What strategy does he intend to use to get the various agencies and Departments &mdash; Social Welfare, Health, Education &mdash; to address this problem in a co-ordinated manner?  For example, due to staff shortages in health <Col N="91" /> boards, many social workers are subjected to extreme pressure.  How will the Minister co-ordinate this diversity of interests in order to produce the best possible service to those who most need it?</P>

On the method we will use, I have set about forming a small co-ordinating and planning group in my Department, which will include some departmental officials and representatives of the Combat Poverty Agency.  My special adviser, Miss Róisín Callender, who is an expert on social policy, will be preparing an outline of the way this issue should be progressed at an early date.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>An integral part of the Department's strategy for improving services for the unemployed has been the phased introduction of more flexible signing on arrangements. Over the past two years weekly signing has been abolished for the vast majority of citizens who are registered as unemployed at social welfare local offices. This change has been made possible by the introduction of alternative pay methods to cash.  Under the new arrangements the majority of unemployed persons are now required to sign on once only each month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more flexible signing arrangements will also be phased in for those who are registered as unemployed at my Department's branch offices.  In this regard a postal draft payment system has been introduced for people in receipt of unemployment benefit at a number of branch offices in recent months.  These now sign on monthly and <Col N="92" /> are paid each week at their local post office.  This system will be introduced for all those signing at branch offices and is dependent on the computerisation of branch offices not currently linked to the Department's main computer network and the completion of negotiations with the Branch Managers' Assocation about changes in work practices. I expect this process to be complete by the end of 1996.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that it is humiliating and degrading for people to have to travel, very often long distances, to sign on at labour exchanges and Garda stations, that there is now urgent need to complete the computerisation process and to introduce cashless offices nationwide?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  Approximately 20 per cent of those who now claim unemployment benefit actually sign on weekly; something of the order of 79,000 sign on at Garda stations, representing a small proportion of the total numbers who sign on.  The move away from weekly signing on is based on a completely different approach from the old one, which was that if somebody did not call at a particular time each week, there was a perceived risk or imputation that they might be working.  My Department is attempting to encourage people to work rather than lock them into unemployment in which respect the back to work scheme operated by my Department has been very successful, enabling participants to retain portion of their unemployment assistance while they work.  It is a completely different cultural approach to unemployment and unemployment assistance.  We endeavour to encourage people to work rather than speak at corners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the move to cashless offices and the collection of benefit from post offices away from the fine new regional centres, such as that in my constituency, has worsened the position regarding the collection of benefit for some people? Instead of collecting their benefits in a large purpose built modern attractive office they must now queue with thousands of others who require a variety of other services in small local post offices. Has the Minister examined this position? Does he believe that the decision regarding the collection of benefit is permanent and that those fine regional offices will provide purely administrative and other functions?  Has he had substantial discussions with An Post about improving its services?</P>

      <P>I am aware of the position, particularly in the Finglas area, to which Deputy Flaherty refers.  One of the first things I did when I became Minister was to inquire why people had to queue, often in the rain, outside the local post office in the main street of Finglas a few doors away from my office.  Arrangements are under way to provide additional space and eliminate the necessity to queue.</P>

      <P>The Minister stated in his reply that people on unemployment benefit receive their payments through the post office.  When will people on unemployment assistance receive their payments through post offices?  Given that there was a gradual spread across the country for the collection of unemployment benefits through the post office why were those on unemployment assistance not allowed to collect <Col N="94" /> their money through the post office?  It appears the present position discriminates against the long term unemployed. In my town those on unemployment benefit can collect their payment through the post office but those on unemployment assistance cannot.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to deal with the disincentive to marriage in the social welfare system arising from the lone parent allowance when a recipient marries another social welfare recipient, particularly for couples who are entirely dependent on social welfare.</Quest>

      <P>The lone parent's allowance provides a payment to a single parent bringing up a child or children and takes account of the special needs of one parent families and the normal outgoings that arise in maintaining a household.</P>
      <P>Special provisions have been made for lone parents in the social welfare code.  For example, particular measures and disregards have been introduced to encourage lone parents to return to the workforce, so that they can be encouraged to become, over time, less reliant on social welfare to meet their income needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social welfare payments generally are structured to take account of household circumstances and in particular in the case of couples, the economies involved in sharing household expenses.  As a result payments to couples by way of weekly payment augmented by <Col N="96" /> increases for adult and child dependants are less than the rates which would be payable if the individuals, also with child dependants lived in separate households.  This is a long standing feature which applies across many of the social welfare schemes and it is not exclusively related to marital status.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for underlying the existing difficulties.  I accept this is a longstanding and major problem.  I accept also the Minister's outline of the great improvements in the lone parent's allowance and the success of the introduction of disregards in allowing people to return to work.  Will the Minister accept that the ideal position, which would not resolve the problem but would help substantially, would be if the concept of dependency was removed from our social welfare system? Has any work been done on that in the Department?  It has been sought by women's and justice groups for some time.  Have any figures been calculated for the cost of such a measure which I am aware would involve a substantial sum?  Would such a measure be a personal priority for the Minister and what are his views on the reality of this happening in the near future?</P>

      <P>My understanding of the introduction of such a measure is that adults would be paid the same rate of social welfare regardless of whether they are cohabiting or married. The formal title given to that approach is &ldquo;individualisation of payments&rdquo;.  My Department is not specifically addressing that area at present, but the working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems is addressing it. That matter is causing great headaches for the working group concerned and I expect it to report some time later this year, I hope by the middle of the year. <Col N="97" /> As soon as we receive it we will address the issue based on or taking account of its recommendations.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that perhaps one of the necessary ironies of the social welfare system in creating valuable schemes to provide assistance is that it appears to create traps?  Does he accept that is the position?</P>
      <P>A disabled young man on disabled person's maintenance allowance in our constituency who is considering marriage was horrified to find that the consequence of moving in with his future wife would be the loss of both their disabled person's maintenance allowance payments of £15 to £20 per week, as a result of moving from two independent payments to husband and dependent. Will the Minister accept this is an issue we have to keep on the agenda, albeit a difficult one to solve?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  An area which needs to be addressed in addition to the question of individualisation of payments is the degree to which we acknowledge that a disability carries an additional cost of living.  If there are two people in wheelchairs, as is the case in the constituency which I share with Deputy Flaherty, they are assessed as if they were mobile.  There is a need to address that issue also.  As Leader of Democratic Left &mdash; if I can put on that hat for a minute &mdash; I believe there should be individualisation of payments for adults on social welfare but I also recognise there are practical difficulties as to how that would be implemented, particularly in the context of the resources available.  As long as upwards of 300,000 people are forced to remain outside the active labour force, the resources available to us to improve matters substantially will be limited.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The sad reality of life today, particularly in urban areas in Dublin, is that in some community care areas 44 per cent of live births are outside <Col N="98" /> marriage.  Will the Minister agree that this is a sad reflection on society? If a young single parent, in receipt of lone parent's allowance, and a male, drawing unemployment assistance, were to cohabit they would lose £26.40. Because of the way in which payments are structured, there is a disincentive to cohabit or to establish permanent loving relationships.  Will the Minister agree it is time to examine the equalising upwards of benefits to rid the system of disadvantage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that issue certainly needs to be addressed.  The advances we have made to ensure that lone parents have a significant amount of income to sustain themselves and the child or children they may have to rear on their own highlight the inadequacies of the generality of other social welfare payments.  The degree to which you maintain a bonus, if that is the right word, for those who are living alone &mdash; they are not all single parents, they may be separated or, although it is rare in Ireland, divorced &mdash; and ensure they have sufficient to live on while rearing children is a question we have to address.  The Constitution guarantees all sorts of rights to women and children but delivering those rights costs money. It is not feasible to approach this issue simply on the basis that you will give everyone the same amount.  If that were done everybody would be levelled down because the resources available to us, even in these good times, would not be sufficient to maintain everybody at the standard level.  The answer is to try to get as many people as possible into the active labour force.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should rephrase the question slightly.  Does the Minister recognise there is a real disincentive for a cohabiting couple because of the potential loss of £26.40 in the case of a lone parent who wishes to cohabit with a person on unemployment assistance? There are other hidden disadvantages in so far as it is easier for a <Col N="99" /> cohabiting couple to obtain local authority accommodation.  Given that the Department of Social Welfare recognises cohabiting couples as the spouses of one another rather than suffer an instantaneous cut-off will they be allowed maintain their combined income for some time before reducing over a period to establish bonding and loving relationships between couples? The children may be the natural offspring of the couple involved.</P>

      <P>In principle I accept the need to address the problem where there is a loss of income.  One parent may have been in receipt of a lone parent's allowance but following their entry into a relationship there is a joint loss of income.  This is only perceived to be a problem where either person was in receipt of a lone parent's allowance.  The difficulty is the extent to which it can be tapered and how the system can be complicated.  I am reluctant to introduce more complications.  I will cerainly look at it and examine whether it is possible to reduce the disparities but I am reluctant to give a commitment that the kind of disparity which can be as much as £30 per week, if the couple had been living apart, can be made up in any substantial way from the resources available to us.  I am totally opposed to levelling down the lone parent's allowances to eliminate this perception of inequity.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is in discussion with the Department of Health and the health boards in relation to the transfer of responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme to my Department.  A detailed assessment is being made of the present arrangements within health boards and the implicaions of transferring the scheme to my Department.  Apart from the assessment of means and the medical assessments which are involved, there is, in addition, a number of broader issues to be addressed, for example, the rehabilitation and training arrangements for recipients of the allowance.</P>
      <P>It is clearly appropriate that the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme is integrated with the income maintenance services of my Department and this is the reason for the take-over. At the same time there will have to be appropriate links with related services operated by health boards and this issue is being addressed in the context of the present discussions.  My intention is to ensure that the new arrangements provide an improved and more streamlined service to people with disabilities and the future administrative arrangements will be designed to achieve this in the most effective and efficient manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the integration of the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme with the income maintenance services of the Department.  The system of means assessment for unemployment assistance recipients is radically different from that for disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients in that the spouse of a disabled person's maintenance allowance recipient cannot earn <Col N="101" /> any income &mdash; any income is deducted from the allowance on a pound for pound basis &mdash; while the spouse of an unemployment assistance recipient can earn up to £60 per week.  Will the Minister consider the introduction of a uniform system of assessment of means for both disabled person's maintenance allowance and unemployment assistance recipients so that spouses can earn an income outside the home, thereby improving the quality of life for both the spouse and the recipient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the complications in transferring the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme to the Department of Social Welfare and integrating it into the mainstream income maintenance programmes of the Department.  For example, means testing is carried out by community welfare officers who investigate the financial circumstances of the client to establish eligibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance.  The main differences between the methods used to assess means for a social welfare scheme and those used by health boards in assessing the means of applicants for disabled person's maintenance allowance relates to (1) assessment of spouses' income for which there is no monetary disregard for disabled person's maintenance allowance while a disregard of £60 per week is allowed for spouses' earnings on social welfare schemes and (2) benefit and privilege which is not assessed for disabled person's maintenance allowance and is assessed for many social welfare schemes.  If one comes in under the current Department of Social Welfare regulations one gains with one hand and loses with the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed that a large proportion of disabled person's maintenance allowance recipients are single and reside with their parents.  If benefit and privilege was to be assessed for disabled person's maintenance allowance there would be significant reductions in the amounts payable to many recipients. One of the tasks of the project group <Col N="102" /> established by the Department of Social Welfare to proceed with the transfer is to seek ways of ensuring that no person currently on disabled person's maintenance allowance will be at a loss as a result of coming in under the Department of Social Welfare.  I cannot give the Deputy precise details on how this will be achieved but it is a specific commitment.</P>
    <P>We have to look seriously at the recognition which must be given to people with the disabilities so that cognisance is taken of the additional costs of people living with a disability whether they are unemployed, in training or in employment.  These are complex issues which will have to be addressed.  My primary intention is to seek to have the system transferred to the Department of Social Welfare and then to seek to eliminate as many of the anomalies as possible.  At present there is no disability allowance for people who are working and who become sick. We have a disability benefit system based on stamps.  An unemployed person may qualify for unemployment benefit based on his contributions or, if he does not have sufficient contributions, he can qualify for unemployment assistance based on means.  There is no disability allowance provision based on means and transferring the disabled person's maintenance allowance to the Department of Social Welfare gives rise to the need to look at this area also.  The transfer of the disabled person's maintenance allowance to the Department of Social Welfare gives rise to a complex set of problems and obviously we are committed to ensuring that we tease out many of these as soon as possible.</P>

I also pay tribute to Deputy O'Hanlon who initiated this transfer during his time in office.  Will the Minister confirm that he will meet the target date of July <Col N="103" /> and that there will be a single means test for disabled person's maintenance allowance and other allowances rather than the ridiculous system whereby officers of the Department of Social Welfare carry out one means test and community welfare officers of the Department of Health carry out other tests?</P>

      <P>I join with the Deputy in congratulating the former Minister for Health, Deputy O'Hanlon on his initiative.  I also congratulate the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, who was instrumental in arranging the agreement to transfer the disabled person's maintenance allowance from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare.  It falls to me, fortunately or otherwise, to follow through on that decision.  I wholeheartedly support this decision and I intend to pursue it as actively as I can.  It is intended to have the transfer completed by the middle of July but we are dealing with eight health boards, all of whom have different ways of dealing with disabled person's maintenance allowance and all of whom act as independent bodies, and it is not a simple task to bring all this together under the Department of Social Welfare. A project group established within my Department and the Department of Health is working on a daily basis to achieve this.  I do not want to mislead the Deputy by implying that the process will be completed by July but we are aiming to achieve the target date.  The work will certainly be under way by July.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regard the means test, I have already outlined the complexities involved in this issue.  Ideally there should be a single means test for medical cards, disabled person's maintenance allowance, unemployment assistance etc., and resources are being wasted in having a range of means tests which result in different incomes for people in virtually the same circumstances, depending on the allowance for which <Col N="104" /> they qualify.  One of my objectives is to rationalise this area but I do not want to do this in a way which results in people with disabilities being worse off than they were before they left the health board.</P>

      <P>On the question of people being worse off, yesterday I put down a question to the Minister for Health about a couple who are worse off under the regulations.  This woman who was in receipt of a carer's allowance for looking after her husband who is on disabled person's maintenance allowance was lucky to get a job. However, as her earnings had to be taken into account their income had been reduced from £131 to £110.  The Minister for Health said that this case highlighted the differences between the assessment of spouses' income under disabled person's maintenance allowance and social assistance schemes.  Will the Minister ensure that people who are lucky enough to get work are not disadvantaged in any way by the complexities of these schemes and will not lose income for trying to help their households?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to give the Deputy such an undertaking. Health board assessment of means for disabled person's maintenance allowance does not provide for any earned income disregard whereas if a person whose spouse is working applies for social welfare benefit a £60 disregard applies.  Under the Social Welfare Bill I am seeking to introduce a system whereby there would be a tapered loss for a person who loses their adult dependant allowance which, ideally, would be pound for pound rather than a sudden loss when they reach the £60 threshold.  My Department and I are committed to ensuring that all people receiving benefits or allowances from the Department of Social Welfare are treated equally in terms of assessment. I want to ensure that a person whose spouse is working qualifies for earned income disregard in the same way as other social welfare applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="105" /> The other side of that coin relates to single people living at home who, as health board beneficiaries, are not assessed for board and privilege, but if they apply for unemployment assistance to the Department of Social Welfare they are.  While married and co-habiting couples may gain under the social welfare system, those living at home with their parents could lose out.  That problem has much wider ramifications. There is much concern about young people being virtually forced out of their homes in order to qualify for unemployment assistance.  I tried to deal with that difficulty in this year's budget by increasing the minimum amount of unemployment assistance for those living at home from £10 to £25.  I am conscious of this problem and I intend to ensure that people do not lose out.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider changing the name of the allowance to &ldquo;disability assistance&rdquo;?  There is unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance and disability benefit but there is no disability assistance.</P>
      <P>While there will be attendant difficulties with any administrative transfer, if disability assistance were treated in the same way as disability benefit people would be entitled to an invalidity pension and hence qualify for benefits and privileges.  The Minister might be able to resolve the problem in that way. However, I appreciate his difficulty with all the benefits and privileges on offer.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's helpful suggestion and I will consider it.  I can foresee a problem in that people on long term disability benefit might object to being transferred to disability assistance.  As the Deputy is aware, people can receive unemployment benefit only for as long as their contributions allow whereas they can obtain long term disability benefit for as long as they can prove they are unfit to return to work, regardless of their contribution record.  I will, however, consider the Deputy's point.</P>

I will ensure that medical assessment for disabled person's maintenance allowance is speeded up.  I spoke earlier about the need to examine how medical assessment will be carried out under the new arrangements.  As the Deputy is aware, while most, if not all, boards operate an informal appeals procedure, there is no formal appeals procedure for disabled person's maintenance allowance, whereas independent appeals procedure is operating exceptionally well in the Department of Social Welfare.  I will seek to ensure that appeals in respect of disabled person's maintenance allowance are dealt with at least as quickly as those currently dealt with by the independent appeals body in the Department of Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>Old age and blind person's pensions have been closely associated since the inception of the latter pension.  Provision of pensions for blind persons was made by amendment of the Old Age Pensions Acts in 1920.  Since then, blind person's pension has operated under the same general means test rules, and is payable at the same rates and in the same way, as old age non-contributory pension.  These arrangements have worked satisfactorily over the years.</P>
      <P>In recent times, my Department has received a specific complaint of the type mentioned by the Deputy.  This indicated that the pension book title was causing concern to some younger blind persons.  As a result it was accepted that the book title should be changed.</P>
      <P>Pensions are paid by books of personalised paying orders which are normally current for six month periods.  In the case of the old age and blind pensioners, their current books expire on 21 April next and renewal books for the six months from 28 April will be issued over the coming weeks.  I have arranged that from and including this book issue all pension books for people in receipt of a blind person's pension will be differentiated from old age pension books. In the case of blind persons, their books from 28 April 1995 will be clearly marked, &ldquo;Blind Person's Pension&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The household budgeting scheme is a free service operated on behalf of social welfare customers by An Post.  People receiving unemployment payments can authorise An Post to deduct regular amounts towards various household bills from their weekly payments.  An Post in turn forward these deductions to the appropriate organisations.</P>
      <P>The scheme is proving to be quite popular with 7,264 people participating at the end of February 1995.  The average amount deducted per person is currently £16.98.  There are 40 local authorities participating in the scheme covering county councils down to urban district councils.  In addition the scheme also covers the ESB, Telecom Éireann and the various gas utilities.  The annual value of the deductions made is £6.4 million.  Not only is this a worthwhile service for social welfare customers but it is also of benefit to the participating organisations in reducing arrears.  I am in favour of the extension of the household budgeting scheme to all social welfare customers as soon as is possible. The main areas currently outside the scheme are lone parents and pensioners. These customers are paid by an order book system and this does not have the same flexibility as the weekly generated payment used for making unemployment payments.</P>

I understand that it may be difficult in the short term to extend that scheme across the board, but the Minister should examine specific areas because the days of evicting people for non-payment of rent are gone and more than 82 per cent of people in local authority houses are maintained solely or mainly by social welfare assistance.  If they are prepared to pay their rent in that way some formula should be found to enable them to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy.  The only reason the scheme has not been extended to lone parents is because they are paid by order book which usually issues to them with 26 weekly payment orders.  These books are generated as a result of a computer tape sent from the Department to a security printer, currently De la Rue Smurfit.  An Post is not involved in the generation of payment, unlike the payment to employed customers.  In the case of the latter payments, they are sent to An Post who, in turn, generate the payment after processing the tape through the household budgeting deduction facility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions are currently under way with An Post and this Department as to the best way to include those paid by payment order book.  Significant changes to the current computer systems that generate these payments would be required and it is likely to be some time before this facility can be offered to lone parents and pensioners. We are examining the situation and are conscious of the need to do so and that the strongest demand for an extension of the scheme is from lone parents who want to have a facility which will save them the worry of holding on to their <Col N="110" /> gas or ESB money until the bill comes fluttering through the letterbox.</P>

    <P>The provisions of the Social Welfare Bill, as announced in the budget, were greeted with widespread disbelief and disappointment.  There were two main reasons hopes were high that the problems of poverty and social exclusion would be addressed in a meaningful and imaginative manner.  On the economic front this budget came after a year in which a current budget surplus was recorded for the first time in 27 years.  It is also set against a background of substantial transfer of resources from the EU.  Besides this, it had been clearly flagged in advance that this Government was not in the business of controlling current spending as evidenced by the planned deficit of £310 million in 1995 and total Exchequer borrowing of £813 million.  Even in the worst years when Fianna Fáil-led Governments were attempting to put the economy back on the rails after the profligacy and incompetence of previous Governments, particularly from 1982 to 1987, provisions of 3 per cent, 4 per cent and 5 per cent were made for social welfare recipients.  The successful rebuilding of the economy was achieved without penalising the poorer sections of the economy.</P>
    <P>Quite independently of the excellent economic background to this budget, hopes were high that the new Minister for Social Welfare, representing Democratic Left, would ensure that the needs of those in the poverty trap were adequately addressed.  People who, for a long time, were conditioned to doubt the credentials of the major parties on this issue looked to Democratic Left to deliver.  They remembered the care and concern of Deputy De Rossa in 1989 when he branded the failure to provide <Col N="149" /> adequate increases in social welfare payments as particularly cruel.  This was in a year when a general increase of 3 per cent was provided, plus a special increase of 9 per cent for the long term unemployed.  Last year he said the miserable increase told its own story.  This year, as the Minister with the cheque book in his hand, he has provided a 2.5 per cent increase across the board for which he has rightly been roundly criticised given his record on this matter. The reason there is such a high level of disappointment is that he attacked previous Governments for providing greater increases.</P>
    <P>It is worrying that the figure of 2.5 per cent is less than the projected inflation rate of 2.8 per cent and likely to be substantially less than the eventual inflation rate.  It, therefore, represents a real drop in income for many social welfare recipients.  On a political level it marks a betrayal of those who expected their needs to be catered for in the current financial climate.  Do the people caught in poverty traps and in receipt of long term social welfare payments cast their vote less frequently than other sections of society as there is some evidence to suggest they are being left behind, particularly on this occasion?</P>
    <P>A mini industry developed in depicting Fianna Fáil politicians as deeply untrustworthy and unreliable. Fianna Fáil Ministers for Social Welfare were subjected to mistreatment in this regard.  Because of the smears many people were directed away from the party in the many elections held in recent years.  Gradually the creators of this negative image also attracted this image with the result that for many people the idea of a reliable and trustworthy politician is unthinkable.  Is it any wonder that this is the case when the transfer from the Opposition benches to the Government side can have such a traumatic effect and the major concern is so infrequently translated into constructive action?</P>
    <P>The Minister has a difficult task as the social welfare budget places a major burden on the Exchequer.  This year it <Col N="150" /> will be of the order of £4 billion.  The difficulty is that a large proportion of the population is dependent on the relatively small number of people who create wealth.  Some people make the mistake of thinking that only the short and long term unemployed are dependent on the State; they forget that old age pensioners and a large number of young people also depend on the State. The high unemployment rate adds to the difficulties.  As politicians, we would serve the people better by painting the true picture as the many interest groups appear to think the State is a soft touch.</P>
    <P>A previous Government attempted to resolve some of the problems in the social welfare code by taxing social welfare benefit.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, pointed out, in some instances this caused even greater difficulties. He also indicated it is his intention, and that of the Minister, to try to resolve them and a slight move has been made in this direction.  However, he must not have been listening very carefully as virtually every speaker on this side of the House welcomed certain sections of the Bill which mark a move in the right direction but he failed to acknowledge this.  He attempted to suggest that my colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, proposed the taxation of child benefit.  I listened to Deputy Ó Cuív's contribution and he did not propose this.  He made the point that child benefit is paid to everybody, regardless of means, and not confined to those in a poverty trap.</P>
    <P>The justice office of the Conference of Religious of Ireland issues an annual report which tends to become the bible for the Opposition parties.  It argues that a radical overhaul of the social welfare system is required and is scathing in its criticism of this Bill.  What value do the Minister and the Department put on this suggestion?  There is a need to increase the basic payment as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Bill, containing provisions which I welcome.  Deputy Woods, when Minister for Social Welfare, ensured that substantial improvements were effected each year.  His <Col N="151" /> initiatives will long be remembered, particularly in regard to the streamlining of services provided by the Department, the provision of work options for the unemployed and a better Department-customer relationship.</P>
      <P>The Government had an unprecedented opportunity to provide worthwhile increases for the 40 per cent of the community in receipt of social welfare payments.  Prudent management of the economy by Fianna Fáil in Government meant that for the first time in many years the healthy state of the public finances provided the opportunity to provide worthwhile increases for all social welfare recipients.  Unfortunately, the Government decided to give a general increase of only 2.5 per cent which will not even match the rate of inflation. This increase, the lowest in 30 years, demonstrates beyond all doubt the uncaring attitude of the Government.</P>
      <P>The support payments for senior citizens are not adequate and, unfortunately, 1995 will see their standard of living lowered further.  The miserable increase in pension payments has been the source of concern at all Fianna Fáil meetings in my constituency.  The development of a proper and adequate system of payment for pensioners has always been and will continue to be a central policy of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>One issue which arises constantly at constituency clinics is the anomaly in regard to the self-employed who commenced paying PRSI contributions in 1988.  They entered the scheme on the clear understanding that the paid contributions would be reckonable for pension age.  It is my understanding that they will only be entitled to a partial refund of the contributions paid if they do not qualify for a pension payment. The position needs to be regularised and the individuals who contacted me indicated their willingness to purchase the necessary additional PRSI contributions if this would enable them to qualify for a contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The typical application for this scheme is the person who has worked hard all his life to improve a small land <Col N="152" /> holding, who has never been a burden on the State and who made a conscious decision to contribute towards the cost of a pension.  Last month the Minister gave a commitment at Question Time that the regulations dealing with refunds would be reviewed by his Department. I ask him to leave this matter, with the regulations dealing with the scheme and the contribution conditions, reviewed and amended at the earliest possible date.  It should also be borne in mind that the self-employed were not allowed to pay contributions between 1961 and 1988.  I presume that within the vast members availing of their rightful entitlements to social welfare payments, the category to which I have referred would constitute a very small percentage.</P>
    <P>The mortgage supplement scheme is important to many households.  My understanding is that supplement is payable in respect of the interest element of the mortgage repayments.  I ask the Minister to consider an extension of this scheme in exceptional circumstances. My query arises because I know of one young lady who, with her husband, negotiated a relatively small mortgage on a new house but did not take out a mortgage protection policy.  Subsequently, and unfortunately, the husband died at a rather young age and, on his death, the family's only source of income was no longer available.  This lady is now totally dependent on a widow's pension to care for her family and herself and the health contribution to her mortgage payments is exceptionally small.  In cases where extreme hardship can be imposed on a household, I ask the Minister to introduce adequate safeguards in the scheme to provide additional help in those exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>Many small holders are unhappy with the assessment of their means in regard to unemployment assistance.  This is self-evident when most of the cases we receive representations on in relation to the social welfare appeals office concern unemployment assistance claims rather than pensions or other type's of social welfare payments.  My experience suggests there is far less discontent with <Col N="153" /> assessments made by officials of other Departments, be it health board officials in relation to medical care applicants or even tax assessment.  There seems to be an unanswerable case for a general means testing system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed improvement in the carer's allowance.  The introduction of this scheme some years ago was a most welcome development and full credit is due to the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, in this regard.  Last year, the introduction of a £100 disregard was welcomed and I hope there can be further improvements in this scheme.  We all recognise the major contribution made by many carers in the diligent and ever constant care and attention given to incapacitated people.  Many hospitals and geriatric home beds were made available due to the commitment of a family member, or even a neighbour, to care for people in ill health.  The Minister has the opportunity to increase substantially the £100 disregard and a move in this direction would have very beneficial consequences.</P>
    <P>The various schemes introduced by Fianna Fáil Ministers to bring more people back into the work-force are worthwhile and have been of great benefit to many individuals and communities. We all know of individuals who have established full-time employment for themselves arising from the help they received initially from the back to work allowance scheme.  Prior to its introduction, many people with good employment creation ideas were naturally wary of ceasing to sign on for unemployment assistance with the insecurity that attaches to moving into an unchartered employment area.</P>
    <P>One scheme that attracted much adverse comment in 1994 was the students summer jobs scheme.  Voluntary organisations in my own constituency have said that it was possible to carry out worthwhile projects in the two counties under this scheme and the participants say they found the work rewarding and satisfactory.  In many instances, it related to their educational programmes also.  Organisers of the schemes in my county received the utmost co-operation and help from the <Col N="154" /> Department officials both in headquarters and in the regional office in Dundalk.  The organisations asked me to put on record their appreciation of the help given by the Department.  I hope this scheme will be consolidated and extended in the future.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies on both sides of the House for the contributions they made to the debate on this Bill.  It is always instructive to hear the various views on social welfare.  There is not a constituency in the country that does not have substantial numbers of people availing of the services of the Department of Social Welfare and every praise is due to the 4,000 people who work for the Department of Social Welfare.  The officials deliver a service in a caring way.  They pay out approximately £11 million per day on average with relatively few complaints about the way the service is delivered.</P>
      <P>As this is the first Bill I have introduced in this House as a member of Government.  I wish to thank also the officials of the Department of Social Welfare who have been unstinting in their efforts to ensure that an effective Bill was put together and that I had all the support I needed in presenting it to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The remarks by the last speaker highlights the obsession Fianna Fáil has developed with the percentage increase in the general social welfare payments. I was amused by the contortions of various Fianna Fáil speakers in portraying a party that is appalled by the fact that people on social welfare are getting an increase in line with the projected rate of inflation.  I am particularly interested why they picked the year 1989 as an example of them having done better than I did.  One speaker this evening referred to 1989, said they had given an increase of 3 per cent that year and said this compared so badly to the 2.5 per cent increase given this year.  The speaker said that they had also given a 9 per cent increase for the long term unemployed but failed to mention, however, that inflation that year was 4 per cent and that Fianna Fáil gave a <Col N="155" /> general increase less than inflation.  The increase given to the long term unemployed in that year was certainly significant but it was in the context of having finally to implement &mdash; five years late &mdash; the priority rates that the Commission on Social Welfare indicated in 1985 should have been paid within 12 months.</P>

      <P>In 1989 Fianna Fáil had been in Government for two years at that stage.  I am simply highlighting the fact that this obsession with the 2.5 per cent increase and the attempt to present a distorted picture of the budget is gradually being seen by the general public as so much nonsense and hypocrisy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Every increase that Fianna Fáil has given in social welfare has been at the expense of cutbacks in other areas of social welfare.  We have only to recall that when Deputy McCreevy, the current Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Finance, was Minister for Social Welfare he introduced the famous &ldquo;dirty dozen&rdquo; social welfare cuts.  I am still trying to overcome the effects of those cuts which were felt by workers and married women around this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another sign of the obsession is the reference by the last speaker to the carer's allowance.  I am on record <i>ad nauseam</i> in this House praising the former Minister for Social Welfare on the introduction of the carer's allowance.  It was an important development in our social welfare system but it is extraordinary that, in speaking about it, Deputy Smith did not seem to be aware &mdash; because of <Col N="156" /> his obsession with the 2.5 per cent general increase &mdash; that this year I increased the income disregard from £100 to £150.</P>

      <P>The Deputy also seems to be unaware that I have extented availability of the carer's allowance to people on occupational pensions, people who were previously excluded from this allowance.  That will assist substantial numbers of people on relatively low occupational pensions.  I ask the Deputy and all Fianna Fáil Deputies to keep their heads down for a while because as soon as the majority of people realise the nonsense they are going on with about the 2.5 per cent increase, they will have to explain why the increases in recent years, which they claim were so marvellous, were lower than inflation.  In 1987, the year Fianna Fáil came to power, it gave an increase lower than the inflation rate, as it did in 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year's social welfare package represents a fundamentally new strategy which avoids the &ldquo;what did we do last year&rdquo; approach.  I opted for a direct assault on child poverty by allocating more than £100 million to provide a significant increase in child benefit rather than a thin spread of available resources among all social welfare recipients. Deputy Walsh, the Fianna Fáil spokes-person on Social Welfare, referred to the position of a husband and wife with five children whom, he suggested, will receive £160 per week.  A family of this size on long term unemployment assistance will receive a new weekly payment equivalent to £200.62, taking account of the new child benefit rates.  This amounts to a weekly increase of £10.48 or 5.5 per cent, more than double the general increase.  If one child is 21 years <Col N="157" /> of age and still in full-time education the family could benefit from a further £13.20 per week by way of continuation of child dependant allowance up to age 22 years.  Similarly, if one child is 18 years of age, child benefit of either £27 per month or £32 per month will be payable from September until the person reaches 19 years of age.</P>
    <P>There are significant improvements for beneficiaries without children &mdash; for example, the minimum payment for a young person on unemployment assistance whose means are assessed on the basis of parental income is being increased from £10 to £25, a 150 per cent increase.  A person on contributory old age or retirement pension with a spouse under 66 years of age, with the additional increase of £1.80 per week, will receive a total increase of £9.70 per week or 8.3 per cent, bringing the new weekly payments to £125.90.  This increase includes fuel allowance of £5 per week and they will also benefit from a free colour television licence.  All these benefits are way above the 2.5 per cent general increase, by which Fianna Fáil appears to be mesmerised.</P>
    <P>There are significant improvements in the carer's allowance, to which I have referred.  This will bring 1,000 additional carers into the scheme at a cost of £3 million in a full year.  The means test for the allowance is being improved and the earnings disregard of £100 in respect of a working spouse is being increased to £150.  This will apply not only to earnings from work but to all types of income such as occupational pensions. This is a significant improvement.</P>
    <P>Students participating in the student summer jobs scheme will receive £600 this year compared with £540 last year. This represents an increase not of 2.5 per cent but 11 per cent.  In the case of those whose parents are both dependent on social welfare an additional £200 will be payable.  The Deputy can work out the percentages on that.</P>
    <P>These examples demonstrate that the Opposition's approach in isolating the 2.5 per cent increase does not accurately reflect the wider improvements in the Bill.  Furthermore the increases will be paid six weeks earlier this year.  This <Col N="158" /> means social welfare recipients will receive more money in 1995 than they would have received if 3 per cent was paid in late July, as apparently is proposed by Fianna Fáil.  I hope to give the benefit of future increases at an earlier stage in 1996 so that social welfare recipients will be on a par with taxpayers in terms of annual budget changes.  That is a complete reversal of what Fianna Fáil did when in power; it pushed back the payment until late July &mdash; budgets took place in late January and social welfare increase were not paid until late July.  Perhaps Fianna Fáil Deputies will explain why they remained so silent on that issue in recent years, certainly since 1987.</P>
    <P>Much scaremongering has gone on with regard to equality payments and the money I have managed to acquire in order to make those payments.  This is an issue on which I thought, in all decency, Fianna Fáil would keep their heads down.  I heard the former Minister for Social Welfare in the House this morning ridiculously claiming that he brought the test cases to the High Court.  It was the women who forced the Minister for Social Welfare into the courts by refusing to accept the legislation he introduced which, he was warned by me and other Deputies, would not hold water.  He continued to deny married women their entitlements under the 1979 European Directive on Equality.  The Deputy had the gall to stand up here this morning and say that he took the test cases.  He challenged the right of married women to the money to which the High Court decided they are entitled and which this Government has guaranteed it will pay &mdash; 75 per cent will be paid the money due to them by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>What we hear now from Fianna Fáil are questions on where we got the money and how we will pay for it.  That party is spreading false information about the effects of the disposal of a portion of the local loans fund.  There will be no effect on the contract between the borrower buying a house by way of a local authority loan and the local authority.  It will not change the relationship, the rate of payment, the <Col N="159" /> length of time over which payments may be made or the interest rate on payments. The only difference will be that local authorities, instead of paying the money to the Department of Finance, will pay it to the agency which takes over that portion of the local loans fund which the Government has decided it will dispose of.  It is important those facts are put on the record.</P>
    <P>Deputies Clohessy, Browne and Gallagher raised the issue of the assessment of benefit and privilege in the case of young single people applying for unemployment assistance.  The purpose of this assessment is to ensure that by taking account of different household circumstances, available resources are targeted at those most in need.  The cost of abolishing this assessment would be in <Col N="160" /> the region of £60 million a year.  That is a substantial amount of money.  Considering that it is more than the total increase which the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods managed to squeeze from the then Fianna Fáil Government in 1993, if we were to abolish it.  I wonder where Fianna Fáil would find the money to pay even the 2.5 per cent inflation proofing that has been provided across the board in this budget.</P>
    <P>There are many other points I would like to cover and I may well have the opportunity to deal with them on Committee Stage tomorrow.  I thank the Deputies who contributed to the debate and I look forward to a further discussion with them on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>It is high time that the House had an opportunity to debate in a serious fashion the implications of the decision handed down in the Court of Criminal Appeal last week in the X case, to reduce from 14 years to four the sentence imposed on the offender.  I tried to raise this matter last week without success.  Of all the houses in the country where people have been debating the implications of the decision it is a strange irony that this House is the last one to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has raised legitimate public concern about sentencing trends in sexual offences and, in particular, child abuse cases.  Claims of hysteria and vengeance have been levelled at women's groups who expressed legitimate outrage at the perceived negation of justice as represented by the reduction in sentence. The confidence of women in the justice system has been badly shaken. This confidence is not unconditional and has taken a bruising, both by the substance of the judgment handed down <Col N="163" /> and the language used in it.  The public, both men and women, are not motivated by vengeance.  They have been simply taken aback by the seeming emotional bankruptcy represented by the narrow legal logic in the judgment. Most people have an innate sense of decentness and fairness when it comes to the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to remark that from the beginning of this long tragedy which is the X case the public has been virtually excluded.  It was the decision of the then Attorney General to injunct the girl, who was pregnant and suicidal, from terminating her pregnancy which catapulted this case into the public eye. In that case the decision to allow the injunction and then to lift it was made by male judges.  Because the accused pleaded guilty at the last moment there was no need for a jury to determine the issues.  Accordingly, the judge handed down a sentence of 14 years.  As we know, last week, on appeal, the judges again decided to reduce that sentence. From beginning to end it has been a case dominated by lawyers.  The public's only role has been after the event.  Small wonder, then, at the level of frustration and disbelief expressed by thousands of ordinary men and women who feel dis-empowered and unrepresented in the process of justice as it applies to this case.</P>
    <P>There is urgent need for this House to arrive at unequivocal recomendations for change prompted by this decision.  A pattern of low sentences has been revealed in dealing with cases of unlawful carnal knowledge.  A clearer definition of the parameters of this offence needs to be enshrined in legislation. Mandatory sentencing is not the way forward and would sow the seeds of further controversies and injustices.  An offence of child rape needs to be clearly defined.  Clearly there is a difference between unlawful carnal knowledge, say, between two consenting teenagers and the degree of criminality correctly associated with similar acts as between a 41-year old man and a 13-year old girl, <Col N="164" /> the latter is clearly child rape whereas the former is of lesser, dubious criminality. We must be clear about the difference. Of course, sentencing should reflect the huge gulf of criminality that devides the two instances.</P>
    <P>The Minister must review the necessity to change the role of prosecuting counsel in sentencing on appeal.  As in this case, on appeal, the function of the court is to rehear the sentencing decision as if it were the court of trial. The role of counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions is confined to that of providing the court with information; the State does not stand over or vindicate the sentence.  Whereas counsel on behalf of the accused has free rein to attend to persuade the court to mitigate a sentence, this advocacy on behalf of the accused is not balanced by advocacy in the other direction.  The victim's perspective must be as vehemently argued as that of the offender.</P>
    <P>It is clear from reading the judgment in the X case that the judges were brought around to identifying with the plight of the offender by the persuasive arguments of senior counsel for the offender.  I find no fault with that &mdash; barristers are retained to be persuaders &mdash; but what is clearly wrong is the imbalance in championing the victim's rights.</P>
    <P>In all prosecution cases the Director of Public Prosecutions represents the State, that is the people.  I have argued repeatedly in this House, not with much success, that the independence of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions would not necessarily be compromised by allowing a greater degree of accountability and review of the activities of that office.  The figures reveal a large discrepancy between reported allegations of sexual crimes and the number of prosecutions proceeded with.  There is evidence of a marked discrepancy when it comes to examining child abuse cases.  Failure to prosecute validated claims of child abuse is a matter of the gravest importance. For individual victims who have reported such allegations, failure to prosecute can be devastating.  Such a failure creates a culture of disbelieving children which must be addressed by <Col N="165" /> our criminal justice system if we are really serious about protecting children. There has been a tragic escalation of such cases in recent years.  Now that we are putting in place programmes to facilitate children to disclose to responsible adults allegations of such abuse, we must also put in place measures to pursue these allegations to detection, prosecution and, ultimately, sentencing. Perhaps the most unpleasant aspect of our criminal justice system is that, in many such cases, we are talking about unimaginable depravity against the most vulnerable members of society.</P>
    <P>Two years after the Kilkenny incest case, most of the recommendations of the report into that case have not been implemented; only 17 of the 79 sections of the Child Care Act have been signed into law.  Therefore, we cannot say that we have even minimum standards of protection of children against abuse.  It is a tragic irony that a case which began with the State championing the constitutional rights of an unborn child has culminated in a decision which failed abjectly to vindicate the constitutional rights of a child abused by an adult.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice has asked me to say that because of other very urgent commitments she regrets she is unable to reply to Deputy O'Donnell.</P>
      <P>I am fully aware that the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal on 14 March to reduce very significantly the sentence of a man convicted of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 15 has given rise to a great deal of concern, inside and outside this House.  The Legislature has decreed that the maximum sentence for this offence is life imprisonment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Child sexual abuse is among the most serious of crimes committed against the most vulnerable members of our society.  The Minister for Justice and I are as anxious as any other Member of this House, or any right-minded member of the public, to ensure that a person convicted of such abuse should be dealt with in a manner which reflects the <Col N="166" /> seriousness of their offence and the harm they have caused.</P>
    <P>As a society only recently coming fully to grips with the horrible reality of child sex abuse there must be greater sensitivity to the needs of the victim and the impact of such offences on victims over a long period of time.</P>
    <P>No doubt Members will be aware that earlier this week the Minister and I met a delegation from the Council for the Status of Women to discuss concerns they had raised following the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal.  At that meeting the council representatives indicated that they would shortly submit to the Minister a proposal for the establishment of a working group with a very broad membership, including the Judiciary, to examine the operation of our sexual offences laws and to make recommendations in relation to any changes that might be considered necessary. We are currently awaiting that proposal and examining the question of what legal changes may be needed to ensure that victim impact statements are taken into account by an appellate court.  My view is that there may be a role for the Director of Public Prosecutions in defending sentences before the appallate court, a proposal at present being examined in the Department of Justice.</P>
    <P>However, Members will appreciate that it is not part of the function of the Minister for Justice &mdash; and indeed it would be quite inappropriate for her to seek to pass judgment on sentences imposed by the courts in an individual case.  In that context it must be borne in mind that in reaching their decision last week the members of the Court of Criminal Appeal were exercising their judicial functions.  Under the terms of the Constitution that is a function exclusively reserved to our judges.</P>
    <P>One of the main points made following the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal is that there is an urgent need for sentencing guidelines for our judges in criminal cases and for sexual offences in particular.  Without commenting either way on whether the approach adopted by the court was the correct one in the case, I can say that <Col N="167" /> the Minister is conscious of the fact that, by and large, sentencing guidelines have not been laid down for specific crimes either by the Oireachtas or the courts themselves, an aspect being examined by the Law Reform Commission in its review of sentencing policy.  The commission has already published a comprehensive discussion document on that topic and the Minister and I are anxious that its report, with its final recommendations, should be finalised as quickly as possible.  Towards that end the Minister has written to the Attorney General asking him to approach the commission in relation to the publication of its report on sentencing.  As soon as the commission's recommendations are available they will receive urgent attention.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the women's groups who attended the meeting with myself and the Minister stated explicitly that they do not favour minimum or mandatory sentences, a view with which I concur.</P>
    <P>The Deputies can be assured that the matter she has raised is and will continue to receive our full attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter came to light when an English man contacted me six weeks ago with information regarding the dumping of chemical weapons and nerve gas off the Donegal coast.  As a result I placed a notice in the local papers stating that I would raise the matter with the Minister for the Marine. Following that I received a flood of information concerning this matter.  As a result I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister for reply next week. I have not raised it as a knee-jerk reaction to the recent happenings in Tokyo. <Col N="168" /> I do not think Deputies would do such a thing.</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle said this morning that this matter had deen dealt with on 30 March and I presume he was referring to last year.  A good deal of water has gone under the bridge since then. The small amount of Sarin gas used so horrendously in Tokyo recently caused ten deaths and resulted in more than 3,000 people being injured.  A phenomenal amount of chemical materials has been dumped off the Irish coast.</P>
      <P>The British Ministry of Defence admitted recently, for the first time, that it dumped hundreds of thousands of tonnes of chemical weapons and poison gas off the Donegal coast in the mid-1950s. Three ships containing 76,000 tonnes of aircraft bombs packed with deadly gas were secretly scuttled by the British Navy in waters between Donegal and Rockall and 3,500 tonnes of 23 lb. artillery shells containing mustard nerve gas, including Sarin gas, were dumped in sealed containers over the side of British vessels about 40 miles of Malin Head.</P>
      <P>Those shocking revelations were contained in a letter from the British Ministry of Defence to the Glens of Antrim councillor, Oliver McMullin, who was trying for years to gain information about deadly weapons dumped around the Irish coast during recent years.  It has been revealed, and accepted by the Ministry of Defence, that some badly leaking shells had to be sealed.  That work involved putting one foot of concrete around them to protect lives of sea men involved in a top secret operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Labour Party called for scientific tests to be carried out on a 120,000 tonnes of chemical weapons which the Ministry of Defence admitted were dumped 12 miles off the Northern Ireland coast.  During the past year or so what were thought to be flares were washed up on beaches near the Glens of Antrim and in County Down.  In fact they were anti-aircraft grenades which would seem to indicate that some of those, so to speak, dumps had sprung a <Col N="169" /> leak.  Consequently, we should be told what can be done about the matter.</P>
    <P>The Ministry of Defence has named three ships involved although we are now aware from other information that many more were involved.  I received telephone calls from Scotland, Wales and even from a man who worked on those ships at Cairnryan.  He said that those ships were so laden with poison gas and chemical weapons, that some of the containers were cemented and the ships were dragged out to sea and scuttled.  That man named three of those ships, including <i>SS Vogtland</i>.  The British Ministry of Defence admitted that there was 28,700 tonnes of nerve gas on board that ship and it recognised that the <i>SS Clare Tee</i> contained 16,088 tonnes of chemical bombs and the <i>SS Kokta</i> was packed with 25,928 tonnes of nerve gas shells.  Some of those shells were leaking and had to be sealed.</P>
    <P>In &ldquo;Operation Deadlight&rdquo; 110 German U-boats, left after the last World War, were sent for disposal by the British, the USSR and the United States. Some of them were kept by those three nations and the remainder, approximately 90, were scuttled in the same site off the Donegal coast.  I would like the Minister to reassure me on this issue.  I would like further information about the British operation and on what has recently come to light regarding the possibility of a dump for such chemical material off the County Cork coast.  The information has been received from people who worked on those ships.  The Minister should explain how such dumping occurred in Irish territorial waters.  As the British had sovereign immunity in this area before 1987, is it possible to discover how such dumping occurred?</P>
    <P>I do not want to be alarmist, but in view of storms, particularly in the Irish Sea and the English Channel in recent years, and as the seabed is and will be used increasingly for piping and so on in the future, especially between Northern Ireland and Scotland and Nothern Ireland and northern England, what guarantee can be given that the material in the waters will not be disturbed? Experts in the cement industry have <Col N="170" /> told me that cement hardens and strengthens with age.  As those weapons are lying in 2,000 feet of water and have probably bumped off the seabed, how do we know they are not cracked and leaking gas?  If that is so, what effect will the gas have on the cement?  This is a matter of concern and information and, above all, reassurance is needed.  Can the Minister for the Marine contact his counterpart in Britain to allay the fears of local people?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McDaid for raising this important issue.</P>
      <P>I understand that the dumping of chemical munitions or war gas ammunition, as it is usually termed, in the North Atlantic by the UK authorities between 1945 and 1957 first came to the attention of the Irish authorities in 1986. Details furnished by the UK authorities at that time showed the nearest dump site to the Irish coast to be approximately 65 miles off the Donegal coast at a depth of 3,000 feet of water.  The weapons were disposed of by scuttling loaded, cemented-covered ships in depths of water from 3,000 to 8,000 feet.</P>
      <P>In 1992 Department of the Marine attention was drawn to the dumping of redundant weapons by the UK authorities off the Cork-Kerry coast.  This operation involved the dumping of 8,405 tonnes of redundant munitions and explosives at a location about 200 miles off the south-western coast at a depth of 4,500 metres in international waters.  At that precise time the annual meeting of the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, 1972, to which Ireland, the UK and 13 other north-west &mdash; west European states are party, was in session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oslo Convention provides that nothing in the convention shall abridge the sovereign immunity to which certain vessels are entitled under international law.  The UK delegation assured contracting parties that the dumping of the redundant munitions was carried out in a strictly controlled manner to ensure no damage to the marine environment, that no nuclear waste was involved and <Col N="171" /> that any toxic heavy metals had been removed from the material prior to dumping.  They assured contracting parties that all sea dumping of such wastes by the UK would be terminated by 1 January 1993.  It was agreed at the meeting that all contracting parties should make formal reports to the Oslo Commission when dumping was being carried out under the immunity provision of the convention.  The subject is now permanently on the agenda for all annual meetings of the Oslo Convention.</P>
    <P>Last November following concerns raised at the alleged potential hazard of the chemical gases to health of the communities living along the west and south-west coast the matter was again reviewed.  A review of scientific assessments made in 1989 and again last November indicates that given the properties of the chemicals &mdash; being either quickly soluble in, or heavier than water &mdash; the sea depth at which they were dumped and the considerable number of years which had elapsed, the weapons were not considered to pose a hazard to the health or fishing activities of our coastal communities.</P>
    <P>The chemicals identified by the UK authorities as having been dumped at sea at that time included the nerve gas TABUN, mustard gas, and Phosgene. SARIN, the chemical gas to which Deputy McDaid refers, was not present in either the 1947 to 1957 or the 1992 dumping of weapons.  SARIN is miscible with water and is broken down in water.  It is the most toxic of the three nerve gases TABUN, SOMAN and SARIN.  The UK authorities have confirmed today that SARIN was not dumped.</P>
    <P>As regards claims made in 1986 that dead birds and sea mammals had been washed up as a result of the dumping of chemical weapons there was no evidence to substantiate those claims.  In the case of some sea birds with broken necks washed ashore in a small number of areas in County Donegal death was attributed to bi-catch, in salmon fisheries nets.</P>
    <P>As regards allegations of leakages of <Col N="172" /> the chemicals from the scuttled vessels, it has been confirmed that no reports have been received in either the UK or Ireland to this effect.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, Ireland is a contracting party to the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, 1972.  The Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, gives effect to that convention. Ireland is represented at administrative and scientific meetings of the convention.  The topic of war gas ammunition was raised at the convention's technical working group on sea-based activities (SEBA).  It was felt by most contracting parties that the salvage of war gases from their dumpsites was very complicated and likely to cause more risk than gradual leakage.</P>
    <P>Studies undertaken by Belgium for traces of war gas in the water column and reports by Denmark concerning war gas in the Baltic Sea will be taken up at the next meeting of the Environmental Assessment and Monitoring Committee of the Convention in April this year.  Ireland will be represented at that meeting by a senior biologist from the Department of the Marine's Fisheries Research Centre.  The function of ASMO to which SEBA reports is generally to review the conditions of the maritime area covered by the convention, the effectiveness of the measures being adopted, the priorities and the need for any additional or different measures.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputy McDaid that I shall be taking up the dumping of chemical weapons off the coast of Ireland at the April meeting of ASMO. I shall be guided by the scientific advice on the actions to be taken by the convention as a whole or by the contracting parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for coming to take the question.  I am not sure what signs I am to read into the fact that the Minister for Defence and the Marine has to deal with TEAM Aer Lingus.  One can only speculate that the <Col N="173" /> Government has plans that sea planes be maintained there or that it be taken over by the Air Corps.  I await with interest the Minister's reply.</P>
      <P>TEAM Aer Lingus is still very much a burning issue in north County Dublin and in the greater Dublin area where many people depend on the company for employment.  The wider economy is affected by whatever happens in TEAM.  The former Government made a commitment to TEAM on the understanding that the first tranche of £25 million equity would be evenly divided, £12.5 million was to be paid for early retirement and the other half was to be used for upgrading and investment in the infrastructure of the company to ensure it was competitive and at the forefront of the world of aircraft maintenance.</P>
      <P>It is sad to report that gross mismanagement has been allowed to whittle away a £25 million equity.  Of that amount £18.9 million has been expended on early retirement for the initial 250 people, leaving 1,700 employed.  Those who remain say the money is not being invested in upgrading equipment as promised.</P>
      <P>Is the Government taking note of the gross mismanagement in the company and, if so, is it taking steps to alleviate the crisis?  I hope that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, is not present is not another indication of negligence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reference by the Minister to a dispute in the company and to a debt of £96 million is inflammatory language and does not reflect the truth.  The £96 million is not an operating debt.  One would expect the Minister to point out, when referring to it, that he is taking into account that a significant amount, almost £8 million, is a bad debt from an African airline; that £28 million has already been spent on redundancy payments; that £17 million is stock written off as a result of spares made available by Aer Lingus, which have since been devalued greatly; that £13 million is owed in interest payments to the banks; that £20 million has been borrowed <Col N="174" /> from First National for the construction of a hangar which was intended to be paid for through equity and that a debt of £10 million has been incurred through a section 84 loan from the Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <P>The morale of highly skilled people, whose credentials in the aircraft maintenance world are unquestioned, is severely damaged by reference to exorbitant debt and problems in the company. I hope the Government, as the chief shareholder, will take its responsibilities seriously and will ensure it is well informed by speaking to the management and the people who keep the company in operation; those skilled in aircraft maintenance, who are suffering as a result of the mismanagement.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to remind the Government of its responsibility not to allow TEAM Aer Lingus slide further through lack of attention.</P>
    <P>In many cases, the management does not have the experience in aircraft maintenance one would expect.  Experienced people are not being offered early retirement but are being asked to stay on to keep the company in operation but when the time is right from management's point of view they are being let go without redundancy payment.  That is the crisis and it is a terrible indictment on a Government that calls itself responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry.</P>
      <P>The subject of TEAM Aer Lingus has been well aired in recent weeks.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications answered parliamentary questions on the matter on 21 February 1995 and it was also the subject of an Adjournment Debate on 28 February last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has, accordingly, dealt with this issue in some detail in the recent past and has made his position clear.  He has also kept this House and the public well aware of his actions.  For the benefit of the House, I will recount <Col N="175" /> the substance of his statements in the matter.</P>
    <P>The Minister has informed the House that prior to his appointment he was under the impression that the restructuring programme at Aer Lingus was being implemented successfully.  Having assessed the position following his appointment, he was able to give the House a measured assessment of the progress made by the Aer Lingus Group in general.  In fact, he took the first available opportunity to do so.</P>
    <P>He informed the House that the airline was continuing to make the sort of progress envisaged in the restructuring programme.  At the same time, he advised the House that he was seriously concerned about TEAM Aer Lingus and that there were still major problems to be overcome if TEAM's operating results were to ensure the long term viability of the company.</P>
    <P>On taking up office, one of the first directions the Minister gave was for a comprehensive update on the situation in the Aer Lingus Group.  It was only when the 1995 budget for TEAM was submitted to the Department and the figures brought to his attention that he became aware of the extent of the problems at TEAM.  Having discovered the seriousness of the problems facing the company, the Minister decided to take immediate and decisive action.  It was quite clear to him that the targets set for TEAM Aer Lingus under the restructuring programme were not being achieved, with all the implications this could have for the European Commission's clearance of the final tranche of equity for the airline.</P>
    <P>The Minister called in the Executive Chairman of Aer Lingus and asked him to submit updated proposals to address the problems at TEAM Aer Lingus. Following receipt of the Executive Chairman's report, the Minister issued a press statement on 7 March indicating that he had written to the Executive Chairman of Aer Lingus requesting him to submit a five year business plan which will provide a basis for <Col N="176" /> developing an assured commercially viable TEAM Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>In his press statement, the Minister acknowledged that significant progress had been made in introducing improved work practices and flexibility but stated that further substantial progress was required to establish competitiveness. He is awaiting the submission of this five year business plan which is at present being prepared by Aer Lingus. When received, it will be examined thoroughly and carefully, in consultation with the company if necessary.  As the Minister indicated in the past, he will not rush this examinationn or allow himself to be rushed as any such mode of action would be irresponsible.</P>
    <P>For reasons of commercial confidentiality, the Minister will not be publishing details of any reports to him on TEAM Aer Lingus.  Clearly, it would not be in the interests of the company to do so.  As he has already explained, it is the responsibility of the board and management of TEAM to brief the company's employees and, in particular, to take the necessary steps to inform staff of the nature of the difficulties which face the company.  The Minister will not interfere in management's responsibility in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the £25 million equity injection in TEAM Aer Lingus by Aer Lingus Group plc and has criticised the management of the company in strong terms.  The Minister does not propose to get involved in discussing issues which are essentially the responsibility of the management. Recrimination about the past will not resolve TEAM's problems.  The task of the board and management is to prepare a five year business plan which will assure commercial viability for TEAM Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>As the Minister stated in the House on 28 February last, the resolution of the difficulties at TEAM Aer Lingus is a matter for the board and management of the company.  The problems must be addressed, not alone for the sake of TEAM, but for the sake of the airline.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 28 March 1995.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is payable to the person with whom the child is normally resident in accordance with regulations. Under these provisions, where the child is resident with both parents, entitlement to benefit is conferred on the mother.  Where a child is resident with one parent only, the benefit is paid to that parent.  Consequently, where the father is bringing up children on his own, child benefit is payable to him.</P>
      <P>The existing arrangements whereby child benefit is generally paid to the mother are in line with the recommendations of the First Commission on the Status of Women in 1972.

      <P>The purpose of the free travel scheme is to encourage elderly people to remain active in the community by giving them access to spare capacity on the various public transport systems.  Expenditure on the scheme this year will amount to almost £31 million and will benefit some 440,000 people.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions have been a feature of the free travel scheme since its inception. They are necessary on city bus routes because the transport services concerned are under severe pressure from commuters travelling to or from work or school in the morning and evening and they would be unable to cope with the additional volume of passengers arising if the restrictions did not apply.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions, however, do not apply in the case of mentally-handicapped people, people attending long term rehabilitation courses and certain other disabled or blind people.</P>
      <P>Time restrictions apply generally from 7 a.m. to 9.45 a.m. and from 4.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m.  Monday to Friday inclusive.  Any reduction in the period of the restrictions, even by half an hour in the morning and evening as suggested by the Deputy, would have significant cost implications for the transport companies involved who in turn would be forced to seek compensation from my Department.  Any improvement to the scheme along those lines could only be considered in the context of additional resources being made available and whether extension of the scheme to other categories would not be a better use of these resources.</P>

      <P>Information leaflets and booklets relating to each scheme are available from any of the 58 social welfare local offices throughout the country.  That network of local offices is computerised and is in a position to provide detailed information on the full range of services locally.</P>
      <P>All developments and improvements in social welfare services are widely advertised using an appropriate mix of media at local and national level.  Selective use is also made of &ldquo;freephone&rdquo; services to provide information on the introduction of new schemes or, for example, at budget time.</P>
      <P>The regional management structure of my Department enables staff to identify the needs of customers at regional and local level and to tailor the delivery of services, including information services, to meet those needs.  Customer panels and customer surveys are among the mechanisms now being used to take account of the views and experiences of customers when assessing the effectiveness of our information services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While my Department will continue to strengthen and develop its information services, there is a clear recognition of the valuable role that the independent voluntary sector can play in providing information, advice and advocacy services on social welfare services. I am fully committed to supporting the development and co-ordination of a citizen's information service which will act independently of the statutory sector in providing information and advice on a confidential basis.  I believe that a strong vibrant independent sector can complement and enhance the statutory information services and can offer <Col N="113" /> choice and advocacy for citizens at local and community level.  As part of this process, agreement has been reached to transfer responsibility for the National Social Service Board from the Department of Health to my Department.  In addition, £250,000 has been provided in the budget to develop computerised integrated social services information which will be available to Citizens Information Centres and other voluntary information providers.</P>

      <P>The new Social Services Office in Tallaght is being fitted out at present and it is expected that it will open to the public before the end of May 1995.  The new offices will feature as the local headquarters for social welfare services for the town of Tallaght and for its hinterland in north-west County Wicklow and will cater for a population of approximately 80,000.</P>
      <P>The processing and maintenance of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance claims will be administered from the new office.

      <P>The improvements in the social welfare area which I am implementing this year will cost £90 million in 1995 and £212 million in a full year.  This is additional expenditure and is not based on cutbacks in other areas of social welfare which was a device used by previous Governments.  Total expenditure this year on social welfare will be in excess of £4,000 million.  What is of real significance, however, and what distinguishes this budget from all previous budgets is the approach we have taken.  The strategy in this year's social welfare budget is to give everyone a general increase and then to target particular areas of poverty with substantial additional resources.  Families with children are universally recognised as being at greatest risk of poverty and in this year's budget I have taken a significant step towards addressing this issue.</P>
      <P>The £7 per month across the board increase in child benefit announced in the budget which will cost over £90 million in a full year, demonstrates my firm and unwavering commitment to those who are at greatest risk of poverty in our society, namely, families with children. In the vast majority of cases the payment is made to women and recent research has shown that women tend to spend more of their income on children and on household expenses than men. Consequently, this payment is a particularly effective way of targeting resources.  Directing income support for children through child benefit will also help relieve one of the worst poverty and unemployment traps in the existing systems, arising from the loss of child support when a person takes up employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general increase of 2.5 per cent in weekly personal and adult dependant <Col N="116" /> payments guarantees that everyone getting a social welfare payment will keep pace with the predicted rate of inflation this year and is being paid six weeks earlier than usual.  In this way, their real income position is being maintained while substantial numbers will also benefit from the 35 per cent increases in child benefit and the other improvements in the system.</P>
    <P>This year's budget also targets resources towards those who are generally recognised as being in particular need through improvements in the carer's allowance scheme, the extension of child income support where the child continues in full-time education, the increase from £10 to £25 in the minimum rate of unemployment assistance where an individual continues to live in the parental home, improved access to and benefit from free schemes, and significant improvements in the resources for employment support services and community and voluntary services.</P>
    <P>In addition I have recently announced at the Copenhagen Summit on social development, this Government is committed to putting in place by the end of 1996, for the first time ever, a national anti-poverty strategy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 46 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has administrative <Col N="117" /> arrangements in place in its network of local offices to record statistical details of unemployed people who are either in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credited contributions.  The recording of this information, which is commonly called the live register, is part of the Department's normal process of maintaining statistical and management information on the number of persons receiving such payments or credited contributions.  This information is also made available to the Central Statistics Office to assist that office to discharge its responsibility of collecting, analysing and disseminating statistical information relating to the economic and social life of the country.</P>
    <P>Any woman who is entitled to either an unemployment payment in her own right or credited contributions will form part of the live register.  Being on the live register gives access to various work supportive and training schemes some administered by my Department and others which are administered principally by FÁS.</P>
    <P>In relation to my Department access to the following schemes in the case of both male and female applicants depends on attachment to the live register: Back to work allowance &mdash; a minimum period of attachment of six months is required; PRSI exemption &mdash; a minimum period of attachment of 13 weeks is required; Second chance education initiatives &mdash; a minimum period of attachment of six months is required; Part-time job incentive &mdash; a minimum period of attachment of 15 months is required.</P>
    <P>All of these programmes are available under the same conditions to both male and female applicants.  There is no evidence that the live register requirement is giving rise to any undue difficulties for potential female applicants.  With the exception of PRSI exemption, participants in all of these programmes receive a weekly payment which is dependent on or the equivalent of the amount of the relevant unemployment payment.  In these circumstances all applicants must <Col N="118" /> be in receipt of an unemployment payment and this means that they have to be attached to the live register.</P>
    <P>The setting up of a special register in the case of the programmes administered by my Department is not therefore necessary.</P>
    <P>As already indicated, other agencies, particularly FÁS, make use of the condition of attachment to the live register as a prerequisite to qualifying for some training and work supportive schemes. The question of establishing a special register for the purposes of gaining access to such schemes is a matter for these agencies.</P>
    <P>At 30 December 1994, there were 2,652 men and 11,853 women signing on the live register for credited contributions. I am aware that people signing for credits are precluded from participating in the Community Employment Programme.  I propose to discuss with FÁS ways in which this obstacle to participation can be overcome.</P>

      <P>Self-employed persons became insured under the social insurance system with effect from 6 April 1988, the commencement of the 1988-89 contribution year.  Contributions at the Class S rate are payable by this group and provide cover for old age contributory and survivor's contributory pension and orphans contributory allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the conditions to qualify for a survivor's contributory pension is that contributions must have been paid in respect of at least 156 contribution weeks &mdash; three years &mdash; between the date of entry into insurance and the date of death.  Entitlement is based on either the applicant's own or their late <Col N="119" /> spouse's social insurance record.  This condition applies to all persons insured for survivor's contributory pension. Employee contributions reckonable for survivor's contributory pension purposes may be combined with self-employment contributions when determining entitlement to pension.</P>
    <P>It is considered reasonable that, to qualify for a survivor's contributory pension, a person would have paid 156 social insurance contributions and I have no plans to introduce a <i>pro rata</i> pension for survivors who fail to satisfy this condition.  A widow who fails to qualify for a survivor's contributory pension can, of course, qualify for a widow's non-contributory pension which is payable subject to a means test.</P>

      <P>The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by the eight regional health boards.  Under the legislation governing the scheme the determination of entitlement is a matter for the chief executive officer of the board. Under section 172 (1) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 people attending a full time day course of study at an institution of education are excluded from entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance; however, in exceptional circumstances, section 172 (3) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 allows a health board to make a payment when it considers this to be justified.  Each application for assistance is decided on its own merits by the health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to other social welfare <Col N="120" /> payments, a single person facing single parenthood may qualify for lone parent's allowance which is a means-tested payment following the birth of the child. Lone parents can continue to receive this allowance while studying on a full time basis.</P>
    <P>My Department has introduced a number of educational incentives for lone parents and the long term unemployed. Participants in &ldquo;second chance&rdquo; educational schemes, such as the vocational training opportunities scheme and the third level allowance scheme, may continue to receive their full social welfare payment and retain a range of secondary benefits, such as rent supplements, under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme for the duration of their course.  These participants are required to have been in receipt of a social welfare payment for at least one year and to be aged 23 years of age or over.</P>
    <P>At present, the total number of lone parents participating on the vocational training opportunities scheme and the third level allowance scheme is approximately 500 and 90 respectively.</P>

    <P>The programme manager system, which provides for the appointment of <Col N="121" /> one programme manager to each member of Government, plays a key strategic role in implementing the commitments set out in the programme for renewal.  The function of the programme manager in my Department, in common with that of other programme managers, is to assist in managing and co-ordinating the achievement of the Government's objectives as outlined in the Programme.  I have recently appointed a man as my programme manager.  He is a career civil servant with extensive experience of economic and social policy issues.  Prior to his appointment he served as Deputy Secretary-General of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  I believe that his appointment complements the existing range of skills and experience among the programme managers.  I have also appointed a woman.  Ms Rosheen Callender, who has extensive expertise in social policy as a special adviser.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>his views on whether there is potential to develop the career's allowance scheme, particularly to encourage a carer to care for elderly people to remain in their own home rather than having to avail of nursing home care; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the carer's allowance is to provide an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners with full-time care and attention and whose income falls below certain limits.  There is, of course, scope to further develop this important scheme in line with that objective and as financial resources permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to continue the work undertaken by previous Governments in progressively improving the carer's allowance.  This year, as announced in last month's budget, the allowance is being improved in two important respects as provided for in <Col N="122" /> the Social Welfare Bill currently before the House.</P>
    <P>First, the scheme is being extended to include carers of incapacitated pensioners over 66 who are not in receipt of a social welfare pension, for example, those getting an occupational pension.  It is only fair that those on social welfare pensions and those on occupational pensions should be treated equally as regards access to the carer's allowance. Many of those who will benefit will be public service pensioners on relatively low pensions.</P>

      <P>In this year's budget, the age at which child dependant allowances are payable with long term social welfare payments has been extended from age <Col N="123" /> 21 to age 22 for those in full-time education. Child dependant allowances paid with short term payments such as disability benefit or unemployment benefit are payable up to the age of 18 years. The cost of extending that entitlement in the case of short term payments to age 22 would be of the order of about £3 million a year.</P>
      <P>I should mention that a person who has been in receipt of disability benefit for 12 months and who is likely to remain incapable of work for a further 12 months may qualify for invalidity pension and, thereby, receive increases for children up to the age of 22 years in full-time education.</P>

      <P>Claims by non-nationals for social welfare payments are determined in accordance with the same statutory conditions as claims by Irish nationals and, accordingly, the nationality of social welfare claimants is not an issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EU social security regulations are a complex set of regulations covering migrant workers who are EU nationals and members of their families. The regulations provide for equality of treatment between workers who are nationals and other EU nationals in relation to Irish social insurance and social assistance payments covered by the regulations.  The regulations provide, among other things, for the aggregation, where necessary, of a worker's insurance record in all member states for the purpose of acquiring or retaining the right to benefit.  Thus, workers who <Col N="124" /> do not satisfy the contribution conditions in our national legislation can rely on aggregation to qualify for payment of Irish disability benefit and unemployment benefit.  If such persons have been insured in Ireland for at least one year, they can qualify for <i>pro rata</i> pensions (that is invalidity pension, survivor's pension and old age contributory pension).  With regard to supplementary welfare allowance, which is not covered by the EU regulations, all persons in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs may qualify for payment.</P>
    <P>Ireland has also concluded bilateral social security agreements with a number of countries which are designed to protect social security (pension) rights and prevent the possible double liability for payment of social security contributions. The agreements do not cover short term social security payments such as unemployment benefit, disability benefit, etc.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The average time taken to process appeals during 1994 was just under four months.  This period includes all phases of appeals and is inflated by additional time involved in the determination of a relatively small number of appeals where, for example, adjournments have been sought or where questions affecting the estates of deceased claimants are at issue.  When the slowest 10 per cent of cases is discounted the average falls to approximately three months.  A recent survey of appeals during the second half of 1994 found that approximately one third were disposed <Col N="125" /> of within two months of being registered in the appeals office.</P>
      <P>Appeals to the independent social welfare appeals office involve cases where there is a difference between the position taken by the Department of Social Welfare and the claimant and consequently involve a degree of conflicting contentions which must be resolved.  For an appeal to get the attention it merits, the grounds advanced in support of it must be investigated.  This will often require a further report by an investigating officer where, for example, a person's means are at issue, or, for disability benefit claimants, a further examination by a medical referee.  The periods indicated above cover the time taken to deal with all phases of the appeal including additional investigations into the grounds advanced, the arrangement of oral hearings, adjournments which may be requested by the appellants or their representatives, determination by an appeals officer and notification of the outcome to appellants.</P>
      <P>The social welfare appeals office has made significant progress in the four years since its establishment in 1991. During that period over 68,000 appeals have been processed and the number of appeals on hands has decreased from 8,287 at 31 December 1991 to 3,850 at the end of 1994 and this has brought about a significant reduction in the time taken to process an appeal.</P>
      <P>The provision of a prompt service is a major objective of the social welfare appeals office.  This was so recognised by the chief appeals officer in his report for 1993 and this aspect of the service will continue to receive attention during 1995.  The achievement of further improvements in response times by reducing the time taken to process appeals has been given a high priority. It is important to ensure that progress in this area is achieved in a manner which is consistent with the demands of justice and the requirement that every appeal be fully investigated and examined on all of its merits.</P>

      <P>The increases in social welfare payments provided in respect of dependent children, which result in the loss of child support when a person takes up employment, represent one of the worst poverty and unemployment traps in the existing system.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Social Welfare, one of my fundamental objectives in the 1995 budget was to start the process of addressing this issue in a new and radical manner.  The £7 increase in the rate of child benefit with effect from September next represents a substantial improvement in the State's contribution towards the costs of rearing children which cannot be lost as a result of either parent taking up employment.</P>
      <P>This, however, is only the first step in meeting the commitment in the <i>Programme for a Government of Renewal</i> to create a form of basic income for children through the introduction of a child benefit supplement.  This supplement, which will be introduced during the lifetime of this Government, will be payable to all families whose income is below a certain level regardless of whether that income is from social welfare or employment or a combination of both.  This will provide a base-line level of support for children, and those who care for them, and will target resources effectively at those in our society who are at greatest risk of poverty, namely, families with a larger number of children. The new supplement will incoporate both the child dependant allowances paid with social welfare payments and family income supplement which is payable to people in low paid employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="127" /> The implications of the child benefit supplement are currently being considered within my Department.  At the same time, the expert working group on the integration of the tax and social welfare systems is also being asked to consider this proposal and to advise on the best overall strategy.  The expert working group is best placed to do this, given the important work which they have already done in this area.</P>

      <P>The River Blackwater is a small tributory of the River Shannon.  The catchment area covers 15,500 acres in County Clare with the village of Clonlara at the centre. Most of the area is steeply sloped; therefore the river responds extremely quickly to rainstorms.</P>
      <P>In the late 18th and early 19th centuries works were carried out to improve navigation on the lower Shannon.  This included the construction of the Plassy/Errina Canal and the diversion of the Blackwater River for part of its course.  The works also included the construction of embankments along the canal and along the River Blackwater.</P>
      <P>The jurisdiction of the Commissioners of Public Works extends to the diversion point of the Blackwater River below Mount Catherine Bridge. The condition of the embanked sections and the canal bank which drains within the Commissioners jurisdiction is subject to continuous periodic examination and remedial maintenance work is carried out as necessary.</P>

      <P>The area around Clonahinchy is protected by an embankment constructed in the 1920s. The responsibility for repair of a section of the embankment was transferred to the Commissioners of Public Works in August 1990.  The damaged outfall structure through the embankment was replaced by the commissioners with a 1.8m diameter pipe which considerably improved its discharge capacity.</P>
      <P>The flooding is due mainly to the inability of the channel upstream of the road bridge to carry floodwaters within its banks.  Studies carried out by the commissioners have led them to conclude that an extensive scheme of embankments and back drains, including the installation of sluices and pumping equipment, would be required to give adequate flood relief.  The provision of a second pipe, as had been suggested earlier, would not in itself be a satisfactory solution.</P>
      <P>While there are no immediate proposals to undertake the large scale additional works required at this stage, the commissioners will keep the situation under review.  In the meantime maintenance of the existing works will continue to form part of the annual programme of maintenance of the commissioners.</P>

      <P>I am aware that some of the post-primary school accommodation in Portlaoise, County Laois is not satisfactory.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 11 October 1994, my Department considers that the most appropriate arrangement for the future provision of post-primary education in Portlaoise would be the development of a single school, formed through an amalgamation of the existing three schools in the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a meeting held locally in 1991, opposition was expressed by parents and teachers to the development of a single school, a community college under the aegis of County Laois vocational education committee.  The basis of the opposition was that a single school would be too large and that a <Col N="134" /> Community College management was not acceptable.  It was not possible to progress the matter further at the time because of this opposition.</P>
    <P>A review of the future needs of the centre, being undertaken in my Department, is nearing completion.  I will consider the matter further when this review is completed.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my Department issued &ldquo;Guidelines on Countering Bullying Behaviour in Primary and Post Primary Schools&rdquo; in September, 1993.</P>
      <P>The guidelines advocate the creation of a whole school response to bullying. Boards of Management are encouraged to involve staff, pupils and parents in the development of a school behaviour policy.  The guidelines also suggest that schools regularly monitor the effectiveness of school policy on this issue.  This would of course require the involvement of teachers at school level.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to now review the position centrally as the guidelines have been available for almost two years.  As part of the review I will be inviting the views of parents, management and teacher represenatives.</P>

      <P>The students summer jobs scheme which was introduced in 1993 proved to be a major success again last year.  The students who participated in the scheme gained valuable work experience and an income during the summer holidays and their local communities reaped the benefit of the work which they carried out.  Much of the community work undertaken could not have been done without the benefit of the scheme.  Over 9,000 students worked last year compared to 4,400 in 1993.  As a further indication of the success of the scheme sponsors provided a total of 11,249 job opportunities in 1994 compared with 9,083 in 1993.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am continuing the scheme again in 1995.  Following concerns expressed by student representatives to me at a meeting in January, I am making a number of substantial improvements in this years scheme which will cost just over £1 million.  There will be a significant increase in the total amount payable to each student who participates in the scheme and I have made special provisions to assist the less well-off students.  This year every student will receive £600, compared to £540 last year.  This amount represents an increase of 11 per cent and is a recognition of the valuable contribution which <Col N="141" /> students are making to their local communities.</P>
    <P>In addition I am making special provision for students whose parents are solely dependent on social welfare payments. These students will qualify for an additional bonus payment of £1 for every hour worked under the scheme. As students can work up to a maximum of 200 hours this is equivalent to an additional £200 for every student in this category.  I am sure that this will be of significant benefit to those students who qualify and to their families.</P>
    <P>I am also relaxing the means test which must be satisfied in order to qualify for the scheme.  Up to now students had to qualify for a minimum payment of £15 unemployment assistance.  This requirement is now being relaxed to allow students with an entitlement to the minimum amount of unemployment assistance to qualify.  This will result in more students qualifying.</P>
    <P>Additionally it will also be possible for a student to complete his/her project in a minimum period of six weeks with prior agreement of the sponsor.  This will give a student up to 10 weeks in which to seek additional paid employment without any restriction on the amount that can be earned.  This was not possible in the past when students received unemployment assistance as any earnings received would have reduced their unemployment assistance entitlement.</P>
    <P>Finally, I am setting up a formal comments/complaints desk in my Department which will be accessible to students, sponsors and students' unions for the duration of the scheme.  Use of this facility will enable my Department to properly monitor the effectiveness of the scheme.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that there is no undue dealy in the payment of unemployment assistance to former prisoners.  Applicants for unemployment payments are now interviewed in the local office of the Department on the day the claim is made or are given an appointment for an interview a day or so later.  This ensures that claims are processed speedily and constitutes a substantial improvement on the previous procedure of interviewing applicants at home in all cases.  In addition arrangements may be made to interview applicants before release from prison.</P>
      <P>Information is not maintained on the number of prisoners released in 1994 who claimed unemployment assistance or on those who requested a means test prior to their release from custody.</P>

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least 10 years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions (or 24 in the case of a retirement pension) registered from January 1953 (when the unified system of social insurance came into effect), or the time they started insurable employment, if later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before the person reached pension age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social insurance paid before 1953 under the National Health Insurance Acts can be taken into account in satisfying the first two conditions but <Col N="143" /> cannot be used in calculating the yearly average.</P>
    <P>In this regard it is relevant to point out that prior to 1953 three different types of contributions were payable. These were national health insurance, widows and orphans pensions and unemployment insurance contributions.</P>
    <P>These contributions gave specific entitlement only to the benefits of the schemes under which they were paid.</P>
    <P>The old age contributory pension scheme was introduced in 1961.  Contributions paid by insured persons prior to 1961 did not contain an element in respect of that pension.  However, as a concession and to enable persons reaching pension age at that time to qualify immediately for a contributory pension, contributions paid prior to 1952 were taken into account in calculating a person's entitlement to pension.  These transitional arrangements operated until 1973.  From that date contributions paid prior to 1953 were no longer counted for the purposes of satisfying the yearly average test.  However they are still reckonable for the other two eligibility conditions.</P>
    <P>Given the history of the eligibility conditions, outlined above, I have no plans to change the existing arrangements.</P>

      <Quest>if he will draw to the attention of Irish Rail and Bus Éireann the need to ensure that trains and buses are accessible to the disabled, particularly those persons in wheelchairs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I wish to assure the Deputy and the House of my commitment to securing improved access to public transport for people with mobility handicaps, including wheelchair users.  There is at present an Inter-Departmental Transport Accessibility Committee which is chaired by my Department.  Its primary objective is to secure such improvements in accessability to all modes of public transport as can be implemented within the resources to public transport providers and other relevant bodies.  Irish Rail, Bus Éireann and Bus Átha Cliath are represented on the committee and participate fully in its work.</P>
      <P>As a result of initiatives taken by my Department through the committee, there have been considerable improvements in public transport access facilities for people with mobility handicaps.</P>
      <P>In so far as rail services are concerned, it is now Iarnród Éireann's policy that all new rail vehicles will be accessible to people with disabilities. DART trains are wheelchair-accessible as are the new Arrow railcars, which also have wheelchair-accessible toilets. The new carriages for the Dublin-Belfast service will also have this facility, while the existing Intercity trains all have at least one dedicated area for wheelchair users in the dining cars.  All major railway terminals and the majority of mainline and DART stations are wheelchair-accessible and it is company policy that all new stations and any major refurbishment of existing stations should make provisions for the disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="145" /> As regard bus services, both Bus Átha Cliath and Bus Éireann endeavour to obtain the most accessible and user-friendly vehicles available on a costeffective basis.  Both companies in replacing their urban fleets are guided by the recommended specifications of the Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee (DIPTAC), a UK statutory body which advises on the needs and requirements of the mobility impaired.  Bus Éireann have also acquired one hundred and thirty improved coaches for their Expressway network which include a facility whereby the front of the coach may be lowered to facilitate access.</P>
    <P>Wheelchair users present the greatest accessibility challenge to bus operators, the main problem being the lack of affordable, operationally-proven and cost-effective wheelchair-accessible buses.  In this connection, the introduction of more than 90 wheelchair-accessible taxis in the Dublin area represents a significant step towards providing a flexible, door-to-door facility corresponding to the particular needs of wheelchair users.  At the same time, Bus Átha Cliath, with EU funding under the Horizon programme, hope to be in a position to begin a pilot wheelchair-accessible service operated by small-capacity low-floor vehicles between Clontarf and Finglas in the near future. The operation of the pilot scheme will be monitored and assessed by the interDepartmental committee as part of its ongoing programme to maximise the accessibility of public transport infrastructure and services.</P>

      <P>These responsibilities cover a wide range of areas including, for example, the appointment of the Chairman and directors of the company, the laying of the accounts before each House of the Oireachtas and approval of the appointment of auditors.  Since Aer Lingus is a commercial company operating in a highly competitive international environment, the safeguarding of the State's investment in Aer Lingus ultimately depends on the commercial performance of the company.</P>
