    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 25, 29 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is totally opposed to nuclear testing and is deeply concerned by the decision of the French Government to resume nuclear testing later this year.  These concerns have been made known to the French authorities bilaterally and in the appropriate international fora.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste raised the issue with the French Foreign Minister yesterday evening and expressed the Government's regret at the French decision to resume testing this year.  He asked that the French Government reconsider its decision, in the interests of the environment, of nuclear disarmament and of a comprehensive test ban treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objectives of the Government now are: first, to persuade the French Government to rescind its decision to proceed with the tests.  The Tánaiste has called publicly on France to reconsider its decision and the Government believes that, in view of the widespread international concern, France should review its position and maintain its moratorium on nuclear tests; second, we want to ensure that Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States maintain their current unilateral bans on testing. The French decision may encourage voices in these countries that favour a resumption of testing.  These calls should be firmly resisted by the Russian, British and American Governments; and third, we want to see early progress on a comprehensive test ban treaty.  The recent Chinese test, and the French <Col N="4" /> decision, show the limitations of a purely unilateral approach and the imperative need for a binding international agreement that will ban all tests, in all atmospheres, for all time.</P>
    <P>In a statement he made on 14 June, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs said that France's decision would be viewed as a setback to the efforts to bring about an early and complete ban on nuclear testing.  Referring to the recent Non-Proliferation Treaty Review and Extension Conference in New York at which the nuclear powers undertook to conclude a comprehensive test ban treaty (CTBT) no later than 1996, the Tánaiste pointed out that the conference had called on the nuclear weapon states, pending the entry into force of a CTBT, to exercise utmost restraint.  The Tánaiste emphasised that, in the light of the outcome of the conference, it was particularly disappointing that two nuclear powers, France and China, had decided to continue testing.</P>
    <P>On the same day as the Tánaiste's statement, the French Ambassador was received in the Taoiseach's Department by officials who, on the instructions of the Taoiseach, conveyed the Taoiseach's strong concern about this matter to the French authorities.</P>
    <P>On 15 June the Irish Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, on instruction, outlined the Government's views to a plenary session of the UN Conference on Disarmament.</P>
    <P>Prior to the French announcement, the Tánaiste had called publicly and repeatedly on the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia and France to maintain their unilateral moratoria on nuclear testing.  In this connection, he emphasised the great importance of securing a successful conclusion of the negotiations for a comprehensive test ban.  Therefore, the French authorities can be in no doubt about the sense of disappointment felt by the Irish Government and people over their decision to resume testing.</P>
    <P>The Government view with real concern the prospect that the French <Col N="5" /> decision in the period ahead, may complicate the efforts of EU states to exert effectively their combined influence in the non-proliferation and disarmament fields.  These are areas which seemed to hold out the promise of further significant advances in the future.  An action which might inhibit such progress is deeply regrettable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the morning of the French decision to resume nuclear testing later this year on Muroroa Atoll in the South Pacific we on this side of the House condemned their intention which has led to justified outrage, anger and resentment.  Can the Minister of State tell us what response the Tánaiste got from the French Foreign Minister yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of the French Government to date has been that it is listening to what is being said by various countries around the world. No response has been forthcoming but the tests do not commence until September which gives the French Government some time to consider the views of the international community, including Ireland, and the effects of these tests in terms of the environment, disarmament and nuclear armaments.  We are particularly concerned about the repercussions of this decision in encouraging other countries which have nuclear weapons to argue for the resumption of testing. We hope that in the period between now and September the French Government will pay due attention to the international concern that has been expressed about this testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State admit to the House that the pressure exerted by Greenpeace and other concerned organisations, in addition to the motion put forward by Fianna Fáil last spring which reflected that concern in relation to the renewal of the NPT, has been very effective when compared with the blank cheque approach of the Government and the Minister?  The Government should have insisted on a <Col N="6" /> five-year renewal with specific targets. The ink was not dry on the unconditional renewal of NPT when the Chinese carried out a nuclear test and now the French have committed themselves to further testing.  Even at this late stage, will the Minister of State not agree that a major error was made by the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I categorically reject the Deputy's views.  In fact, had those views been acceded to and five-year extensions been granted, we might have been left in a position where there was a complete free for all, in regard to nuclear testing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already had two tests in a couple of months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's approach to the NPT conference was to push for an indefinite extension.  That was achieved without a vote and no state party advanced a proposal for a series of five-year extensions.  Such extensions would merely have weakened the non-proliferation regime by calling into question the performance of the treaty, which is its foundation, and might have encouraged would-be proliferators.  We wanted the process for the review of implementation strengthened.  This was achieved. The enhanced review arrangements give greater scope for non-nuclear weapons states such as Ireland to hold nuclear weapons states to their commitments to nuclear disarmament and to a comprehensive test ban treaty.  France's decision to renew nuclear testing is clearly a unilateral one.  I believe the outcome would have been precisely the same had the five-year reviews been agreed to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said to the Deputy at the time of the debate on the NPT, his decision to move the motion was a strategic one. We all share the same objective in relation to ending the nuclear arms race and nuclear testing, but a five-year extension of the treaty would have meant that it might have come under question every five years.  We now have <Col N="7" /> an enhanced review procedure which begins next year.  Such an outcome would not have been possible had the strategy suggested by the Deputy been adopted.  I continue to disagree with the Deputy's strategy in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that the Chinese and the French are involved in nuclear testing makes a nonsense of what the Minister of State has just said in relation to the NPT.  This was our treaty, having been initiated by Frank Aiken, and Ireland should have taken a stand on it.  It is typical of this Government to be judged by words, not actions. If the French proceed with these tests &mdash; hopefully they will not &mdash; will the Minister of State, through the Tánaiste, insist that notice be given to the people in the South Pacific of when testing will take place?  The French have been obsessively secretive about this in the past and tests have taken place without any notice being given to the countries affected.  Can the Minister of State give an assurance to the House in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government considers the decision of the French authorities on this matter to be highly unsatisfactory. We will continue to press France to reconsider its decision. Because the testing will not resume until September, I am hopeful this will give the French Government ample opportunity to reconsider what I believe to be an unfortunate and wrong decision. That is not to say, however, that the approach adopted by Ireland at the NPT was not correct.  The approach suggested by Deputy Burke would have put the whole foundation of the treaty at stake.  I would remind the Deputy that this change of policy by the French Government has come about since the election of President Chirac, whose party is in partnership with Fianna Fáil in the European Parliament.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 3 and 30 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has repeatedly made clear the importance it attaches to progress in removing the stocks of weapons held by paramilitaries.  It is self-evidently the case that dealing with the paramilitary arsenals is an essential element in the peace process and crucial to the achievement of a lasting peace. As the Tánaiste stated in the House on several occasions, most recently on 23 May, it is impossible to envisage a lasting peace without the objective of the removal of paramilitary arms having been achieved.  This approach underlies the position taken by Government representatives, both publicly and in all relevant contacts on this issue.</P>
      <P>The Government welcomes the widespread agreement in principle on all sides that the decommissioning of such weaponry is one of the key issues which must be addressed in the search for overall agreement.  Our efforts now must be geared to creating the context where this can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to avoid a circular argument whether prior decommissioning is the condition for political progress, or political progress for decommissioning.  As a political reality, neither issue is likely to be fully resolved in isolation from the other.  As the Taoiseach stated in the House on 25 April, &ldquo;Without progress on the arms issue there will not be progress on other issues.  Equally, for there to be progress <Col N="10" /> on the arms issue there are many other issues on which there must be progress.</P>
    <P>I hope serious discussion of decommissioning will be paralleled by serious discussion of the various political issues which are the responsibility of political leaders, and which are necessary for a resolution of the problem.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have both emphasised, the peace process is not a single issue agenda, and progress in any one area is more likely in the context of movement on a range of issues.  The objective of permanent peace will be achieved only by a coordinated process which involves movement on all sides.</P>
    <P>Our task now is to build momentum by developing progress across the entire agenda which must be addressed.  We will continue to press for this, both in regard to the oversearching goal of launching comprehensive political negotiations, and on the specific issue of decommissioning of paramilitary arsenals.</P>
    <P>All of these issues, including the decommissioning of paramilitary arms, have been the subject of continuing dialogue with the British Government, at political and official level.  The Government has been seeking to find solutions, bridge gaps and facilitate movement. The discussions between the Irish and British civil servants on the modalities of decommissioning have been continuing in that context.  The Deputy will understand if, in accordance with the normal practice, I propose not to go into detail of this on-going work.  It is not envisaged that the outcome of this work will be published.  I can assure the Deputy and the House that it is the Tánaiste's intention and that of the Government to continue to devote to all of these issues the close and continuing attention that they must have.</P>
    <P>We do not believe there is or was any justification for illegal weapons, whether in the context of talks or otherwise. That is why we have placed such importance on the voluntary decommissioning of the weaponry which has so far eluded detection by the security <Col N="11" /> forces on both sides of the Border. However, we do not believe this objective, important as it is, should be used as a road-block in the way of negotiations. Rather, the process of political negotiations should be used to the full to build the conditions of trust and the prospect of agreement which will enable the more difficult features of the situation, of which this is one, to be successfully disposed of as part of an overall agreement.  I am aware of the very proper concern that there should be no negotiation under the shadow of threat of violence.  However, the sustained observance of the ceasefire is also a relevant factor in considering the test for participation in political dialogue, as defined in the Downing Street Joint Declaration.</P>
    <P>Moreover, in a context of political negotiations based exclusively on political mandate, the weight of the combined democratic mandates around the table would make it unlikely that any group would seek to revert to the threat of violence in that context, and even more unlikely that they would succeed in their objectives, if they did.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for that comprehensive reply with which I agree in relation to the fact that nobody can condone the possession of illegal weapons.  However, they are there, and as we approach the anniversary of the ceasefire the question of decommissioning of arms has been added by the British Government as a new condition for talks.  Will the Minister of State agree that it is vitally important that decommissioning take place and that it be the number one item on the agenda of all inclusive talks rather than a condition which prevents talks taking place?  In the context of finding a formula to allow the talks process to proceed, why has the Government only now re-established the Dalton Chilcott talks?  Why were they not taking place since the beginning of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="12" />
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the Deputy's last point, there are ongoing discussions on the question of the peace process in which the people named have been participants for some time.  In that sense this is a continuing process.  In specifically addressing the question of decommissioning, they are simply addressing one of the items in a series of agenda items which have to be addressed in the overall framework of negotiations.</P>
      <P>I indicated that the consideration of the means by which decommissioning can be achieved should continue to be examined in discussions between the British Government and Sinn Féin.  Our primary concern is to see that all the paramilitary arms are removed as quickly as possible, and we will give careful consideration to any proposal which will assist in realising that objective. Naturally I support and welcome any diminution, to whatever degree, of existing arsenals.  I would be wary of an approach which might, even unintentionally, give undue emphasis to partial or symbolic gestures, possibly at the expense of the fuller and more comprehensive approach we all want to see. Neither would I wish to see degrees of decommissioning being used as bargaining chips in a political process since that would damage the principal of negotiations based exclusively on the existence of democratic mandates. While I welcome any progress, I wish to keep the focus on the overall goal of general decommissioning rather than on partial or symbolic gestures which might prove insufficient to bring about real change.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State has given a long answer but has skirted around some of the more delicate aspects of this.  In particular, she has not expressed any view, as I asked her to, as to whether there is any justification for any party or its associates seeking to retain possession of arms and explosives when entering into talks with the other parties and with the Irish and British Governments, in view of the fact that <Col N="13" /> the necessary elements for a political settlement in Northern Ireland are well known and easily identifiable.  The views the Minister of State expresses on behalf of the Government here today are in marked contrast to the views expressed by the Tánaiste in this House last June, exactly a year ago.  Do I understand her to say that a sustained ceasefire is one of the prerequisites for talks and that it is an adequate prerequisite? How does she regard the fact that the figures published yesterday suggest that there have been 125 punishment beatings since last September, some of them multiple incidents, in which many people have been seriously injured?  I agree that this matter should not be a single item on the agenda but, for the most part, the agenda is what Sinn Féin suggests rather than what all parties would wish to discuss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste stated, as reported at column 1019 of the Official Report of 1 June 1994:</P>
      <P>The definitive abandonment of the use, or support, of violence for political ends would open the way to participation in political talks and to a role in the shaping of an agreed future for the Irish people.  It is also a precondition for participation in the proposed Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sustained silence of the guns, which we have had for ten months, is the crucial test.  If, as we all hope, it continues indefinitely it will be a powerful reassurance that the conditions in the Joint Framework Document are being met.  We want all parliamentary arms removed and are actively encouraging Sinn Féin and the British Government to enter discussions on this and other crucial issues central to the peace process. The Taoiseach and Tánaiste have made clear to Sinn Féin on several occasions their concern and that of the Government and people in regard to punishment beatings.  They have called for an end to them and similar calls have been made across the political spectrum <Col N="14" /> in the North.  This matter is of enormous concern if we want peace and the cessation of violence.  We must bear in mind the suffering of the victims and their unfortunate families.  We reiterate our call to all paramilitaries to desist from such actions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in condemnation of punishment beatings and call, as my party leader has, for them to cease as soon as possible.  As regards the need to involve all parties in bilateral or preferably round table talks with the first item on the agenda being decommissioning of arms, what was the response to the Taoiseach's invitations?  One meeting was held with Sinn Féin but what progress has been made with the other parties who were invited to talks with the Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>That process is ongoing. A number of parties participated and we continue to hope that all parties to the process will respond to the Taoiseach's invitation.</P>

      <P>A series of issues continue to be discussed at a number of different levels.  Decommissioning is one of them.  The Deputy wondered why it was a matter of discussion recently.  I assume it is one of the outstanding agenda items which has to be dealt with. The Government is concerned to keep up the momentum and keep the peace <Col N="15" /> process moving forward.  All options are being explored.  The work that may be done by the Dalton-Chilcott group may assist in that advancement and movement.

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 20 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the warnings of Trócaire and very conscious of the explosive potential of the problems in the Great Lakes region, particularly in Rwanda and Burundi.  It is now over a <Col N="16" /> year since Rwanda was engulfed in genocide and a civil war which left up to one million dead.  Not surprisingly, the recovery has been slow, fragile and uneven.  While the situation in the country has shown some improvement, notably in the revival of the private sector and the reopening of schools, overall conditions remain fragile and tense.</P>
    <P>Ireland has repeatedly advocated concerted international assistance for Rwanda and the region as a whole. Repatriation of refugees, national reconciliation and the rebuilding of administrative structures are urgent priorities.  We regard the return of refugees and internally displaced persons as an essential element in this recovery.</P>
    <P>The closing of the camps within Rwanda was taking place in a comparatively peaceful manner until the massacres at Kibeho on 22 April.  The Irish Government strongly condemned the killings at the camp and, with our partners in the European Union, called on the Rwandan authorities to set up an independent investigation into the incident.</P>
    <P>An independent international commission of inquiry was subsequently established and it presented its findings on 18 May 1995.  The commission concluded that the tragedy did not result from a planned action by Rwandan authorities to kill a certain group of people, nor was it an accident that could not have been prevented.  The Government of Rwanda accepted the results of the inquiry and committed itself to continuing with its own inquiry into the conduct of the people involved to ensure that such acts are not repeated and that those responsible are brought to justice.  I welcome the report of the commission of inquiry and the subsequent commitment by the Rwandan authorities to implement its conclusions and recommendations.</P>
    <P>The commission of inquiry strongly recommended that the international community continues to encourage and assist Rwanda in its efforts to achieve <Col N="17" /> justice, national reconciliation and reconstruction.  I am firmly convinced that this is the only way in which a permanent resolution will be found for the Rwandan crisis.</P>
    <P>We have raised the need for control on the supply of arms with our EU partners and will continue to do so.  The UN Security Council, in Resolution 997 of 9 June, extended the arms embargo on Rwanda imposed last year to &ldquo;persons in the State neighbouring Rwanda&rdquo; if such arms are for use within Rwanda. The resolution also refers to the possibility of deploying UN military observers in eastern Zaire and elsewhere to monitor this embargo.  I welcome this strengthening of the arms embargo regime.</P>
    <P>The Government has always supported a UN presence in Rwanda and I am glad that the UN Security Council has extended the UNAMIR mandate for a further six months.  The force is to be reduced to 1,800 troops after four months.  Adjustments in the mandate mean that UNAMIR will use its good offices to help achieve national reconciliation, assist the Government in the return of refugees, assist in the training of a national police force and contribute to the security of UN personnel and aid workers in case of need.</P>
    <P>On the humanitarian front, as the House will be aware, Ireland has donated more than £4 million in emergency assistance.  The Government is also providing rehabilitation assistance in sectors such as health, education and agriculture.  To date, the Government has spent £350,000 on rehabilitation projects and is committed to contributing substantial further rehabilitation assistance.  An officer of my Department recently visited Rwanda and I am currently considering recommendations for future assistance, including the rehabilitation of the justice system and the prisons.</P>
    <P>The European Union, which had temporarily suspended assistance to the Government of Rwanda following the events at Kibeho, decided on 1 June to <Col N="18" /> engage in a political and technical dialogue with the Rwandan Government which will enable the resumption of full assistance from the European Union. This was in accordance with the views of a number of member states, including Ireland, and resulted from a discussion in the Development Council.</P>
    <P>I am glad to inform the House that the first plenary session of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda took place yesterday in The Hague.  I hope that the tribunal will pursue its work with all possible speed and that those responsible for the genocide will be brought to justice.  The United Nations and European Union team of human rights monitors continue to do very good work.  I had discussions recently with the co-ordinator of the EU contingent, who is Irish.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to look at the problems of Rwanda in isolation from the problems of the region as a whole.  The situation in Burundi is very tense and the spillover of refugees into neighbouring countries is adding to the difficulties of their hard pressed economies.  This underlines the need for the holding of an international conference on security, stability and peace in the Great Lakes region, as called for by the UN Security Council.  The Government firmly supports the convening of this conference and I note that Trócaire has strongly advocated that such a conference take place.  We will continue to pursue this proposal with our EU partners and the states of the region.</P>

      <P>The perpetrators of the genocide in Rwanda are rearming themselves in preparation for a violent return to their homeland after one year in exile.  May I ask the Minister of State the specific action being taken to ensure that the EU, the UN and other world bodies will not sit back and allow another one million people to be wiped out in this region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are taking a series of measures which will allow for a degree of reconstruction, peace building and <Col N="19" /> peace making in Rwanda.  In this context, the report of the independent inquiry into the massacre in Kibeho recommended that the international community should assist in and contribute to the rehabilitation of Rwanda. The single most important action the international community can take is to encourage and enable displaced persons and refugees to return to their homes in safety and make them feel confident about resuming their lives in Rwanda. However, this will be a long process.</P>
      <P>There have been reports on arms shipments and movements in the camps in the countries surrounding Rwanda while international press reports have referred specifically to the camps in Zaire.  The UN embargo on the sale of arms to Rwanda has been extended to include persons in neighbouring countries who may be using those arms in Rwanda.  International embargoes on arms can be extremely difficult to police and we are talking about generating a momentum which will bring about peace in Rwanda and restrain continuing outbreaks of violence in Burundi. We address the issue of international arms movements by using all of the resources at our disposal in the United Nations and the regional bodies within Africa which have a significant role to play in the resolution of the Rwandan conflict.</P>
      <P>The taking of concerted action by African countries, as happened last year in the case of the extremely dangerous situation in Lesotho where three neighbouring presidents, including President Mandela, used their authority to broker an agreement, could form the basis for the peaceful reconstruction of Rwanda. The international conference would offer further guarantees and enhancements to displaced persons to return home and may offer the opportunity for a settlement to be brokered at a regional level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem can only be solved by a series of measures, and the Government has been actively involved in assisting in the rehabilitation process.  Recently an <Col N="20" /> official visited Rwanda and we are considering, together with the Red Cross and local authorities, the provision of assistance to the prisons and the judicial system.  It is essential for refugees and displaced persons to have confidence in this system if they are to return to their homes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the work being undertaken in the area by the Government representatives and the non-governmental organisations such as Trócaire, Concern, GOAL, the Red Cross, Human Rights Watch etc.  The availability of arms is a contributory factor to the increasing tension not just in Rwanda but also in Zaire and the region generally.  The Minister of State referred to the pressure being applied at the UN and in Africa and the region. However, it is well known and widely accepted that the arms are coming from EU member states.  As a member of the European Union we should exert pressure through the Foreign Affairs Council to ensure that proper consideration is given to the supply of arms.  Will the Minister of State agree that it is hypocritical for member states of the EU to vehemently protest about human rights abuses and genocide in this area while at the same time they are supplying weapons, directly or indirectly, to the participants in the conflict?  Will she assure the House, and the public, that the Government will highlight this issue at the EU?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is extremely concerned about the arms trade in Rwanda, Burundi and throughout Africa where excessive transfers of conventional weapons have had destablising consequences often at the expense of economic and social development.  In addition to supporting specific arms embargoes where necessary, the Government is committed to working for restraint in the manufacture, possession, transfer and sale of all conventional weapons.  Ireland, together with its European Union partners, sponsored the introduction of a United <Col N="21" /> Nations register of armaments to include information on international transfers of certain categories of conventional weapons.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, Ireland has proposed at the United Nations the elaboration of a code of conduct on conventional arms transfers which would encourage states to voluntarily exercise responsibility and restraint in their exports and imports of conventional arms and set out common principles to be observed in this area.  Our European partners have broadly endorsed the proposal and Ireland is continuing to work to promote acceptance of the need for responsibility in conventional arms transfers.  Ireland recently ratified the United Nations Inhumane Weapons Convention which prohibits the indiscriminate use of certain conventional weapons, notably landmines.  We will be pressing for a strengthening of its provisions at the conference which will review this convention in the autumn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, and his Minister of State on to their concern in relation to the troubled areas, particularly in the African Continent.  Will the Minister of State agree that there is concern in relation to spending substantial amounts of taxpayers' money, such as the £4 million referred to in her reply, to ensure that it finds its way to the people for whom it was allocated?  Will she indicate if, within her Department, there are plans to review the method of allocation and the policing of these moneys to ensure it reaches the people who require assistance and that it is not lost through the conflict in the areas to which she has referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of the £4 million Irish assistance to the Rwandan crisis was directed through the Irish relief agencies: GOAL, Trócaire, Concern and Refugee Trust and some £350,000 has been directed through the Rwandan <Col N="22" /> Government since December.  There are intense negotiations on spending any moneys on development or emergency relief.  Any money spent on relief generally is through the mechanism of NGOs. The Irish NGOs have a truly outstanding record and we receive reports from them in relation to spending moneys allocated.  There is a proposal this year to spend money on rehabilitation in Rwanda.  We are being advised in this respect by the Irish agencies working in Rwanda, in particular, by Trócaire which has worked there for a number of years on peace building and on the civil reconstruction of that country.  In relation to proposals to spend money we send senior officials &mdash; as we did in the case of Rwanda recently &mdash; to discuss in detail how those moneys might be spent.  A number of Irish people work in senior appointments in Rwanda, not least the head of the European Union monitors.</P>
      <P>I am happy that we are able to avail of the advice of people who are extremely experienced in the field as to where the money might best be spent. Recently the OECD's development aid committee produced a report on Irish aid in which it examined all the expenditures which Irish aid has made during the past number of years.  That report was extremely complimentary and emphasised that Irish aid, unlike the aid programmes of a number of other countries, is largely directed at the alleviation of poverty in primary areas such as health, education, water and sanitation and building capacity in those countries with which we have a relationship.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 6 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>The recent statements by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, the German Defence Minister Mr. Ruhe, and the Secretary-General of the Western European Union, Mr. Cutileiro &mdash; to which the Deputies' questions refer &mdash; reflect the developing debate on security and defence issues in advance of the European Union Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) next year.  The ideas they raise are amongst those that are being put forward as the debate develops and it is not at all clear which concrete proposals will be formulated and tabled at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference review of the Common Foreign and Security Policy provisions of the Maastricht Treaty is expected to include consideration of a common defence policy for the European Union.  A key issue in this context is the question of the future relationship between the EU and the Western European Union.  The German Foreign Minister's views concerning the possibility of a gradual merger of the EU and the Western European Union indicate the approach that Germany is likely to develop at the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations.  A <Col N="24" /> similar approach has recently been advocated by the Netherlands and it is probable that others among our EU partners will also take this view.  On the other hand, the British Government has made clear its preference for the maintenance of the EU and Western European Union as separate organisations, although supporting the deepening of co-operation between the two organisations. The Government's views were set out in a speech which the Tánaiste made on 16 February and these will be developed in a forthcoming White Paper on Foreign Policy.  Ireland's preference is for an approach in this area that takes account of the level of political and economic integration by the European Union, that is responsive to broader developments in European security and reflects the varying capacities and experience of the member states.</P>
    <P>On the question of a common armaments market I have seen reports that this idea was mentioned recently by the German Defence Minister.  It is not clear what the German Minister has in mind.  If proposals are put on the table at the Intergovernmental Conference the Government will follow its existing policy which emphasises disarmament and arms control as well as the maximum restraint in the export of conventional arms.</P>
    <P>In so far as the remarks of the Secretary-General of the Western European Union are concerned, the question of a common defence policy for the European Union is a matter for the member states of the Union at next year's Intergovernmental Conference. Any such policy will require the unanimous agreement of all the member states, including Ireland.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has made it clear that a common defence policy for the Union would have to be compatible with Ireland's continued pursuit of its objectives in the areas of disarmament and arms control, and that the Government will continue to work for a reduction in armaments, for the strengthening of non-proliferation <Col N="25" /> regimes and for an end to nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.  These will remain priority objectives of our foreign policy.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach to the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations will be based on the commitments set out the programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, namely, that we will continue to play our full part in the European Union and that our foreign policy will continue to be underpinned by our commitment to peace, security and co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Government's Programme for Renewal also gives a clear commitment that the outcome of any future negotiations that would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy will be put to the people in a referendum. This will ensure that Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains unchanged unless the people themselves decide otherwise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the Government's view in relation to full membership of the Western European Union? Will she assure the House that the Government will only retain observer status and will not agree to join the Western European Union as full members?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has made its position clear.  We are committed to a policy of neutrality.  As part of the Intergovernmental Conference if the outcome of any negotiations would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy this will be put to the people in a referendum.  This means that Ireland's policy of military neutrality remains unchanged unless the people of Ireland decide otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations it is essential that the Government has a point of view.  It is not sufficient to say that whatever the outcome may be, we will put it to the people.  The Government must protect the traditional military neutrality to which the people of <Col N="26" /> Ireland are deeply committed.  Surely it is essential for the Government to outline its strategy when going in, not to say that whatever emerges will be presented to the Irish people?  Will the Government say in these negotiations in the Intergovernmental Conference that we will not enter military alliances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Our participation in the Intergovernmental Conference will draw on our stance in our calls for disarmament, arms control and restraint and reduction of conventional weapons. As a neutral country we have put forward this viewpoint not only in the EU but in the UN and many international fora.  That continues to be the position.</P>
      <P>However, the question on the Order Paper relates to comments made by politicians in another member state. The Intergovernmental Conference is being preceded by a reflection group on which our representative is my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell.  We have put forward our traditional view.  As it is a process of discussion, first at the reflection group and subsequently in negotiation at the intergovernmental stage, we expect and anticipate other Governments will put forward their points of view, as is happening.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy the Government's position will be strongly stated and has already been made known, both before and after the commencement of the work of the reflection group.  The Tánaiste and I are on record as to our commitment to neutrality.  If changes are proposed which would in any way reflect on that policy, that position would go to the people for decision in a referendum.</P>

      <P>It is the view of all sides of the House that the issue should go to the public if there is a proposed change.  I am asking about the Government's position and let it be noted the Minister is refusing to answer.  Not only does Fine Gael want us to join the Western European Union, some of its members are on record at the Joint <Col N="27" /> Committee on Foreign Affairs and elsewhere as wanting us to join NATO. There should be an unequivocal statement of the Government position on behalf of the three parties, not the position of the Tánaiste or the Minister of State.  The Government position should be clearly stated in advance of the discussions that we are a militarily neutral State and will not be involved in military alliances.  We should not hide behind having a referendum at a later stage but should clearly state that to our European partners because if we continue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that the line she is stating is already selling the pass to our colleagues in Europe, if she is agreeing at this stage to have a referendum on the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference? There should be a clear negotiating stance by the Minister of State on behalf of the Government, including Fine Gael and DL, that we will not vary out position or join military alliances, no matter what our partners want.  If we take that line, the other three neutral countries in the EU will join us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position of the Government in relation to both the reflection group and the Intergovernmental Conference is well known.  I reiterate that we have made clear our broad position on military alliances, armaments, disarmament and non-proliferation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that position is generally supported by the Irish people. Nonetheless the process of the reflection group and the Intergovernmental Conference will inevitably give rise to proposals from other countries.  We <Col N="28" /> have a duty to listen to what they have to say, just as we hope they will listen to Ireland's position.</P>
      <P>In relation to setting out our foreign policy, the Deputy will be aware that the Tánaiste will publish the While Paper on foreign policy shortly.  This followed an historic and unique process of consultation at various venues and seminars around the country.  Having attended a number of those.  I agree with the Deputy that there is a strong commitment in Ireland to the concept of neutrality.  We welcomed the arrival into the EU of a number of other states with a strong tradition of neutrality, which I think will strengthen Ireland's traditional position on military matters and reduction of armaments in the Union.</P>

I am not specifically aware of the conference to which the Deputy referred but if, as chairman of the parliamentary party, he put forward the position of the Irish Labour Party on neutrality I congratulate him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the advent of the other neutral countries into the EU, I believe there is <Col N="29" /> a greater possibility than when Ireland was the only neutral country to express a neutralist view, which I hope will progressively lead to a reduction in the use of conventional armaments and to the reduction and elimination of nuclear armaments.  I hope the structure and balance of the Union on military matters has fundamentally changed and that the outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference will reflect this change in the Union's position.  Ireland will argue strongly for this and that we should pursue options on peace building, preventative diplomacy and reductions in both conventional and nuclear armaments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">

      <P>I intend to take Questions Nos. 7 and 23 together.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's policy to promote cross-Border economic co-operation in all fields.  The new context created by the ending of violence has transformed the potential for such co-operation. The Government wishes to see full advantage taken of the significant new opportunities which arise in this context for North-South trade and economic co-operation.</P>
      <P>The evolving peace process will enable resources which were previously devoted to combating paramilitary violence to be transferred to productive economic purposes, North and South of the Border.  The Government wishes to build on the positive developments of the past nine months and to explore how best to convert the &ldquo;peace dividend&rdquo; into real and lasting economic progress.</P>
      <P>Within the Anglo-Irish Conference, we are considering with the British Government action which can be taken in a number of sectors to develop North-South co-operation.  Over the past few years, we have taken initiatives in the conference to promote co-operation in fields such as tourism, transport, energy, environment, health, agriculture, education, North-South trade, forestry and fisheries.  In the period since the cease-fires of last autumn, the conference has considered the scope for co-operation in the areas of animal health and rural development; cross-Border roads, urban renewal and environmental issues; and health issues.</P>
      <P>At a meeting to be held later this week, the conference will discuss North-South co-operation in relation to heritage matters and broadcasting.  Further possibilities for North-South co-operation will be examined by the conference over the coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the regular meetings of the conference, Government Departments, North and South, are in regular <Col N="31" /> contact with each other on a wide range of issues of mutual interest.  The Government has also played a role in the elaboration of a number of other economic initiatives which are directly related to the peace process.</P>
    <P>The White House Conference on Trade and Investment, which was hosted by President Clinton, was part of the American Government's support package for the peace process.  It provided a unique opportunity for the private sector and the State agencies in Northern Ireland and the Southern Border counties to come together in a spirit of co-operation and to highlight the benefits of investing in these areas to several hundred leading American companies.</P>
    <P>The European Union has also launched a support package to develop the peace process.  The PEACE Initiative will help to develop cross-Border economic links and will devote a minimum of 15 per cent of its total funding to cross-Border development.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document, which was launched on 22 February 1995 by the Irish and British Governments proposed the creation of new North-South institutions to &ldquo;cater adequately for present and future political, social and economic inter-connections on the island of Ireland&rdquo; and to enable representatives of the main traditions, North and South, to enter &ldquo;agreed dynamic, new, co-operative and constructive relationships&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In addition to the foregoing initiatives, in which the Government has had direct or indirect involvement, a range of local government and private sector initiatives are under way to promote cross-Border economic and business co-operation in the context of peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply.  Is she aware of the recent Newry-Dundalk conference which was held as a follow up to the Washington conference, and has her Department taken cognisance of the <Col N="32" /> various speeches and statements made there by some very prominent people?</P>
      <P>Will she accept that at the recent Washington Conference on the problems of economic development in the North and the six Border counties, there was too much emphasis on the six Northern counties and not enough on the six Southern Border counties, particularly as the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, only mentioned the Border areas once in his keynote speech?</P>
      <P>Will she accept that the recently agreed division of international funds by a ratio of 20:80 between the six Southern Border counties and the six Northern counties is not sufficient, particularly in view of the fact that the Southern Border counties have suffered more than the Northern counties as they did not have the backing of a very large Exchequer and, up until recently, got no recognition for the difficulties they experienced over the years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard brief reports of the Newry-Dundalk conference which I welcome because there is enormous scope for work to be done in the Newry and Dundalk areas.  I am aware that Dundalk has suffered over the years because of the Border and I welcome any initiatives to promote development in that area.</P>
      <P>On funding, it has been agreed that Northern Ireland will get a maximum of 80 per cent of the total funding under the new package and the six Southern Border counties will get a minimum of 20 per cent.  We consider this a reasonable distribution, bearing in mind that the Southern counties comprise a little more than 20 per cent of the total population covered by the initiative.  For example, the international fund allocates 75 per cent to Northern Ireland and 25 per cent to the six Southern counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Tánaiste has said here on a number of occasions, in answer to the Deputy, that he is most anxious that the <Col N="33" /> Border counties benefit from the initiative. I am aware of a number of initiatives. From reports of the Washington Conference, my understanding is that the delegates from the Border counties were quite positive about the work done there in terms of the economic benefits which the conference might ultimately bring to the Border counties.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern that the Border counties will benefit because many areas have suffered in terms of economic development and there are also questions of infrastructural development.  I hope that a direction of a proportion of the funding to the Border counties will benefit the area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the main issues at the Newry-Dundalk conference and which was adverted to by Dr. Tony O'Reilly related to the motorway between Newry and Dundalk, development of which is at a standstill, despite the flowery language which we get from the Departments on both sides of the Border.  Will the Minister of State use her good offices to ensure that whatever bureaucratic blockage is responsible for the delay is dealt with?  As Dr. Tony O'Reilly recalled, 40 years ago as a child he heard promises of the Dundalk-Newry road being improved but he is still waiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problems with the road because, as the Deputy probably knows, I visit Dundalk quite frequently.  The road is a priority for the town and I will use whatever good offices I have with the Minister to make the case for that road and for Dundalk in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the comments of my colleague from County Louth and join him in supporting any move in the Border areas to achieve the maximum results.  That is what we set out to do in Washington and I believe we were successful. In relation to the 80 per cent; 20 per cent allocation of the additional £240 million of cross-Border funding, I <Col N="34" /> am the only Member of the House who is a member of the body dealing with that.  We strongly opposed the division that was decided on but, as the Minister of State said, it was allocated on the basis of population.  Is the Minister of State satisfied with the programme submitted under this heading to the European Union for sanction?  It will be advertised nationally that moneys will be available for projects in the six Border counties. Will the Minister of State ensure that the programme is proceeded with on the basis that it is related to the peace initiative and that the moneys must be spent during the next three years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Preparations for the programme are well advanced and we expect it to be finalised shortly.  I am confident it will give rise to a number of applications which will reflect the level of interest in the Border counties.  There is co-operation at local authority level, between business and community groups and organisations along the Border. I anticipate that much interest will be shown in the funding when it becomes available.  I am confident that the projects which will qualify for funding under the various headings will be considerably enhanced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State accept that the reason the population level dropped in the six southern counties concerned was the lack of investment and that, therefore, it is wrong to use it as one of the criteria? Will she assure the House that any money provided by the International Fund for Ireland or under the INTERREG programme or the new Delors programme will be considered additional and not used to replace expenditure provided by the Department of Finance?  Funding provided under the INTERREG programme has been used in this way.  As there is a need to upgrade infrastructure in the area it is essential that the Department of Finance does not take the soft option.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission has made it clear that any funding provided in the context of the peace initiative must be considered additional.  It will be provided by way of the global grant mechanism.  We have considerable experience of using this mechanism.  In this way we can ensure that funding will be provided to those interests which will qualify for funding under the initiative.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 10, 15 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>My information is that the European Youth Orchestra has no plans to visit Indonesia.</P>
      <P>In so far as the question of human rights is concerned, the Dáil will be aware that the Government takes every opportunity in our bilateral contacts and in the appropriate international fora to bring home to the Indonesian authorities the deep concern of the Government and the Irish people.  On 23 May the Tánaiste received the representatives of the six Association of South East Asian Nations, ASEAN, embassies in London, including the ambassador of Indonesia, when they visited Dublin.  He availed of that occasion to impress on the ambassador the public concern in this country as regards the situation in East Timor.</P>
      <P>Ireland has also supported moves to raise the issue at the UN Commission on Human Rights.  At this year's session the Indonesian Government agreed to invite the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit East Timor during the course of the year.  The high commissioner will submit his report to the next session of the human rights commission.  In these circumstances the Government does not think that it would be appropriate to take up any offer of private assistance in pursuing a charge of genocide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the political level, Ireland supports the ongoing talks between the Portuguese and Indonesian foreign ministers, which take place under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General.  In this context we welcomed Portugal's recent initiative to convene an Intra-Timorese <Col N="37" /> meeting bringing together, under the aegis of the secretary-general, those who accept and those who reject the Indonesian presence in East Timor.  The meeting took place earlier this month in Austria.  Both the UN representative and the Portuguese Government have expressed their satisfaction at the outcome of the meeting, which, we expect, will be considered at the next meeting of the foreign ministers of Portugal and Indonesia on 9 July.</P>
    <P>The Government can support the main lines of the declaration adopted at the recent Inter-Parliamentary Conference in Lisbon.  In particular we believe that countries that supply arms to Indonesia for use in East Timor should reconsider their policy.  We shall take up this issue with our European partners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for informing the House that the European Youth Orchestra has no plans to visit Indonesia.  Will she agree that not only an arms but a cultural embargo should be imposed by the Government and its partners in European on the grounds that every opportunity should be taken to send the message to the Indonesian authorities that we find their actions in East Timor distasteful?  That would be another nail in the coffin in terms of their illegal occupation of East Timor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has taken up the issue of East Timor at the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva.  I expressed our concern when I addressed the commission.  The Government supports the initiatives which have been taken by the Portuguese Government and would like to see the problem resolved by way of discussion and negotiation.  The outcome of the Inter-Parliamentary Conference in Lisbon was the declaration, the main part of which the Government supports. Talks have also been initiated in Austria between those who reject and those who accept the Indonesian presence.  These <Col N="38" /> talks represent a significant breakthrough. We should support the process of discussion and negotiations as well as calling on those countries which are supplying arms to Indonesia for use in East Timor to reconsider their policy.  That is the best way to proceed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said that the European Youth Orchestra has no immediate plans to visit Indonesia. If it announces its intention to do so in the near future will she review the question of withholding funding from it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no information that the European Youth Orchestra proposes to visit Indonesia.  We have made our views known on the position in East Timor.  We have met representatives of the East Timorese people on a number of occasions and condemned the policy of genocide in that country. We support the tentative steps which have been taken to achieve a negotiated solution to the problem.  It is important that we support in particular the initiatives taken by the Portuguese Government, the former colonial power in both Indonesia and East Timor.  Obviously I would not expect that the orchestra would find it appropriate to visit Indonesia at this time and my understanding is that there are no such plans.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the suggestion by the American law firm of taking action on a genocide charge is not to be pursued.  Will she agree that a genocide charge should be pursued for the murders in East Timor and the behaviour of the Indonesian army?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government raised the issue of East Timor with the UN Commission on Human Rights.  A number of UN rapporteurs, including a rapporteur on torture, visited East Timor and produced a very damning report on conditions in Indonesia.  A commitment <Col N="39" /> was given by the Indonesian Government to invite the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit East Timor during the year.  We should support and encourage such visits.  After the visit by the High Commissioner he will submit a report to the next session of the human rights commission.  Initiatives such as the Lisbon conference and particularly the discussions that took place in Austria should be supported. We have made it clear to the Indonesians that we find their behaviour in East Timor unacceptable.  We have supported calls for a negotiated solution which would grant freedom to the people of East Timor and would bring an end to the military operations which have taken place there on an on-off basis since 1975 when the majority of killings took place.</P>

      <P>The Members of the Economic and Social Committee were appointed by Council Decision 94/660 of 26 September 1994 for the period from 21 September 1994 to 20 September 1998.  Thus the nomination of a new Irish member of the committee does not arise at this time.  However, when the time comes for nominating members to the committee in 1998, I am sure that the Government will include in its consideration any nomination by the Consumers' Association of Ireland or indeed by any other similar organisations. It should be recalled that the Government's approach to nominations <Col N="40" /> to the committee necessarily reflects the relevant EC Treaty provision that the committee shall consist of representatives of the various categories of economic and social activity.  Ireland's membership at the committee is made up of representatives from the business community, the farming community, trade unions and the Irish Countrywomen's Association.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree the consumer interest, which unfortunately is not traditionally regarded as of much importance in Ireland, is regarded as of considerable importance in most member states who have consumer representatives on the Economic and Social Council?  Will she agree it would be a very good idea for Ireland to have such a representative to reflect the importance of the rights of the consumer in this economy and throughout the European Union generally?</P>

      <P>In the event of a vacancy arising the matter will be considered on its merits by the Government of the day and nominations by the Consumers' Association of Ireland or any other similar organisation will be considered. The Council decision directs that the composition of the various categories represented should include producers, farmers, carriers, workers, dealers, craftsmen, professional occupations and the general public.  In considering the composition of the current Irish membership the Government has endeavoured to meet that requirement.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government decided earlier this year to establish new embassies in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Malaysia.  These three new missions will be opening over the next few months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> Even after these new missions are established, there will still be areas of the world where Ireland remains under-represented, including for example Central and Latin America, the Middle East and south-east Asia.  These are regions with significant growth prospects where there are excellent opportunities for promoting Irish interests, which would be enhanced by the presence of a more extensive diplomatic network.</P>
    <P>It is intended, therefore, to keep our embassy network under continuous review and to propose the establishment of new missions where there would be a clear benefit to the State from doing so. We are looking in particular at our needs for diplomatic representation overseas in the context of our Presidency of the European Union next year when we will have the responsibility of representing the European Union in its dealings with third countries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the announcement of the opening of offices in Malaysia, Hungary and the Czech Republic.  I share the concern of the Minister about the absence of representation in south-east Asia, a major economic growth area, and Latin America. This side of the House will support the Department in every way possible in its battle with the Department of Finance to ensure this country is properly represented abroad.  Embassies should be not only offices of diplomatic activity but of economic expansion, taking advantage of the economic opportunities that arise.  Will the Minister agree the Ireland House concept of embassies and semi-State agencies operating in the one area is one that should be expanded?  In that context will she approach the Department of Finance with a view to further expansion to allow us take advantage, particularly in south-east Asia, of the opportunities for inward investment and sales in that region?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the economic role of our embassies is extremely important.  All our missions <Col N="42" /> abroad are conscious of the importance of promoting our economic interests. There is close co-operation with the various State agencies involved in this work.  That co-operation has been progressively developed since the re-establishment in 1993 at ministerial level of the foreign earnings committee which brings together the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Tourism and Trade and all the State agencies involved in the promotion of foreign earnings.</P>
      <P>In recent years the Ireland House concept has been introduced in certain capitals abroad to give greater focus and impact to our promotional efforts by bringing together in a single location all the Irish agencies involved.  My intention is that each new embassy will be established in an Ireland House and that the State agencies concerned will be integrated more fully into the embassies than has been the case previously.  I hope this will lead to closer and more effective co-operation between the diplomatic and economic sides and that it will enhance the impact of the new embassies in the promotion of our economic interests abroad.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Deputy's support for any request to the Department of Finance which the Department of Foreign Affairs may believe is necessary.  There is a broad understanding of the important spin-off benefits, not only in the diplomatic area but in the economic area, of having an Irish presence particularly in rapidly developing markets such as a south-east Asia and Latin America.</P>

      <P>Given that the committee is bringing together a number of Government Departments, including <Col N="43" /> the Department of Foreign Affairs, to examine the question of foreign earnings, a closer relationship has developed in recent years between our embassies and other State bodies which work in the area of trade promotion.  Our embassies' activities are under continuous review.  This concept will develop over time in respect of all our embassies.  Irish business people and many foreigners who wish to do business with Ireland may be unaware of the existence of various Irish promotional bodies and their first port of call for assistance and advice might be their local Irish embassy.  For that reason it is important that our embassies should develop their economic side as they could be extremely beneficial in trade terms.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State agree that, while we would want to have as many permanent representations as possible abroad, there are financial constraints in terms of our population of 3.5 million?  There are many successful Irish friends abroad, both first and second generation.  Where it is not possible for economic reasons to open an embassy, will the Minister of State agree that an extensive consular service should be developed using the offices and goodwill that undoubtedly exists towards this country among private individuals?  As such services operate successfully in some countries, will she agree that they should be expanded?</P>

      <P>We have expanded the honorary consul core in a careful and selective manner in recent years.  There are now 56 honorary consuls representing Ireland in 42 countries.  When the Tánaiste discussed the Estimates with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs he said that the Department would carefully consider any such proposals put forward for different areas or countries.  Generally, those appointed as <Col N="44" /> honorary consuls are people of distinction in terms of their background in professions or trades and it would be desirable that they would have certain facilities such as an office, telephone, fax machine and so on to facilitate their work.  We keep this matter under continuous review and we will continue to expand that service in a careful and measured way.</P>

      <P>The most recent statement of Government policy on this issue was enunciated by the Taoiseach at the World Summit for Social Development on 12 March 1995.  The Government acknowledges that some progress has been made in recent years to alleviate Third World debt, but considers that much more needs to be done, particularly for the lowest income countries.  A lasting solution to the debt problem is an essential prerequisite for sustained economic and social progress in developing countries.  The Government believes that all possible options, including debt cancellation, should be considered.</P>
      <P>At present, it is the international financial institutions, notably the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, rather than the EU, which have the main role to play in the resolution of the debt problem.  Ireland is a member of both institutions and we will continue to urge that the issue be tackled and that innovative approaches be considered in order to resolve this serious problem.</P>

      <P>The question of assistance to African, Caribbean and Pacific countries under the Lomé Convention is on the agenda of the Cannes conference. I understand agreement was reached on the eighth round of European development funding for the 77 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.  One of the interesting features of the Lomé Convention is that the funding given is based on grant allocation rather than loans.  In that sense the funding does not add to the debt burden of developing countries.  The Taoiseach in his speech at the World Summit in Copenhagen referred to a suggestion made regarding the possibility of selling part of the IMF gold reserves.  He supported that proposal and it has received support from a number of other countries.  It is proposed that the proceeds of the gold sales should be put towards alleviating the debt burden of some of the poorest countries particularly in Africa.  The matter was discussed also at the G7 meeting in Halifax in Nova Scotia recently, but agreement was not reached on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Minister of State with responsibility for development co-operation, the focus here is normally on development aid issues, but the whole question of debt is fundamental to the development of countries in Africa, South America and Asia because the model of development proposed, particularly by the World Bank and by a number of the Bretton Woods institutions, is based on private investment, an expanded private sector and a more efficient market economy. While I consider that laudable, it is difficult to envisage the pursuit of a successful market economy or investment strategy for private investors in a country which is overwhelmed by a mountain of debt.  In terms of our participation in the EU Development Council and in the OECD, we have raised on a number of occasions the question of alleviating the debt burden of developing countries in a structured and systematic way, particularly that faced by some of the poorest countries <Col N="46" /> in sub-Saharan Africa because of the severe limitation on their ability to develop their economies whether through public or private sector investment.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her detailed reply indicating the Government's priority on this issue. In this year when our Famine will be commemorated we will think of the similarity of what happened here during the last century when at a time of great hunger huge resources in terms of the food products and incomes continued to leave the country.  Will the Minister ensure that the Government keeps this matter high on its agenda?  I accept we are not involved directly in terms of the volume of debt.  Does the EU have a substantial debt relationship directly with Africa and will the Minister of State indicate the amounts given by it, America and other donor countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of organisations, including NGOs such as Trócaire and Concern, suggest that in commemorating the Famine we should reflect on what is happening in Africa, in particular. I am sure the Deputy is aware of the exhibition on modern day famine and food shortages in the Famine museum in Strokestown House, something which will feature prominently in our Famine commemorations.</P>
      <P>A number of developing countries owe substantial debt, both bilateral and multilateral, to various European Union countries.  While negotiations on bilateral debt have been taking place through the Club of Paris and so on, our aim is to make progress on the debt to multilateral institutions such as the IMF. Negotiations in that regard should take place to facilitate more rapid development of African economies, particularly in the sub-Sahara.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that in the past five or six years repayment of debt by sub-Saharan African nations exceeded amounts lent by more than $4,000 million and that in <Col N="47" /> such circumstances those countries cannot develop their economies?  Will the Government ensure that future loans to such countries are given through the International Development Agency of the IMF and the World Bank rather than through the proposed new facility, in respect of which legislation will go through the House in the autumn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has made its position clear regarding debt relief, particularly in regard to sub-Saharan Africa.  Unfortunately, the Deputy's comments regarding the outflows in terms of debt repayment from the south to the north are correct.  If the developed world is genuinely committed to social and economic development in the developing world, as well as addressing the question of aid and other assistance packages it must address the question of debt relief on a bilateral basis and through multilateral international organisations.  The proposal regarding the possible sale of gold reserves is one way of resolving the issue.  A number of other proposals, such as imposing a small tax levy on international financial transactions, have been put forward.  Such mechanisms would relieve Africa's debt burden.</P>

      <P>The news of Senator Gordon Wilson's death is truly tragic and I know all Members will joint with me, on behalf of the Government, in offering sincere condolences to his family and many friends.</P>
      <P>I am sure none of us forgets the extraordinary sentiments expressed by Gordon Wilson in describing how his daughter died some years ago.  He embodied for all of us that unique courage and capability of rising above the tragedy that shattered not only his family but, in many ways, this island.  I am sure many took courage from his courage in believing that there was a prospect of peace and reconciliation among people of different traditions on this island.</P>
      <P>He was appointed by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, to the Seanad in a most welcome gesture, a decision that I am sure was welcomed by all Members.  His contribution to the Seanad, both formal and informal, was valued by everybody in both Houses. He subsequently became a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. Anybody who was touched by Gordon Wilson could not but be struck by his commitment to this island and all its people.  He was from the Methodist tradition imbued with the spirit of John Wesley, a non-conformist in many respects, but passionately committed to the rich tapestry of cultures and diversity that makes up this island.  His family suffered another tragedy recently in the death of his son.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I personally and on behalf of the Government extend sincere condolences to all members of his family.  We have lost a trusted and valued Member <Col N="192" /> of the Houses of the Oireachtas and a great Irish person.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the Minister in this expression of sympathy.  The nation will be shocked and saddened by the tragic death of our good colleague, the late Senator Gordon Wilson.  As the Minister stated, he caught the imagination of the whole world by his dignified and moving account of his last conversation with his daughter, Marie, following the horrific explosions in Enniskillen in November, 1987.  Many on this island offered condolences on that occasion.  It was an incident of the troubles that showed people that there must be another way.  More than any person, I believe he personified the deep yearning for peace throughout the country. He always spoke from the heart and peace was his bottom line.</P>
      <P>His nomination to the Seanad by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, was supported by everybody in this country, as was his later nomination by the same Taoiseach to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, representing a recognition of the universal respect in which he was held and a reflection of his continuous commitment to peace which he pleaded with others to follow.</P>
      <P>The late Senator Gordon Wilson was a very brave, courageous man who said what he thought and treated everybody with the same gentleness, courtesy and good humour.  In his own way he was a very good story teller and character and made a very valuable, personal, thoughtful contribution to the deliberations at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation when he attended its regular Friday meetings.  He was anxious to represent the voice of the Northern Protestant community in the South, while always making the point that he was not their representative in any elected capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was enormously heartened by the ceasefires.  Two Fridays ago I spoke to him while we drank the usual cups of tea before, during and after the meetings of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, when he voiced his strong view <Col N="193" /> that the peace would hold and be tremendously successful.  He believed that to be a tribute to the plain people of Ireland.  He longed for peace.  I know that both inside and outside the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation his spirit was one of forgiveness and reconciliation, evidenced within his family in a manner not so evident in any other family nationwide.</P>
    <P>The late Senator Gordon Wilson will be deeply missed.  On behalf of my party I offer my deepest sympathy to his wife, Joan, to the other members of his family who have suffered so much, and to his many personal friends.  I also send our sympathy to the people of Enniskillen in association with whom the late Senator Gordon Wilson will always be remembered by Members.  We salute a man who, through personal tragedy, was a tremendous example of forgiveness and reconciliation, whose vision contributed to peace on this island, whose life and humanity straddled all borders.  We were all honoured to have known the late Senator Gordon Wilson, unfortunately for too brief a period.</P>
    <P>May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>The life of the late Senator Gordon Wilson had a profound impact on this island and beyond.  Through the darkness and misery of violence over very many years, including his own personal tragedies, his gentle, clear voice touched us all.</P>
      <P>In his first speech in the Seanad he said: &ldquo;I only ask for your good wishes and prayers that I get the grace to live up to the expectations and hopes that have been asked of me.&rdquo;  He did.  Every one of us in Leinster House, every TD and Senator, in addition to every member of the staff, now has the aching feeling of knowing they have lost a dear friend.  As Senator Wilson moved around the House invariably he left smiling faces in his wake; he was interested in everybody's concerns.  No words are adequate to capture Gordon's courage, his vast resource of humanity and Christianity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="194" /> Two years ago, again in Seanad Éireann, he said: &ldquo;We all have the capacity for good as well as for evil but, more importantly, we have the capacity to change&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Gordon made a vast contribution to the process of change which has brought light to this island, North and South.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Taoiseach, Leader of the Fine Gael Party and my party.  I offer my deepest sympathy to Gordon's wife, Joan, his daughter, Julie Ann and the many friends he leaves behind.  We will all miss him tremendously.</P>

      <P>The cruel and sudden death of Senator Gordon Wilson shocked us all.  As others said, he personified forgiveness and reconciliation ever since he came to ours and the world's attention on that famous bleak day in 1987 when he lay in the rubble after the Enniskillen Remembrance Day atrocity as his daughter, Marie, died.  In Gordon Wilson we saw then, on the one hand, the tragedy of Northern Ireland and, on the other, the spirit of forgiveness and reconciliation required if we are to build a lasting and durable settlement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>His selection as a Member of Seanad Éireann by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, was an inspired one. We have all been privileged to have had him as a colleague over the past two and a half years.  The late Gordon Wilson was no ordinary person; he was a big man in every sense, an extraordinary human being.  He had a great sense of humour, he was tall, emotionally strong and had an intellectual capacity many often underestimated.  I remember at the opening session of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, when many of us felt a little uneasy having to work with people whose <i>raison d'être</i> and methods we had vigorously attacked and bitterly opposed, I looked at the late Senator Gordon Wilson and his spirit of forgiveness, I felt I had no right to object.  In everything he did and said at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation he demonstrated that forgiveness and <Col N="195" /> made no exceptions.  It cannot have been easy for him to have mixed with some delegates, yet he made no exceptions. He was indeed a role model of forgiveness and reconciliation for all of us.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that the late Senator Gordon Wilson represented moderate Unionist opinion in Northern Ireland &mdash; and was never afraid to spell out clearly what that meant &mdash; neither was he afraid to criticise the lack of leadership among the Unionist community and their failure to negotiate and be moderate. I will quote from his speech at the opening session of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation about the need for moderation:</P>
    <P>Maybe coming from my background I can say how difficult it is for all of us to compromise because that can be seen as a dirty word, implying a rejection of one's heritage and a betrayal of one's background. Accommodation is not a betrayal but maturity.  It is the sort of maturity to which we must aspire in this country if we are to go forward and not be so obsessed with looking backwards all the time.</P>
    <P>I think it was 13 January last when the late Senator Gordon Wilson made his submission to the Forum for Peace and reconciliation on the cause of the problem and gave his ideas on what was required for a political settlement in Northern Ireland.  He quoted the words of the Ulster poet, John Hewitt, from his &ldquo;Memorandum for the Moderates&rdquo; as follows.  I could find no more fitting epitaph than these words:</P>
    <P>Speak peace and toleration;</P>
    <P>moderate your tone of voice and everywhere avoid what might provoke;</P>
    <P>good will must be deployed in efforts to restore our balanced state;</P>
    <P>to long-held views sincere give proper weight;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="196" /> one brief rash word and all might be destroyed.</P>
    <P>That would be a fitting epitaph to the late Senator Gordon Wilson because in everything he said and did, he was indeed a man of peace.</P>
    <P>I offer my sincere sympathy and that of my party to his wife, Joan and his daughter, Julie Ann.  I know he had been really looking forward to Joan's retirement when he had hoped she would have been able to spend much more time with him in Dublin and elsewhere as he constantly travelled around the country, always willing to accept invitations even when sometimes it was very difficult for him.  I can think of no two women who have suffered more devastation and heartbreak than they have, having lost so much.  Life at times appears to be so unfair to some.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest tribute we can build to the memory of the late Senator Gordon Wilson is to continue to work for the tolerant, moderate Ireland he spent his life trying to build.  If we leave no stone unturned seeking to consolidate the peace process, then we shall have paid a great tribute to an extraordinary man and wonderful colleague.</P>

      <P>Like everyone in this House and outside it, I was stunned to hear of the sudden death early today of Senator Gordon Wilson.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Senator Wilson was a truly remarkable man whose courage and resilience was an inspiration to people of all religions, of none, and to those of virtually every political persuasion.  The dignified manner in which he responded to the brutal murder of his daughter, Marie, in the Enniskillen Remembrance Day massacre played no small part in creating the climate of public opinion which led ultimately to the ceasefires on the part of the Nationalist and Loyalist paramilitaries last year.  His willingness to share his awful grief with the public, his courage in engaging in dialogue with those responsible for the murder of his beloved Marie and his determination to <Col N="197" /> challenge bigotry and intolerance wherever and whenever he met them left an indelible impression on the public mind.</P>
    <P>The fact that he was willing to accept the nomination of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, to be a Member of Seanad Éireann, despite the opposition of many of his own community, typified the courage of Gordon Wilson.  I got to know him ony when we both became members of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  It was perhaps in that arena that he made his most significant contribution to Irish society, with his knowledge and understanding of the Unionist community, his ability to put their point of view while being prepared to listen and endeavour to understand those with whom he disagreed which provided a unique dimension to the deliberations of the forum.  The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, the Oireachtas and all the people of this island are the poorer for the loss of this remarkable man.</P>
    <P>Today our thoughts must also turn to Gordon's widow, Joan, who, in a short time lost her daughter and son and now, her husband.  Within a few short years Mrs. Wilson had had to endure more suffering and loss than anyone should be expected to bear in a lifetime.  On behalf of Democratic Left, North and South, I extend to Joan and to her daughter, Julie Ann, my deepest sympathy and condolences.</P>

      <P>I, too, was shocked and saddened by the untimely death of our esteemed Oireachtas colleague, Senator Gordon Wilson.  He was a good, gentle and kind man who possessed incredible courage and deep conviction. I was honoured, as were all of us in the Oireachtas, when he accepted my offer of an appointment to Seanad Éireann to represent the changing times and the need for a change.  We were all delighted when he also accepted a nomination to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation for he, above all other people in this country, personified peace and reconciliation.  He recognised the need for change, he preached the <Col N="198" /> message of change and carried his message of forgiveness and reconciliation of all parts and traditions of this country. He was a shining example to all of us. He led by example.  We must continue to carry the message of Senator Gordon Wilson in the days, months and years ahead so that we can all finish the job in which he so enthusiastically participated.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand how the Wilson family were asked to bear such an unbearable burden of tragedy but Senator Wilson accepted his cross and he wanted to share with everybody his innermost thoughts of forgiveness and reconciliation.  To his wife, his daughter and his many friends, both nationally and internationally, I wish to say that all of us in the Oireachtas will miss him badly but we will follow the example he set.

      <P>Senator Wilson was so full of life and love of life and was so peaceful and outspoken that it is hard to believe he will not speak to us again. It was an honour and a privilege to have known him.  I served with him on the Forum of Peace and Reconciliation. While all members of the forum are able and well intentioned he was perhaps the one we could least afford to lose.  In terms of his contribution to the forum he will be irreplaceable.</P>
      <P>Senator Wilson spoke with an honesty and a clarity which transcended the popularity-seeking that is sometimes associated with politics.  He said exactly what was on his mind and he was prepared to try anything that would bring peace.  He was prepared to speak to members of the IRA when many were entrenched in their views regarding them and would not dream of speaking of such a prospect.  As a southern Protestant, whose late cousin was a Methodist clergyman in the North, we often discussed options and implications because he was a man who considered everything very carefully.  He had a great sense of humour and we must remember that when we mourn his passing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> Having voiced his options publicly, Senator Wilson would often say, &ldquo;I am not looking forward to talking to some people when I go home tonight&rdquo;, but he said it in such a way that one knew it would not divert him from the path of peace on which he had embarked.  He had a way of letting people know that if he made statements with which they did not agree, they were not made with any personal malice but merely with reconciliation as the objective.  To that end, we have a fine example to follow in Gordon Wilson.  Go ndeanadh Dia trocaire ar a anam agus go raibh gach rath ar a clann, ar a bhean agus ar a iníonn.</P>

      <P>The late Senator Gordon Wilson was a fellow Ulsterman and Northerner, although he was born in County Leitrim.  As someone who comes from the other tradition in the North and who knew Gordon Wilson even before the tragic events in Enniskillen and his appointment to the Seanad, I wish to pay tribute to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two things that ought to be understood and remembered about Gordon Wilson.  The first is his Christianity. He symbolised Christianity and was a member of a certain section of Northern Protestantism to which the phrase &ldquo;a true Christian gentleman&rdquo; very much applies.  All of Gordon Wilson's thoughts and actions were Christian. I had a long conversation with him recently about the North and the prospects for peace.  Of course, he never recovered from the tragic death of his daughter, Marie, in 1987.  He told me he had not had a full night's sleep since then.  He confessed to me that it was only his deep Christianity which kept <Col N="200" /> him from &ldquo;finding the waters of Lough Erne very inviting&rdquo;.  That is an illustration of the torment through which Senator Wilson lived.</P>
    <P>The second thing I will remember about Senator Wilson and which made his position on the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation so fitting was the emphasis he always placed on reconciliation. Like Deputy Harney, I had reservations, when I attended the first meeting of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, in relation to some of the participants but having spoken with Gordon Wilson, I decided that if he could forgive, there was no reason for me or anyone else at the forum to be bitter.  That must be the lesson for the future.</P>
    <P>We in this House should dedicate ourselves, through the forum and in every other way possible, to building a future without violence.  Such commitment would be a fitting tribute to Gordon Wilson.  We must do everything in our power to ensure that never again will there be tragedies such as the murder of Marie Wilson or the many other horrific events that marked those years of the troubles in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I join others who have expressed their sympathy to Joan and to Julie Ann.  I know Gordon was looking forward to Joan retiring from her position as a music teacher and of buying or renting a place in this city so that she could share more fully in the part he played in politics in this community.  He worked too hard and committed himself too much, but that was in the nature of the true Christian gentleman he was.</P>

      <P>I briefly seek the indulgence of the Chair to be associated with the comments made.  Much has been said of the bravery of Senator Gordon Wilson and the appalling things he had to endure in his lifetime.  I agree with the comments, they were well and properly made.</P>

      <Col N="201" /> One thing I had in common with him was the fact that we both went to the same school.  Wesley College, and there was nothing he enjoyed more than to reminisce with me about Wesley, about how it was and how it is.  We had many discussions about it and he visibly and clearly got great pleasure from that. Recently I discussed with him how, next September, we would attend the celebrations of the 150th year of setting up the college.  We were very much looking forward to going together to those celebrations.  It is particularly sad to think I will be going to those celebrations alone as far as the Oireachtas is concerned, but I will certainly take him with me in spirit.</P>
    <P>While his primary contributions were to peace in Northern Ireland, Gordon also had a deep interest in the political situation and social conditions in this part of Ireland.  I had many discussions with him on various issues affecting my own Department.  He expressed an intense interest and was deeply involved in issues affecting all parts of this island. I join in the message of condolence to his wife Joan, his daughter Julie Ann, other members of his family and friends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of this Bill is to increase the membership of the board of An Bord Bia by two and to provide that one member of the board shall be appointed on the nomination of the Minister for the Marine.</P>
      <P>This Bill addresses a long running grievance by farming organisations that they were not represented on the board of An Bord Bia.  This was an error and on the enactment of this Bill, I will put the matter right by appointing two new members to the board, one from the IFA and one from the ICMSA.  This approach is justified because of the substantial levy contribution farmers make to An Bord Bia which in 1995 will be in the region of £4.3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite apart from their direct financial contribution to the work of An Bord <Col N="203" /> Bia, it is high time to include farmers as key players in the food industry as it is they who must provide the raw material for the industry.  That raw material must satisfy processors' requirements in relation to quality, cost and timing of delivery.  The commercial partnership between farmers and processors must be fostered.  The processors are already well represented on the board of An Bord Bia.</P>
    <P>The direct representation of the IFA and the ICMSA on the board of An Bord Bia will be a further step in developing the partnership needed if we are to exploit fully the potential of the food industry to create additional wealth and employment.</P>
    <P>As a result of discussions which I had with the Minister for the Marine it has been agreed that BIM and An Bord Bia should cooperate closely in marketing fish exports with a view to the ultimate transfer of those functions to An Bord Bia.  We have both concluded that such a move would not only strengthen the export marketing of fish products by making available for that task the resources of a larger organisation like An Bord Bia but would also assist An Bord Bia in promoting the distinctiveness of all Irish food products and ultimately to develop some form of &ldquo;Brand Ireland&rdquo; for Irish food.  To facilitate that process, this Bill provides for the appointment of one board member of An Bord Bia on the nomination of the Minister for the Marine.  It is worth noting that during the debate on the An Bord Bia Act, 1994, a number of Deputies highlighted the fact that the marketing of fish should be included in An Bord Bia's remit.  Provision was made in section 9 of the An Bord Bia Act, 1994 to enable transfers of that kind to take place.  On the enactment of the Bill, I propose to appoint a nominee of the Minister for the Marine to one of the existing places on the board.</P>
    <P>I recently appointed the managing director of the Irish Dairy Board to another of the existing places on the <Col N="204" /> board of An Bord Bia.  This appointment will strengthen the links between An Bord Bia and the Irish dairy processing sector.  The Irish Dairy Board is by far the largest Irish food exporter and is highly representative of the dairy sector.  The need for such an appointment was also raised by many Deputies during the debate on the An Bord Bia Act, 1994 and I am glad their concerns will be met by the appointment of Dr. Noel Cawley.</P>
    <P>The food industry is Ireland's single biggest industry.  It provides employment for almost 200,000 people on farms, in processing and related activities. We must explore, examine and exploit every possible means of strengthening our food industry.  I said on a number of occasions that the realisation of the full potential of the Irish food industry would be capable of transforming our economy through additional employment and wealth creation and through the stabilisation and re-invigoration of rural communities.</P>
    <P>If that potential is to be realised, the industry needs to be more competitive to accommodate the effects of CAP reform, the GATT and any changes generated by the need to facilitate Central and Eastern European countries through enlargement.  It is important to realise that being competitive is not just about price or about the most up-to-date plant and equipment.  It is about quality, delivery at the right time and back-up service if something goes wrong.  Competitiveness is also about developing the human resources of an industry to ensure that the best advantage is extracted from all the other resources in it.  Competitiveness is also about innovation.  If we think we can develop our food industry by always producing the same products in the same way, then we will fail.  Food companies must continually look ahead and take a view of how the market is developing, how consumer tastes and eating habits are changing and devote a substantial part of their resources to innovation &mdash; to new product and new <Col N="205" /> process development &mdash; to meet those future changes.  Finally, competitiveness is also about marketing.  There is little point in having first-class products if one does not sell them in accordance with a well thought-out marketing strategy.</P>
    <P>This thinking underlies the programme for development of the food industry which I launched on 14 February last.  Under the programme, which runs from 1995 to 1999, a total of £640 million will be invested in the food industry.  Of that amount, £283 million will come from public funds, mainly the EU Structural Funds, and £357 million from the industry itself.  What is different about this programme is that, for the first time, all the factors involved in the development of the industry are brought together in a co-ordinated way. In addition to assistance for plant and equipment, the needs of the industry for additional investment in research and development, marketing and training are provided for, in line with the thinking outlined.</P>
    <P>Of particular relevance to the Bill before the House is the marketing function. A total of £66 million has been set aside in the programme for marketing in the widest sense.  An Bord Bia will have a central role in the implementation of the marketing measures under the programme.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia will publish a plan tomorrow detailing how precisely it will discharge the funds allocated to it under the programme in the years to 1999 and all the other State agencies involved in the food industry will do likewise.  To ensure consistency and synergy in their plans.  I established a management unit in my Department under the chairmanship of the Secretary which will examine and approve them as they fall due.</P>
    <P>I see an exciting time ahead for the food industry.  The massive assistance being underwritten by the State, EU Structural Funds and the commitment and skill of the State agencies provide a framework within which opportunities <Col N="206" /> can be grasped and challenges met.</P>
    <P>The constitution of the board of An Bord Bia will be pivotal to the success of the programme.  Strengthening the board of An Bord Bia as I described will put it in a better position to deliver what is needed.</P>
    <P>Section 1 of the Bill provides that the minimum number of ordinary members of the board shall be increased from nine to 11 and the maximum from 11 to 13.  It also provides that one ordinary member shall be appointed on the nomination of the Minister for the Marine as well as for certain consequential changes in the provisions governing the terms of office of board members.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides for the short title and collective citation of the Bill.  Since publication of the Bill, I received a letter from the chairman of the board, Mr. Ned O'Sullivan stating that he has been given a major promotion with ITV and is to take up residence in London.  He will be unable to remain on the board or as chairman.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to him.  His expertise as a marketer of drinks at international level has been invaluable to the board and he will be greatly missed.  I thank him for his dedicated work as chairman in recent months and particularly acknowledge his input into the five-year development plan.</P>
    <P>It is vital that farmers are directly represented on the board.  When I travel abroad to food fairs and exhibitions and quality is mentioned, invariably it is in the context of meat, better genetics, confirmation of carcase and less fat. When we talk about dairying we talk about somatic cell counts, less butter fat and more protein.  It all relates to primary production, and farming practices, I am trying to ensure that all elements of the food chain are represented on the board.  For the first time there will be joint marketing of Irish red and white meat, drink, seafood and horticultural products.  I hope this will culminate in the biggest promotion of Irish food in Ireland under the aegis of An Bord Bia. The board is in its infancy and expanded <Col N="207" /> membership will ensure the controversy caused by the exclusion of the agricultural sector will be rectified.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I join the Minister in thanking the outgoing chairman of the board.  We hope the Minister will be in a position to appoint someone who will continue the good work.</P>
      <P>This Bill seeks to amend the composition of the board of An Bord Bia.  The policy decisions on streamlining the food industry were taken by the previous Administration and implemented by the then Minister, Deputy Walsh, in response to the expert group set up as a result of the Culliton and Moriarty task force reports.</P>
      <P>The Bill is simple in its concept.  The Minister has yet to appoint a female appointment to the board.  The gender equity provision of the directive applies to this Government as much as it did to the previous one.  The Minister in error claimed credit for appointing a female to a board the warrant of appointment having been made during his predecessor's time.  Will the Minister state who will be the appointees to the board as it has been heralded that one will be from the IFA and one from the ICMSA?  Many people in the industry would like to know who will be appointed.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to suggest that farmers or primary producers are not represented on the board.  When a person is appointed to the board his occupation or status is irrelevant.  As a member of the board one's primary duty is to serve it without reference to outside agendas, particularly sectional ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the great mistakes of successive Ministers in many Departments has been to believe that every vested interest must be represented on a board for it to be effective.  That is not logical. Mr. Michael Hanrahan and Mr. John Duggan are eminent farmers involved in the co-op business, in the ICMSA and the IFA but this is not why they are members of the board.  They are quite <Col N="208" /> capable of representing the view of farmers in so far as it would apply to any matters under discussion by the board. They are members because of their expertise as farmers.  Such experience should be the <i>raison d'être</i> for any person's membership of the board.  Competence, not membership of an organisation should be the determining factor.</P>
    <P>While I know prospective appointees from farm organisations the Minister has in mind will be more than able to contribute positively, I do not accept in principle that all organisations must be represented on the board.  The Minister said he will make the appointments on the basis that primary producers pay levies to the tune of £4.3 million.  This is not a reason <i>ipso facto</i> people should be members of a board.  The food industry is a multi-billion pound industry.  Levies should not be a determining factor in whether people should or should not be represented on the board.  This is not to say that people from those bodies should not be on the board but the argument on the basis of levies paid is weak.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been pressured by controversy which arose because the representative organisations were not explicitly given the right to nominate persons to the board.  Representatives of the IFA in executive capacities are not excluded from membership of the board of An Bord Bia but representative organisations have not had until now a nominating role for boards. There is good reason for this.  If we follow the Minister's contention to its logic every constituent area of the food industry in terms of its positive contribution to a multi-billion pound industry, would be entitled to a member on the board. Clearly this is not feasible.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister sees political kudos for him in appointing these people to the board and this is his primary motivation.  He made this announcement when he met them on the IFA's 25th anniversary on 6 January. To say that the payment of £4.3 million in levies is the reason for the appointments is insulting everybody's intelligence.  It does not make sense.  If <Col N="209" /> this was the case, every co-op and export marketing organisation which makes a contribution to the food industry would be entitled to have members on the board.  I am not objecting in principle to the appointment of people from the IFA or the ICMSA to the board. However, the Minister is seeking to assuage a vested interest, as he sees it. Two eminent members of the farming community are already on the board and are well able to ensure primary producers' interests are articulated and defended.</P>
    <P>I made this point at the outset because of the importance of the food industry.  The key issue in terms of how we develop a progressive industry was outlined in the Culliton report, which stated that a key requirement is a vision shared by producers and processors in different sectors and this must be supported by Government development agencies.  Probably one of the great weaknesses of the Irish food industry until now was that there was not a share vision.  Very little is being done by either side to establish common ground between producers and processors so that the long term interests of the Irish food industry are served.</P>
    <P>We know from farmers' perception of the interests being served that they have great distrust of the processing industry. Examples can be given to show why farmers have good reason to be suspicious of the intentions of processors in terms of price and why they feel there is a cartel in the ring when they go to sell their livestock.  The processing industry has developed a great deal of sophistication.  We have a more market led agriculture now than we had when we had a price support mechanism under which, regardless of production levels, there was a guaranteed price.  In the absence of a significant live trade, it is always felt by the primary producer that the processing industry takes advantage of this situation.</P>
    <P>This is further exacerbated by the key weakness in the food industry probably since the foundation of the State &mdash; the seasonality of our production systems <Col N="210" /> and the failure to avoid a glut at various times in the season, particularly with regard to beef.  The continuing divergence of opinion between farmers and processors as to where the real interests of the Irish food industry lie must be overcome.  The Minister and Members of the House can seek to persuade but until producers and processors find common ground on these issues, so that they can be resolved in the long term strategic growth in the niche markets we have identified as a result of the Culliton and Moriarty reports and the report of the expert group on the food industry.</P>
    <P>We agree with everything in these reports but we know the practice is different.  People go back to their vested interest groups and short term entrenched positions.  More enlightened practitioners in the food industry have indicated that this must be challenged. The Minister must be mindful that there will be short term political difficulties in facing up to this problem but if we have the long term interests of the food industry at heart we will have to address this issue.</P>
    <P>I have enormous admiration for the many excellent people in these organisations who represent farmers exceptionally well, both here and abroad.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely vital that the membership of the board does not seek to protect vested interests.  Rather it must seek to bring about the shared vision to which Culliton referred.  This key weakness can only be overcome if the board considers the overall picture.  All the boards set up by the Department must have this shared vision.  The Department is the regulatory body but only the industry can ensure that it achieves its full potential.  The work has already been completed on the strategies and policies, the direction in which the industry should go, the winners and where the investment both in terms of capital and marketing initiatives should be placed.  There is a general agreement on these issues both politically and <Col N="211" /> otherwise as they make sense and a great deal of work has been put into them in recent years.  Unless there is a change of culture among those in the industry and we are willing to educate each other on the importance of taking the long term rather than the short term view, we will not have the type of industry our natural resources and grasslands would give in terms of competitive advantage both in the European Union and elsewhere.  I emphasise this point because, if we were to achieve this competitive advantage, the potential of the industry could be realised rather than merely talked about.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is our most important indigenous industry.  Foreign computer, pharmaceutical and electronic industries are attracted here because of our well educated workforce and good macroeconomic competitive advantages, but then can move or stay depending on how well we manage our economy in the meantime.  While we will always have the competitive advantage our grasslands give us in terms of environmentally friendly farming etc., the industry will not achieve its full potential without a shared vision.  If this key requirement is not met what we are trying to do in terms of structures will not work to the extent that it should.  In the past there was a lack of co-ordination in the part of the various marketing organisations in their attempts to build structures which would meet the needs of a modern food industry.  However, the co-ordination of these attempts may result in our taking our eye off the ball, that is the need to find a common ground between producers and processors so that everyone knows it is in their interests to produce the food required by consumers in an effort to increase our market share in the most sophisticated consumer market in the world, the European Union.</P>
    <P>This £8 billion indigenous industry employs 200,000 people.  The import content of Irish food is only 14 per cent whereas the import content of foreign non-food companies is 80 per cent.  A <Col N="212" /> competitive food industry creates jobs not only in the food sector but in the wider sub-supply sectors.  The contribution of food to net exports &mdash; 40 per cent &mdash; is also an indication of the central importance of the industry to the economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister is seeking to make two further appointments to the board.  This is the first opportunity many of us have had to outline the problems and the need to be aware of the growing complacency in the industry.  Recently people to the fore in driving the food industry such as Denis Brosnan referred to the need to be aware of this complacency. Previously we had a commodity-based agricultural sector where production levels were irrelevant and price supports were in place.  As a result of CAP reform we now have a more market-led agricultural sector which needs to gain access to the market in order to survive.  While the food sector has adapted well to these changes much more needs to be done, and the expert group is pointing the way.  Unfortunately, this Bill is being debated the day before An Bord Bia sets out its marketing strategy.  If the debate had been left to another day we would have had an opportunity to discuss these matters in a more informed way.</P>
    <P>We need to start picking winners in the sectors and to take discerning decisions.  All too often the Department has played the field and adopted the short term attitude of getting the money and looking later at what can be done with it.  The Department had to grapple with a series of crises because it did not know what the final direction of CAP reform would be and it wanted to get as much of the cake as possible.  Hopefully we now have in place a marketing organisation which will take a strategic view of what needs to be done.  Given its objectives.  I wonder whether £66 million is sufficient to ensure that we have a real, solid marketing agency.  We will have to await its detailed marketing strategy to make a more critical assessment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="213" /> The most successful food conglomerates in the world spend enormous amounts of money on research, development and marketing.  Given that it will take some time to gain the resources necessary to do this, it is critical that the marketing agency is adequately funded.  The expert group in the food industry and Culliton have referred to the need to build more Irish companies.  We are talking about building twenty to forty £100 million pound turnover companies during the term of the plan.  It is sad to note that one of the companies at the cutting edge of the food industry, Green Isle, has to be taken over by a company from another country in order to develop.  There is a certain logic to this as there was insufficient capital within the country to help it develop.  However, it is sad to think that in order to develop, control of some companies will pass to companies outside the State.  That need not necessarily be a bad thing.  I understand the scales and the need for marketing and distribution systems into those markets. Greater penetration into those markets is an understandable objective.  It is sad that as we develop the food industry with indigenous raw materials there will be fewer Irish food companies in terms of ownership.  That is something which the Department, the Minister and others in this economy should take cognisance of to see if it is the right or the only way to go or whether we should have a greater degree of partnership as distinct from take-over in terms of the development of the food industry.  It appears that take-overs will become the norm rather than the exception and partnership will be the option taken by those who are not in the first division.</P>
    <P>As regards marketing, a couple of issues have arisen in the Department in recent months which jar and which will not be helpful to the job of An Bord Bia in the future.  Again, it is a case of crisis management.  The Minister and the Department are calling for a strategic marketing view when they do not seem to have one themselves in terms of delivering basic schemes which help to <Col N="214" /> build the image of an Irish food industry. The fiasco of the control of farmyard pollution scheme contradicts everything in the Minister's speech about the development of the food industry.  The fact that we are not able to manage our resources to ensure that such a scheme is properly funded is a reflection on our policy direction and our failure to allocate sufficiently where the need is most.</P>
    <P>If we are to pick winners in the food industry and in food companies, we must pick them departmentally.  We must choose schemes where there is obvious demand and where a critical element must be addressed.  The expert group on the food industry and the Culliton report always refer to the growing importance of the environment and the need for environmentally friendly practices as being the norm in agriculture.  It is not simply for the purpose of a good image, these are now becoming critical viability issues for many farmers.  The ability to deal with waste and farmyard pollution is an important factor in terms of the viability of many farmers, particularly in the small to middle income groups, and it must be addressed.  When we consider that small level of capital investment in relative terms, probably an investment of £14,000 to £20,000 on average, it is obvious we have failed as a Department and from our resources of thousands of millions to deal with that issue for 18,000 farmers.</P>
    <P>Yet at the other end of the chain, we will say that if we develop a food business and competitive companies, we will grant aid capital investment, provide repayable loans and increase the percentage of marketing initiatives.  We are again putting the cart before the horse. As the Minister said, there is failure to integrate the farmyard with the supermarket in terms of maintaining not only the food link chain, but the quality assurance on which the modern sophisticated consumer not only in Europe, but in Ireland, insists if we are to have a market share for our food industry in the European Union.</P>
    <P>The disease fee status of our herd is <Col N="215" /> an important issue as people look at Irish food.  This is another issue where there is a stand-off which should be resolved by the Minister.  It is his job to ensure that we do not harm the image of the food industry.  It is important to resolve these issues quickly because that is the name of the game, doing the job one is entrusted to do.  We do not want hassle over this because it will create a huge problem for us internationally if we allow it to continue.  It will be used by competitors in the same way as the live export issue was used.  This has become a cut-throat business and if people put a black mark against us, we should do everything possible to remove it.</P>
    <P>I understand that every Minister faces vested interest pressures and problems in Departments.  We must find a solution to this problem.  We do not need stand-offs because there are enough in our supermarket chains at present where people are being hurt.  We can solve this problem if the Minister has the goodwill and political ability to do so.  I encourage him to do so as quickly as possible.  The appointment by the Minister for the Marine of a person from the fishing industry was included in the definition of food in the original Bill but discussions had not been completed with an Bord Iascaigh Mhara at the time.  I am glad the Minister now has the opportunity to complete that process by making the appointment.</P>
    <P>I have no objection in principle to the fact that he is making these appointments and I hope board members realise that their job is to address the board's agenda and not to bring others to it.  A shared vision for the producer and processor will determine not only how effective this board will be, but how effective the food industry will be in meeting the targets it has set itself and which have been set for it by the Department and the Minister in the Structural Fund allocations.  I wish whoever is appointed to the board well, they will have our full co-operation and assistance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am mystified by the necessity for this Bill.  Perhaps Deputy Cowen was right when he suggested that it is a sop to some organisations so that life will be made easier for the Minister in other respects.  If that is the case, it is unworthy and it is not appropriate to bring in a Bill.  Regardless of whether it is appropriate, it is unnecessary.  If the Minister wants to appoint two further people to this board &mdash; I question the wisdom of a board of 14 running anything &mdash; he already has power to do so under the 1994 Act.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not mention the Order on today's Order Paper which he made in the past couple of days called An Bord Bia Act, 1994, Order, 1995, where he increased the existing board, as far as I can ascertain, from nine to 11.  That creates two more vacancies.  In addition, we are told that the chairman has resigned, which is unfortunate, but it is because of advancement in the company and I congratulate him and wish him well.  There are now three vacancies which can be filled by the Minister without this legislation.  Why not do that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unnecessary to bring in this Bill. If it is enacted, there will be a total of 14 board members, 13 ordinary board members and a chairman.  What organisation can be run by a board of 14?  I have plenty of experience dealing with semi-State bodies and boards of a promotional, developmental and regulatory nature and various others.  The ideal is that there should be six or seven intelligent people with a broad view of the task to be undertaken and who are not there in a representative capacity.  The curse of semi-State bodies has been the people who inhabit their boards on a representative basis.  If they are perceived to be the representatives of particular organisations their only contribution to the board usually is to fight the cause of the members of that organisation, not the cause of the board.  It is retrograde in principle, no matter who is involved, to increase a board unnecessarily for the ostensible purpose of allowing wide representation rather <Col N="217" /> than a presence for the purpose of furthering the objectives of the board.  In any event the Bill is not necessary.  Under the Order about which the Minister did not tell the House &mdash; but which is in today's Order Paper &mdash; he has power to appoint more people.  He gave himself that power at the end of last week and he does not need this legislation.  The House should only pass legislation when it is needed.</P>
    <P>I knew only some of the people on the board but I have got a list of the members from the Minister.  It is a good board, better than average in many respects.  I do not see anything wrong with it as it stands.  As there are two vacancies I do not see the need to increase its membership.  To increase it to 14 members is utterly foolish and is done for the wrong reasons, as the Minister knows.  This House should not facilitate him in doing it for the wrong reasons.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives me an opportunity to say a few words about the food industry and about marketing because this board is primarily about marketing and promotion and, presumably, about the increase of employment in the industry and so on.  Certain fundamental dilemmas face the food industry, one of which is the fact that it is now ultimately supervised from within the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  That Department has dealt with some aspects of food since 1987 but it has not worked. I spent much time on the other side of Kildare Street looking out the window of my office at the Department of Agriculture across the way.  It was usually covered in scaffolding as it appeared to be falling down from an early stage in its existence, but it is now visible again. That building about 30 yards away could have been 3,000 miles distant from the Department of Industry and Commerce in terms of its culture and approach.  I said that ten or 15 years ago and unfortunately I know of no reason I should revise that view.</P>
    <P>In the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry the whole culture is about the primary producer.  They are not interested in the food industry or <Col N="218" /> processing.  All these issues are secondary. If some benefit accrues to the economy incidentally, after the primary producer is looked after, well and good, but if not, it does not matter.  The primary producer is the only one who matters. That culture and outlook has caused this country huge loss.  That is the official policy borne out by this Bill and by what the Minister has said.  It is not necessary for him to appoint two primary producers since there are already two on the board.  He claims he is introducing the Bill to strengthen further the already extremely strong hand of the primary producers.  That is wrong.  That is not where the need is.  This is the traditional solution of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and of those who are not that concerned about industry as such and it runs totally in the face of what Culliton recommended. Unfortunately the Culliton commission's recommendations not only on the food side but on various other sides have long since been jettisoned or consigned to the waste paper basket with great loss to this country.</P>
    <P>The whole question of adding value where food is concerned is secondary in official thinking.  As a result employment will continue to suffer.  Employment is secondary because of two fundamental policy approaches by the Government: first, the traditional primacy of the producer over the processor and, second, the policy of taxing work and workers up to the hilt but of giving. on the other hand, large scale support to capital intensive, low employment creating and non-productive activity. An example of non-productive activity is the support given to building at great cost to the taxpayer.  Once a building is erected it makes no contribution whatever to the economy whereas the production of goods and the adding of value to primary agricultural produce is of enormous benefit.</P>
    <P>If people think there is a great effort nowadays to add value or to reinvest it is worth examining some recent figures.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="219" /> The State pays out large sums in grants and thinks it thereby fulfils its obligations to the industry and to the economy while the major Irish companies in the food sector prefer to invest their money outside Ireland.  Total acquisition expenditure by the Irish dairy companies over the past seven years is estimated at £1.2 billion, the vast bulk of which went on corporate purchases outside the State.  Recently a food industry analyst estimated that less than half of this money had been well spent, with the rest either unproven or poorly spent.  This capital flight into high risk foreign acquisitions tells us much about the state of the Irish food industry. With no possibility of increasing output and with labour costs driven up by high personal taxation there is no commercial incentive to invest in either additional primary processing capacity or in downstream processing facilities. That is the dilemma the Government should face.  Almost every penny of that vast expenditure by Irish co-operatives in the past seven years went outside Ireland.</P>
    <P>All that is being done here is the primary processing of the primary product: the value is not added here but in England, the US and so on.  They are continuously investing so that their most valuable activities are taking place outside the State.  That is the real dilemma. What the Minister said in his contribution is of no consequence and is only the same as has been churned out each time a Bill of this kind has been introduced. That is not tackling the difficulty.</P>
    <P>As was confirmed by the Minister, the time-honoured solution to all industrial development problems in Ireland is a massive dose of Government grants. The most important statement the Minister made today was that An Bord Bia would make a big announcement tomorrow.  This shows the primacy of this House &mdash; it certainly takes a lowly place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a great pity that so much of the agricultural processing industry is bound up in PR stunts.  I can think of many examples and it is sad that there will be another tomorrow.</P>
      <P>This House cannot be told what is happening, other than that large sums of money will be spent.  We know that under the sub-programme for the development of the food industry, the Government is committed to paying £283 million in grants over the period 1994-99, 70 per cent of which will come from the EU.  The Government thinks that is the solution but it is not.  As proof of that, between 1991 and 1993 the State expended £100 million in grant-aid to the food industry, yet the CSO data now available suggests employment levels in that sector remained static over that period.  Investment by way of grant-aid of large sums of money in the food industry is doing nothing for employment.</P>
      <P>There are a number of anomalies in the food industry, one of which is that by and large the big indigenously owned companies, which are mainly co-ops, perform basic processing of the primary product here, but do relatively little else.  Their value-added activities tend to take place abroad, through companies which they acquire.  As a result, much value which could be added to Irish agricultural produce here is done abroad for the benefit of other economies. This is partly due to our high costs in telecommunications, energy, transport, etc. and, above all, our high personal tax, which is beginning to drive companies into Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The other anomaly is that much of the value-added here is added by multinationals. Relatively few large scale downstream processors in Ireland are Irish owned.  The drinks industry is perhaps the best example and it is a national tragedy.  Apart from one tiny Irish owned producer of spirits, which has less than 1 per cent of the market, every other producer of drink here is foreign owned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="221" /> The Irish owned distiller is not enthusiastic.  It tried to sell out to a monopoly competitior, which is foreign owned, and was aggrieved when he was not allowed to do so.  He does not have much faith in the distilling industry and is primarily there as a tax arrangement under a BES scheme.  He has no interest in distilling as a long term commercial activity.</P>
    <P>Our main distillers, all our brewers, all our cider producers and most of our mineral water and soft drink manufacturers are foreign owned.  This is a disgrace and it is one of the anomalies of our food industry and An Bord Bia will not do anything to redress that.  These drinks producers are owned by foreign multinationals and their marketing strategies are devised abroad.  They are not interested in what An Bord Bia is doing because that body has nothing to contribute to them and it will not be asked, except for a grant if one is available.  We should give some thought to the position we find ourselves in, where the production of drink, one of our largest and most important indigenous industries, for which there is export demand, if we sought it, and high domestic demand &mdash; is entirely foreign owned.  If someone asked 30 or 40 years ago if that was possible, he would have been thought mad.</P>
    <P>It appears that everything which is reasonably profitable is likely to pass into foreign ownership and the companies in the food industry able to invest are making those investments in the form of acquisitions abroad.  This is the dilemma facing us all.  We should face up to these realities rather than debating them within the terms of the Bill. An Bord Bia will not achieve any worthwhile increase in exports which would not have happened in any case.  The multinationals carry out their own marketing and are controlled from outside the country.</P>
    <P>An Bord Bia is just another layer of somewhat dubious bureaucracy.  In effect, CBF will continue as a subsidiary of An Bord Bia.  BIM remains as a separate body &mdash; I cannot see the rationale <Col N="222" /> for that &mdash; and ABT remains as the primary marketing body.  However, although it has more experience, knowledge and resources than any other body it is not allowed to contribute to the promotion and development of food. This is crazy and is the direct opposite to what Culliton recommended.  Even An Bord Glas remains.  I was never very conscious of what it does but this House passed a Bill some years ago to set it up and, no doubt, it is still in existence.</P>
    <P>This incredible proliferation of organisations for every conceivable task suggests that job creation is a growth industry in itself.  Those employed to create jobs seem to be able to increase their bureaucratic type jobs more quickly and readily than those they are supposed to be creating.  It is more important to create genuine productive, value-adding jobs by the production of processed food products, processed to the product as finally prepared with the maximum added value for the convenience of the consumer.  We have little of that here and what we have is foreign owned for the most part.</P>
    <P>A recent sad example was that referred to by Deputy Cowen.  An Irish company called Poldy's was one of the few successes in the preparation of oven-ready and consumer-ready products in fish, meat and vegetables.  It was successful and had plants in Naas, Portumna, Sligo or Mayo and Dublin.  It is now owned by Northern Foods of England; it was taken over because it was successful.  How often has that been repeated, and, more important, how often will it be repeated?</P>
    <P>The net effect of such takeovers is that Ireland is simply a producer of primary agricultural produce, usually of a good standard, which is made available to other processors to add value for the benefit of other economies.  I have a vision of the food industry here which is different and we should get on with developing it.</P>
    <P>The drinks industry, both distilling and brewing, is a substantial user of agricultural products.  It is a large and <Col N="223" /> successful industry here &mdash; although it could be a great deal more successful &mdash; and every single part of it, bar one minute distillery which wants to get out of the business anyway, is foreign owned.  That is a great tragedy.</P>
    <P>Unless we as a House, a Government and a country face up to these fundamental problems, difficulties and anomalies, we are only codding ourselves. Trying to pass this Bill today simply to add two people to a board of 14 people, which the Minister has the power to do anyway even if the Bill was never passed, seems quite ridiculous.  A Bill such as this will not help.  We need to come to grips with the fundamentals and the sooner we get on with that the better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. During the Second Stage debate on the An Bord Bia Act, 1994, I was one of the Deputies who highlighted the fact that functions in relation to the marketing of fish exports should be transferred from BIM to An Bord Bia.  I am glad to say that the concerns I had then are now being met following discussions with the Minister for the Marine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also glad to see that this Bill addresses the long running debate that the farming organisations, the IFA and the ICSMA, should be represented on the board of An Bord Bia.  However, let <Col N="224" /> me say at this stage that the two farmers on the board are there on merit in their own right &mdash; Michael Hanrahan, chairman of the Kerry Group, and John Duggan, the chairman of Avonmore.</P>
    <P>However, if farmers, who contribute by levy about £4.3 million to An Bord Bia, are to be key players in the food industry the two farming organisations should be directly represented on the board.  I agree with Deputy Cowen that it is very important we have co-ordination from the producer to the processor. That is exactly what we are doing in this Bill.  We are making provision for farming presentations to ensure that what the Deputy has said here will be fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Indeed, the appointment of representatives of the IFA and the ICMSA to the board will cement the link between the different stages of the food chain from production to consumption.  The recent appointment of Dr. Noel Cawley to the board will also strengthen the board and the links between An Bord Bia and the dairy processing sector.</P>
    <P>Turning to An Bord Bia and its overall role in the development of the Irish food industry, I have been impressed by the progress it has made in such a short time.  I disagree with the sentiments expressed here by Deputy O'Malley as regards the effectiveness of An Bord Bia.  It has achieved a great deal in the short time in which it has been in existence. An Bord Bia is vital to the industry and it will submit a strategic plan tomorrow which will guide its activities, promote leadership for the industry over the next five years and provide a very important focus.</P>
    <P>The main goals of An Bord Bia are: to build a reputation for Irish food based on consistent quality, consumer sensitivity and innovation; to ensure a market-led approach to the development of the industry through strategic market research and enhancement of marketing capabilities within Irish food companies; to inform the industry of marketplace developments through the provision of market intelligence and to enable individual companies develop <Col N="225" /> and implement specific marketing initiatives by providing financial assistance.</P>
    <P>It is important that An Bord Bia's strategy is firmly based.  We must recognise the needs of processors and rely on information on consumer requirements. Above any other agency, it must operate at the cutting edge of the market.  It must be the market eyes and ears of the industry. In a general way it must operate in partnership with industry.  I have been impressed, as I said earlier, with An Bord Bia's performance to date.</P>
    <P>The development of the food industry is of major importance to me as Minister of State and to the economy as a whole. I believe that agriculture and food are synonymous.  The production of food from farm to retail outlet must be regarded as a single economic activity to which a single policy must apply.  It is only then that we will get the policy right.</P>
    <P>There may be some justification for a separate approach so long as price supports in the form of purchases into intervention or export subsidies are available to dispose of surplus production. CAP reform has already commenced a major scaling down of intervention availability and a reduction in institutional price levels, while the recent GATT Agreement will reduce the amount of export subsidies available. The GATT Agreement will also intensify competition on the EU market by reducing restrictions on imports from outside the EU.</P>
    <P>Because of these developments, if we, as producers of significant volumes of farm products that are surplus to our needs, are to sell those products at a reasonable return to all involved, then we must sell them as processed products. If not, then we are likely to end up selling a substantial proportion of them as commodities on the world market at rock-bottom prices.  In this respect, I agree with Deputy O'Malley.  By adding value through processing we increase national income by selling them at a higher price.  Farmers may believe that <Col N="226" /> they will not see much of the added-value in their returns.  That may or may not be so, but there can be little doubt that if left to the mercy of the world commodity markets, they will get even less.</P>
    <P>The processor has much to do as well. In addition to all the obvious requirements imposed by the marketplace, the processor must be committed to innovation and marketing.  The processed food market is a fiercely competitive one and one in which Irish companies are small players.  It gives a sense of proportion to recall that the top food company in the world &mdash; Nestle &mdash; has a turnover equal to about three quarters of Ireland's GNP or that Heinz, which we rightly regard as a giant, only just makes it to the top ten of the world's food companies.</P>
    <P>I am determined that our biggest industry will realise its full potential and in the process make a major contribution to national wealth and employment. The task is a formidable one.  It is difficult to break into new markets which are highly competitive.  However, we have a good image as a food processing country and that image is well founded on a pollution-free environment and extensive production at farm level.</P>
    <P>Our State agencies are specially dedicated to the task of exploiting fully our advantages.  Our farmers are capable of producing the right raw materials.  We also have the entrepreneurs willing to invest in the plant and the human resources necessary to process those raw materials and market them.  Generous assistance is now available for such investment.  I therefore foresee a great future for the Irish food industry.</P>
    <P>The measures in the Bill before the House are simple but important.  They will strengthen considerably An Bord Bia and the marketing of Irish food. They will help to realise the potential of the food industry to the benefit of farmers, processors and all others who now depend on food production for their livelihood as well as those who will come to depend on it as employment <Col N="227" /> expands.  This is a welcome addition to the 1994 Act.  I am delighted that primary producers will now be represented on the board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for giving me this opportunity to speak to the Bill.  During the debate on the 1994 Act I spoke for 20 minutes on the issue in question, that is, the right of the primary producer organisations to be represented on the board.  I welcome the Minister's decision to allow the IFA and the ICMSA to be represented.  Two farmers are already members of the board.  It is extremely important that the organisations which sold the idea to farmers that they should provide funds to market their products should have the right not just at committee but at board level to decide how those funds should be disbursed.</P>
      <P>When I was a member of the board we had to be careful, in making hard decisions on whether we should cater for the needs of one industry over another, that there was no bias.  I and other producer representatives ensured in no small way that the element of trust was preserved.  The appointment of Dr. Noel Cawley is an extremely important one because of the close links between the dairy and meat industries.  One need only consider the success of some products in the dairy industry, such as Dairy-gold and Baileys cream liqueur to realise that Dr. Cawley can play an important role in providing advice to the board.</P>
      <P>One cannot but smile at some of the comments made during this short debate about the failure of the Minister and Minister of State to provide funding for pollution control and disease eradication measures.</P>

The year after CBF was established the then Minister, Ray MacSharry, cut its budget by half at a time when expenditure should have been increased to meet the needs of the industry and to market Irish meat abroad.  It was only when Deputy Austin Deasy increased its allocation to over £1 million that there was movement in this area.  If the board had been given the support it deserved, farmers, producers and processors would not have been as dependent on placing meat in intervention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a minor Bill and the criticisms levelled at it, in as much as it has been suggested it will not solve the remaining problems of the food industry, are unfair.  Some minor adjustments are to be made to the board of An Bord Bia.  It is unrealistic to expect huge changes in the industry.</P>
      <P>Other speakers outlined the difficulties confronting the food industry. Deputy O'Malley mentioned in particular that successful small Irish food companies tend to be gobbled up by international players.  They are made offers they are unable to refuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The size of Irish food companies presents the greatest problem.  If this problem is not resolved the food industry will not realise its full potential.  We should be realistic and accept that there <Col N="229" /> is a need to group the existing co-operatives into one or two major co-operatives with a turnover of £2 billion to £3 billion.  That is the challenge confronting us.  A large number of those at the top of the indigenous food and dairy industries realise that this needs to be done. Those with a vested interest tend to resist this concept as it would result in a diminution of their own importance.</P>
    <P>I have listened with interest to the debate but have yet to hear any suggestions as to how progress can be made on this front.  It is a pity that in the debates which have taken place on the development of the food industry little has been said about the ways and means by which amalgamation can be secured.  In the past initial private tentative discussions took place.  I hope someone will take the initiative to rekindle interest in such discussions as it is essential that we have large indigenous companies with the capacity to penetrate international markets.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, mentioned Nestle, whose turnover is equal to three-quarters of Ireland's GNP.  If the industry is to make progress it needs to develop new processes and products and spend enormous sums on marketing.  Deputy Cowen mentioned the sum of £66 million, but this will have little impact on international markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That was my point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>If anyone doubts that Irish food companies have failed to penetrate international markets all he need do is visit a supermarket on the continent. Irish food companies need to increase in size.  This would enable the industry to fund research and development, which is badly needed.  The extent to which companies invest in research and development is grossly inadequate. One of the characteristics of investment in research and development and product development is the enormous level of failure that must be sustained.  Most attempts at developing new products fail and these products never reach the <Col N="230" /> shelves.  It is only a very small proportion of new products that make it into the marketplace.  When products are successful the benefits and payoffs are enormous, but one must have a broad base of investment and be able to endure considerable losses in order to succeed.</P>
      <P>I agree with some of the remarks made.  I acknowledge I do not represent a farming constituency.  On the last count I could find only one farmer in my constituency and that gentleman has now retired.  I am in a luxurious position in terms of talk about the enormous strength of the farming lobby.  I realise it would be very foolish for people who represent constituencies with a large number of farmers to ignore this matter.</P>
      <P>I share in the criticisms of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in terms of the tremendous emphasis on farming matters in the Department.  The Minister has been in office for only a short time and his approach to date has been enlightening.  However, greater emphasis should be placed on the food aspects of agriculture.  I am aware that changes have been made in that area in recent years but there is scope for considerable further change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that much more attention by paid to the concerns of consumers, not only here but internationally, because we depend on those markets.  If we do not understand what the people want we will be doomed to flounder and the food industry will not realise its full potential.  That industry, together with tourism, are the two major indigenous industries which have huge potential to develop.  It is absolutely essential that initiatives are taken to consolidate the agriculture industry, particularly the dairy industry.  The beef industry has lunged from one crisis to another over the years, and I will not refer to them.  That industry has not made the first steps in terms of achievements. There are huge problems, particularly in the meat industry, in terms of <Col N="231" /> inadequacies of technology.  Technological investment in that industry is too low.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to this Bill.  The difficulties encounted by the food industry as a result of the weakness in sterling have caused problems for some of our food producing companies.  The Government has granted no assistance to this sector. In an industry where Irish manufacturing costs are 5 per cent above those of our UK competitors it is very difficult for Irish companies to compete on the export markets when the Irish punt is trading at or above parity with sterling. The exchange rate between the punt and sterling is a crucial factor in maintaining competitiveness in the Irish agri-food business.  It affects exporters trading in the UK market as well as those competing in other European and world markets.  Their competitive edge is compromised since their UK competitors are at an advantage.</P>
      <P>The present weak position of sterling makes it difficult for Irish food exporters to maintain market share. Today's news that sterling has weakened further makes it even more difficult for Irish food manufacturers to compete.  The effect is serious, threatening employment in this important labour intensive sector.  The Government must acknowledge the contribution of the food industry to the economy in terms of its output value and low import content. which is of the order of 14 per cent.  The only thing saving many companies at present is the fact that interest rates remain low.  Food companies currently exporting to Britain, one of the most volatile and competitive markets in Europe, have found that their margins have been eroded in the past three years as the punt has been trading at or above parity with sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="232" /> The obvious solution to the problems associated with the fluctuation in the currency exchange rate is the creation of a single currency involving all European Union countries.  However, recent evidence suggests this goal is a long way off and it is further complicated by the fact that Britain does not favour the idea of a single currency &mdash; it negotiated an opt-out provision on this proposal. This is the only viable long term solution. It would give some stability to Irish food manufacturers involved in the export market so they can plan medium and long term policies.</P>
    <P>More than 40 per cent of our exports go to the UK.  Any change in the exchange rate between the punt and sterling has an effect on trade with our near neighbours, a problem exacerbated by the fact that 75 per cent of food exported from Ireland goes to the UK. The value of food exported to Britain last year was of the order of £1.4 billion. Ireland currently supplies almost 11 per cent of Britain's annual food imports. Apart from the UK, and to a lesser degree Germany, the European consumer associates Ireland more with the production of first class alcoholic drinks such as Guinness stout and Jameson whiskey than as a main producer in the food sector.  We are told repeatedly about our green image, but let us not fool ourselves; most of the time we are trying to convince ourselves of this image.</P>
    <P>Irish food companies are relatively small compared to some of their international competitors.  If our products are to be found on the shelves of more world markets, our food producers must seriously consider options such as alliances, partnerships and producing branded products for major multinational food companies.  We heard criticism earlier about Irish companies becoming involved in foreign partnerships or buying foreign companies.  I do not see anything wrong in that and I commend the companies involved.  In recent years some of our major co-ops have bought into foreign companies on the basis that the easiest way to secure <Col N="233" /> market share is to buy existing companies trading in the market.  It is a relatively inexpensive way of securing market share and some of those companies have been badly stung as a result of some of their investments in recent years.  A number of Irish companies have gone down the road of acquisition, spending almost £1,200 million in the past seven years.  This is the road we must follow if we are to become the main players in world food business.  If Irish companies are serious about competing in world markets, they have no option but to join forces in some form with multinational food giants.</P>
    <P>We need to improve our international and branded marketing as a matter of urgency.  If the Irish food industry is to prosper and grow, it must diversify away from low margin commodity products, such as beef and dairy products, which are in surplus and move into value added downstream processing.  Some companies have been imaginative and gone down that road in what is becoming an increasingly competitive market but, unfortunately, others have not done so.  If we are to succeed, we must go down that road.</P>
    <P>As I said before, the Government stands indicted for not appointing a Minister with responsibility for food. While I accept and compliment the former Minister, Deputy Walsh, for setting up An Bord Bia, we must acknowledge there are two aspects to it, primary producers and sales and marketing.  They are and should remain separate indentities. Primary producers are more than adequately represented by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and former Ministers have done a good job in promoting and protecting the interests of primary producers, farmers. We must seriously consider the food processing sector and ensure its interests are protected.  I question whether the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry should have responsibility for that area.  That is another debate and perhaps An Bord <Col N="234" /> Bia should be answerable to the Department of Tourism and Trade, a proposal we might consider in the future.</P>
    <P>Since 1987 we have had a Minister of State with responsibility for the important food sector.  While it is universally accepted that the primary responsibility of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry is to the farming sector, there is a growing acknowledgement that the food industry needs political representation in the form of a Minister or Minister of State.</P>
    <P>Over the years our food industry has developed the capacity to produce and sell high quality, but relatively unsophisticated products, on domestic and world markets.  Only a few Irish producers have succeeded in developing any substantial presence in the export market with value added produce.  In a number of agri-related food industries the Irish sector has failed to keep pace with its competitors in terms of product sophistication and the price of basic products. The elimination of those weaknesses is essential if the food industry is to hold and build its market share, especially with supermarket groups in the European Union.</P>
    <P>Much lip service has been paid to the horticultural sector and yet the only success in that sector has been achieved in the production and marketing of mushrooms. We have failed to market properly our field vegetables, apples and soft fruit.  Tomatoes and lettuce can be produced in abundance with a market on our doorstep and yet we have failed to take advantage of those opportunities. There are major structural problems regarding the processing and marketing of horticultural produce.  While the most important market for those products is the fresh market, there are great opportunities for onward processing.</P>
    <P>I welcome this legislation in so far as anything that will strengthen the make up of An Bord Bia is to be commended. However, like our spokesperson on agriculture, Deputy Cowen, I consider that perhaps it is being introduced as a result of commitments given by the Minister earlier this year.  Farmers will contribute £4.3 million to the board by <Col N="235" /> the way of a levy in 1995 and they have a role to play in the functioning of this marketing board.  I have always held the view that a greater degree of unity is needed in the promotional activity of our major industry, agriculture.  A number of our fellow member states of the European Union have single agencies which deal exclusively in the food promotion business and they have had considerable success to date.  I anticipate that An Bord Bia will make important progress in improving buyer and consumer demand for Irish food and drink products abroad.  I welcome that An Bord Bia will have responsibility for the export marketing of Irish fish products. I look forward to the publication of the board's five year marketing plan.</P>
    <P>Given the challenges facing our food industry following CAP reform, the GATT and the need for our food producers to compete successfully on the world market, it is timely that we have a single agency to deal with the marketing of our food and drink products abroad.  I welcome the thrust of the An Bord Bia Bill introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Walsh.  We have a serious job to do and we must address the competitive nature of the food market, not only in Europe but worldwide. We have the ability to produce many agricultural products and we must seriously consider how we can secure added value in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly to this Bill, which is of importance to the agriculture industry.  I concur with the remarks of Deputy Nolan and I record my appreciation of the many successes for our agriculture industry achieved by the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, in his work as a member of the Council of Agriculture Ministers of the European Union. Those benefits accrue to primary producers, processors and the Irish economy. I wish to refer specifically to the urgent need to stimulate and encourage the emergence of innovative food enterprises and agri-business projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="236" /> My home county of Cavan is predominantly rural, with only 16 per cent of its population living in towns or their environs with a population of 1,500 or more.  The county is highly dependent on agriculture, which accounts for 32.7 per cent of persons in employment compared with a national figure of 14.3 per cent.  The proportion employed in that sector is on a par with the national level, whereas the 36.4 per cent employed in the service sector is well below the national level.  The food industry is the main subsector within manufacturing in that county and directly employs approximately 1,300 people.  Direct support should be targeted at new small scale and speciality food projects.  Training and support is needed also to develop product diversification.  New and existing food companies need to develop suitable scale added value food processing enterprises.  Quality innovative projects are needed.</P>
    <P>In the Cavan-Monaghan area there is a particular emphasis on the dairy, mushroom, poultry and pigmeat industries and there is practically no emphasis on added value.  The necessary research and development is not being carried out in those sectors.  Research, whether in individual agri-businesses or in the higher institutions of education, must provide better uses for the primary product through formulations to suit customer requirements.  Too much of our agricultural product is in commodity and not enough in added value. Research, adding value, customer requirement and the creation of customer needs must be interlinked if we are to derive maximum value from our agriculture industry.</P>
    <P>There is an obvious need for the establishment of satellite units or small food research centres in areas in which there is special emphasis on a particular agricultural commodity.  The Cavan area would be a prime location for such a unit, with possible co-operation from our neighbours in the North.  The desire of the US administration to help job creation in Border regions provides us <Col N="237" /> with a link to strengthen our national food industry.</P>
    <P>We must aim at exploiting to our best advantage the huge markets of the European Union and the United States. Satellite food research centres could provide advice on product development, marketing, labelling, testing and facilities which meet stringent European Union regulations.  I ask the Minister to pursue the idea of establishing small research centres and in association with Forfás to consider establishing an advance factory in Cavan geared specifically towards the food industry with an emphasis on development in a cross-Border context.  Such developments should be based on indigenous industry as private companies and co-operatives could, with proper direction and assistance, provide much needed jobs in the Border economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on giving recognition to farming organisations because without their co-operation it would not have been possible to establish An Bord Bia.  An organisation that encourages the farming community to respond by investing in excess of £4 million is entitled to recognition.  The farming community has always responded well to demands.</P>
      <P>Much nonsense has been spoken about a gender balance on the board and while I believe in equality, the best people for the job should be appointed to the board of An Bord Bia.  People should not be appointed for the sake of giving them jobs as was the case in the past.  As the organisation is in its infancy I appeal to the Minister to ensure that those appointed to the board are the best qualified for the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1987 Ministers for Agriculture have responded favourably to the promotion and marketing of agricultural produce.  Our farmers are possibly the most adventurous in the world.  Failure usually takes place outside the farmyard gate.  Farmers will endeavour to expand, but many manufacturers and agencies fail to market or promote their produce <Col N="238" /> adequately.  This is the case at present in regard to lamb.  I appeal to the Minister to assist sheep farmers who are experiencing serious financial difficulties. We produce probably the best lamb and pork in the world but we are not compensated for quality and image.  If the Minister does not address this problem immediately, we will lose that advantage.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to assist the food industry, particularly the cheese, confectionery and mushroom industries which depend to a large extent on the British market.  Approximately 35 per cent of Irish exports go to the UK market and the firms that export all their produce to the UK are experiencing serious difficulties.  Many small cheese manufacturers are in difficulty and have asked me to appeal to the Minister on their behalf.  We cannot afford to lose those manufacturers who require approximately 20 million gallons of milk per annum.  There may be very few of them, but they produce good quality cheese mainly for the UK market. Because of the uncertainty in the United Kingdom, which is likely to continue while there is uncertainty in the British Government, the Minister should set up a fund to compensate for currency fluctuations.</P>
    <P>Central marketing is not the answer. The primary producer and the manufacturer should be able to go to the marketplace to ascertain what is required for consumers.  For many years we have been bedevilled by people trying to sell the concept of centralised marketing in the dairy industry.  Will the Minister clarify the role of An Bord Bainne in An Bord Bia?  An Bord Bainne is not referred to in this or previous Bills.  If the food industry does not participate in its promotion we will not achieve anything.</P>
    <P>Before being elected to the House I frequently attended international food fairs where three or four Irish organisations would compete to promote Irish produce.  That is unacceptable.  There should be one organisation selected under An Bord Bia to promote our food <Col N="239" /> industry abroad.  I am disappointed with the work of An Bord Bainne.  Even though the UK market is on our doorstep, we produce very few fresh dairy products.  The Danes and the Dutch have tapped that market and are concentrating in particular on high population areas.  We produce mainly bulk dairy products such as whole milk, skimmed milk, buttermilk and whey powders.  We do not produce enough consumer products or adequately promote the Irish name across the world. Irrespective of how patriotic or Irish-oriented a supermarket is, it must sell foreign dairy products because similar products are not manufactured here. Because of the prevailing trend there is no incentive to manufacture them. Commodities in bulk do not constitute the answer.</P>
    <P>If we as a nation are to be successful in the food business everybody in that sector will have to pool their talents and resources.  While An Bord Iascaigh Mhara and An Bord Glas should be represented, so also should the dairy sector.  I heard other Members pay tribute to the many co-operatives that have spent money on acquisitions abroad to expand and diversify their businesses. However, if there are to be separate promotional units, without overall integration we shall fail.  I must emphasise that point.  I am always disappointed when I examine the list of consumer goods to realise that we do not have the variety or diversity of other European countries with whom we compete, such as Holland and Denmark, the two with whom we are always compared.</P>
    <P>Our food industry can be the envy of the whole of Europe, producing good quality food in a perfect environment, with good grass and animal foodstuffs, but more is required.  This Bill is not sufficiently comprehensive and a future Minister will have to pick up the bits and pieces and introduce a further Bill. Historically, that has been the failure of our food industry &mdash; the failure never has been on the part of farmers &mdash; in <Col N="240" /> the manufacturing, marketing and promotional area, which has been so fragmented as to fail our people.</P>
    <P>There are many quality commodities produced within the agriculture industry, the finest of which is probably beef. This sector has experienced difficulties in the past, all of which are now behind us.  There is an urgent need for greater marketing and promotion in that area. Prior to the establishment of An Bord Bia much good work was done in that respect which no doubt will continue so that we can retain our many markets for fresh red meat.  Today's modern transport facilities, air freight and frequent ferries render its distribution easier.  I am informed that it is possible to bring fresh bottled milk from a bottling plant in the United Kingdom to shop shelves here by 7 o'clock in the morning and <i>vice versa.</i>  Somebody here should take up that challenge and engage in milk exports, giving our food industry the boost it deserves while recognising the efforts of our farming community.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the contribution of the farming organisations will be of great importance to the board of An Bord Bia.  Many farming executives are innovative, far seeing people who will advance some excellent ideas, as will executives of many of our co-operatives.</P>
    <P>I represent an area with what is probably our largest food manufacturing industry, trading under the name &ldquo;Dairygold&rdquo;.  I have already expressed my disappointment that that totally Irish-owned company, with little involvement other than within Ireland is not represented on the board of An Bord Bia.  Representation of that region, which comprises practically all of Munster, must be examined sympathetically, especially within the pitmeat and dairy sectors.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to give sympathetic consideration to the suggestions I have made and to get away from the former method of appointment of semi-State boards by appointing the right calibre of people.  While equality is important, it is equally important to appoint people with the requisite <Col N="241" /> expertise, whether male or female, people who understand the business and will give of their best.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Having spent some time as a Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry &mdash; at a time when the food export group was established, from which An Bord Bia has evolved through a number of the recommendations of that group &mdash; the best that can be said about this Bill is that it affords us an opportunity to discuss the present condition of the food industry and its future.</P>
      <P>The appointment of two representatives of the ICMSA and IFA will not yield any dramatic change in the future development of An Bord Bia.  I read in the press last week of a rift between the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the farming organisations on whether their respective Presidents should be appointed directors of An Bord Bia, which point I hope will be clarified by the Minister.</P>
      <P>During my term of office in the Department it was my experience that people in the food industry had a genuine interest in its development for the betterment of the country as a whole.  We have first-class raw materials and, in marketing terms, a green island image, on which we should capitalise. Our farming community is producing high quality raw materials but the marketing strategies of food companies are in urgent need of examination.  While that green image opens doors to us on the Continent, commodity quality is the determining factor in attaining sustainable markets.  We must also be competitive, ensuring that we produce commodities which will be purchased by European Union customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our food companies must adapt to the changing scenario.  In the past much of our produce was put into intervention but the reform of the CAP has changed all that.  I should prefer greater emphasis on adaptation to the new European scene within which market supports are <Col N="242" /> lessened, with more dependence on quality produce with greater added-value. Underlying the potential for increased value-added in the food chain is improved technology, generated by research, applied by an increasingly educated, trained workforce.  Facing into a highly competitive future one of our greatest strengths is the exceptional calibre of our young business graduates who demonstrate an incredible appetite for greater knowledge.  These young men and women are selling our produce worldwide within many differing cultures and languages.  Exporters must realise the importance of foreign languages and improve the skills of their personnel, particularly in German.  I participated in many promotions with CBF when I observed that German was more widely spoken than English, on a par with French or Italian within the European Union.</P>
    <P>Our food industry has tremendous potential.  We must also carefully examine convenience foods, the fastest growing sector within the European Union.  While there have been some success stories of companies engaging in the production of convenience foods, we need to attract more of them.  This would lead to the creation of substantial numbers of jobs within an ever expanding market, in which endeavour I should like to see An Bord Bia participate. An Bord Bia needs to examine its marketing policies.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the short-sighted decision of the Government to halt the provision of additional prison spaces at Castlerea as well as the building of a women's prison in Dublin in view of vandalism on the rampage, the spiralling escalation of serious crime, particularly in Dublin, as well as the need to relieve prison over-crowding and provide modern, humane conditions conducive to the prevention of re-offending, as called for by the Mountjoy Visiting Committee and on which action was promised by the Minister for Justice, and calls on the Government to take a number of co-ordinated measures to deal with crime, including:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the immediate reinstatement of the prison building in Castlerea <Col N="244" /> and the women's prison in Dublin and the finding of the necessary economies in public expenditure elsewhere;</P>
    <P>&mdash;proceeding with a special detention unit for drug addicts and measures to stop the free circulation of drugs within prison;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the formulation of a constitutional amendment on the law of bail; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;the bringing forward of legislation to streamline criminal procedures.</P>
    <P>In every county old people spend sleepless nights in fear of marauding intruders.  In every house parents are increasingly and justifiably in fear of the free availability of drugs.

      <P>This translates to 40 per cent a month or about five a day. One in three shops has experienced violent crime.  In the last two years, over £10 million has been spent on security equipment to protect personnel and discourage attack, and £11 million has been lost in cash, goods and damaged property from retail outlets.  In the last 12 months there have been 3,800 detected drug offences which is only the tip of the iceberg.  Statistics do not tell <Col N="245" /> us what percentage of the approximately £60 million stolen in the last 12 months here was stolen in drug-related crime.  There is no doubt that these figures are alarming and that we do have a serious crime problem which is spiralling out of control.</P>
      <P>We are experiencing a crime wave, the likes of which has never previously been seen.  Indictable offences are now running in excess of 100,000 per annum for the first time in the history of the State.  Each day sees an average of over 300 new indictable offences added to the growing catalogue of terror experienced by citizens.  The sad and sobering statistic is that every five minutes a new victim is claimed by this remorseless reign of terror.</P>
      <P>There is a heavy onus on all those involved in the administration of justice to act quickly against this flowing tide of lawlessness.  Since the Minister for Justice came into office, over 50,000 new victims have suffered at the hands of criminals.  They have the right to ask what this administration has done for them.  Their neighbours have the right to ask what action this Government has taken to protect them from being included in the next batch of victims and what priority is being given to law and order, and they have a right to an answer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite the Members and the public to judge this Government on its inactivity. It is an incontrovertible fact that since taking office the Minister has failed abysmally to articulate a coherent criminal justice policy and to introduce a single measure which would stem the tide of crime.  She has mounted this podium of studied inactivity under the supervision of a Taoiseach who has publicly proclaimed that our prisons are full of people who should not be there.  I challenge the Taoiseach now to publicly state what prisoners he wishes to release, and how many murderers and rapists he wants to release into the community. How many robbers, thieves and burglars will benefit from his bungling benevolence?  How many drug pushers does he propose to return to the gates <Col N="246" /> of our schools?  How many court orders does he propose to tear up by releasing convicts at an early date?  They are the people who populate our prisons, who have been removed from society for its safety.</P>
    <P>Last Friday week there were 2,153 prisoners in Irish jails.  Only seven of those were there for the non-payment of debts and a further 22 were there for the non-payment of fines.  Over 98.5 per cent of prisoners in jails are there because they committed crimes against their fellow citizens.  They are the people the Taoiseach wishes to release because this Government is soft on crime, proved when it voted down a Bill introduced by Fianna Fáil which would have denied temporary release to prisoners convicted of crimes committed while on bail.</P>

This Government has sought to fight crime with an excuse in one hand and a committee in the other.

Why?  She was invited to go on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; to discuss the issue but she refused.  So much for openness and transparency. When her portfolio comes under scrutiny she believes absence is the best policy. She recently repeated this trick at Cabinet.  The sole positive contribution by the Minister was her announcement that 210 new prison places were required and would be provided by the Government.  These were to be the crown jewels of the Minister's reign. Unfortunately she left her palace unguarded and in her absence it was raided by the Minister for Finance and his gang and the jewels disappeared. The prison places were snatched and the Minister became a political banshee wandering the corridors and wailing to <Col N="248" /> whatever political correspondent would listen that the prison places had not been stolen, merely borrowed, and would be given back at some unspecified date in the future.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Since taking office, the Minister has shown herself to be allergic to legislation. If she spent less time hiding behind the skirts of the Law Reform Commission and more time developing a coherent criminal justice policy she might not be on the political road she is now travelling.  It will not be long until she is asked to relieve Deputy Coveney <Col N="249" /> in the political sin bin which the Taoiseach has made of the Office of Public Works.

      <P>No greater monument to the shambles of this Administration's justice policy exists than the wall which surrounds what was to be the prison in Castlerea.  Every brick in the wall represented a statement of hope for the people of Castlerea.  Every hour's work that went into its building represented a social lifeline for the locality. The Minister's political incompetence resulted in the Cabinet signing a death warrant for the town of Castlerea.  The late John Heaney would understand the indifference and fatal contribution of this Government to the death of an Irish town and the political callousness which permitted the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance to snigger when I raised the matter last Wednesday &mdash; the knowing snigger of shillelagh Machiavellis who would plunge the political dagger into the heart of a constituency which is not represented by a Labour Deputy.  The capitulation of the Taoiseach and the so-called party of law and order is extraordinary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wall which surrounds the hospital building in Castlerea will be long remembered by this Humpty Dumpty Administration as a monument to its indifference and naked duplicity.  The House is in the process of passing the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill in the knowledge that it will result in the need for increased prison accommodation. The Government has proposed a bail referendum which will also necessitate increased prison accommodation. In the same breath it cancelled plans to provide 210 badly needed prison places.  Neither I nor anyone else understands the morality of a Government which purports to have sufficient <Col N="250" /> money to employ programme managers, advisers and consultants on a grand scale but cancels promised prison places because of lack of finance.</P>

      <P>The Government might even consider building a wailing wall for the Minister.  This Humpty-Dumpty Government is heading for a fall and the public has seen through its <Col N="251" /> charade of seeking to occupy the high moral ground while practising the financial morality of an alley cat.  Public office carries with it a duty to spend money in the interests of the people but this Government has assembled an army of advisers, managers, handlers and spin doctors in an attempt to deceive the people and has done so with taxpayers' money.</P>
      <P>We have now reached the absurd situation where convicted criminals are being released because of a purported lack of finance at a time when the political cronies of the ruling rainbow gorge themselves on a crock of public gold. Humpty Dumpty cannot continue to straddle the wall and preach financial plenty to its cronies and financial hardship to the voters of Castlerea.  If a choice has to be made between keeping dangerous prisoners in prison and profligate advisers, managers and handlers in clover, I want to see prisoners in prison.</P>
      <P>This country needs tough action on crime and a Government policy on it. It needs a Minister for Justice with the political will to introduce that policy but at present the country has none of these. The Government has no crime policy.  It has a bric-a±-brac of committees, commissions and <i>ad hoc</i> groups trying desperately to establish one.  It does not have a Minister for Justice with the political ability to establish or implement the necessary policy.  If it had, chronic overcrowding in Mountjoy would be relieved.  Our prisons would not be havens of drug taking and peddling and people would not be going into prison drug free and coming out as addicts. Plans would be well advanced to tackle a drugs problem which has gone out of control by providing a special drug treatment prevention unit for habitual addicts and offenders.  The time to build that unit is now because as sure as night follows day it will have to be built.  Even though I know the Minister will not listen and I am wasting my sweetness on the desert air, I have to put this on the record.</P>

      <P>More importantly, was the Minister there?  She never seems to be there when important decisions are being made.  Cabinet confidentiality will prevent us from ever knowing whether anybody noticed the Minister's absence on the fateful day when cuts in prisons' expenditure were decided.  We know that if her absence was noted, nobody cared.  When the kitchen cabinet meets, the Minister for Justice is sent out to buy buns.  Her opinion is neither sought nor considered. Meanwhile back at the ranch, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, pours the tea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has presided over a greater daily incidence of indictable crime than any Minister for Justice in the history of the State.  She has the unique distinction of having been publicly humiliated by the Tánaiste and the Cabinet within weeks.  The extraordinary thing about this is that no Minister for Justice in the last 25 years has had a greater opportunity to tackle the crime problem because there has been a substantial peace dividend to her Department from the peace process.  Nobody <Col N="253" /> can find out where those resources are and where they are being spent but one thing is sure, they are not being used to tackle indictable and serious crime.</P>
    <P>The Minister continues to cling to the wreckage, apparently oblivious to the fact that a decision has been taken not to send out the lifeboat.  While she floats on a sea of indecision, the remorseless tide of crime continues to flow.  As the Minister drifts ever closer to the Office of Public Works, the victims of her indecision mount daily.  Will it take another 50,000 victims to prise her fingers from the Cabinet table or will she take the hint from yet another public rebuke?  I was not surprised to hear the Minister for Justice decided that it might be best for her to resign.  It would have been the honourable thing to do and is what she should have done.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to study carefully the contributions of her so called supporters. I invite her to listen in vain for whole-hearted endorsement from her Cabinet colleagues and to what is being said in Opposition and Government.  It is surely time for her to go, to leave behind the pretence of having a policy and to make room for somebody who has.  It is time to retreat from the shambles of announcing a bail referendum which the Labour Party will not back.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil will not surrender to crime.  We are determined to take the streets of this country back for ordinary decent people.  We are determined to wage an all out war on drugs.</P>

      <P>We introduced the Proceeds of Crime Bill, the Criminal Law (Bail) Bill, the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill and the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill. The Criminal Procedure Bill is on the Order Paper and will provide for an amendment to the Criminal Procedure Act, 1976, for the speedy hearing of certain scheduled offences and statutory conditions in relation to bail.  The Minister is leaving it to us to bring forward legislation to streamline criminal procedures. Government inaction rules.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will continue to speak on behalf of the victims of crime and highlight their plight.  We will continue to deplore the calculated callousness and indifference of this Government.  If the Minister for Finance feels he can shove crime so low down his list of priorities and shove the Minister for Justice around in the way he has done, he is making a bad mistake.  One of the central issues on the streets today is serious crime.  There is deep concern about it and nothing is being done to stem it. This is the time to admit the Government is soft on law and order and pursues a policy designed to release criminals back on the streets without having served their sentences.  This is the time for the Minister to take responsibility and do the honourable thing, which she previously threatened to do, and let go of the wreckage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Donoghue for sharing some of this time with <Col N="255" /> me.  A few days ago the Minister's face expressed grave shock and horror at the fact that she had been savaged in her absence by her own Cabinet.  This was an extraordinary thing to have happened. I and other speakers genuinely believed her concern about slashing her Department's budget was genuine and that her responses were an acknowledgement that she was outraged by what had occurred.</P>
      <P>However, within days she publicly indicated support for the decision of the Minister for Finance and the Government that the development of additional accommodation in Castlerea should not take place.  I thought such support would never be forthcoming from her, given the circumstances in which her Department's budget was cut.  This was extraordinary and a U-turn on what she indicated at the time of announcement to terminate building the prison.</P>
      <P>Since January she told her party colleague, Deputy Connor, that the prison would be built.  He feared that the west was once again under threat and made his concerns known to the Minister.  She gave him leave to publicly state she would proceed with the prison as agreed and planned by the previous Government, of which the Minister for Finance was a member.  A week ago the Minister for Finance carved her out of the Cabinet and out of the arena of public political credibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan was concerned about the interests of his constituency and requested the Minister to review building the prison.  She confirmed to him that the prison would proceed.  I cannot understand how she could behave as she did.  She showed such revulsion at what happened but she is now prepared to subscribe to a decision which is contrary to everything she set out to achieve and which is necessary to achieve her aspiration to deal with crime.  The Minister has failed to confront the crime problem and in doing so is riding roughshod over the victims of crime, ordinary people who live in fear of being attacked in their homes, shops, <Col N="256" /> pubs and places of work.  All she is doing is supervising a litany of horrific crime.  People have had their hopes dashed of living in the west and securing gainful employment in the development of the prison.</P>
    <P>When I asked the Minister for Finance if he considered it worthwhile building a prison in Castlerea he said that it was intended to extend other prisons and there were no Labour votes in Castlerea or County Roscommon.  If the battle against crime depends on votes for the Government then it is a sham.  It is an insulting, degrading and demeaning way to deal with this issue and it totally ignores the basic expectation of ordinary men and women to feel safe and secure.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary that the only weapon the Minister has in her armoury to deal with criminals is rhetoric.  This weapon is taken out every few weeks in response to a serious crime or when somebody is beaten, mugged, stabbed, shot or injected with a needle.  Rhetoric may create the impression of activity but it is making no inroads into solving the problem of crime.  It would be wrong of us not to make these points.  We are not making a personal attack on the Minister; rather, it is an attack on the Government and her for the way in which they are conducting this campaign.</P>
    <P>Every day 700-800 criminals walk freely on our streets as a result of the revolving door prison syndrome.  These criminals are taken into prison in the morning and sent home in the afternoon. Under the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill, prisoners who have committed crimes against people in Britain and other countries in Europe can be transferred to prisons in Ireland.  This means that criminals here will not be able to avail of the luxury facilities in our prisons.  The reality is that there will be guest prisoners in our prisons and the criminals with whom we should be dealing will be ignored.  Every day gardaí travel in taxis from prison to prison asking if they will take in the man or woman with them who has committed <Col N="257" /> serious crimes against their fellow citizens. This is not the way to run the system or the campaign against crime.</P>
    <P>Criminals in Dublin are a threat not only to the people living in the city but also to people living in rural areas. Every day and night marauding gangsters travel in stolen cars to rural areas where they rob small businesses and shops before speeding back to their hiding places in Dublin.  The country is under siege at present and all of us have an obligation to act responsibly and to support any action which will deal with the increasing level of crime.</P>
    <P>A few nights ago a 90 year old man in my parish, who is a member of Fine Gael and who lives on his own, was bound hand and foot with barbed wire by gangsters who broke into his home and robbed him.  He supports the points I am making and does not support the Government's decision not to build a prison in Castlerea.  This motion is not only about Castlerea, it is about the necessity to provide additional spaces for people who need to be taken out of society.  There is little point in having gardaí outside public houses at 12 midnight when criminals break into them at 3.30 a.m. and carry out acts of terrorism against the occupants.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that criminals who commit terrible acts of violence and vandalism will be sentenced to community service.  It is proposed that they will paint letter boxes, mow lawns and water flowers; yet we cannot provide similar work for students and unemployed people.  It is time to stop being nice, taking the soft options and providing luxurious facilities in prisons.  Rather we must bring these people before the courts and get them off the streets.  If we have money left over after clearing up this mess then we can consider rehabilitation, the soft options and the facilities which should be provided for them.  We should not be engaging in an exercise which gives rise to questions among the public about whether we are genuinely committed to dealing with this problem. In recent years politicians have become popular people to attack.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> We do not have to know what went on in Cabinet to know that the Minister for Justice was elsewhere when the budget for her Department was slashed.

When Opposition Deputies criticise this Government they forget, because their memories are so faulty that they are referring to their inaction.  Prisons did not open on 15 December for the first time.  Temporary and early release was not introduced then.

Some of the comments made tonight shock me beyond words because those who are to the forefront in the fight against crime are the 11,000 or so members of the Garda Síochána, a service and a force which has served this country admirably since 1922 when my grand-uncle was part of the founding group.  Every word of criticism which the Opposition has made is an implicit criticism of the work of the Garda Síochána and that is a disgrace. As a former member of the Garda Síochána, I was surprised to hear Deputy O'Doherty make the implicit criticism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us have the same level of order which obtained for the previous speaker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understandable that <Col N="263" /> the deferment of the Castlerea Prison project &mdash; I say again the deferment &mdash; is the source of concern to the people of Castlerea and it is right that they should receive reassurance that the social and economic impact of the decision will be addressed.  I wish, therefore, to inform the House that I propose to establish immediately an inter-departmental committee to review all aspects of the prison project for Castlerea taking into account the social and economic impact on Castlerea and the surrounding area and the need to identify and initiate measures to address such impact.  The committee will report by the end of December 1995.  The recommendations will be brought to Government without delay.</P>
      <P>I wish to stress that the inter-departmental committee, which will be chaired by an Assistant Secretary in my Department and will have senior representatives from the other Departments, will as a matter of priority consult with the Castlerea Development Co-operative Society so as to ensure that the measures identified to address the impact of the deferred decision are informed not only by broad criminal justice and related considerations, but also by local concerns and insights.</P>
      <P>I have been made aware by my colleague, Deputy Connor, that in the 1980s a number of industries ceased production in County Roscommon, including the loss of Fenner Stone and Triteach (Ireland) Ltd. in Castlerea with a net loss of 432 jobs in the county. While some of the lost industries have been replaced, the loss of industrial jobs has continued over the past ten years.  I remind Deputy Doherty that his party was in Government during seven of those years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 1986 to 1991 the population of Castlerea fell by 9 per cent, one of the more marked percentages in the country.  In 1936 to get elected to the county council approximately 1,800 votes was the quota but in 1991 the quota dropped to approximately 910 votes.  I will return <Col N="264" /> to a specific focus on Castlerea before I conclude my statement, but first I would like to say more about the background to the deferment decision and to comment on various other matters addressed in the Deputy's motion.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise that the provision of 210 additional prison spaces at a cost of approximately £30 million, as envisaged in the Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan published by my Department last year, had the objective of facilitating enhanced offender management capacity.  It was, of course, only one of a number of initiatives to tackle the acknowledged difficulties in our prison system.  What needs to be stressed straight away is that the need for enhanced offender management capacity has not, all of a sudden, disappeared. It does not mean that we no longer have need to provide resources and facilities, but there is need to look at how offender management capacity should be enhanced.  We must look, for example, at the provision of high security prison places allied to alternative types of custodial facilities, whether perhaps certain offenders could be managed at the same or less cost and so on.</P>
    <P>In other words, the Castlerea project is deferred &mdash; I stress deferred &mdash; not because the need for enhanced offender management capacity has disappeared but because it is entirely appropriate that the Government should take stock with a view to ensuring that the best results are achieved.  It is widely recognised that the whole question of imprisonment and what it achieves is a complex one and that the situation is constantly changing and requires ongoing review and assessment.  The five year plan, which was issued specifically not as a blueprint but with the aim that it would encourage discussion on offender management issues, itself underscores this point.  I am sure Deputy O'Donoghue has read it but if not I would be happy to send him a copy.</P>
    <P>There is also the particularly relevant <Col N="265" /> point that the Government's programme for renewal includes a commitment to examine the question of the setting up of a prisons board.  As I have already indicated, that examination is under way.  Also highly relevant are the material impact on custodial capacity of the peace process and, of course, developments in the juvenile justice area.  As Deputies will know, juvenile justice will be the subject of major of legislation which is at a very advanced stage of preparation in my Department.  This was not at an advanced stage when I took over in the Department.  All these elements argue unanswerably at this time for the need to take stock.  While there is a need to take stock in terms of ensuring the proper development of offender management capacity, there are also, of course, budgetary considerations. This Government is committed to achieving 2 per cent real growth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in gross current supply services expenditure in 1996.  As the House is aware, the Government is reviewing the 1996 budget proposals. This review extends to all Ministers, including the Minister for Justice.  In order to ensure a strategic approach to the allocation of available resources, all existing policies and expenditure will be examined with the aim of maximising benefits within the Government's spending target for 1996.  In this context, the Government examined a number of projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Proceeding to other relevant criminal justice issues which have been raised &mdash; first, in the matter of alternatives to custody, I propose to discuss the possible extension of community based alternatives with both the President of the Circuit Court and the President of the District Court.  I will be requesting both Presidents to discuss the matter with their colleagues.  I am aware that the President of the Circuit Court is now holding meetings with all the Circuit Court judges at which this issue could <Col N="266" /> be discussed while alternatives to custody&rdquo; could be placed on the agenda of one of the regular statutory meetings for the judges of the District Court by the President of the District Court.</P>
    <P>I am providing a total of £413 million this year in the Garda Vote which will ensure that the Garda authorities have available to them sufficient manpower and resources to tackle all aspects of modern day crime.  Over 400 gardaí were recruited last year and the aim of maintaining the strength of the force at about 11,000 members stands.  I am also confident that we will have worthwhile redeployment of Garda manpower from Border areas on an ongoing basis.  The Garda authorities have already decided not to replace members in the Border Divisions and I can tell the House that the strength of the Border Divisions has decreased by 53 since 31 July 1994 due to retirements, resignations and the reassignment of 16 probationer gardaí to Dublin following graduation.  The gardaí who would normally fill these vacancies have been assigned to areas of most need by the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>In these days of continuous technological progress.  I am sure the House will agree that the Garda Síochána should avail of the latest technology to assist them in the prevention and detection of crime.  In line with this policy, I have provided funding this year for the installation of closed circuit television cameras in Dublin city centre as an aid to policing.  The installation of a closed circuit television system for the Temple Bar area is the first such project to be undertaken and I expect that these cameras will be operational shortly.</P>
    <P>A code of practice for its operation is being prepared and this will be available to the public.  I am confident that the proposed system will have a beneficial effect on crime prevention and crime detection and also on the quality of life and business where this technology is applied.  The confident expectation is that it will prevent certain street incidents and crimes and allow for better deployment of Garda manpower and resources to the point of need.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="267" /> In recent years the Garda has been returning to a more community oriented form of policing.  Schemes have been started in a number of the highly densely populated urban areas, in Cork, Dublin and Limerick.  There is a proposal for a similar scheme in Waterford. These schemes have the benefit of identifying young people at risk who move into lives of crime and giving them some alternatives to a life of crime.  This is an inexpensive way of ensuring that young people who might end up in crime do not do so.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the drugs problem in this House on numerous occasions since I became Minister.  As I have already said, the problem is a complex one.  Successive Governments have recognised that the problem must be tackled on a number of different levels. To this end the multi-agency approach, involving the Departments of Health, Justice and Education and their respective agencies, has been recognised by the Government as providing the best possible framework to deal with the problem.  Essentially, we must deal not just with the supply of drugs but also with the demand.  We must focus on both parts of the equation.  This precisely is what the Government strategy to prevent drug abuse is about.  It proposes a multi-disciplinary approach requiring action in the areas of supply reduction, demand reduction and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes.  In other words, the strategy calls for integrated action on the problem on a number of different levels.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the drugs problem in prisons, I shall deal in some detail with the law enforcement response to the drugs problem.  Let us be quite clear about what is happening on the ground. All Garda drugs units throughout the country are co-ordinated on a national basis through the National Drug Administration Office in Garda Headquarters which is staffed by full-time gardaí with a detailed and specialised knowledge of the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> In Dublin, which is the main area where heroin is a problem, many drugs units have been established in each of the city's five Garda divisions.  I have already told the House many times where they are located.  There are also full time drugs units in Cork, Galway and Limerick.  While the strengths of individual units naturally fluctuate, we have never had more specialist gardaí committed to the fight against drugs. The Garda and the Customs and Excise Service, supported when required by the Defence Forces, have had a number of significant drug seizures.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of inter-agency co-operation, the House will be aware that my Department is finalising a detailed and comprehensive report on important aspects of law enforcement in relation to the drugs problem here. Based on that report, I am preparing a set of comprehensive and far reaching proposals which I will bring to Government very shortly.  The main task of the report was to identify the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem by the existing law enforcement agencies, and the proposals will be mainly concerned with this aspect.  If it had been expedited, that report could have been brought forward by the former Minister for Justice.  I am bringing it forward now during my term of office so that I can expedite and put into place the new arrangements which this country needs to attack drug trafficking.</P>
    <P>The House is aware of the level of drug abuse in Mountjoy prison.  It is difficult to know its true extent because it is a covert activity.  What cannot be denied, in common with the experience in other jurisdictions, is that drug abuse by prison inmates is a serious problem. Finding solutions, as any former Minister for Justice will readily confirm, is extremely difficult.  Considerable ingenuity is employed by offenders inside and outside prison to ensure that supplies to those in custody are maintained.  Prison management's strategies must pass tests <Col N="269" /> of practicality and acceptability in human rights terms.</P>
    <P>There are a number of proposals already being put in place in the prisons which will begin to tackle some of these problems &mdash; proposals that could have been put in place last year or the year before by the former Government but will be put in place by this Government. I am confident that a number of these facilities will be in place before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I accept that our criminal procedures need to be as efficient as possible.  I assure the House that I will introduce all the necessary legislative reforms. Work on a number of important measures is at an advanced stage.  It is only right that I should mention that there is already a huge body of criminal law which is used successfully day in and day out to bring perpetrators of crime to justice.  The measure of what is happening in the criminal justice system is not the production of Bills but how effective those Bills are.</P>

It is fine for Deputy O'Donoghue to say his Bill is constitutional but it is my responsibility <Col N="270" /> as Minister for Justice to ensure any legislation passed in this House is valid.

      <P>The House will appreciate it is not open to the Government to throw together legislative bits and pieces, confer a grandiose title on them, and pretend what is at issue is worthwhile reform of the law.  The number of Bills introduced is not a measure of legislative effectiveness.  We are not doing mathematical calculations when introducing Bills.  We wish to introduce effective and worthwhile legislation.</P>
      <P>Work is at an advanced stage in my Department on a series of comprehensive measures.  The overriding concern will be to ensure progress and that action consistent with the aim of the protection of the community is taken by my Department.  I can assure the House the Government will take whatever steps are needed to achieve that purpose.</P>
      <P>To return to Castlerea, from what I have said the House will have a better understanding of the valid considerations which prompted the need to defer the prison project.  I hope the House and the people in Castlerea who are concerned about the decision will recognise in the establishment of the interdepartmental committee a real determination to come up with measures.  I would be happy to come here at any time, as I have done since I became Minister.  Deputy O'Donoghue and his colleagues do not frighten me with their hyperbole and fancy language.</P>

      <P>The Minister rightly used the word &ldquo;deferred&rdquo; when speaking about this project.  I feel great empathy with the people of Castlerea.  I understand the frustration they feel and I know how they had placed their hopes in this project.  In the past few months I have visited many towns in the west like Castlerea which are in need of investment, towns which have lost population through emigration.  I have also seen the great spirit and energy of the people of the region.</P>

      <P>It is extremely regrettable for the people of Castlerea that this development has been postponed.  The provision of a prison service in a town <Col N="274" /> like Castlerea would obviously have a huge impact on the economic fibre of the region but the provision of public services in any area is only one aspect of development.  Individuals, private companies and voluntary organisations have achieved a great deal of progress in the west already and will continue to do so in the future.</P>
      <P>I have seen many examples of this creativity and initiative as Minister of State with responsibility for western development and rural renewal.  I have seen tremendous signs of hope for the west.  I have seen at first hand the vision of the people of Foxford, County Mayo, which has resulted in tremendous development for the area.  Only last week I opened a bakery in Ardara, County Donegal &mdash; after the change of Government Deputy Gallagher was not available.  That bakery exports bread daily to the UK.</P>

As well as this, the number of tourists visiting the west is set to increase dramatically.  Overall the population of the country will be surpassed by the number of visitors this year.</P>
      <P>We have seen the expansion of numerous industries in the west, such as Fruit of the Loom.  In recent days 217 new jobs were announced for the west so the position is not all gloomy.  The people of the west are determined to prosper and through various voluntary organisations and Government agencies they are empowering themselves with the confidence and skills to plan for a better future.</P>

Of the 17,076 such jobs located in the west, only 668 were in Roscommon &mdash; that is 4 per cent.  In other words, Deputy Doherty should look into his heart.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, she will not upset me.  Unfortunately, however, we have not seen that toughness either at the Cabinet table or in relation to criminal justice.  We need to see some toughness from the Minister and her Department. <Col N="276" /> She may have risen to power by being tough but we certainly have not seen it since she has come to power.</P>
      <P>Crime is now an integral part of modern Irish life and, quite simply, there are now more people who are prepared to commit crimes.  Drugs pose a major threat to the fabric of our society and represent a major challenge for us all. They are now widely available in every part of Ireland and on every street in Dublin.  Young lives are being destroyed.  Drug crazed youths are robbing our shops, garages and factories and burgling our houses.  Some shops in my constituency have been broken into three or four times this year.  We have to act now as a society &mdash; the time for rhetoric is over, as other speakers have said.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks I attended a number of public meetings on crime in my constituency and, believe it or not, the public is very well briefed on the issues involved and why criminal justice is failing and is not prepared to tolerate it any longer.  That is why the decision to cancel the prison at Castlerea and the women's prison in Dublin is unbelievable. The public cannot comprehend the priorities of a Government which would cancel 210 much needed places of detention at this time.</P>
      <P>The public knows we have a revolving door system which is the laughing stock of the criminal world because there are no places of detention for many criminals. A criminal will be back out on the street the day he is convicted of a crime because there is no place to put him. The Government's priorities are wrong. I appeal to the Minister to fight her corner on this issue in Cabinet because she would have support from the public if she did so.  Unfortunately, justice does not appear to be getting a fair play from this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy for the Minister, believe it or not.  The public knows that many crimes are being committed by people out on bail. The Minister rightly called for a constitutional amendment to the bail laws &mdash;<Col N="277" /> and our spokesperson, Deputy O'Donoghue, brought forward a Private Members' Bill on the issue &mdash; but, unfortunately, the Labour Party and Democratic Left blocked her.  Fine Gael, the party of law and order, should tell the two parties with which it is in Government that they can no longer block tough measures to deal with criminals because the public will not tolerate it.  Everybody in this House tonight would agree with me on that. Tough measures are needed and I question whether Labour and Democratic Left have the ability to implement what the public is crying out for.</P>
    <P>On 11 May 1995 the Minister informed the Dáil that she would introduce a comprehensive set of proposals to deal with the drugs problem.  That is extremely urgent and I hope she brings it forward as quickly as possible.  Our spokesperson, Deputy O'Donoghue, has brought forward very radical and comprehensive proposals to deal with the drugs problem.  We need a special detention unit for drug addicts so that the process of detoxification can be carried out, and measures to stop the circulation of drugs in prisons.  Tough laws for drug pushers and suppliers and the detoxification of addicts must be central to any scheme dealing with the problems of drug addiction in our communities.</P>
    <P>More gardaí are needed on the beat. The public cannot understand why the Department of Justice is reluctant to put gardaí on the beat.  Of course, resources must be put into new technology and we have much more sophisticated ways of dealing with crime.  However, I am convinced that the way to deal with crime at the very heart of our community is to put gardaí on the beat.  I am flabbergasted that the peace process has only resulted in 16 new gardaí being brought to the Dublin area.  What is happening to the resources?</P>

      <P>The emphasis must be put on the victim who is left out of the current debate.  Civil liberties groups and so on who discuss the criminal justice system forget about the victim. More support is needed for victim support groups because it is victims who are suffering in the current situation.</P>
      <P>The public knows that current laws are inadequate.  We need the Juvenile Justice Bill, with the possibility that parents would take responsibility for some of the actions of their children, put on the Statute Book as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Government's amendment is totally inadequate and unbelievable.  I am aghast at the possibility that the Government could put forward such an amendment which is basically waffle and refers to interdepartmental committees, study groups and reviews.  I am long enough in politics &mdash; which is not that long compared to some Members &mdash; to know that mentioning the word committee&rdquo; is a way of getting somebody of the hook.  If something is sent to a committee for a few months, it is hoped the issue will die down.  It is very hard to resurrect the report of a committee. Many committees have reported over the years.  Their reports often gather dust and it is difficult to get the right political climate in which to resurrect them.  We have heard waffle and the Minister has kicked to touch tonight with references to setting up committees, reviews and interdepartmental committees.</P>
      <P>The Castlerea prison has been cancelled, which nobody can understand.</P>

      <P>The people know that prisons are totally inadequate.  We <Col N="279" /> needed a positive decision.  Just when crime was beginning to snowball on the streets of Dublin and the public was demanding action on the crisis, the decision was made to cancel the Castlerea prison.  Everybody knows that more places of detention are required.  I wonder whether this interdepartmental committee will ever see the light of day.</P>
      <P>As I said, the legislation is inadequate. Our spokesperson on justice has brought forward several Private Members' Bills.  We have been promised a Juvenile Justice Bill, a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, a Fraud Offences Bill, a Criminal Law Insanity Bill, a Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Bill, a Criminal Law Bill to provide power of arrest without warrant for serious offences and a Bail Bill.  Unfortunately, it seems that the Bail Bill was cancelled a few weeks after it was promised.  When will we see all this legislation?</P>
      <P>When our spokesperson Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was Minister for Justice she brought forward a number of significant Bills to deal with the crime issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The most significant one was the Public Order Bill.  She was attacked by the Labour Party and Democratic Left who did not want tough action to deal with gangs of youth threatening ordinary, civilised people, having cider parties on greens and being generally disruptive.  The Public Order Bill was introduced to give the Garda more powers to deal with that.  The public knew the Garda did not have enough power to break up a cider party.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn introduced it and the Garda welcomed it.  It was not supported in the main by Labour and Democratic Left who are the Minister's partners in Government.  Time and again they have refused to support tough measures to combat crime.  We have been told the Fine Gael is the <Col N="280" /> party of law and order, but unfortunately, that is a myth.  Fianna Fáil is the only party prepared to take tough measures.  As the next general election will be fought on the issue of crime, the Minister's Cabinet colleagues should give her more support, otherwise they will find themselves in difficulty.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Local Government (Delimination of Water Supply Disconnection Powers) Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.  Some years after the derating of domestic and certain other premises, local authorities were given wider powers in the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Act, 1983, to charge for services they provide.  Members of the House who have served in local government will recognise and accept that this enhancement of local discretion and increased financial independence is important in the local government context. While the issue of service charges has been a difficult and contentious one in some areas, they are an important source of income for local authorities so much so that in the region of £50 million was collected in domestic charges in 1994, when Deputy Smith was charged with responsibility for the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy agreement A Government of Renewal contains three commitments which have a direct bearing on service charges: first, it gave an undertaking to commission a professional study of local government funding &ldquo;to see whether a fair, equitable and reasonable system of funding can be introduced with a view to publishing a White Paper on the subject&rdquo;. I am pleased to inform the House that earlier today I announced the appointment of a consultant to carry out this important study.  All relevant aspects of local government funding, <Col N="281" /> including service charges, will be considered as part of this study.</P>
    <P>Second, in recognising that service charges are seen by some as a form of double taxation, the Government gave a commitment to introduce a tax allowance at the standard rate, up to a maximum of £150, for those who can show that they paid their service charges on time.  The statutory provision is in section 7 of this year's Finance Act.</P>
    <P>Third, we undertook to amend the Sanitary Services Act, 1962, to delimit the power of local authorities to disconnect domestic water supplies for nonpayment of water charges.  This Bill will give effect to this commitment.</P>
    <P>It is at the discretion of each local authority to decide whether to levy charges and to set the level of such charges.  It is also a matter for each local authority to arrange for their collection. Where a person defaults on payment of a water charge, two options are open to local authorities under the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962; they can either pursue the outstanding charge as a simple contract debt through the courts or they can discontinue the supply of water if a charge is not paid within two months after it becomes due.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities have succeeded in recovering outstanding charges through the courts; others have found that this can often be a long drawn out, unsatisfactory and costly process.  In many circumstances, local authorities consider disconnection to be a more realistic and effective option. There is no doubt that disconnection is a severe measure and one not implemented lightly by local authorities. It is, and should remain, a weapon of last resort, to be used only after an exhaustive process of pursuing outstanding debts and then only where there is ability to pay.  In most cases, the first steps towards a disconnection are enough to prompt payment and it is only in a relatively limited number of cases that local authorities have had to disconnect supplies.</P>
    <P>The legislation conferring on local <Col N="282" /> authorities the power to disconnect for non-payment of water charges did not establish any procedural arrangements or controls in respect of the implementation of that power.  Legally, therefore, local authorities have more or less a free hand as to how they use their disconnection powers.  Disconnection policy, including procedures, may vary from local authority to local authority.</P>
    <P>The introduction of this Bill should not, however, be interpreted as suggesting that local authorities have acted improperly or irresponsibly in the use of their disconnection power.  Disconnection has not been used as a first line of attack or in an uncaring fashion by local authorities around the country. There is evidence that local authorities generally have adopted a responsible and sympathetic attitude in this matter.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, because of the severity of the sanction of discontinuing a water supply and the implications it can have, particularly for the very young and the elderly, there is a need to establish a clearly defined series of steps which must be followed prior to disconnection. That is why the Government gave a commitment to amend the Sanitary Services Act to delimit the powers of local authorities to disconnect domestic water supply and that is what this Bill will do.</P>
    <P>Before looking briefly at the main provisions of the Bill, I should underline the fact that it relates only to domestic water supplies as opposed to water supplied for commercial, industrial, agricultural or other non-domestic purposes.</P>
    <P>Section 3 and the Schedule contain the main limitations on the powers of local authorities &mdash; or more properly under sanitary services legislation, sanitary authorities &mdash; to discontinue domestic water supplies.  Section 3 (2) provides that before an authority may disconnect a supply of water for nonpayment of water charges, it must first obtain an order from the District Court. Such an order may only be granted by the court where the following clearly defined procedures which are set out in the Schedule have been followed: first, a demand must have issued in writing; <Col N="283" /> second, at least two reminders of outstanding charges must have issued; third, at least two warnings must have been given, either separately or in conjunction with the reminders, about possible court action leading to disconnection and, finally, the sanitary authority must have had delivered to the consumer, or sent by registered post, final notice to advise that it is intended to make an application to the court for an order authorising disconnection.</P>
    <P>By circular letter of 4 April this year, I asked local authorities to implement these procedures pending the introduction of this Bill.  In fairness to local authorities procedures more or less along these lines were already being followed in most cases.  For the future, the Bill will establish standardised statute-backed procedures ensuring that people will be in no doubt as to where they stand in this matter.</P>
    <P>An exception to the requirement to follow the specified procedures is provided in section 3 where a person defaults on an instalment order &mdash; that is a specified schedule of payments&mdash; which had been previously made by the courts where a local authority used the option of pursuing a charge as a contract debt through the courts.</P>
    <P>I want to ensure that the power of disconnection remains to deal with cases where people who can afford to pay their water charges refuse to do so.  It is important in terms of equity that everybody who is liable to pay, and who can afford to pay, does so.  In this way the burden of paying for the provision and maintenance of much needed and demanded local services is fairly shared. If this does not happen, then complaint citizens will rightly question why they should continue to pay.  The Bill does not offer any succour or consolation to the so-called conscientious objector who, by propounding some self-serving logic, leaves it to the rest of the community to foot the bill on his behalf, while at the same time enjoying, and more often than not vociferously <Col N="284" /> demanding, all the benefits of local services and facilities that other people's money can buy.  The power to disconnect remains and indeed will now have the backing of a court order.  Where a court grants an order authorising discontinuance the consumer will, unless there are special and substantial reasons to warrant otherwise, be liable under section 4 for the costs and expenses of a local authority in its application for a water discontinuance order.  Furthermore, where a supply is disconnected, the consumer will be responsible for meeting the costs, not only of having the supply reconnected, but also the costs incurred by a local authority in disconnecting the supply in the first place.</P>
    <P>While the Bill does not make life easy for those with ample resources who refuse to pay.  I am anxious that it should provide added protection for the less well-off, those who cannot afford to pay.  Section 3 (3) gives that protection. Under this section, the court may not grant an order authorising disconnection in any case where the default in payment arose as a result of hardship. To ensure that disconnection will not put vulnerable people in a house at risk &mdash; for example where an individual's medical condition would be seriously threatened &mdash; the court is required under section 3 (4) to take account of the personal and household circumstances of the consumer when considering an application from a local authority to disconnect.  As further protection for those who cannot afford to pay, section 3 (5) prohibits disconnection in any case where a local authority has granted a water charges waiver on the grounds of hardship.  All in all, this is a well-balanced Bill.  It is tough on those who will not pay and sympathetic to the needs of those whose cannot pay.  That is as it should be in a caring society.  The Bill strikes the right balance between, on the one hand, the necessarily strong powers of a local authority to ensure payment of water charges due to it, and an acceptable level of protection for individual consumers on the other.  It constitutes a significant advance towards <Col N="285" /> greater transparency on an issue of public importance.  I look forward to a constructive debate on the Bill and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister for the Environment and his officials to the House although they are the only complimentary remarks I will make.  I am deputising for Deputy Dempsey who is unavoidably absent.  I am more than surprised at the Minister's remarks.  He said he had established another commission to study local authority funding with a view to introducing a White Paper.  That is a compromise, a cop-out and a cover up.  It is a compromise to Democratic Left because while the Minister is introducing a Bill to delimit the powers of local authorities to disconnect water supplies the olive branch is being held out to Democratic Left that some consultancy in the future will find a way to ignore the realities.  I am surprised the Minister, with his tenacious capacity and obvious energy, succumbed to that pressure.</P>
      <P>It is a cop-out because it is a delay. On foot of this study no fundamental changes will be introduced by the Government before the next general election.  It is a neat cover up because it enables the Minister in introducing this Bill to put emphasis on the possibility of another way of funding local authorities. He is aware, as I am, that there are enough reports on local authority funding to fill every pothole from Wexford to Tipperary.  The Bill has the hallmarks of a tension packed Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said before, and I repeat, that the Minister is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  Between 500,000 and 600,000 homes pay service charges and as few as 900 homesteads, a fraction of 1 per cent, had their supplies cut off by local authorities.  Therefore, there is great compliance by the public in facing up to the reality of paying for the services they enjoy.  To devote so much time and energy to finding a way to alleviate the problems of Democratic Left leaves me wondering.  There are <Col N="286" /> people in difficult financial circumstances, and we introduce waiver schemes and encourage local authorities to be as generous as possible in those cases.  I was glad to hear the Minister say:</P>
    <P>Disconnection has not been used as a first line of attack, or in an uncaring fashion by local authorities around the country.  Indeed there is evidence that local authorities generally have adopted a responsible and sympathetic attitude in this matter.</P>
    <P>That has been the expression of everyone. There should be no pressure on people who cannot afford to pay.</P>
    <P>P.J. Wodehouse once said &mdash; I do not remember the exact words &mdash; that the surest and safest way to get rid of dandruff is the guillotine.  That is exactly the kind of policy being pursued in this case. As a former colleague of the Minister for the Environment I am shocked and surprised that he would clog up an already cluttered court with this nonsense, giving the notion that there is another way, there will be manna from heaven if we wait a little while.</P>
    <P>This Bill has the hallmarks of a team that is already a shambles.  Democratic Left is not walking on the tail of Fine Gael and Labour, or maybe it is and the dog is not even barking.  This measure will be a bureaucratic nightmare for local authorities who are already stretched for cash and are now being tightened into a lúbán, strangling their already overstretched systems.  It will clearly slow up the process of collecting service charges.  It is pandering to a small minority of non-compliant people who do not want to pay.  It will further underpin a dependency culture which, in a make-believe world, ferments the notion that someone else should or will pay.  This is a serious retrograde step.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that local authorities are running amok.  People, in some cases, those with substantial incomes, have waited months for registered letters or a call from a local authority official because a few puny cowardly politicians suggested that service <Col N="287" /> charges could be abolished.  My estimation of the Minister may have gone down but he has time to recover.  At least he stood up to Democratic Left and did not abolish service charges.  He went halfway up the ladder, but there is time for him to recover.</P>
    <P>To get £100 from a person who has a piped water supply in their home the local authority will have to write to him six times.  Much time will be spent by officials dictating letters and money will be spent on postage.  To get that £100 we will have to pay £200 in fees for legal services in the courts under this system. It is an unnecessary additional administrative burden involving substantial legal costs.</P>
    <P>In national terms, local authorities raise more than £50 million through service charges.  The first thing that will happen as a result of the enactment of this legislation is that people will delay paying service charges on two fronts. The appointment of a new consultancy group to examine service charges and property tax provides hope that there will be a change and they can avoid the charges.  By the time the local authorities have an opportunity to work out their system this year it will be October or November before they will be fully satisfied that a person will not pay and they will have to follow the procedure and go to court.  This year will pass and perhaps as much as £15 million, owned to the local authorities already strapped of cash for services provided will not be paid.</P>
    <P>Since 1983 this debate has been characterised by a lack of courage and blatant dishonesty.  Everyone knows that local authorities are strapped for cash, that amends must be made to strengthen their resource base and that the provision of water and sewerage facilities is enormously expensive.  Yet a political lifeline has been handed out by unsuspecting people to make-believe politicians propagating the view that those charges will be abolished and some kind of manna will be found.  It is <Col N="288" /> time to grow up.  We are now in Opposition, but I was in Government and I know the public are fully aware of the realities.  They know they enjoy good facilities and are happy to pay for them.</P>
    <P>Statistics reveal that almost 65 per cent of the public are complaint.  People following this debate tonight who pay service charges will ask themselves if they are fools.  People, with resources who do not pay their service charges can receive six letters, a visit from a local authority official and in the process hold up and strangle the local authority system.</P>
    <P>Regarding disconnection, I do not believe the Minister believes in the principle enunciated or was advised by his Department officials to pursue that line. He was caught in a web, trying to sort out his colleagues in Government.  Even if he has an elastic conscience which up until now I did not believe he had, and believes in that principle, he has no course open to him other than to tell the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications that it should be a consistent Government policy that there should not be disconnections.  What will the Minister say to Telecom Éireann?  I forecast he will not indicate that it is the policy.  What will he say to the ESB? Everybody knows they use that system.</P>
    <P>In an ideal world we should not have such systems, everybody should pay. Other parties in the House talk about such a Utopian world, but members of Fianna Fáil are realists.  We know there will be ups and downs along the way. Disconnection is not a problem as the threat of disconnection works.  It is an administratively simple, quick and effective measure but I forecast that the Minister will not contact the ESB.  The present system of disconnection will continue to be operated by Telecom Éireann and the ESB so where is the principle?  The Minister for the Environment in previous ministries strongly advocated principle, but has a low profile on this.  He cannot be consistent here.  I was glad to note in some of the gobbledegook he gave us this evening he at least did not defend the principle <Col N="289" /> in this legislation.  He left himself a semblance of decency.</P>
    <P>People living in rural areas in Cork, Wexford or Tipperary who wish to gain access to a water supply must employ a person efficient in well boring, buy an electric pump and pay between £1,000 and £3,000 capital costs for those services. People who do not have access to a public sewage treatment facility must dig a septic tank or use a pure flow Bord na Móna system which will cost between £1,000 and £3,000.  People in rural areas without public schemes must find between £3,000 and £6,000 to get supplies and then they will be fully responsible for maintenance costs.  The Minister has not said anything on their behalf tonight. They must pay without any State aid. They do not understand Democratic Left's argument on this issue.</P>
    <P>I was pleased that grants for group water schemes were increased and I was successful in securing funds from Europe to develop those schemes. People lucky enough to have access to a group water scheme must set up a committee, get a group together, gather funds, draw up a contract and fund and manage the scheme with the help of grants.  People around the country would not get access to such a water supply for less than £400 and must also bear the cost of annual maintenance.</P>
    <P>Last year I received a letter from an old age pensioner in County Sligo.  I was successful in securing £500,000 for the Castleconnell group water scheme which had been on the books for many years.  When that woman received a letter of approval she told me she went to the credit union and borrowed £400 to pay her contribution to the scheme.  She was happy and proud to do that.  As a Minister, I would have dearly wished to have been able to tell her that she could have a free water supply and she would have loved to have heard the Minister say tonight that she would not have to pay a service charge.  That lady suffered hardship but she showed some spunk. She stood up for her country and was <Col N="290" /> not prepared to have a dependency culture for everything.  It is often worth paying money for something one wants. That woman does not understand Democratic Left's approach tonight or why the Minister is giving in to pressure.</P>
    <P>A third group, the majority, have access to public supplies.  I recall from discussions in my former Department some years ago that it was estimated that the capital cost of providing water and sewerage facilities to various towns is in the order of £3 billion.  Private individuals in rural areas are required to find all the funds with the exception of the grant.  The same principle applies to the group water scheme, but under a public scheme the public are not asked to put money up front.  I do not want to hear the argument about double taxation. It does not stand up.  Even though taxpayer's money is used to fund those schemes, they are 50 per cent EU funded.  The majority of people in towns and villages pay their service charges.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is as ashamed as I of the fact that 2,500 homes do not have a domestic water supply. In the scorching sun we are all enjoying at present they must travel to neighbours or to wells for water to wash their children and for other domestic requirements. What has the Minister to say to those people tonight?  They would be delighted if the local authority provided them with a service and asked them to pay part of the maintenance in an annual charge.  People are not asked to pay the capital cost, they are asked to pay only 33 per cent of the maintenance charge to cover the caretakers, maintenance, purification, electricity and so on.</P>
    <P>I am sure many people will wonder what is in this Bill for them.  After ten or 12 years of service charges why must we pander to the few?  Those who cannot afford to pay must be catered for. The Minister could have improved the administrative system without hauling people into court, imposing such an expense on local authorities and engendering the notion in the minds of the public that he proposes a soft solution. <Col N="291" /> We are moving towards an administrative logjam which will involve writing letters, going to court, paying solicitors and so on when all we need do is encourage the public to face up to the reality.</P>
    <P>Providing such services is inordinately expensive and I am sure the Minister wishes he could afford to sanction more schemes for those in need, but he does not have the resources.  Everyone who can afford to pay but refuses is putting back the day when we will be in a position to provide more supplies.  We should not give succour to them.  We should have the courage to tell the public the true position in regard to national and local finances.  Unfortunately, instead of the usual energetic and encouraging speech from the Minister, he delivered a bland, cold, careful and disinterested one.  He is introducing legislation he does not support and which the majority of people believe is absurd and nonsensical.</P>
    <P>Political parties in recent times have pretended there is an easier way, but for the majority that is not the case.  I outlined in detail the conditions in which people live in rural areas, what they must do to get involved in group water schemes and the percentage of people who pay.  We must consider them because it is they who make such schemes possible, not those who can afford to pay and put the Minister or local authorities up against the wall before they do so.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister seriously to consider withdrawing the Bill and showing courage.  Of course he will have trouble with Democratic Left but he should recognise that 95 per cent of the public are sensible and are as talented, if not more so, than any Member of the House.  They know that Democratic Left has less than 5 per cent support and may wish to pander to the public to get votes.  That is not the Ireland of which I want to be a part.  Most people work hard, pay taxes and are willing to pay for a good service.  They pay Telecom Éireann and ESB charges and they are prepared to pay for services.  The more <Col N="292" /> they know about the reality the more we will eliminate cynicism about politicians. We should not pretend there is an easy way out.  The Minister should have resisted the temptation to set up a study group.  The Bill should be seen for what it is.  He took a further step to hold on to Democratic Left.  The tail is wagging the dog, but the dog is not barking. However, Members on this side will bark and vote against the Bill.  The people who pay their way and meet their obligations will wonder why we are pandering to those who do not want to do likewise.</P>

      <P>In an attempt to be generous at the outset, I endorse the welcome the previous speaker gave to the Minister and his officials.  However, like Deputy Smith, even on a fine summer's evening I cannot say anything good about this Bill.  I believe it was the Greeks who once said that those whom the Gods wish to destroy, they first make mad.  There is an inherent madness at the heart of this Bill.

      <P>Pope or no Pope, I do not envisage any citizen or taxpayer benefiting from the provisions of this Bill.  By what yardstick does one measure the benefit of a Bill?  Will any taxpayer or citizen benefit from this Bill?  The answer must be no.  A Government with its priorities in order would seek to put in place a proper system of local goverment financing.  We all know that every local authority is starved of cash and can scarcely deliver even a minimum standard of basic services.  One would expect the Government, with its large <Col N="293" /> majority, to introduce a Bill that would provide a proper system of financing for local authorities, but that is not the case. Instead we have a miserable Bill the provisions of which do not confer advantage on any category of householder or citizen.  It represents a major vote of no confidence in the judgment and professionalism of every city and county manager, that adds another layer of complex, unnecessary bureaucracy to the administration of day to day local authority affairs, which is nothing more in origin, than an attempt to bring Democratic Left on side when this Government was being cobbled together a few months ago.  In the interim, God knows, there has been little evidence that Democratic Left wants to be offside on any issue that has arisen since the formation of this Government.  In my part of the country they are now being called Democratic Left, right and centre.  I see no evidence that Democratic Left would secede from this Government if this Bill was not introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should have steeled his nerve on this issue, his track record strongly indicates he is capable of better.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the provisions of this Bill will certainly clog up our courts with business that properly belongs elsewhere.  City and county managers should have the discretion and judgment to proceed on matters of this nature.  All local authorities have a formalised system of waivers in place whereby families and householders who can demonstrate they are not in a position to pay are given a full or partial waiver in accordance with their circumstances. It has been my experience that this has been administered fairly, honestly and conscientiously by local authorities so that those who can demonstrate their inability to pay are not required to do so.  That is beyond question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="294" /> Clearly there is another category of person in a position and liable to pay but who, for one reason or another, chooses not to.  Local authorities should be given the right and discretion to invoke whatever small measures are open to them to endeavour to recover moneys due from such persons.  I can think of no good reason for diluting their discretion or undergoing this long-winded, slow, costly process to recover moneys owned.  Is it not nonsense that in future we shall ask local authorities to incur costs of £200 and £300 to recover sums of £100 or less?  How can the Minister justify to a thinking public that local authorities, on the basis of no logic I can perceive, should be asked to incur that kind of expense to recover moneys owed to them?  That is the measure of the nonsense at the heart of this Bill.</P>
    <P>A number of local authorities already experience sufficient difficulty collecting a percentage of the money due for service charges, as the system has been cynically abused and exploited by politicians of different parties, at different times, for electoral advantage.  The game is now up, the public are not fools and know that each party in this Government, Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left, wants to retain the system of service charges.  That is clearly demonstrated in the text of this Bill and in what the Minister said this evening. That is fine by me, and I have no doubt the general public will accept that because more and more people are beginning to realise there is no such thing as a free lunch, that certain services are worth paying for.</P>
    <P>Instead of the Government saying honestly and openly that it favours the retention of service charges and that the administration of the system will remain intact until such time as it devises or puts another system in place &mdash; if that is what this Government plans to do, although I suspect it will not &mdash; so much time will be spent drawing up reports, studying them and delaying them that the next general election will have come and gone before it will have the courage <Col N="295" /> or vision to put in place a proper system for financing local authorities.</P>
    <P>What does any citizen stand to gain by the addition of this costly layer of bureaucracy on local authorities?  No other authority, private or public, has been treated with the same contempt by successive Governments as local authorities. On the one hand, they are required to deliver certain nominated services to the general public while, on the other, we render it increasingly difficult for them to collect the requisite funds to enable them to deliver those same services.</P>
    <P>If this principle is to be put in place <i>vis-a</i>±-<i>vis</i> local authorities, will the Government, in all logic and consistency, put the same principle at the disposal of people who do not want to pay their telephone and electricity bills or television licences?  Why can the same principle not be placed at the disposal of such people, in the case of those services, when the relevant authorities will have to invoke the same costly procedures to enable them to recover money in respect of telephone and electricity bills or television licences?  Why does this principle have to be applied to local authorities only?  Why must city and county managers be treated with such contempt?  I do not understand it.</P>
    <P>Considering the present position with regard to law and order &mdash; with a huge backlog of cases awaiting hearing in the district and other courts and as this delay in bringing suspects to a hearing and justice is one of the factors that has undermined the authority of the Garda and our overall criminal justice system &mdash; it is unbelievable that the Minister would attempt to place this additional burden on our courts, that cases of this nature would be heard at a time when criminals roam our streets, when drug barons and the godfathers of crime are out on bail for months.  It is unbelievable that such a simple matter as the administration of our service charges system should be brought within the remit of our courts in this manner.  It <Col N="296" /> shows an extraordinary lack of understanding of the present pressures on our courts, of how our judicial system is breaking down, of how criminals are winning the day, roaming our streets, unable to have their cases heard because of the backlogs of cases to be heard.  In those circumstances I fail to understand how the Minister would place this additional, unnecessary burden on our courts.</P>
    <P>The Minister would have done the Government great credit if he had abandoned all the promises written into the programme for Government and come into the House with proposals for a proper system of financing local government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I know of local authorities who experience great difficulties in trying to agree an estimate and strike a rate.  Each year, when the income from service charges decreases, there is an inevitable increase in the commercial rate.  Commercial ratepayers are paying far more than they can afford and what they ought to be expected to pay.  The time will come when the commercial rate will be so high that businesses will be forced to close and their workers will have to join the dole queues.  They will be unable to pay the ever escalating level of commercial rates.</P>
      <P>We must put in place a system which will allow the burden to be evenly distributed between the householder and the commercial ratepayer.  That would provide for some element of justice but whenever less income is obtained from the domestic sector, more is demanded from the commercial sector.  I believe we have gone too far in this regard and, in the case of my own city, a further increase in rates will result in the closure of businesses and subsequent job losses.</P>
      <P>The Minister must be courageous. There is little more information that can be gathered by any group of consultants. There comes a time when no new information can be found.  We have arrived at that time in respect of the financing of local authorities.  It is an area that has been the subject of a myriad of reports but there are only certain ways by which finance can be found to enable local authorities provide basic and essential public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My party believes in the principle of local taxation.  Moneys sourced locally are better spent locally and better value for money can be obtained by spending money that way.  We also believe, <Col N="298" /> however, that the talk of double taxation is not empty talk.  Householders who pay locally for services delivered locally are entitled to an equivalent raduction in the tax they pay into central Exchequer.  That is the only fair way of financing local services.  There is no doubt that local services are better financed if the moneys are raised locally and my party is more than willing to support the Minister in this regard and will not play cynical political games.</P>
    <P>I was born into a family where it was normal practice to pay rates.  That is the way we operated and that is the culture in which we were raised.  That is the case with the majority of people because they know there is no such thing as a free lunch.  If they feel they are getting value for money, they are prepared to pay for a service.  At present, they do not believe they are getting value for money.  They believe that street sweeping is far from adequate, there is inadequate footpath and street maintenance, the public lighting system is deficient, roads are filled with potholes, there is a lack of development in the provision of libraries, parks and play areas for children. They are the type of facilities that make life better for people in their own communities.</P>
    <P>These inadequacies have been a factor since rates on domestic dwellings were removed.  There has been a consistent deterioration in the quality and nature of local services.  Such a situation cannot continue because local services make the greater contribution to the quality of people's lives.  The quality of public lighting in our streets gives us a sense of security.  In areas where public lighting is poor, vandalism and petty crime thrives.  If footpaths are in a state of good repair, people feel they can walk in comfort.  Shoppers want to spend their money in areas where the streets are regularly cleaned.  They also want to raise their children in communities that have well stocked libraries and good public parks.  People are prepared to pay locally for such services. However, they do not want double taxation. Most people are happy to pay <Col N="299" /> local service charges provided there is an equivalent reduction in their taxation to central Exchequer.</P>
    <P>This Bill reflects badly on the Government's priorities in relation to local authorities.  It creates an additional burden for city managers and it comes at a time when we are asking local authorities to take on a whole range of extra duties and responsibilities.  The three year arts plan of the arts council envisages local authorities being given a whole new range of functions and responsibilities.  The Casual Trading Bill and other new legislation put an extra workload on local authorities, and they are not being given the extra funding and personnel.  How then can they be expected to carry out all these additional functions?  It defies all logic to put this extra hardship on city managers who want to recover moneys due to local authorities to spend on providing public services.  My party certainly cannot support this Bill and will vote against it.</P>

I am much better when we are at full strength.  However, I feel Members missed the most entertaining contribution, the Deputy's own. Unfortunately I cannot hear Deputy Noel Ahern who continues to mutter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to two contributions tonight.  I understand why Deputy Smith made his.  The contribution which puzzled me most was Deputy Quill's. She spoke about compliant taxpayers who will now be jailed, have their water <Col N="300" /> cut off etc.  This debate is about the compliant taxpayers who need a break and who need it locally as opposed to nationally, where we would normally look.  I will begin by reading a letter to a man whose name I will not mention because I understand there are certain rules and regulations regarding that, and he probably would not wish to be associated with politicians anyway.  It is as follows:</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to meet with the delegation from ACRA and I believe our mutual interest in the financing of local authorities will help towards the introduction of a more equitable system which will find greater acceptance in the community generally.</P>
    <P>I promised to reply to you setting out the Fianna Fáil position in three areas raised by you.  The following is the position in each case:</P>
    <P>1.  Fianna Fáil are totally opposed to the new system of Local charges and, on return to office, will abolish these charges and repeal the legislation under which they are imposed, namely the Local Government Financial Provisions No. 2. Act of 1983.</P>
    <P>In its place, we will introduce new legislation which will end the present unsatisfactory position and put local finances on a sound basis.</P>
    <P>This legislation will provide that Local Authorities will receive a guaranteed statutory contribution each year from the Central Exchequer.  This Exchequer contribution will be sufficient to provide for a satisfactory level of necessary services.</P>
    <P>The new legislation will eliminate the present uncertainty whereby Local Authorities cannot anticipate what the grant from the Central Exchequer each year will be and which has compelled County Managers to impose a new and unacceptable level of service charges against the wishes of the <Col N="301" /> great majority of the local community.</P>
    <P>The legislation which will provide for the new statutory grant from the Central Exchequer will not contain any new power to enable elected members to introduce new charges.</P>
    <P>2.  On the question of an amnesty for those who have not paid water or service charges Fianna Fáil believe this is a matter that must be dealt with by the local authority who levied the charges.  Under Coalition legislation the manager has the power to waive the charges.</P>
    <P>3.  Fianna Fáil recognise that there are many anomalies in the financing of different local authorities under pre 1983 legislation and in government will undertake a review of this situation.</P>
    <P>I trust this clarifies for you the Fianna Fáil position regarding the new water and service charges imposed under this Coalition Government legislation. The total collected last year was, as you know, £10.4 million.</P>
    <P>Thanking you for your interest in Fianna Fáil Party Policy.</P>
    <P>Before I read the signature, let me say the person involved lost interest in Fianna Fáil very soon after that.  It is signed by Deputy Robert Molloy.</P>

This led to an outcry and such action was never again taken.  Service charges are no more and no less than a form of double taxation.  Water charges cannot be equated to telephone <Col N="302" /> charges or other services.  Water is necessary for life, a telephone is not.</P>

Whether water will be turned off depends on where one lives and the figures show that.  There is not a need for this draconian measure.  If we have such a high collection rate in Cork why is it necessary to turn off water in other areas in order to force people to pay the charges? Either there is something seriously wrong with the system of management or the level of charges.</P>
      <P>Tax relief on service charges is not sufficient; they should be abolished. Deputy Quill stated she was raised in the tradition of paying rates.  I was raised in the proud tradition of paying tax.  I am paying double when I pay local charges.  I will not be happy until we have a fairer system of taxation.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Carlow County Council is no different from other county councils.  It issues demands and reminders and officials call to people and explain the position.  In extreme cases the water supply is disconnected. It occurred four times last year.  If the cases went to court they would have been upheld.  The waiver system should be extended.  The charges are based on the total income of a household and it is a family matter if a teenager does not contribute to the payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was bamboozled by Deputy Quill's contribution.  I did not know what she was for or against.  She wanted clean streets, lighting and the payment of service charges.  She insulted council officials by giving the impression that they would clog up the courts system and delay the hearing of cases against drug barons and so on.  At the end of her speech she supported the Minister <Col N="304" /> and the payment of water charges.  She said commercial rates were too high but that is because we do not have the guts at local level to charge for the services we provide.</P>
    <P>I recently met a person in a pub who was plastered out of his mind.  A quarter of the money he had spent on drink would have paid his water charges.  In the most colourful language imaginable he informed me he would not pay water charges.  He did not see anything wrong with spending a small fortune on drink while expecting water to be provided free of charge.  I asked him if he paid his milk bill.  Milk is an important product but if you do not pay your bill you will not be supplied with it.  I accept the argument about double taxation to a certain extent but what about those who do not live in towns?  They may pay £1,000 to sink a well.  If the pump bursts they must pay for the repair.  Everyone pays taxes but for some strange reason those living in towns expect to have free water.  I accept that we must ensure people on low incomes are exempt from paying water charges.</P>
    <P>Carlow County Council always reacts favourably when I bring cases of genuine hardship to its notice.  Council officials should not be painted as hooligans trying to disrupt the country and clog up the courts.  Deputy Quill spoke about deficits but how are county councils to get money if they do not charge for services?  I was elected to the county council in 1979.  At that time it cost the council £76,000 to supply water and I asked why it did not pay for itself.  Why should people living in the country supply their own water and pay for a sewerage system which may need to be cleaned out twice a year depending on the condition of the soil?</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax break for those who pay the charges.  Those who have a water supply laid on have much to be thankful for.  Many people with a private water supply and a septic tank would willingly pay local service charges for such a service.  Councils cannot provide services unless they charge for them.  We should not hedge the issue in <Col N="305" /> such a way that it seems we are for the payment of charges on the one hand and against them on the other.  Increasing the commercial rate is an easy option.  We are not brave enough to charge for the services we provide.  I welcome the tax break for those who pay water charges and I commend the Minister for bringing in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an inadequate Bill, introduced to give legal effect to a foolish decision to appease Democratic Left.  The Minister is inconsistent as his stance at question time a week or two before this was announced was different from what he is saying now.  I am sure that when he comes to look back on his political career &mdash; we all do this no matter how short or long our careers are &mdash; he would like to think that all his decisions would stand the test of time. He was a good Minister for Health and I am sure he will be able to look back with pride on many of the decisions he made while in that position but I do not think this decision will stand the test of time.</P>
      <P>We all understand why the Bill was introduced.  Democratic Left made this issue its hobby horse over a number of years and the Minister provided them with a way out.  It is politics but not a great decision.</P>
      <P>We should encourage people to stand on their own feet, to be responsible for their decisions and their due debts and not to rely on the Government to bail them out.  There have been disconnections but in a caring, not a ruthless, way.  To suggest that local authorities and county managers have been ruthless and are cutting off poor people is a lie and unfair to local authority officials who, like everyone else, have a job to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is giving the wrong signal to decent people.  We rely on 80 to 90 per cent of people to uphold a certain standard of decency and to keep services going.  In future many people will ask why they should bother paying because they see other people dragging their <Col N="306" /> feet, buying time and hoping the problem will eventually become bogged down in bureaucracy.  We must try to appeal to decent people and signals such as this will be wrongly interpreted.  This is not just about water charges but about all other laws, rules and regulations.</P>
    <P>At an election during the 1980s we encouraged people, regardless of whether they agreed with charges, to pay them because it was the law.  We said we would see if we could abolish the charges in the future.  We did so in Dublin but this may not have happened in other parts of the country.  Charges were imposed in Dublin for three years and it was eventually decided that, because of a technicality, they did not have to be paid for two of them.  Many decent people tackled me about having encouraged them to pay.  It was tough luck for those who had paid as those who did not got away with it.  This deeply upset me and it would have been proper to give a refund to those who paid on time.</P>
    <P>My concern is that this proposal sends the wrong signal and undermines decent citizens.  There are too many pseudointellectual principled objectors.  The Minister suggested he is not playing into their hands but he is.  He said that if this does not happen, compliant citizens will rightly question why they should continue to pay, if the Bill is passed, compliant citizens will do exactly this as it does not offer succour or consolation to the so-called conscientious objector who, by propounding some self-serving logic, leaves it to the rest of the community to foot the bill on his behalf.  The Bill will do everything the Minister says it will not do.  I do not want to undermine people who feel they have a conscientious objection to something. However, some people have objections to almost everything and they seem sincere each time.  They seem to be professional at raising objections.  They might have got away with many things to date but now we are giving them the official seal of approval and condoning their behaviour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="307" /> This Bill will result in another layer of bureaucracy in spite of what the Minister said.  However, he outlined that demands must be issued in writing and that at least two reminders of outstanding charges and two more warnings must be issued.  This is the end of it only from the local authority's point of view. The matter then has to go to court to become bogged down there.  Such cases will become like those involving parking fines.  They will become lost in the system and a question will be tabled here in a few years asking how many of these court orders have been implemented.</P>
    <P>This issue is making an ass of the House.  This Bill is playing to the so called conscientious objectors and making a skit out of the ordinary decent citizen. I totally dissociate myself from it. Local authorities operate a generous waiver system and nobody can say their officials have been unreasonable.  If a case is made to them, they will ensure there is no undue hardship.</P>
    <P>During Private Members' Business, we discussed prison places.  It has been said repeatedly that people should not be put in prison for the non-payment of fines, that jail should be a last resort, that we should find other ways of forcing people to comply with the law.  One example of this is to cut off a water supply. There are people who say they do not mind their water supply being cut off, but other family members put pressure on them to pay the charges.  I am not happy that this power should be watered down.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne referred to the promises made by my party on this issue.  We could all refer to the promises by various parties on it.  Water charges were originally introduced in 1983 by what I presume was a Fine Gael-Labour Government &mdash; I think the then Minister for the Environment was Deputy Dick Spring.  In 1985 my party promised to abolish water charges and they were abolished in Dublin in 1986.  Fianna Fáil is an open party and it was left to individual councillors to decide whether <Col N="308" /> charges should be abolished.  Some councils abolished the charges at that time while others did not.</P>
    <P>I accept the points about double taxation, but we all pay tax in several ways. While the granting of tax relief is not a bad idea, I would not necessarily go along with the motives behind it.  It is important to remember that the hullabaloo about double taxation first began in the mid-1980s when the higher rate of income tax was 55 per cent and the standard rate was 35 per cent.  It is unfair to use the same argument in 1995 when the higher rate of income tax has been reduced to 48 per cent and the standard rate to 27 per cent.  If the issue of water charges had been discussed and were part of the deal for reducing the income tax rates, the social partners would have understood what was happening and would have been happy with it.</P>
    <P>I am speaking from the strange position that my local authority does not collect water charges &mdash; my party abolished them some years ago.  Recently an increasing number of people have told me that they would willingly pay water charges if they could be assured of a water supply when they turn on a tap.  I listened to the rural Deputies referring to people who had to go to a well to get water.  Maybe people in Dublin have been brought up soft, but they expect this basic necessity to be available at all times.  I was part of a delegation which met the Minister to discuss this issue.  I do not want to go into this point in detail but people expect a water supply when they turn on a tap.  This expectation is more deeply enshrined in people living in Dublin who only paid for this service for a few years.  If they had to pay for it all the time they might have a keener sense of what is right and wrong.</P>
    <P>A minority of the members on Dublin City Council support the idea of water charges and the installation of meters so that people pay for what they use.  The shortage of water has not been caused by the recent sunny spell; it is due to the fact that there is not enough water to <Col N="309" /> meet all the requirements.  The severe water shortage in my constituency of Dublin North West, which is supplied by the Leixlip water works, affects domestic consumers and industries.  This area has almost been written off and the IDA does not direct foreign industries to it.  Consultants are examining the problem and I hope it can be solved as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that he had appointed a consultant to look at the funding of local authorities.  He is not the first Minister to do this and it should have been possible to take some of the reports off the shelves in the Department, dust them and look at what they say.  We do not need more reports as the ways of raising funding for local authorities have already been thrashed out at political and consultant level.  What we need is the political will to make decisions.  To be fair to him, if the Minister is opting out of making a decision he is not the first Minister to do so.  If this is what he is doing he will not be proud of it in time.  I have always regarded him as a Minister who grasped the nettle and got on with the job.  The appointment of another consultant, whether or not he is a political friend, is merely prolonging the decision; it is a delaying tactic.</P>

      <P>The Minister wants to bring in a fair, equitable and reasonable system of funding which can be introduced with a view to publishing a White Paper on the subject.  Looking for a consultant's report and a White Paper is long fingering the issue and is putting a final decision way down the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Water charges bring in £50 million and RPT brings in £15 million.  I tabled a parliamentary question which asked if VAT was increased or if a local sales tax of 0.5 of 1 per cent was introduced, would it bring in more money than both those taxes together?  A few years ago we reduced VAT from 23 per cent to 21 <Col N="310" /> per cent.  I do not know if consumers ever noticed the value of that in the shops.  It might have been better to have reduced it to 21 per cent VAT plus 2 per cent local sales tax which would not have been any business of the EU.  It would have covered rate support grants and the whole shooting gallery.  It might have put a few pounds back into local government, which is badly needed.</P>
    <P>If we look back to the late 1980s, when the squeeze was put on several Government Departments, including Environment, Health and Education and on local authorities, money seems to have been ploughed back into these other Departments but not into local authorities, which are still getting by on a shoe string.  I agree that the Minister might be a bit more generous with the odd special grant, but as regards the rate support grant or any of the basic funding, local authorities are still trying to keep things going at a basic level.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are not being used to the fullest.  They could be used for generating employment because they know what needs to be done.  I would like to see the facilities and the influence of local authorities used to a greater degree.  I am sure all these suggestions are on the shelves in the Department of the Environment in the numerous reports carried out by various Government Ministers from all parties over the years.  No matter how innovative this new consultant is, I doubt if he can come up with anything new.</P>

That is a disgrace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a waiver system in place in the Cork area which works well.  We have a managerial authority established under the relevant Act, we use discretion and we have instalment payments. If this Government, the Labour Party and the so-called Democratic Left, were <Col N="312" /> sincere, they would have given an exemption to old age pensioners and to the long-term unemployed.  Then they would have made progress and faced up to their responsibilities.  They have done a three card trick job.  Some 300,000 people are unemployed and many families cannot afford to pay the charges.  If the Government had wanted to be sincere, it would have given them an exemption.  Why does the Government not face up to its responsibilities?</P>

      <P>I do not understand the thinking behind the Bill.  Since this began in 1985, many mechanisms have been put in place.

It is pumped through miles of pipeline and it costs money in terms of capital expenditure to place it.  Cork could do with more money for water schemes.  Places like <Col N="313" /> Fermoy and Ballyhea and other places in mid-Cork badly need extra funding. Why has that been delayed?  No capital projects of a substantial nature have been presented.  Let us come to grips with this and finalise the water structure and systems in Cork so as to give us an adequate water supply.  Some 20 million gallons of water are pumped each day.</P>

The people of Bray were fooled on the last occasion but they will not be fooled this time. The reason the Deputy is here tonight is he knows he is not wanted in Wicklow. The Government was founded on this Bill.  What is the House coming to? I fear for the country and this Administration. I know in my heart and soul that the people I am canvassing are of the same opinion.  They are living in fear of what will happen under this Administration. When an Administration is founded on the issue of domestic charges, at a loss of £50 million to the taxpayer, it is about time it got its answer.</P>

      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  What strikes me about it is that the Government has cobbled together a Bill to meet the political needs of the smallest party in the Government.  The existing arrangements for the collection of service charges, by and large, are acceptable and do not cause serious anxiety in any of the local authorities in counties Cavan and Monaghan.  The Minister referred on a number of occasions to the existing system as one that is working satisfactorily and that takes into account difficulties people may have in meeting the relevant charges at the appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all receive representations regularly from people who wish to avail of the waiver scheme.  The local authorities of which I am a member are always anxious to deal with representations in <Col N="317" /> the most humane way possible from any family experiencing particular financial difficulties in meeting the charges.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>...these charges are an important source of income for local authorities so much so that in the region of £50 million was collected in domestic charges in 1994&mdash;</P>
    <P>It is, of course, entirely at the discretion of each local authority to decide whether or not to levy charges, and to set the level of such charges&mdash;</P>
    <P>In many circumstances, local authorities consider disconnection to be a more realistic and effective option. There is no doubt that disconnection is a severe measure and it is one which is not implemented lightly by local authorities&mdash;</P>
    <P>Disconnection has not been used as a first line of attack, or in an uncaring fashion by local authorities around the country.  Indeed there is evidence that local authorities generally have adopted a responsible and sympathetic attitude in this matter.</P>
    <P>If we are to take the Minister at his word this legislation is unnecessary.  To give the power to the courts to decide on who should have the water supply disconnected is taking away the decision-making role of the local elected representative.  We have heard pious platitudes from Governments of all political shades about giving more power back to locally elected members and more local democracy.  Surely the Minister's speech flies in the face of any aspiration the Government may have in that regard.  I speak for the local authorities of Cavan and Monaghan who have implemented a system that deals with the needs of the people.  Provision has been made to establish a waiver system where a family is unable to meet its commitments.  In 1994 Cavan County Council had the second highest rate of charges for water, refuse collection and sewerage at £195.  The collection rate is about 90 per cent.  County Cavan is not without its difficulties in regard to local government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for affording me the opportunity to raise this important matter, the cost to the State of scrapping old motor cars.  There are approximately 218,000 cars over ten years old in this country.  Because of the time given to section 171 of the Finance Act, 1995, there was not much time available to discuss other matters.  Of particular interest to me is the payment of £1,000 in vehicle registration tax in respect of motor cars over ten years old which are scrapped and I congratulate the Minister for Finance for introducing it.  The system becomes operational from the first day of next month and considerable interest in it has been expressed in my constituency and, I am sure, in other areas.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the scheme as a forward thinking initiative by the Minister, I am sure it could be enhanced and developed further to achieve its primary objective, which is to get cars over ten years old off our roads and out of the system.  The insurance statistics for some of these motor vehicles must be quite interesting &mdash; I will refer to this later.</P>
      <P>The people in my constituency driving cars that are more than ten years old are not doing so because of a love of vintage cars.  They are compelled to do so because of the high cost of purchasing new cars.  A £1,000 refund will result in only some of these vehicles being sent to the scrap yard and replaced by new ones.  If the scheme was relaxed slightly there would be a big increase in the numbers taking up the Minister's offer of financial aid, set out in section 97 of the Finance Act, 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose the scheme should be adjusted so that a person can buy a car not more than two years old with not more than 30,000 miles on the clock and in addition being held by a granted <Col N="319" /> owner for at least three years; the Finance Act mentions six months but that refers to a new car.  In these cases there is no trade value.</P>
    <P>The scrap value is taken as nominal in the following examples.  A small new car costing £10,000 would cost £9,000.  A small car two years old, depreciating by 20 per cent each year, would cost approximately £6,400 after two years; and net of the grant would cost £5,400. There is a self-evident, large difference between £9,000 for a new vehicle and £5,400 for a good second-hand vehicle. This would encourage more people to take up this scheme and take more old cars out of the system.  The replacement cars, which would be more affordable, would also be much easier to insure and, therefore, the likelihood of uninsured vehicles on the road would be diminished considerably.</P>
    <P>A further saving would be in the huge amount of Garda time spent in District Courts dealing with traffic offences such as bald tyres, defective steering, defective lights, exhaust emissions, etc.  Apart from Garda time being better used in crime prevention and other important matters, other litigants would be able to get better access to the District Court. Accessibility to the courts is an integral part of any system of justice.</P>
    <P>When cars of more than ten years old come off the road driving will be safer, not only for the drivers and passengers of such vehicles but for other road users and pedestrians.  The new vehicle numbering system was introduced in 1987 and the huge number of vehicles with old style number plates makes clear how many vehicles are at least eight and a half years old.</P>
    <P>A car is a vital part of the fabric of society, especially in rural areas where there is little availability of taxis.  This was much discussed when the drink driving laws were altered and I admire the Minister for taking that initiative, even though he is a pioneer.  In the country, people need cars to get to work, go to shops, take their children to <Col N="320" /> places of education and visit the elderly, apart from pleasure purposes.</P>
    <P>While my proposals would involve a great number of additional cars being scrapped the tangible cost of the £1,000 per vehicle would increase significantly. The benefits of reducing uninsured driving and saving Garda and court time, while real, are difficult to quantify. However, while these people in the main cannot afford new cars, in buying good used vehicles they will allow the better off motorist to buy new vehicles. This will have a much more dramatic effect on new car sales than the scheme originally proposed by the Minister, which still left a large financial gap between the scrap value of a car, which may be nothing, and the price of a new car.</P>
    <P>Sales in the current year of both new cars and light vehicles of the type used by small businesses are only slightly up on 1994 at present and car sales dropped in May this year compared with May 1994.  Despite the good economic statistics car sales have not achieved the peak of some years ago. An uplift in new car sales would benefit the Exchequer, through VRT more than anything else.  The original scheme was described as revenue negative.  Adopting those improvements to the Minister's good idea would mean more vehicle registration tax for the Exchequer, generating more funds; would free gardaí from District Court time; increase the number of insured vehicles; make the roads safer for all, by getting rid of poor vehicles; and make the car, a necessity in rural areas, accessible to more people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for raising this matter and I am happy to respond to him on behalf of the Minister for Finance.  I am also pleased to hear that the Deputy welcomes the scheme for repaying £1,000 vehicle registration tax when a new car is registered for the first time in conjunction with a car at least ten years old being scrapped.  Given both the degree of <Col N="321" /> interest displayed by car distributors and the level of inquiries from the general public, the Government is hopeful it will achieve its twin objectives of removing some older cars from the road and replacing them with new cars which might not otherwise have been purchased.</P>
      <P>The scheme is due to come into operation on 1 July, Saturday next.  However, since it is not possible to register a car at the weekend, the Revenue Commissioners are prepared to accept new cars registered on Friday, 30 June as being eligible under the scheme.</P>
      <P>As regards the estimated cost of the scheme to the Exchequer, while prudence dictated that an assumption of revenue neutrality be included in the budgetary arithmetic, there now seems to be a reasonable chance that the Exchequer will benefit positively from the scheme.</P>
      <P>The point has been made that it is still very costly for an individual who owns a ten year old car to purchase a new one even when the £1,000 VRT repayment for scrapping the old car is taken into account.  However, the discounts and financing deals now being offered in conjunction with the VRT concession certainly reduce the net outlay involved. I believe the Deputy is interested in extending the scheme to good quality second-hand cars and that is something the Minister for Finance has examined. However, this would go far beyond the objective of what is a once-off scheme and there would be little attraction to the Exchequer in terms of extra revenue from second-hand sales.</P>
      <P>As I indicated, there are two objectives to the scheme &mdash; to facilitate the removal of older cars from the road and to stimulate the purchase of new cars that might not otherwise be purchased. I accept that extending the scheme to certain second-hand cars could contribute towards the first of these objectives, but I believe it would undermine the second objective, perhaps to an unacceptable degree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="322" /> Extending the concession in the manner suggested would, in certain cases, do no more than subsidise indirectly new car purchases which would more than likely have taken place anyway in the normal process of trading-in and upgrading of motoring needs by individuals and companies.  This would not be an acceptable use of what are clearly scarce Exchequer resources.</P>
    <P>There is also the point that it would very likely result in the subsidisation of imports of secondhand cars.  It would not be possible under EU rules, to restrict the benefits of the scheme to secondhand cars already registered in the State.  I do not know if increased imports is the outcome the Deputy requires but I doubt that it is.</P>
    <P>Apart from these considerations, there is also the matter of determining at a practical level what consitutes a good quality secondhand car.  An age cut-off would undoubtedly distort the market and, in many cases, age is not necessarily the best indicator of quality. A Jquality&rdquo; definition,  without explicit reference to age, might be less distortive in market terms but even if one could be devised, there would always be scope for a lot of argument at the margin.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, the scheme that has been adopted and put in place in the Finance Act, 1995, restricts the benefit to the purchasers of new cars.  This is simple, straight forward and non-contentious in terms of definition.  The Minister for Finance would hesitate to broaden its scope any further.</P>
    <P>Obviously, since the scheme only takes effect from the end of the month, we cannot be sure now successful it will be.  All the indicators are however, that it will succeed.  In that case, we will have removed a certain number of lower quality vehicles from the road while, at the same time, safeguarding the position of the Exchequer.  I think the Deputy will agree that this is a good, if rare, result.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Justice Fergus Flood, chairperson on the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, in his 1994 report highlighed the depths of isolation and exclusion which distressed disabled people in our society because of the denial of access to public transport. This single issue of transport is a major obstacle to giving people with disabilities greater equality in Irish life.  In reply to a recent parliamentary question tabled by the Progressive Democrats, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications stated that Bus Éireann has no immediate plans to introduce wheelchair accessible buses in Cork or elsewhere on its service network. I am amazed at this callous rejection by the Government of basic public transport for people in wheelchairs.</P>
      <P>My question tonight specifically relates to the availability of wheelchair accessible taxis.  I am aware that the Minister recently transferred the function of awarding licences for taxis and wheelchair accessible taxis to local authorities as a reserved function to be exercised by the elected councillors on the basis of a points system.  I welcome this change in so far as it is transferring functions from central to local government which my party has been advocating for some time.  However, merely transferring the function will not in itself achieve the availability of wheelchair accessible taxis unless some special measures are introduced to help overcome the high capital cost of purchasing suitably adapted vehicles.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister that the report of the interdepartmental committee to review the operation of small public service vehicles, which reported in May 1992, recommended in paragraph A. 10 that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>the capital cost of providing a vehicle which is fully wheelchair accessible is significantly higher than the cost of standard family saloon cars, which are currently used, and is a critical factor which has discouraged <Col N="324" /> the introduction of such vehicles on a voluntary basis.  Financial incentives are seen as an integral element of any package of measures to secure the availability of suitable vehicles.</P>
    <P>It is stated in paragraph A.12 that:</P>
    <P>while long-term objectives of achieving full access for people in wheelchairs to taxis are supported by the committee, it believes that short-term measures are also essential to secure an immediate improvement to the transport options available to people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>I also remind the Minister of the conclusions of the ECMT International Seminar on Taxis which was held in Seville, Spain, in April 1992.  Paragraph 8 of the summary of its report states that:</P>
    <P>central regional and local government have vital roles to play in enabling people with mobility handicaps to make use of accessible taxi services, particularly by providing direct and indirect subsidies, as appropriate.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 12 states that:</P>
    <P>taxi operators should not be put at a competitive disadvantage by a requirement to provide accessible taxis.  Governments should, therefore, consider the need for incentives to encourage the purchase of such vehicles.</P>
    <P>I am informed that it would cost £30,000, at £22,000 plus the import duty, to import the particular type of vehicle required to facilitate wheelchair users. A taxi driver in Galway carried out a thorough investigation into the viability of changing from a traditional style saloon car taxi to the wheelchair accessible type and concluded that it would not be viable without financial aid &mdash; either direct subsidy or cancellation of import duty etc.  An approach for financial assistance to the Galway County and City Enterprise Board elicited the <Col N="325" /> following response from the chief executive officer:</P>
    <P>Your proposal is of considerable interest, due mainly to the facilities which you propose to make available for the transportation of disabled or wheelchair bound passengers, and it was agreed that there may be considerable potential for the development of this aspect of the business. Regrettably, however, the County and City Enterprise Board are unable to approve your application at this moment but would be prepared to examine same again at their September or October meeting.  I regret I cannot be of more help at this time.</P>
    <P>I understand that the interdepartmental report recommended the issue of 50 additional licences for wheelchair accessible cabs in the Dublin taximeter area and that that has been acted on. However, it seems that no surveys to establish need have been carried out anywhere else.  In Galway and similar areas it is clear that some financial incentive will be necessary to achieve the objective of having the transport needs of disabled people improved.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister's earlier response on the VRT and the £1,000 repayment on new cars which is to be made available to able bodied people, I look forward to his response with great interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Molloy for raising this issue and allowing me the opportunity to outline the measures I have taken, in the short period of time I have been in the Custom House, to facilitate the introduction of wheelchair accessible taxis in all taximeter areas in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A major review of all aspects of the operation and licensing of taxis and hackneys was under way in my Department before I took up office last December.  There were extensive consultations with various interest groups, and representations from numerous individuals and organisations, including groups representative of disabled <Col N="326" /> people, were considererd in detail by me when I took up office.</P>
    <P>I brought this work to finality as quickly as possible and I made regulations on 31 May to introduce fundamental changes to the system of licensing taxis and hackneys.  These regulations which I signed will come into operation on 1 September 1995. They provide for the transfer, as the Deputy said, of a number of important functions to local authorities on a reserved basis, including the creation of taximeter areas, the determination of the number of taxi licences to be granted in the different areas, and the licensing of taxis and hackneys.</P>
    <P>The determination of the number of licenses for wheelchair accessible taxis, and the grant of these licences, are among the functions devolved to local authorities.  This is the first time that provision for such taxis has been made on a national basis.</P>
    <P>I believe that the local authorities are the best people to know of local public transport requirements, including the requirement for taxis, and the needs of disabled people in their functional areas.  I am confident, therefore, that the new regulations will result in the introduction of appropriate numbers of wheelchair accessible taxis in the various taximeter areas around the country, and the establishment not only of new taximeter areas but of wheelchair accessible taxis in areas which have no taxi service at present.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to provide specific financial assistance towards the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis.  In this regard, I would point out that while 50 special licences for such taxis were authorised in 1992, on a pilot basis, a further 30 holders of ordinary taxi licences have also provided wheelchair accessible vehicles in Dublin without any financial inducement or incentive.</P>

This is in recognition of the additional costs involved in providing a wheelchair accessible taxi, More importantly, it will, in future, be open to local authorities to fix the fees for the various kinds of licences in their areas.  In doing so, I feel sure that they will keep in mind the need to encourage the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis.  It is quite properly in line with the thrust of Government policy to devolve real powers to local authorities in order to give them as much scope as possible in this regard.</P>

      <P>The provision of a pre-school programme is probably the most effective way of allowing children, particularly in disadvantaged areas, make a good start in terms of their personal development.  A number of reports have highlighted the need for such a programme and child care facilities in general.  In an interview in <i>The Irish Times</i> some time ago the Minister for Education said that progress was slow in implementing the pilot early start pre-school programme; that there was a need for more research, parental and community involvement and training for teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been community pre-school playgroups in Ballymun for the past 21 years.  They are run on a shoestring, under the aegis of the local authority, by a number of dedicated people who have provided a tremendous service to the community down through the years.  They operate from schools, flats, basements, community centres etc. Emphasis has always been placed on the <Col N="328" /> involvement of mothers, particularly young mothers of whom there are many, regrettably, in the area.</P>
    <P>The word in Ballymun is &mdash; I have heard this through the grapevine &mdash; that one of the playgroups is to be evicted following the Minister's decision to introduce the early start programme in a school in the area.  This amounts to duplication.  I would like to hear what exactly is on offer as the word is that all of a sudden unlimited funding is available despite the fact that the exsisting service has been run on a shoestring for years.</P>
    <P>While the Minister has obviously secured the agreement of the teacher unions she has ignored those who run the community pre-school playgroups in the area who have been doing their best to provide a service for the past 21 years.  Could she not have thanked them for the work they have done and explained why she believes the early start programme is better?  The Minister is being ungrateful.  Rather than act in a ruthless and savage way the Minister should expand the existing service to include areas where no service is available. I am shocked at what is happening.</P>
    <P>The people who run the existing service are objecting strongly; they are unhappy, angry and resentful as they feel the early start programme is being foisted on them.  If unlimited funding is available in the Department it would be better if it were used to fix the roof of the comprehensive school which was on the list of schools at which repairs were to be carried out until the Government entered office.  There is deep resentment at the way the people concerned are being treated by the Minister having provided a service for the past 21 years. She has failed to consult with them in writing or to ask them to meet with her. This is a disgrace.  I seek confirmation that what they have said is true.</P>

      <P>It is a matter of regret that the Minister for Education is not present as a contemptuous approach has been adopted in dealing with the many groups and professionals involved in the <Col N="329" /> provision of a pre-school service during the past 20 years.  Despite many approaches and expressions of concern by, for example, the Irish Pre-School Playgroup Association and AMI Montessori teachers, the Minister remains steadfast and continues to refuse to consult with them and plan in a rational and coherent way a proper national pre-school programme.</P>
      <P>There is little point in introducing the early start programme in areas where provision has already been made for a pre-school service.  As we do not have a national pre-school system, it would be far better if existing resources were utilised to introduce the early start programme in areas where no service is available.  Jobs are being put in jeopardy not alone in Ballymun but also in Cork, Galway and throughout the rest of the country.  This amounts to duplication and is a scandalous waste of existing resources given the constraints on public expenditure.</P>

      <P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Education.  The early start pre-school programme is targeted at the most disadvantaged children in the areas in which it is based and is being developed as an integral part of the primary schools to which the pre-schools are attached.  The objective of the initiative is to provide young children with an education programme which will enhance their overall development and lay a foundation for successful attainment in future years. The service is being targeted at areas of particular disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions on the selection of locations for the pre-school projects established by the Department were taken after consultation with the relevant health authorities and having full <Col N="330" /> regard to the range of pre-school activities already in place in an area.  The criteria used were the degree of social disadvantage and the availability of vacant classroom accommodation.  In the case of each area chosen, the intention is that the pre-school project will serve the children from the catchment area of the school to which the project is being attached.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Education is aware of the important role played by exising playgroup services and it is certainly not her intention that the pre-school programme should compete with these services in any way.  The Minister considers that the new pre-school programme will complement existing initiatives in the playgroup area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that playgroups for children in this age group have a more social and child care orientation than that of the pre-schools established under the early start programme. The early start programme has a fundamentally different focus from other services provided in this area.  Each pre-school has precise curricular objectives and employs fully qualified primary school teachers and qualified child care assistants.  Parental involvement in the activities of the pre-school is a fundamental part of this programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister has established a monitoring committee in the Department to advise on the development of the early start programme.  This committee has representatives from the Department, the Department of Health, all the voluntary bodies involved in pre-school services for this age group, as well as representatives of the teacher unions and of relevant third level colleges involved in staff training.</P>
    <P>This committee will also advise on the co-ordination of pre-school provision. In addition, regular consultation will continue to take place between Department officials and those of the Department of Health in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister has recently expanded the early start programme by including a further 32 schools in the programme for the coming school year.  One of these <Col N="331" /> schools is located in the Ballymun area, Virgin Mary boy's national school.  The Minister understands that the nearest community playgroup to this school is located in the Ballymun East Community Centre.  The Minister would like to assure the Deputy that there is no question of eviction of his playgroup from the area as a result of implementing the early start programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I express my deepest sympathy to the family of Stephen McMillan who tragically lost his life having collapsed at the Dance Nation rave event held at the Point Depot in Dublin last Saturday night.</P>
      <P>I understand that another young woman attending the same event was seriously injured when she fell over a banister.  The drug ecstasy was freely sold and consumed on the night in question. This drug has been available for approximately four years and can be obtained in every city, town and village. Sadly it has almost become acceptable as a source of enjoyment and pleasure, which is the most disturbing aspect.</P>
      <P>It must be stated with absolute clarity that ecstasy kills.  Officially there have been six ecstasy related deaths in recent times &mdash; unofficially the figure is as high as 14.  Ecstasy may cause dehydration, convulsion, blood clotting and heart and renal failure.  It may bring on panic attacks, extreme state of anxiety and psychosis.  These symptoms are not dose related; a quarter or half a tablet may have the same effect as three or four tablets.  They are the harsh facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Serious questions must be answered concerning the organisation of the Point rave event last Saturday, which was attended by 7,000 young people ranging in age from 14 to 19 years.  It should deeply concern all of us in this House <Col N="332" /> that drugs were freely sold and consumed in the presence of those organising the event.  Sadly, the taking of ecstasy is treated as acceptable.  The taking of that killer drug should never be treated as acceptable.  Promoters of major musical events for young people make huge profits from ticket sales and are duty bound to provide maximum safeguards and security for those attending.</P>
    <P>Reports from this major event are very disturbing.  Some people who attended described it as scary and eerie. Those who take JE&rdquo; tablets may lose their personalities and become robot-like in their behaviour.  Other disturbing reports related to the turning off of the water supply in the toilet areas.  Those who take ecstasy need large quantities of water, and in this case the organisers charged £1.20 per bottle, again making huge profits.  I am concerned that there is an apparent acceptability of this action.</P>
    <P>It is time the Minister instigated a thorough investigation into the sale of drugs such as ecstasy at clubs and dance events.  Together with the organisers of such events she should endeavour to tackle comprehensively this deadly practice that is eating away at our vulnerable young population.  Why do the promoters of events not spell out the dangers involved and issue warnings that ecstasy kills?  An effective and imaginative advertising campaign should be conducted by the Government, involving promoters and organisers of these events to get the message across to young people about the real threat to their lives from taking ecstasy, because the message certainly has not been received.</P>
    <P>Many young people are very vulnerable and are under enormous peer pressure to take the first tablet, first a quarter, then a half, and they are told it will do no harm.  These tablets contain lethal impurities and do great long term harm.  Times have changed dramatically and in many ways our young people need much more support than we did when we were young.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="333" /> The introduction of ecstasy seems to have taken the fun out of concerts and dances and sadly it is becoming more acceptable.  I appeal to the Minister to first instigate an investigation into the tragic death of Stephen McMillan who lost his life after taking ecstasy; second, carry out a comprehensive investigation into the sale of drugs such as ecstasy at clubs and dance events and report back on the mattert, and, third, initiate as a matter of urgency an effective and imaginative advertising campaign involving the promoters of events to get the message across loud and clear that ecstasy kills, a message they sadly do not hear at present.  It has been stated that we are going to have a summer of JE&rdquo;; let us ensure that does not happen.</P>

      <P>I wish to express my deepest sympathy to the family of Stephen McMillan.  It was a cruel blow to have a son of such tender years taken away in such tragic circumstances. One can only begin to imagine how tragic it was for the family to receive the news that this young man collapsed and subsequently died.  I have been informed by the Garda authorities that this tragic case came to their attention only this morning.  Deputy Kitt will appreciate that I am not in a position, pending receipt of a report of the Garda investigation, to make a detailed comment on the case.  I understand that a <i>post mortem</i> has yet to be held.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned about reports that the drug, commonly referred to as ecstasy, was available at the event in question.  I note that a spokesman for the Point Depot has stated that their security staff searched everyone entering the venue.  I further note that the general manager of the venue has said that anyone who is approached by persons selling drugs should contact security immediately. The concert promoters have declared that drugs were not freely available at the event.  I am not in a position at present to comment on these statements. I will await a Garda report before assessing them.  This is not to <Col N="334" /> imply in any way that the owners of the venue and the concert promoters are not being factual in their statements, but given the nature of some of the eye-witness reports as quoted in the press, I believe it prudent to await the Garda report.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity to comment on the drug ecstasy.  I am concerned that some people seem to be of the view that ecstasy is a so-called soft drug and, as such, not especially dangerous.  Let us be clear about this, ecstasy can kill and has killed.  If nothing else, last Saturday's tragic event demonstrates this better than any words of mine or Deputy Kitt.  Ecstasy is not a harmless drug; it can and does destroy life.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem in dealing with this drug is that it has been glamorised to a great extent by elements of the music industry.  To put it simply, many see this drug as an integral part of the so-called rave scene.  I ask the national media, both broadcast and print, to be careful not to fall into the trap of glamorising this drug.  They have a responsibility to the community not to give young people the impression that this drug is in some way cool.  I consider it a matter of deep regret and highly unhelpful that this drug has had such a propaganda effort mounted on its behalf.  Last Saturdays tragic incident showed the reality of ecstasy.</P>
    <P>I do not have figures of the number of people who have died from this drug. I do not know where Deputy Kitt got his figures.  They are not available officially to me but I will check them.  I will examine the Garda report when it is available &mdash; I understand it will be available very quickly.  A number of people will have to be questioned about their knowledge of what happened at this event.  It is important that we learn the facts as to what occurred at this Dance Nation function, as it was called.</P>
    <P>The dance was advertised in the Point Depot, which is licensed for public dancing.  It was a fully licensed dance <Col N="335" /> rather than the so-called unlicensed rave discos about which we are aware. Supervision and medical personnel were in attendance at the event.  I will await the Garda report and will then take the <Col N="336" /> necessary action.  I again extend my sympathy to the family of the young man who died.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 28 June 1995.</P>

      <P>The Maastricht Treaty provides for a review of the operation of the institutional and procedural provisions of the Common <Col N="48" /> Foreign and Security Policy at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>The Government will play a constructive role in the review and will be working for practicable and sustainable ways of improving the functioning of the CFSP.  It believes that it is important that the European Union should have the capacity through the CFSP to make the most effective contribution possible to the preservation of international peace and stability and to the promotion of democracy and respect for human rights.  The review should be based on a careful appraisal of the functioning of the present arrangements, which have been in operation for less than two years, and the aspects which may require strengthening should be correctly identified.</P>
      <P>The recent CDU/CSU paper to which the Deputy refers, prepared by the majority party in the German coalition Government, is an important contribution to the developing discussion, both within Germany and the European Union as a whole.  However, it does not at this stage constitute German Government policy.</P>
      <P>An important issue in the context of the review will be the decision-making arrangements of the CFSP, including the voting procedure.  For our part, the Government is not convinced that the use of qualified majority voting would resolve the problems in relation to the effectiveness of the CFSP or that it would result in a more satisfactory decision-making system.  The European Union's foreign policy needs to be underpinned by broad support in the member states if it is to be sustainable and effective on sensitive international issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government believes, on the basis of the experience to date, that the key to more effective decision-making in the CFSP lies in improving the structures for the preparation of proposals. In this regard, we would agree with the view expressed in the CDU/CSU paper that the lack of a mechanism for joint analysis and planning in the CFSP framework needs to be addressed.  At <Col N="49" /> present there is no counterpart in this area to the role the Commission plays in policy planning in Community matters. More effective means are needed at European Union level to undertake the research and analysis which underpins policy initiation and development on international political questions.  This would facilitate identification of the common European Union interest and the formulation of effective responses on such issues.  Accordingly, the Government considers that priority should be given in the review of the CFSP to developing a planning and research capacity at the EU level.  We think that the best way of doing this is to develop the role of existing bodies, in particular the Council Secretariat of the European Union, instead of establishing new institutions.</P>

      <P>The Government has consistently emphasised to the British Government the importance of prison issues in the context of the peace process, and the need to respond positively to the new situation in the aftermath of the paramilitary ceasefires.</P>
      <P>It is against this background that the Government, having regard to the reduced threat to the community, agreed to the release of a number of prisoners in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste has devoted particular attention to these matters, including the question of release and prison conditions, in the discussions which he has had with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach also raised these issues <Col N="50" /> in several recent discussions with the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major. Both the Taoiseach and Tánaiste have availed of recent visits to London to brief the British Opposition parties on the Government's concerns.</P>
    <P>There are a number of areas within which the Government sees scope for progress towards early and orderly releases from prisons in Northern Ireland.  An increased rate of remission for long term determinate sentence paramilitary prisoners is one obvious step which, it is believed, would have an immediate and positive effect.  Another area where the Government would hope to see movement is in the review arrangements for life sentence prisoners. We have also urged the British authorities to consider a more flexible approach to parole arrangements, including in cases of compassionate parole where family members or other relatives are seriously ill.  Some recent changes in compassionate parole arrangements announced by the Secretary of State are a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is continuing to keep the situation of prisoners in England under close review, and has urged the British Government to approach prison issues and specific cases with care and full appreciation of the importance which these matters also have in the wider context of the peace process.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that the Government will continue to follow closely developments in this area, and will ensure that they receive careful attention in the continuing discussions with the British Government.</P>

      <P>Hostage-taking, <Col N="51" /> wherever it occurs, is a heinous and despicable criminal act.  It is wholly unacceptable that, in pursuit of political, military or other aims, innocent people should be threatened or abused through such actions.  Those who engage in hostage-taking bear the responsibility for any loss of life precipitated by their actions.</P>
      <P>The Government was gravely concerned by the actions of Chechen fighters in taking hostage up to 1,300 inmates of a hospital in Budennovsk.  Some 150 people were killed.  Many others were injured or traumatised by this horrific incident.</P>
      <P>With our European Union partners, Ireland condemned in the strongest possible terms the hostage-taking in Budennovsk.  We deplored the loss of life which had taken place and called for the unconditional release of all hostages.</P>
      <P>The European Union also reiterated its appeal for a political settlement of the crisis in Chechnya.  It was made clear that the hostage-taking had illustrated, once again, that it is not possible to resolve the Chechen crisis by military means alone, and that the tragic events in Budennovsk underlined the imperative need for a political solution for Chechnya.</P>
      <P>There is a chance that the Budennovsk tragedy may act as a catalyst for the efforts to restore peace in Chechnya. In discussions between the Russian authorities and Chechen leaders in Grozny last week there were some encouraging developments.  A three-day ceasefire was agreed.  There were indications of a willingness to negotiate on a range of fundamental issues which must be resolved if Chechnya is to enjoy peace.  However, given the legacy of the conflict, I do not wish to underestimate the difficulties associated with this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, with its European Union partners welcomes, and will continue to encourage, these recent positive developments. We will continue to work for a permanent ceasefire; substantive <Col N="52" /> negotiations for a political solution; a deep engagement by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe &mdash; OSCE &mdash; in the political process and in the protection of human rights; and for full access for the humanitarian aid agencies to the victims of the conflict in Chechnya.</P>

      <P>Ireland, together with its partners in the EU, follows closely and with concern the human rights situation in Indonesia, in particular, the difficulties faced by activists in the trade union movement to which the report in question refers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By virtue of Indonesia's membership of the International Labour Organisation it has undertaken to give effect to principles laid down in the ILO Charter. These include undertakings that: workers and employers, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and, subject only to rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorization; workers' and employers organisations shall have the right to draw up their constitution and rules, to elect their representatives in full freedom, to organise their administration and activities and to formulate their programmes.  The public authorities shall refrain from any interference which would restrict this <Col N="54" /> right or impede the lawful exercise thereof, and workers' and employers' organisations shall not be liable to be dissolved or suspended by administrative authority.</P>
    <P>In its statement of 22 November 1994, the EU appealed to the Indonesian authorities to refrain from any restrictions of these rights and to take further steps towards establishing a general climate, including freedom of expression, in which labour organisations can work freely and independently.</P>
    <P>In its statement to this year's session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which took place in Geneva from January to March, the Presidency, speaking on behalf of the EU, expressed concern at the situation of trade union leaders in Indonesia.  The statement highlighted, in particular, the case of Mr. Muchtar Pakpahan, leader of the officially unrecognised trade union Indonesian Prosperous Workers Union (SBSI) whose case is addressed in the Amnesty Report.  Mr. Pakpahan was sentenced to three years imprisonment in November 1994 for allegedly inciting strikes and demonstrations which took place in the town of Medan in April 1994.  His sentence, and that of his colleague Mr. Telambanua, was increased on appeal in January 1995.</P>
    <P>The EU issued a statement on the disappointing result of his appeal in which it considered the sentencing of these trade unionists, without due respect to their rights to a defence, to be unjustified. It reiterated its request that the Indonesian Government take further steps towards creating a general climate in which trade union organisations can work freely and independently.</P>
    <P>I understand that although Mr. Pakpahan has recently been released from prison this was for procedural reasons and is not a cause for any optimism.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific recommendations made in the Amnesty International report of 1 May 1995, I would fully support the call on the Government of Indonesia to release immediately and unconditionally any person <Col N="55" /> imprisoned for their peaceful activities in support of workers' rights and to take all measures to protect the lives of trade unionists and labour activists in Indonesia.</P>
    <P>I would also support the call on the Government of Indonesia to ratify and comply with International Labour Organisation Convention 87, concerning the Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise and Convention 98 concerning the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining.</P>
    <P>The report calls on the Indonesian Government to abolish the death penalty. As a State party to the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, Ireland supports this call.</P>
    <P>I will continue to follow the situation of trade unionists in Indonesia and to avail of every appropriate opportunity to raise our concerns about human rights with the Indonesian authorities.</P>

      <P>The reflection group, which is to assist in the preparation of the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference, held its inaugural meeting in Messina on 3 June in conjunction with the ceremonies commemorating the 40th anniversary of the signing of the Messina Declaration. It is expected to have in all about fifteen meetings of the group before the Madrid European Council in December to which it is to report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Its task is to clarify the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference and, where possible, to identify options in relation to the issues arising on the Intergovernmental Conference's agenda. <Col N="56" /> The reflection group is not a negotiating forum.  It will be the task of the Intergovernmental Conference itself to negotiate the details of any Treaty amendments.</P>
    <P>The inaugural meeting of the reflection group held a first discussion of the challenges facing the European Union in the coming years.  Ireland's representatives at the reflection group, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell, gave a detailed briefing to the Joint Committee on European Affairs on 6 June on the discussions, including on the approach he had taken.</P>
    <P>The second meeting of the group on 13 and 14 June had a first wide-ranging discussion of the institutional balances in the European Union, including in the perspective of future enlargement. These institutional issues to which the group will return at future meetings of course, are of crucial importance to the European Union and to Ireland.  At the meeting the Minister of State strongly emphasised the importance we attach to maintaining the broad institutional balances in the European Union which have served the Union well.  He supported the prerogatives of the Commission under the Treaty and argued firmly against any proposals which would seek to deprive the smaller member states of their right to nominate a member of the Commission.</P>
    <P>I would emphasise that the work of the reflection group is at a preliminary stage.  The House will be kept fully briefed on the progress of the discussions.</P>

      <P>Discussions with the United States authorities are continuing with a view to the setting of dates for a visit by President Clinton to Ireland, North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government looks forward very much to welcoming the President to Ireland.  Naturally, we hope that he will <Col N="58" /> be able to see as much as possible of the country, including Border areas, while he is here.  However, at this very preliminary stage, it is not possible to indicate the President's itinerary, which will, inevitably be subject to time constraints.</P>
    <P>The White House Conference for Trade and Investment in Ireland was the beginning of a process intended to highlight the attractions of investment in both the Border counties and Northern Ireland.  The relevant US authorities are planning follow-up in the form of sector-specific missions which will bring potential US investors to these areas over the coming months.  It is hoped that the first of these missions can be arranged for the autumn of this year. The Government and its agencies will lend these follow-up activities every support.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste has noted the comments made by the Chairman of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland.  As the Tánaiste indicated in answer to a question from the Deputy on 23 May of this year, the Government believes that, for a police service in Northern Ireland to secure and enjoy cross-community support, it must be accountable, free from partisan political control and must reflect, both in its composition and ethos, the communities it serves.  While it would be premature at this stage to prescribe the precise shape of future policing structures, we are confident that there is an increasing awareness in Northern Ireland that these are the types of attributes that future policing arrangements in Northern Ireland should possess.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="59" /> In the post-ceasefire situation, growing attention is being paid to the future of policing in Northern Ireland.  Discussions on the subject are taking place in various fora, including the consultation process initiated by the Police Authority.  The Government will continue to avail of the machinery established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement to communicate our views on this matter and to discuss these issues with the British Government which retains ultimate responsibility in this area.</P>

      <P>All of us know that the search for lasting peace is an extraordinarily complex process and that there will be many difficulties along the way.  These have been overcome in the past and I am confident this will continue to be the case.</P>
      <P>At the same time, it is important to keep these inevitable difficulties in perspective. We must not lose sight of the many positive achievements recorded so far in the peace process.</P>
      <P>Since last August, no one on this island has died in the name of any political cause.  Each passing day demonstrates ever more conclusively that the ceasefires are intended to be permanent.</P>
      <P>We have seen over the past nine months a steady consolidation of the peace and an inexorable momentum towards an inclusive talks process which, I hope, will produce the comprehensive agreement which we all so dearly wish to see.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="60" /> The challenge for all sides now is to translate the absence of violence into a lasting and just peace.  The Government are working hard to bring about a process of inclusive political dialogue which will lead the way towards a lasting political settlement.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government has recently invited the political parties in Northern Ireland to engage in bilateral discussions with us.  We hope that all sides will feel able to respond positively to this invitation to dialogue on an informal basis and on an entirely open agenda.</P>
    <P>There is now a unique opportunity on this island to build a new future for all the people of Ireland, North and South. The only way forward is to proceed with urgency towards comprehensive political negotiations.  The Government will do everything in our power to achieve this objective, through bilateral contacts with the political parties and our ongoing engagement with the British Government, including through the mechanisms of the Anglo-Irish Conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 37 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, President Clinton has sought Congressional concurrence to increase the US contribution to the International Fund for <Col N="61" /> Ireland from its existing level of $20 million annually to $30 million for each of the years 1996 and 1997.</P>
    <P>This request for an increased contribution to the Fund is currently being considered by Congress against a background of severe cuts in the overall US aid budget.  The Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives authorised $29.6 for the IFI for Financial Year 1996 and $19.6 for 1997 as part of the overall US aid package for 1996 and 1997.  This recommendation was endorsed by the full House of Representatives on the 8 June.  In parallel the Appropriations Committee of the House of Representatives has recently agreed to appropriate $19.6 million contribution for 1996.  This recommendation has yet to come before the full House.</P>
    <P>A similar process of consideration is also under way in the US Senate.  It is likely that the outcome of the Senate's deliberations will differ from that of the House of Representatives.  Accordingly, a House-Senate Conference will be required to reconcile the different approaches.  I do not expect this legislative process to be completed until late summer or early autumn.</P>
    <P>The Government will avail of every opportunity to restate the case for continued US support for the International Fund at this critical time and to express its appreciation for the United States assistance over the last nine years.</P>
    <P>As regards administrative arrangements, the Board of the International Fund enjoys autonomous decision making powers within the terms of its mandate and its members act independently from Government.  Over the last nine years the Fund has received a cumulative contribution of some $250 million from the United States.</P>
    <P>The International Fund has its own decision making and administrative strutures.  Its Board is assisted by an Advisory Committee of officials appointed by the two Governments. The day to day administration of the Fund is provided by a Secretariat with offices in Dublin and Belfast.  In <Col N="62" /> addition, the Fund has engaged the services of 10 local Development Counsultants across the 12 northern counties who assist prospective applicants to develop their proposals.</P>
    <P>These administrative arrangements have worked very well over the last nine years and I am completely satisfied that they are fully capable of dealing with any additional resources that may become available to the International Fund in the years ahead.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he and the Government propose to take to ensure that the Security Council Resolutions of the United Nations designed to ensure the delivery of aid and the protection of the safe areas in Bosnia will be implemented and enforced in view of the continuing attacks on Sarajevo and other Bosnian towns and the virtual starvation of the people living there.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11722/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the deterioration in the situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina following the failure of the Bosnian Government and Bosnian-Serbs to agree to a renewal of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement which expired on 1 May.  The continuing rejection by the Bosnian-Serbs of the Contact Group's plan and the drift into generalised hostilities has increased the plight of the inhabitants of Sarajevo and the five other designated safe areas.  The Bosnian-Serbs have reacted to Government offensives from some of these towns by attacking military targets located in the safe areas.  They have also initiated unprovoked bombardments &mdash; more than 70 people were killed by a shell in Tuzla recently.</P>
      <P>The safe-areas regime was established as a temporary measure by the Security Council in 1993.  With some 40 people dying daily in Srebrenica from military actions and starvation, the Council's Resolution 819 demanded that Srebrenica be treated as a safe area.  Subsequently, by Resolution 824, the Council declared that Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zepa, Gorazde and Bihac should also be treated as safe areas by all the parties concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These Resolutions demanded that all parties should ensure that the designated towns be free from any armed attack; that Bosnian-Serb military units be withdrawn from these areas; and that all parties should allow UNPROFOR and the international aid agencies unimpeded access to the safe-areas.  In Resolution 836, the Security Council further expanded UNPROFOR's mandate to enable it to protect the safe areas, including to deter attacks against them. In this regard, the Security Council defined the parameters for the use of force as being in self-defence. UNPROFOR was therefore authorised, <Col N="64" /> acting in self-defence, to take the necessary measures including the use of force in reply to bombardments against the safe-areas or armed incursions into them, or in the event of deliberate obstruction of UNPROFOR's freedom of movement or that of protected aid convoys.</P>
    <P>UNPROFOR's ability to discharge its mandate has been circumscribed by the limited resources with which it operates. To deter aggression through strength at the safe-areas would have required a very much larger force than the 7,600 additional troops which were authorised by the Security Council in 1993.</P>
    <P>UNPROFOR has also been severely constrained by the military activities of the Bosnian-Serbs and the Bosnian Government.  The Secretary General has underlined that unprovoked attacks launched from within the safe-areas are inconsistent with the basic concept which underlies that regime.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding these severe constraints, UNPROFOR has achieved some successes which have contributed to the improvement of the desperate living conditions in the safe areas.  The presence of UN observers, including from our Defence Forces, has enabled it to monitor ceasefires, stabilise confrontation lines and improve security by resolving local disputes; to arrange medical evacuations and humanitarian aid deliveries to the extent that circumstances permitted; and to broker local agreements.  Also, the presence of even limited UN forces has enhanced the security of aid workers in these towns.</P>
    <P>In the light of events following the hostage crisis, it is vital that UNPROFOR must be able to recover its freedom of movement and to fulfil its tasks more effectively, notably to ensure the safety of the civilian population of the safe areas.  The Government therefore welcome the Security Council's recent decision to authorise an increase in UNPROFOR's strength by up to 12,500 additional troops so as to enable it to discharge its existing mandate more effectively.  Units of UNPROFOR's new <Col N="65" /> rapid reaction capacity are now being deployed.</P>
    <P>The Security Council also underlined the need for a mutually agreed demilitarisation of the safe areas.  This would bring an end to attacks on these towns and to the launching of military operations therefrom.  The Secretary General has been asked to intensify his efforts to secure demilitarisation, taking account of the need to ensure the safety of the civilian inhabitants of the safe areas.</P>
    <P>UNPROFOR will continue to be a peace-keeping mission.  Its ability to carry out its tasks will continue to be influenced by the degree of co-operation which it receives from the parties. It is clear that the use of force against only one party would lead to UNPROFOR to be perceived as a party to the war and thus as a legitimate military target, precipitating its withdrawal from Bosnia.</P>
    <P>A negotiated political settlement remains the key to ensuring the safety and security of all of Bosnia's peoples, not least the inhabitants of the designated safe-areas.  We, with our EU partners, are continuing to work to this end.</P>

      <P>Since last September, I have repeatedly urged the British authorities to move as quickly as possible toward normal traffic conditions at all Border crossings in view of the greatly altered situation on the ground.  I have emphasised that this should include the removal of vehicle checkpoints, including the three checkpoints mentioned by the Deputy at Mullan, Gortmullan and Wattlebridge.  I am aware that these remain a source of inconvenience for many people in Border areas, and this has been the subject of representations to the British Government through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will know, the Kilturk and Clady checkpoints are being dismantled at present, while the ramps have been removed at some others.  In my view the time has come to remove all remaining vehicle checkpoints as soon as possible and I can assure the Deputy that I will continue to press for this at every available opportunity.</P>

      <P>The European Commission adopted guidelines in respect of the European Union's special support programme for Peace and Reconciliation &mdash; the PEACE Initiative &mdash; on 16 May.</P>
      <P>On 5 June, the Irish and British Governments submitted a draft joint Operational Programme for the Initiative to the Commission.  Consultations on this draft are currently under way.  It is hoped that the Operational Programme can be adopted by the Commission before the summer break.</P>
      <P>Once this has happened, interested groups will be invited to submit applications for funding under the various measures covered by the Programme. The two Governments and the Commission wish to ensure that funding can reach groups on the ground in Northern Ireland and the Border counties at the earliest opportunity.</P>

      <P>In line with previous administrations, this Government recognises the unique position of the Irish language and culture in Irish society and the integral and creative role it plays in defining our Irish identity.  Accordingly, it is the Government's policy to continue to lead and support initiatives which promote the use of Irish and the development of Irish culture.</P>
      <P>The preservation of Irish as a vernacular language is a basic aim of the various schemes being administered by the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and also Údarás na Gaeltachta. The Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and Údarás na Gaeltachta have special responsibilities in relation to Gaeltacht islands in the context of their overall responsibilities for the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>The Government continue to be deeply concerned about the outbreaks of violence in Burundi <Col N="72" /> which have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of innocent people in Bujumbura and have led to the displacement of thousands of people both internally and in the neighbouring countries. Estimates of the total number of deaths since the attempted coup of October 1993 and its violent aftermath vary between fifty and one hundred thousand.  It is impossible to estimate reliably the number of injuries which have taken place during that time.  The United Nations High Commission for Refugees estimates that 740,000 refugees have fled Burundi since October 1993.  However, they also confirm that since last March there have been spontaneous returns to Burundi in significant numbers while at the same time smaller numbers have continued to leave the country.  Earlier this year the Government allocated a further £750,000 from the Emergency Assistance Fund to meet the emergency needs of refugees from Burundi and Rwanda.  This decision brought Government funding for emergency relief operations in Burundi, Rwanda and neighbouring states to a total of IR£4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In their joint declaration of last March the President and Prime Minister of Burundi, who represent the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups respectively, committed themselves to the priority objectives of peace, reconciliation and reconstruction for implementation over a three-year period.  The institutional framework for this process is enshrined in the Convention of Government <Col N="73" /> which was agreed by the parties in Burundi on 10 September 1994.</P>
    <P>Ireland, the EU, the UN and others in the international community wish to see the Convention fully implemented and consider it the optimum internal solution based on consensus.  The EU confirmed its strong backing for the process of the Convention in its declaration at Carcassonne on 19 March and committed itself to assisting the Burundi Government in organising a national debate to consolidate national reconciliation and reconstruct democracy in the subsequent EU Common Position of 24 March.</P>
    <P>On 20 April the Heads of State and Government of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) extended the mandate of the OAU Observer Mission in Burundi until next September and increased its military component from 47 to 67 officers.  This followed the visit of an OAU ministerial delegation to Burundi on 12 April.  In keeping with the undertaking given in its Common Position of 24 March, the EU has recently approved a contribution of 1.5 million ECU to the OAU in support of its operation in Burundi.</P>
    <P>In response to the recent spate of violence involving extremist militias in Bujumbura and pursuant to the objectives of its Declaration and Common Position, the EU made a demarche to the Prime Minister of Burundi on 23 May.  It stressed that the current crisis could be seen as a test of the Government's determination to restore law and order in the capital and to deal effectively with extremists.  The EU confirmed its readiness to implement projects to occupy the youth in Bujumbura, who are manipulated by extremists, to destabilise the situation.  In welcoming the EU position the Prime Minister expressed his determination to combat the militants on both sides of the conflict.</P>
    <P>It is reported that the President of Burundi held a meeting on 12 June with the political parties participating in the Convention of Government, the Prime Minister and the special representatives <Col N="74" /> of the UN and the OAU.  The participants reportedly reiterated their support for the peace process of the Convention and considered that despite the incidents of violence the situation remained controllable.  They are reported to have called for a resolute and unerring commitment from all the political, moral and soci-economic partners and to have undertaken to report to the National Security Council on concrete measures to address the security situation and restore peace.  On 18 June, following consultation with the National Security Council, the President of Burundi announced a number of measures to combat extremists and others seeking to exploit ethnic divisions.</P>
    <P>Ireland, with its EU partners, strongly supports the efforts of the UN Special Representative to Burundi, Mr. Abdallah, to resolve the crisis in Burundi and strongly favours the proposal by the UN Security Council in its statement of 29 March to hold a regional conference on peace, stability and security in Burundi, Rwanda and neighbouring states.</P>
    <P>We actively support the implementation of the EU Common Position and Declarations on Burundi which provide <i>inter alia</i> for the restoration of law and order and the strengthening of the judicial system; the implementation of the International Plan of Action for Refugees in the Great Lakes Region adopted in Bujumbura last February; the sending of Human Rights Experts to Burundi in conjunction with the UNHCR; the convening of a round table of donors for Burundi and the establishment of an International Commission of Inquiry into the attempted coup of October 1993 and its violent aftermath as a prerequisite for national reconciliation.  We also support the EU Declaration on Burundi which was issued on 23 June.  This latest declaration condemns acts of violence on all sides and confirms the EU's resolute support for the peace efforts of the Burundi Government in these and other key areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="75" /> The Government will continue to do all that it can, both directly and in conjunction with the EU and the international agencies, to bring an end to extremist violence and to engage the political parties of Burundi in the peace process enshrined in the Convention of Government.</P>

      <P>The question of human rights violations in El Salvador during the 12 year civil war in that country has been the subject of UN sponsored investigations since the signing of the Peace Accord in 1992.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of that accord two investigative commissions were established, the <i>ad hoc</i> Investigative Commission and the Truth Commission, to examine the issue of human rights violations in El Salvador, including the question of murder and death squad activities involving members of the armed forces, the administration and the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>Both Commissions published their reports naming those responsible for such violations and recommending their immediate dismissal and exclusion from the armed forces and all forms of public service.  A number of these recommendations have been implemented and the UN Secretary General remains engaged in efforts to ensure their full implementation.</P>
      <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> Investigation Commission on Human Rights recommended that the Salvadoran government dismiss 97 army officers including seven generals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> The UN reported in March 1995 that because of resistance within the Armed Forces there had been a considerable delay in the discharge of these officers.</P>
    <P>The report of the Truth Commission found the military in El Salvador responsible for the vast majority of human rights violations and atrocities.  It also found that the FMLN were responsible for grave acts of violence, including assassinations, disappearances and kidnapping.</P>
    <P>The Truth Commission considered that it could not recommend judicial proceedings in El Salvador against the persons named until after judicial reforms were carried out.</P>
    <P>A new Supreme Court made up of eminent professionals was set up in 1994.  Since taking office, the new court has dismissed or suspended 11 judges and named a new Director of the Institute of Forensic Medicine, previously considered a partisan body.</P>
    <P>The recommendations of the Truth Commission in the human rights area are binding on the parties under the peace accords.  Of particular importance are those steps which would enable Salvadorans whose rights have been violated to have recourse to the protection afforded by international human rights instruments.</P>
    <P>While a number of the solemn undertakings given by the parties remain to be fulfilled, the United Nations remains committed to ensuring the full implementation of all agreements reached under the peace accords including the recommendations of the Truth Commission. Ireland and our partners in the European Union continue to give strong support for the UN's efforts and will monitor closely all developments in El Salvador.</P>

        <i>The Partial Test Ban Treaty 1963</i>
      </P>
      <P>The Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water was opened for signature on 8 August 1963 and entered into force on 10 October 1963.  Ireland signed the Treaty on 9 August 1963 and deposited its instrument of ratification on 20 December 1963.</P>
      <P>
        <i>The Outer Space Treaty 1967</i>
      </P>
      <P>The Treaty on the Principles governing the activities of States in the exploration and use of Outer Space including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies opened for signature on 27 January 1967 and entered into force on 10 October 1967.  Ireland signed the Treaty on 27 January 1967 and ratified on 19 July 1968.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Non-Proliferation Treaty 1970</i>
      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Non-Proliferation Treaty opened for signature on 1 July 1968 and entered <Col N="78" /> into force on 5 March 1970.  Ireland, having had a particularly close association with it, was the first State to sign and ratify the Treaty on 4 July 1968.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Seabed Treaty 1971</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Treaty on the Prohibition of the Emplacement of Nuclear Weapons and other Weapons of Mass Destruction on the Sea-Bed and the Ocean Floor and in the Subsoil thereof opened for signature on 11 February 1971 and entered into force on 18 May 1972.  Ireland signed the Treaty on 11 February 1971 and ratified on 19 August 1971.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Biological Weapons Convention 1972</i>
    </P>
    <P>Ireland signed the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological and Toxin Weapons and on their Destruction when it opened for signature on 10 April 1972.  Ireland deposited its instrument of ratification on 27 October 1972.  The Treaty entered into force on 26 March 1975.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Environmental Modification Convention 1976</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Convention on the Prohibition of Military or any other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques was adopted by the UN General Assembly on 10 December 1976.  The Convention entered into force on 5 October 1978.  Ireland signed the Convention on 18 May 1977 and ratified it on 16 December 1982.</P>
    <P>

    </P>
    <P>The Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons which may be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects was concluded at Geneva on 10 October 1980 and entered into force on 2 December 1983.  Ireland signed the Convention on 10 April 1981 and deposited its instrument of ratification of the Convention on 13 March 1995.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="79" />

    </P>
    <P>The Convention on the Prohibition of Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on their Destruction will enter into force six months after the deposit of the sixty-fifth instrument of ratification.  This is unlikely to be before 1996, as only twenty-eight States have ratified the Convention to date.</P>
    <P>Together with our partners in the European Union, Ireland was an original signatory of the CWC on 14 January 1993.  The Government are currently considering the steps necessary to enable Ireland to ratify the Convention.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Missile Technology Control Regime</i>
    </P>
    <P>Ireland joined the Missile Technology Control Regime in 1992.  Since the regime is not treaty-based, the questions of signature and ratification do not arise.</P>

    <P>When I paid my official visit to China in September 1994, I met the Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister, Mr. Qian Qichen, and expressed the hope that, in spite of the fact that Chinese law does not provide for Honorary Consuls, Ireland's Honorary Consul in Hong Kong would be able to continue to operate after 1997.  I appreciate the fact that the Chinese authorities have since agreed that those countries which have diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China may retain an <Col N="80" /> Honorary Consulate in Hong Kong after 1 July 1997.</P>

      <P>Ireland fully supports the right to development as a universal and inalienable right and an integral part of fundamental human rights, in accordance with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action of June 1993.  The principle of the right to development was reaffirmed at the World Summit for Social Development at Copenhagen in March 1995.</P>
      <P>The Government very much holds the views that developing countries should be free to decide on the best way to develop and diversify their economies, with the objective of achieving sustainable development.  At present, the economies of many developing countries are dependent on a small number of primary commodities.  Any measures which would permit them to diversify their range of products would be beneficial to their development.  To achieve such diversification, investment is crucial as is improved access to markets of developed countries.  The Government supports efforts aimed at achieving greater investment and improved access to markets for developing countries.</P>

      <P>External trade regulation falls within the competence of the European Union.  In that framework, Ireland seeks to promote the interests of the developing countries, particularly the least developed among them.  Aid and trade concessions are the two main instruments employed.  As far as trade is concerned, the Union applies its Generalised System of Preferences in favour of imports from developing countries.  The developing countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, the so-called ACP Countries, enjoy especially favourable access to the EU market, subject to certain safeguards in relation to specified agricultural produce where Union producers would be unduly affected if imports were not regulated to a certain degree.</P>
      <P>Both the Lomé Convention and the European Union's Co-operation Agreements with developing countries provide for Union assistance with the development of expertise in processing, marketing and distribution.  Encouragement and support is also provided in forming regional networks for the same purpose.</P>

      <P>Immediately on the election of the present Taoiseach, in accordance with precedent, a <Col N="85" /> professional security survey of his residence was carried out by the Garda experts attached to the Crime Prevention Unit of Crime and Security Branch. That Garda survey report recommended that &ldquo;a concrete wall should be constructed along the road frontage from the outbuildings to the tree line adjacent to the main entrance gates&rdquo;.  It recommended that the security wall be built to a height of 2.5m (7 feet).</P>
      <P>In the absence of such a security wall, it was the view of the Garda authorities that one additional garda would have been required on a 24 hour basis to patrol the area.  The cost of providing this additional garda on a 24 hour basis would be very substantial and would have had the effect of removing five gardaí from operational duty elsewhere on a year round basis.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works, acting on the advice of Garda Security built a specially constructed security wall at the Taoiseach's residence at a final cost of £12,000.</P>

      <Quest>the criteria applied by the Revenue Commissioners in determining the value of used cars presented at points of entry to this State for the purpose of calculating an appropriate level of duty; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11697/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>When a used car is registered in the State for the first time, with effect from 1 January 1993, the Finance Act, 1992, as amended, provides that vehicle registration tax (VRT) shall be charged in relation to the car on the basis of a percentage of its value and that value shall be taken to be the open market selling price (OMSP) of the car at the time of the charging of the tax thereon.  Determination of these values is based on an ongoing examination of OMSP's of cars in the State.  In addition the age, condition, mileage, etc. of each individual car are taken into account, as are any enhancements or extras that may be fitted.</P>
      <P>In addition to paying VRT at the time of registering the car, VAT-registered businesses purchasing used cars commercially from other EU member states must also account for VAT on such acquisitions in their VAT returns.  VAT in such cases becomes due on the date of issue of the invoice to the registered business and the VAT is assessed on the price charged for the car.  However, no VAT is payable on used cars purchased in other EU member states by private individuals for their own use where VAT has already been paid in the other member state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In cases where used cars are imported into the State from non-EU countries, both VAT and customs duties are payable at the time and place of their importation into the State, in addition <Col N="87" /> to VRT.  The criteria used to determine the value for customs purposes are set out in Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2913/92.  Under this regulation the primary method used to determine the value is the <i>Transaction Value,</i> i.e. the price actually paid for the used car when it is sold for export to Ireland.  An invoice is normally accepted by customs as evidence of the transaction value. Where the value cannot be determined using the transaction value method (for instance where no invoice is available, e.g. gifts) the value is determined by proceeding sequentially through the hierarchy of valuation methods provided in Regulation 2913/92.  The cost of transport and insurance of the used car to its place of introduction into the Customs Territory of the EU is added to the value determined by the transaction value method (or other method) to arrive at the value for the calculation of customs duty.  The value of the used car for the purpose of assessment of VAT in such cases is the value for customs purposes together with any taxes, duties and other charges levied (excluding VAT and VRT) on the goods.</P>

      <P>The channel <Col N="90" /> referred to is in fact in the Inny Catchment Drainage Scheme and not the Brosna as previously understood.  It was last maintained in 1990 and was scheduled for further cleaning works earlier this year.  A large portion of the channel has to be cleaned by hand as access is impossible by excavator.  However, high water levels in the area and pressure of other more urgent work elsewhere in the catchment prevented the works being carried out at that time.  It is now expected that the work will be undertaken during July and August next.</P>

    <P>In the case of domiciliary care allowance which is payable in respect of handicapped children between the ages of two and 16 years, it is the income of the child (e.g. compensation awards) rather than of the parents that is taken into account when assessing eligibility.</P>
    <P>Because of the very different nature of these schemes, for example the discretionary powers of the chief executive officers to issue medical cards to persons when income exceeds the guidelines, there are no plans at present to operate a single means assessment.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Developments in the <Col N="98" /> provision of services in recent years for persons with disabilities have been, in the main, community based.  The principle behind the development of the services has been to enable persons with disabilities to live as independent a life as possible within their own communities.</P>
      <P>The Report of the Review Group on Mental Handicap Services &mdash;<i>Needs and Abilities</i> endorsed the establishment of community based services which enable persons with mental handicap to live as independent a life as possible.  Most agencies would review, on an ongoing basis, the needs of the clients for whom they provide residential accommodation and where the opportunity arises, would try to enable individual clients to move to more community based accommodation.</P>
      <P>In the case of people with mental handicap currently accommodated in psychiatric hospitals there has been an ongoing programme to transfer them to more appropriate care settings.  A Nursing Adviser from my Department has been assisting the health boards to work out details of the transfers.  He is also advising on ways in which accommodation and programmes for those residing in the psychiatric hospitals can be improved.  Additional funding of £600,000 has been provided in 1995 to continue this programme.</P>
      <P>In the case of services for people with physical disabilities, the policy also is to provide the necessary community supports to enable people to be as self-reliant and independent as possible and to facilitate their integration in all aspects of community life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Review Group on Physical and Sensory Disability which will report to me shortly is expected to endorse this policy and provide a blueprint for the development of community based services in the future.  In addition I recently received a report from an Advisory Group on the provision of personal assistants to people with physical disabilities. However, even in advance of these reports, there have been significant developments in the provision of <Col N="99" /> supports to enable people with physical and sensory disabilities live in the community. Services such as home care attendants, the provision of independent living units of accommodation, and the expansion community based physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy have done much to promote independent living by people with physical and sensory disabilities.</P>
    <P>The policy document on the development of mental health services &mdash;<i>Planning for the Future</i>&mdash; which was published in 1984 and which has been accepted by successive Governments, advocated a shift in the delivery of services from a predominantly institutional to a community based approach in caring for and treating persons with mental illness.</P>
    <P>Significant progress has been made by health boards in developing appropriate community residential accommodation for such persons.  This progress was most recently highlighted in the statutory report of the Inspector of Mental Hospitals from the year ending 31 December, 1992, the most recent report published.  In the report, the inspector noted that community residential accommodation of a generally high quality continued to be provided in increasing numbers.</P>
    <P>These developments are evidence of the substantial progress being made in the reorganisation of our mental health services and a high priority is attached to continued progress being made in the coming years in the development of services for persons with mental illness.</P>

The main impetus for the review was the general level of dissatisfaction at the organisation of orthopaedic services in the region.  Waiting lists for elective orthopaedic surgery were growing because of the volume of trauma cases being dealt with in Lourdes Orthopaedic Hospital, Kilcreene.  It had been envisaged that Kilcreene would be solely an elective orthopaedic hospital but for a variety of reasons the situation had developed to one where approximately 60 per cent of the workload being performed there was trauma.  The review was undertaken to advise the South-Eastern Health Board on the organisation of orthopaedic services for the region in the most effective and efficient manner.</P>
      <P>The main recommendations were as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;that in the best interests of patient care, elective orthopaedics in the South-Eastern Health Board region should be centralised in Waterford Regional Hospital.  As the building programme is completed at Waterford Regional Hospital and as finances permit, the hospital should <Col N="102" /> be staffed appropriately to meet the regional role envisaged for it.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the best interests of patient care would also be served by all major orthopaedic trauma in the south-eastern region being transported directly to Waterford Regional Hospital where the patients would be managed by a team of orthopaedic surgeons to be based there.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the centralisation of both elective and major orthopaedic trauma at Waterford Regional Hospital would facilitate the development of a centre of excellence of orthopaedic practice in the south-east. The Review Group envisaged that the centre would be staffed by six orthopaedic surgeons.  A centralised orthopaedic service would provide a 24 hour service for major orthopaedic trauma producing a higher standard of care than existed previously.  A higher standard of orthopaedic surgery, and consequently patient care, would result in a larger throughput of patients requiring regular practice of a wider spectrum of orthopaedic skills.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that regular and frequent consultant orthopaedic input should be made to each of the three general hospitals (St. Luke's, Kilkenny, Wexford General Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel) by the consultant orthopaedic staff based at Waterford.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that a reorganisation of the ambulance service should take place.  This reorganisation should have, as a major objective, the minimisation of additional travel impositions on patients as well as the efficient transporting of trauma cases from the scene of accidents to the regional centre.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the implementation of the review group's recommendations required the designation of about <Col N="103" /> 60 beds for orthopaedic trauma from within the total bed complement of Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the transfer of elective orthopaedics from Kilcreene Hospital to Waterford would require the provision of additional facilities.  Pending the emergence of such facilities, it envisaged that all elective orthopaedics for the region would continue at Kilcreene Hospital.</P>
    <P>&mdash;that the medical benefits to patients and the economic advantages in centralising orthopaedic services outweigh the disadvantages.  The review group was convinced that the opportunity existed to dramatically improve the orthopaedic service for the people of the south-east by centralising both the trauma and elective services in Waterford Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>The report of the Review Group was discussed at the General Hospital Programme Committee of the South Eastern Health Board and subsequently at the board meeting on 11 February 1993, where a full discussion on all the issues took place.  The South-Eastern Health Board decided that the treatment of major orthopaedic trauma cases should be centralised at Waterford Regional Hospital.  In parallel with this, a decision was also taken that elective orthopaedic cases should continue to be performed at Kilcreene Hospital.</P>
    <P>The implementation of the decisions made by the South-Eastern Health Board in relation to the reorganisation was completed in late 1994 with the centralisation of major orthopaedic trauma cases at Waterford Regional Hospital.  I understand from the South-Eastern Health Board that the improvement in the service has resulted in patients seeking orthopaedic services within the region who would in the past have travelled outside, mainly to Dublin.</P>
    <P>I recently met the South-Eastern Health Board regarding Kilcreene <Col N="104" /> Orthopaedic Services and I am now awaiting proposals from the board for any further developments at Kilcreene Hospital.</P>
    <P>There are no plans in my Department to close Kilcreene and I am satisfied that the hospital will continue to discharge a very important role in the delivery of hospital services in the south-east region.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East)</i>: Hospital waste consists of two main components, domestic type waste and health care risk waste.  The domestic type waste is suitable for disposal by the landfill method.  The options for disposing of the health care risk waste are incineration to a high environmental standard or the use of the new technologies such as shredding and disinfection by microwaves, steam or chemicals.  The disposal arrangements in operation for any health agency are a matter for that agency in the first instance.</P>
      <P>The Department has proposed to the health agencies a disposal strategy for health care risk waste, based on the non-incineration technologies.  The pace of development in relation to the technology of waste disposal is accelerating and it would not be prudent to rule out definitively the use of any one technology at this stage.</P>

      <P>Specific EU requirements for waste water treatment do not apply to discharges below 2,000 population equivalent.  Discharges from septic tanks and other smaller sources are governed mainly by the general pollution control provisions of the Water Pollution Acts, 1977 and 1990.  It is for the local authorities concerned, subject to any guidance or direction from the Environmental Protection Agency, to instigate enforcement and-or remedial action in relation to any pollution or potential pollution from these sources.</P>
      <P>My Department has issued extensive guidance to local authorities and the public about the location, performance standards and management of septic tanks.  This advice includes a leaflet entitled <i>Private Water Supplies: Focus on Quality</i> as well as circular letters to local authorities on the regulation of septic tanks through the planning control system.</P>
      <P>A revised standard recommendation for new domestic septic tank systems, SR 6: 1991, prepared by the National Standards Authority for Ireland, specifies stringent site test requirements and minimum distances between percolation areas and groundwater sources so as to avoid polluting groundwaters.</P>

      <P>Functions have not been removed from local authorities under the Local Government Act, 1991.  While <Col N="117" /> no order has been made by the Government under that Act transferring functions from a Minister to local authorities, an order made by the Minister for the Environment under the Act in 1993 removed a range of central controls. The general competence provision of the Act removed the restrictive constraints of the <i>ultra vires</i> doctrine and greatly widened the discretion of local authorities to take action in the community interest.</P>
      <P>It has been the policy, in framing new legislation in the last few years, that appropriate functions should be devolved to local authorities and unnecessary controls removed.  Roads, road traffic and local government legislation in 1993 and 1994 provides accordingly in areas such as extinguishment of public rights of way, abandonment of public roads, speed limits, traffic management, parking controls, by-laws, libraries and provision of amenities. Local authorities have been given full responsibility for the various schemes outlined in the recently published document <i>Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead.</i>  Future legislation of my Department affecting local authorities will continue these trends, wherever possible.  In keeping with this approach, I made regulations last month which devolved to local authorities powers and functions in relation to the regulation of taxis and hackneys.</P>

Postgraduate students, like undergraduate students, are eligible for tuition fee and maintenance grants, subject to a means test, under the third level student support schemes.

      <P>I am aware of the concerns referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The objective of the early start pre-school programme, set up in October 1994, is to expose young children to an educational programme which will enhance their overall development and lay a foundation for successful attainment in future years.</P>
      <P>In establishing the early start pre-school programme, I was fully aware of the valuable role played by community groups in providing services for children of pre-school age.  It is not intended that the early start programme should in any way compete with or duplicate such initiatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The early start programme has a fundamentally different focus from other services provided in this area.  It has precise curricular objectives.  Each pre-school is an integral part of the primary school to which it is attached and operates within the general framework of the primary system.  Each pre-school employs fully qualified primary school <Col N="132" /> teachers and qualified child care assistants. Parental involvement in the activities of the pre-school is a fundamental part of this project.  In contrast, the services provided under local community initiatives tend to cater for a wider age group and have a more social and child care orientation than that of the pre-schools established under the early start programme.</P>

Co-operation is based on a work programme adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, and subsequently endorsed by the European Council, in accordance with the declaration, No. 31, on asylum of the Treaty on European Union.  That declaration states that the Council will consider, as a matter of priority, questions concerning member state's asylum policies with the aim of adopting common action to harmonise them in the light of the work programme and timetable contained in the report on asylum drawn up at the request of the European Council meeting in Luxembourg on 28 and 29 June 1991.  Co-operation in the area of asylum policy takes place with due regard to obligations on all member states flowing from the United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees, 1951, <Col N="134" /> the Geneva Convention as amended by the 1967 New York Protocol.</P>

At present, eligibility for appointment to the High Court requires 12 years practice as a barrister or ten years practice plus two years as a Circuit Court judge which is deemed to be practice as a barrister.</P>

      <P>The Government has decided to limit the growth in public expenditure with the aim of achieving a target of 2 per cent real growth in gross current supply services expenditure in 1996 the policy document as agreed in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> The Government has asked all Ministers to review existing policies and expenditures with a view to maximising the benefits to be obtained within the Government's spending target. My Department is currently engaged in such a review but it is not possible, at this stage, to identify particular activities or projects in my Department which may be affected by this review in advance of specific decisions by the Government.</P>

      <P>The information being sought in the solicitor's letter of 18 November 1994 refers to an incident which occurred in 1986. The Garda Authorities have informed my Department that they were asked directly by the firm of solicitors concerned to furnish this information in October 1994.  I understand that the Garda authorities' response was that the information was confidential and that consequently they could not accede to the request.</P>
      <P>The incident in question was fully investigated in 1986 and a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions who directed that there should be no prosecution.  During 1987 and 1989 and again in 1994 the solicitors acting for the individual attempted to get information which is confidential.  Some non-confidential material was supplied however.</P>
      <P>On receipt of the solicitor's letter last November, the Garda authorities were requested by my Department to furnish a report on the matter, which was received in mid-February.  The matter was referred to the Chief State Solicitor for legal advice on the 26th of this month and my Department will be in touch with the solicitors concerned as soon as that advice is to hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the papers were inadvertently mislaid in my Department hence the delay in sending them to the Chief State Solicitor.  The delay is <Col N="137" /> regretted but the Deputy can be assured that the matter will be followed up as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>The report to which the Deputy refers was based on a report commissioned by the Pensions Board. Having received the report from the consultants, the Pensions Board consulted on a confidential basis through the board members with the organisations they represent.</P>
      <P>After this process was completed they submitted a report on family law reform and pensions issues to me, which I forwarded to the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  Discussions are ongoing between the Pensions Board and officials of the Department of Equality and Law Reform with a view to addressing the issues raised in this report.</P>
      <P>The Pensions Board has among its functions, as set down in the Pensions Act, 1990, that of advising the Minister on matters relating to pensions generally. The report it submitted to me in relation to the Family Law Bill was in this context and it is not normal practice to publish such advices.  However, the 1994 annual report of the pensions board which was presented to me recently and made available to all Deputies and Senators, contains a detailed section which outlines the main conclusions contained in the report submitted to me.</P>

      <P>Means tests applied to social assistance payments fall into three broad categories.  These are: unemployment assistance, pre-retirement allowance and supplementary welfare allowance; old age (non-contributory) pension, blind person's pension and carer's allowance; widow's and orphan's (non-contributory) pension, deserted wife's allowance, lone parent's allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance.</P>
      <P>The variations between the three means tests occur in the treatment of capital and income from employment, where different levels of disregards and rates of assessment are applied across the various schemes.  In addition, claimants of unemployment assistance living with their parents are assessed with the value of board and lodgings.</P>
      <P>The introduction of a single means test is under review within my Department, with a view to introducing elements of standardisation where possible. However, the introduction of a single means test for all social welfare recipients could give rise to significant costs, particularly if implemented on the basis that existing recipients would not suffer any reduction in their payments. Therefore any changes to the existing arrangements must be considered in the light of budgetary considerations.</P>
      <P>On a more general level, the introduction of greater simplicity in the whole area of means assessments is currently under review by an interdepartmental committee set up by the Government to develop a framework to provide an integrated approach to the administration, delivery and management of statutory income support services.</P>

      <P>The increase in the old age non-contributory pension amounts to £43.50 for the 29 week period from 16 June to the end of the year.  This is equivalent to approximately 22p per day for the 199 days in the period.  An increase of £41.40 was paid for the shorter period of 23 weeks in 1994, which was equivalent to 26.5p per day.</P>
      <P>Recipients of the old age non-contributory pension may also benefit from other measures introduced in this year's budget: &mdash; the extension of the free television licence to cover the cost of a colour licence; &mdash; the extension of the free travel to cover travel in Northern Ireland; &mdash; the relaxing of the means limit for qualifying for free fuel allowances; &mdash; the provision of a companion pass to all those being cared for by a recipient of a carer's allowance; &mdash; a substantial increase in the rates of child benefit for those pensioners with child dependants &mdash; approx. 1,400 pensioners.</P>

      <P>Bord Fáilte undertakes two general surveys of visitors to Ireland. The annual Survey of Travellers collects information on route of entry, purpose of visit, accommodation usage, regions visited, expenditure etc.  The Visitor Attitude Survey is conducted every three to five years and assesses visitors' impressions of Ireland and the Irish tourism product.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Visitor Attitude Survey was most recently conducted in 1993.  The main findings included the following: the <Col N="148" /> quality of sightseeing and scenery available in Ireland continued to be the most important visitor motivation, cited by 72 per cent of respondents; the key advantage distinguishing Ireland from similar destinations was the friendliness and hospitality of its people; the key disadvantages were poor weather followed by road quality and access costs; the majority expressed themselves happy with their visit with only 5 per cent claiming that it did not live up to expectations: 80 per cent would definitely recommend a holiday in Ireland to a friend and 90 per cent said that they would be very interested in returning to Ireland in the future.  In the most recent survey about 5 per cent of visitors mentioned litter as an irritant.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1993 the Visitor Attitudes Survey was previously conducted in 1983 and 1988.  The main findings in relation to visitors' impressions have not changed significantly over the years. Some changes include: 80 per cent in 1993 would recommend Ireland to a friend as opposed to 74 per cent in 1988 and dissatisfaction with prices fell from 16 per cent in 1988 to 6 per cent in 1993.</P>

      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism 1989-93 set out strategic targets for the development of Irish tourism in relation to foreign exchange earnings, overseas visitor numbers and tourism-related jobs to be created, over the five-year lifetime of <Col N="149" /> the programme.  The actual results achieved, as compared with the targets set, at the end of 1993 are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>As regards the period from 1994 onwards, the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 sets out strategic targets for the lifetime of the programme, as opposed to annual targets. Its principal objectives are to achieve a foreign earnings target of £2,250 million per annum and to create an additional 35,000 jobs by 1999.  Expectations are that these targets will be fully realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The means used to monitor and <Col N="150" /> review tourism results include surveys of tourists and tourist operators together with statistics compiled by the Central Statistics Office and Bord Fáilte.  In addition, the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 identifies a range of economic, activity, quality, physical and financial indicators to help assess the performance of the programme.</P>

      <P>Following the approval in principle of the board of FÁS for an apprenticeship in hairdressing, FÁS, in collaboration with subject matter expects from the industry itself, has developed a draft curriculum for the occupation.</P>
      <P>The mode of delivery of this curriculum, involving both on and off-the-job training and assessment, and the most appropriate apprenticeship model are the subjects of on-going consultation within the Hairdressing Apprenticeship Review Group.  This group is representative of the Irish Hairdressers' Federation, the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Department of Education and FÁS.  The group is also considering the likely costs of the apprenticeship and how these are to be funded. When proposals covering these complex issues are agreed, a wider process of consultation with the industry at large may be necessary, due to the fragmented nature of the industry itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="153" /> It is the intention that FÁS will organise a pilot of the hairdressing apprenticeship, subject to agreement being reached on the various issues involved.</P>

      <P>The Competition Act, 1991, prohibits anti-competitive practices and the abuse of a dominant position.  The Act applies to undertakings, undertaking being defined as &ldquo;a person being an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged for gain in the production, supply or distribution of goods or the provision of a service&rdquo;.  At present the Act is enforced primarily by way of private civil actions in the courts between disputing parties.</P>
      <P>Section 4 of the Competition Act prohibits and makes void all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade in any goods or services in the State or in any part of the State.  Section 5 prohibits any abuse of a dominant position.</P>
      <P>Section 6 provides that any person aggrieved in consequence of anti-competitive activity has a right of action in the courts for relief, by way of injunction or declaration and damages, including exemplary damages.  The Minister has a similar right of action but the reliefs available to the Minister are restricted to an injunction or declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Act illustrates examples of what may be prohibited, it is ultimately for the courts to decide what constitutes <Col N="154" /> a breach of the law in any case brought before them.</P>
    <P>Competition law is a complex matter involving detailed legal and economic arguments.  It would not be possible for a court of law to decide on the basis of the very brief details supplied in the Deputy's question whether the matter referred to was in breach of the Competition Act, 1991.  As the Minister, I have no function in adjudicating whether this, or any other practice, is in breach of competition law.  This is a matter entirely for the courts to decide.</P>
    <P>I would add, however, that the Competition Act, 1991, applies equally to firms in the public and private sectors. It is the responsibility of individual firms to ensure that their commercial activities are in compliance with competition law.  In this respect I believe that firms in the public sector have a special responsibility, given the unique position they hold in their respective areas.</P>
    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to the Competition (Amendment) Bill, 1994, which proposes to give the Competition Authority powers to investigate anti-competitive activity, either on its own initiative or as a result of third party complaints, including the power to take court actions where necessary.  In line with the policy agreement for Government I am committed to strengthening the enforcement of competition by giving the Competition Authority powers of enforcement and by enabling the courts to impose stiff fines on those found to be engaging in unfair competition. I intend to seek to have the Bill enacted as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I assume the question relates to the Teagasc food centres. A sum of £41.044 million was provided for institutional food research in the National Plan under Measure 3 in the food sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Industrial Development. These funds are being allocated by my Department on the basis of recommendations made by the NonCommissioned Food Research Committee. This committee has appropriate industry and institutional representation.</P>
      <P>The research institutions submit research proposals for funding which are examined by the committee.  Over £6 million has been approved to date of which over £4 million is in respect of projects submitted by the Teagasc food centres.  The first of these projects commenced early in 1994.</P>
      <P>I have no specific information regarding the number of people employed since most of those involved were already employed by Teagasc and are assigned to a number of projects at any one time.  The question of Teagasc staffing for food research has been under consideration for some time and a number of posts have already been sanctioned. Sanction for further posts has to be considered in the context of the recent Government decision on recruitment in the public service.</P>

The Deputy should be aware that the identification of fisheries and fishing rights vested or reserved to the Land Commission over all of County Mayo constitutes an enormous task which, given the competing demands on the limited resources available, will take a considerable period of time.  In view of this the Deputy may, perhaps, wish to be more specific about the area of interest to him.  Pending further communication from the Deputy arrangements will be made for commencement of work on the compilation of the information requested.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 156, 157, 158 and 168 together:</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the Disadvantaged Areas Appeals Panel on extension of new areas were submitted to the EU Commission in November 1993, and their reclassification proposals were submitted in October 1994.  Both sets of recommendations were submitted without alteration.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that a final decision on extension of disadvantaged areas is not expected to be taken by the Council of Agricultural Ministers until towards the end of 1995, and that a review of the headage schemes is envisaged in the light of the results of the evaluation study on the schemes which is currently under way, it is not envisaged that there will be any change in the areas to which the scheme applies in 1995.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that areas included in an extension and areas reclassified to more severely handicapped status, arising from the Government's submissions to the Commission, will be included in the schemes from 1996 onwards.</P>
      <P>The issue of the third tier of disadvantaged areas will also be dealt with in the context of the overall review of the schemes, taking account of the resources available under the Structural Funds.</P>

      <P>Arrangements to introduce the new cattle identification system required by Council Directive 92/102/EEC on the identification and registration of animals are being finalised and should be in place shortly. To ensure a smooth transfer between the existing and new identification schemes, two new tags will be used alongside the existing tag inserted for disease eradication purposes as a transitional measure.  The question of payment for this new system of cattle identification is still under consideration.</P>

      <Quest>if he will continue paying forestry grants and premiums to non-farmers and others, some of whom are not even resident in this country or in the European Union in view of the fact that the accompanying measures in CAP reform were designed to assist farmers to diversify and to compensate them for restrictions on other commodity areas.</Quest>

      <P>Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2080/92 which instituted the current European Union aid scheme for forestry measures in agriculture specifically provides that where the afforestation of agricultural land is involved aid in the form of both grants and premiums may be given to farmers and to any other private-law, natural or legal person.  To restrict the scheme in its application in Ireland in the manner implied by the Deputy would be in conflict with the regulation. I would have to say that the current scheme is a success in so far as its attractions for farmers are concerned, as borne out by the fact that almost 80 per cent of planting on privately-owned land is being undertaken by farmers.  I am committed to encouraging the development of forestry as an alternative farm enterprise and I am pleased that a growing number of Irish farmers are availing of what is a most attractive asset and income option.  I will continue to take and support measures to achieve further success in this area.</P>

      <P>I regret that, due to an administrative oversight, a final reply did not issue to the Deputy's representations in this case.  However, the claim for compensation had been addressed in direct correspondence between the person concerned and an official of my Department.</P>
      <P>My Department did not fail to inform the person concerned that he could apply for a permit to move animals; indeed, the restriction notice served on 21 April, 1994 states that permits could be applied for.  No application for permits was made.  I have no comment to make on the opinion of a Teagasc adviser.</P>
      <P>The restriction was withdrawn as soon as possible after the results of analysis came to hand.  There is no statutory provision for the award of compensation. In these circumstances, no claim for compensation can be entertained.</P>

      <P>Telecom Éireann policy nationwide is that customers are entitled to call their own and contiguous charge groups at the local call rate.</P>
      <P>Due to technical limitations in older exchanges, Monaghan customers are able to access further charge groups in Northern Ireland, which are not contiguous, at the local call rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The (04) telephone directory normally records what the customers are entitled to but, due to an error, the 1994 directory showed the wider area.  The 1995 directory corrected the error. There has been no change in what customers can actually do at local call rates. <Col N="181" /> Such change is not, however, ruled out when relevant exchanges are modernised.</P>

      <Quest>in relation to MMDS broadcasting, if his attention has been drawn to plans by Suir-Nore Relays to encrypt all channels, including those received free by satellite, they provide to their customers and in so doing to impose an extra cost on subscribers who are already paying substantial sums for service; his views on whether this represents an abuse of a monopoly position; the action, if any, he will take to rectify this matter; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the proposal referred to.  It is my understanding that encoding of channels will not result in an increase in Suir Nore's basic MMDS charge, which is one of the lowest in the country.  Encoding of channels is a standard practice of MMDS companies, and has the advantages both of reducing interference to other frequency users and of reducing the risk of illegal theft of signal, thus helping to keep costs and prices down. I understand that a decoder box will become necessary, however, and that there is a refundable damage deposit of £25 in each case.  I understand also that the majority of Suir Nore's MMDS customers already have such decoders and that the proposal will impact only on those who do not.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot speak with authority on any question of abuse of a monopoly position, that would be primarily a function of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.</P>

      <P>A programme manager, Mr. Conor Barry, a special adviser, Ms Angela O'Donnell, a personal secretary, Ms Barbara Culleton, and a personal assistant, Ms Deirdre McDevitt, have been designated, pending finalisation of a contract of employment in each case.</P>
      <P>The present rate of pay for each appointment is as follows: Programme Manager, £35,400 per annum; Special Adviser, £8,813 per annum; Personal Secretary, £8,813 per annum; Personal Assistant, £13,142.</P>
      <P>These remuneration costs are funded jointly by the Departments of Defence and the Marine in recognition of my dual role.</P>
      <P>There have been no such appointments made by the Minister of State at the Department of Defence.</P>
      <P>Price Waterhouse, management consultants, were employed as facilitators for the Strategic Management Initiative in the Department during 1994.  Total expenses were approximately £16,500 of which 50 per cent was reimbursed by the Department of Finance.  The initiative is still under way and Price Waterhouse are being retained to the current year.  It is too early to quantify expenditure for 1995, but it is unlikely to exceed the 1994 figure.</P>
      <P>In addition, the firm Brindley Advertising Ltd. has been engaged since 1992 for the purpose of developing awareness of the &ldquo;Towards 2000&rdquo; initiative in Civil Defence.  Projected expenditure for 1995 is £5,000.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has for the development of fishing facilities on the country's rivers and lakes; if he will confirm the availability of funds to develop the rivers Glyde and Dee in County Louth; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Responsibility for the development of fishing facilities on our rivers and lakes, among other matters, is vested in the Central and seven Regional Fisheries Boards which are independent bodies established under the Fisheries Acts.  In particular, the development of the rivers Glyde and Dee is a matter for the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board.</P>
      <P>The Deputy may wish to be aware, however, that the development of the tourism angling potential of our rivers and lakes is the primary objective of the Tourism Angling Measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism.  This measure, which is administered by the Central Fisheries Board, provides for a comprehensive investment programme in the tourism angling product totalling almost £19 million over the six year period 1994 to 1999.  The first tranche of 1995 projects was announced in April and includes an investment of £15,000 in a pre-development survey of the River Dee.  The River Dee development project submitted by the Eastern Regional Fisheries Board will be assessed in light of this survey.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the importance of salmon farming to the west, the reason his Department intends to publish a supplementary report to the 1993 Sea Trout Working Group Report without adequately noting that the statistical analysis therein has already been independently analysed by a leading authority on fisheries statistics and was shown to be erroneous and that field experiments conducted during 1994 by independent experts whose work was subsequently recognised in leading international scientific journals also shows the report to be in error.</Quest>

      <P>The supplement to the 1993 Report of the Sea Trout Working Group is <Col N="188" /> included by way of an appendix to the Report of the Sea Trout Working Group on the 1994 research effort, which has just been published.  The group comprises leading scientists from the Department's Fishery Research Centre, the Salmon Research Agency, UCC, UCD and TCD as well as specialist consultants.  Scientists who undertook the field trials referred to by the Deputy presented their findings to the Working Group.  These, together with the other latest available data and analyses, were evaluated and taken into account as part of the group's comprehensive assessment of the 1994 research programme.</P>
      <P>The Introduction to the Report states that the supplementary report should be considered only in conjunction with the contents of the 1994 report which incorporates new, amended and improved analysis.  The report has been referred for consideration to the Sea Trout Monitoring and Advisory Group.  The national programme of research into all aspects of the complex sea trout problem is continuing, together with the programmes of management, conservation and rehabilitation recommended by the Sea Trout Task Force.</P>
