On each day the House has sat during the past two weeks we have sought to get the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to make a report to it but he has declined to do so until a date which suits him.  He has declined also to give us, before it is debated in the House, the 125 page report prepared in his Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>For those who are fearful about the introduction of divorce here, an examination of the position in the North would offer substantial reassurance.  Divorce on a scale similar to the British model has been available since 1978.  Approximately 2,300 divorces are granted per annum. Almost 3,000 applications for the equivalent of a judicial separation order are made each year and this compares with the figure of 4,000 barring orders and <Col N="522" /> 3,000 applications for judicial separation in the Republic.</P>
      <P>The existence of divorce on the British model in Northern Ireland, and its availability there, has not destabilised northern society.  As I said the last day, if one were to look at those dioceses which straddle the Border, North and South, one would not find any great difference in marriage breakdown between, say, Dundalk and Armagh which are in the same diocese.  When looking at examples of the experience of divorce in other countries we should carefully examine the position in those jurisdictions which have a cultural background and religious traditions similar to ours.  In countries like Austria and Portugal which have substantial Catholic populations, and where divorce has been available for a period, it has not undermined the institution of marriage. Those countries suffer from problems in relation to marriage breakdown as do all modern societies.</P>
      <P>The existence of the right to remarry can only undermine existing marriages if the only basis for those marriages is their legal status.  Marriages take place and continue primarily because of the original consent of the parties involved and their continued consent and commitment. Couples who marry choose to give that consent and commitment a legal reality; the withdrawal of consent to the marriage is what brings it to an end.  The withdrawal of consent may be by one or both parties &mdash; withdrawal of consent by one in itself ends the marriage. That is an unfortunate reality. The removal of the legal status of the marriage, whether by way of judicial separation or divorce, is simply a recognition that the marriage has ended; it does not bring about the end of the marriage. An individual may be divorced against his or her will &mdash; this is true; but it is no different from the present situation where an individual may be separated against his or her will; marriages may be annulled against the wishes of one party.  Will the proponents of this argument also say that we must have no more annulments for this reason?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="523" /> A new argument was introduced to the debate recently in that it has been suggested that the family of the first marriage will effectively be downgraded in favour of the second family.  Children &mdash; whether born within a first or subsequent marriage or outside marriage &mdash; all have the same rights to be maintained by their parents and to succeed to their parents' property.  The parents have the same duties towards them. Divorces will be granted, as are legal separations at present, only after arrangements have been made for the maintenance and support of the first spouse and children.</P>
    <P>This requirement is of such significance that it is being written into the Constitution.  Those people who are genuinely concerned about the first family and children need to look at the wording of the amendment which will put into constitutional form considerations for the position of the first spouse and children.  There is no doubt that it is difficult to support two families but it is wrong to suggest that the first family will be in an inferior position relative to the second.  This argument is made by people who have traditionally supported the concept of annulment as a means of dealing with problem marriages. The process of an annulment, where it can be declared that the parents were never married or that one or other parent is at fault, is potentially far more psychologically damaging than the process of judicial separation and divorce which, I hope, will be preceded by mediation and counselling.</P>
    <P>The picture of the first wife and children being abandoned in penury is not a fair picture of the outcome of divorce. The may see a reduction in their standard of living because of the breakdown of the marriage and the need to establish two households &mdash; but this is already happening without divorce.  All the information on poverty in Ireland and elsewhere suggests that women and children suffer disproportionately from poverty.  This has always been the case and the absence of divorce legislation in <Col N="524" /> Ireland has not made the situation of Irish women and children any better. What impoverishes women and children is the dependency status of many women &mdash; whether that dependency is on a husband or ex-husband or on the State.  Tackling the feminisation of poverty is a major issue for all of us but let us not confuse it with the issue of the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>I am a little disturbed by the concentration in the debate on the effects of divorce on women.  There seems to be an underlying but unstated assumption that women are totally unable to cope with the vicissitudes of life, that they need protection by men and that all the protection is best delivered by refusing to recognise that a marriage can come to an end.  These simplistic assumptions serve only to promote a limiting and inflexible view of women's role in society and of their capacity to assert their own rights and entitlements.  The analysis also wrongly suggests that the absence of divorce guarantees women protection from poverty, violence and abuse.  It manifestly does not.</P>
    <P>Ideally we would all like to see children growing up in a stable loving family but, unfortunately, this is not always possible.  I would like to be able to claim that we in Ireland have a better record than others in cherishing our children but, unfortunately, it is simply not true. The absence of divorce has not meant that all our children grow up in stable families, that our children are free from abuse of all kinds, that they are guaranteed a happy childhood.  Requiring their parents to stay legally married to each other, in spite of the breakdown of their relationship, does nothing for children. There is no doubt that we need to concentrate further attention on children in marriage breakdown; denying their parents the right to remarry does not improve the position of the children.</P>
    <P>I accept that many of the arguments put forward by the people opposed to divorce are reasonable, with which other reasonable people can deal and address in an appropriate way. However, I resent the suggestion that <Col N="525" /> those of us who favour the introduction of civil divorce, do not have a moral vision or, if we do, it is of questionable value.  I and my party certainly have a vision of the kind of society we want.  It is a tolerant society where people's relationships with each other are governed by the rule of law, equality of treatment and respect for the views of others.  I stand by that vision of a pluralist inclusive society and I deny any suggestion that it is somehow or other an inferior vision for Ireland today or at any time.</P>
    <P>Many of our laws exist because people, in spite of their best intentions, often fail to live up to their own and society's highest expectations.  We have laws which deal with the rights and duties of people in all sorts of circumstances where failure occurs &mdash; when their businesses fail; when they fail to deal honestly with other people etc.  We have extensive legislation dealing with people's rights and duties within marriage towards their children and when their marriages fail.</P>
    <P>The divorce referendum is about the right to remarry.  The Government has put a range of legislation in place which deals with marriage breakdown.  This legislation outlines the rights of spouses and children and deals with maintenance and property, custody and guardianship of children.  The Government cannot legislate happy marriages into existence.  If it could, obviously this Government and every other Government would try to so so.  It offers support structures for marriage and is now dealing with the consequences of broken marriages.  Providing for divorce is the last piece of the legislative jigsaw. Divorce is the formal recognition of the end of the marriage and the establishment of the right to marry again.</P>
    <P>As my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, has said on a number of occasions, the language of winning is not appropriate to this debate.  I am confident that the people will vote to allow the right to remarry.  I do not expect that those who favour the introduction of <Col N="526" /> divorce will rejoice at its existence <i>per se</i>, rather that they will celebrate the tolerance and compassion shown by the electorate; they will celebrate the choice in favour of a pluralist society and the recognition of minority rights that its introduction entails.</P>
    <P>During my recent visit to Belfast when I met a wide range of family lawyers and the organisations dealing with marriage breakdown in the North, both Catholic and Protestant, I was struck by the comparisons one could make between the situation in relation to marriage breakdown, North and South of the Border.  Unfortunately, both societies are experiencing relatively high rates of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>In the North there is a final legal remedy which allows people the right to remarry if they so choose.  That right has existed for a considerable period and there is no evidence that it destabilises marriage or the commitment of people of both traditions in the North to marriage. I am confident that the introduction of the right to remarry will similarly allow people here who wish to regulate their relationships, to enter into second marriages if that is their wish.  Equally those who from conviction or otherwise do not wish to opt for that will not find the status of their marriages in any way affected.  I would urge generosity and compassion on the part of the electorate when they go to the polls in November.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party is supporting the passage of this Bill, but it is no secret that not every member of my party will vote or campaign for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the referendum. This is true of every other political party in the Dáil.  Neither is there unanimity in most families in Ireland on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having been through many elections and controversies, one would think I would have been hardened against &ldquo;voter surprise&rdquo;, but I was not the only seasoned politician who was amazed at the attitude of many voters in 1986. Friends who I expected to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; were of the opposing view whereas <Col N="527" /> others, including persons who were most conservative in other areas of social policy, voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  So it will be in November 1995.  This is one issue on which individuals will make up their own minds, taking their consciences, prejudices, social values, personal experience and many other factors into account.</P>
    <P>Some commentators are making an issue of the fact that some political parties are not canvassing on the doorstep for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  It will make no difference whether political activists stand on every doorstep and beg even their own die-hard supporters; the most committed party activist will make an individual decision on this occasion.</P>
    <P>I voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in 1986 and will do so again on 24 November.  If I can persuade any voters to do likewise I will gladly do so, but I respect the views of party colleagues, personal friends and voters who think otherwise and who will campaign against the proposal.</P>
    <P>I take issue with the campaign to date of the organised anti-divorce campaign. I have identified its secret theme &mdash; if you cannot convince, confuse.  The last time around those who were against the introduction of the right to remarry set out to convince, and they had supporting evidence.  There were huge gaps in the corpus of law which could well have left individuals, families and first spouses in severe difficulties.  The Oireachtas has addressed those gaps and we are now operating in a very different context.  The people who are against divorce cannot now point to those dangers.  Instead, they are like those Indian icons with six hands pointing in six different directions telling us to be frightened of this, that or the other.  However, the people are not shaking in their shoes, in spite of those warning fingers.  They are staying remarkably calm, and there is no panic. The reason is the basic, solid, commonsense of the people.  They analyse even the most terrifying claims and come to a realistic conclusion about them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="528" /> It is claimed that divorce legislation will move us one step further down the road to a secular society.  Would anybody be scared to live in a secular society?  The dictionary definition of a secular society includes words like &ldquo;civil&rdquo; and &ldquo;lay&rdquo;.  I do not know about the people involved in the anti-divorce campaign, but I have no problem living in a civil society, and I am not scared by any of the other synonyms like &ldquo;earthly&rdquo;.  When someone outside the jurisdiction describes Ireland as being &ldquo;run&rdquo; by the clergy or by the Catholic Church, modern Ireland shrugs and laughs because it is simply not true.  We live in a modern secular society with a strong traditional set of beliefs and an increasing tolerance of beliefs which differ from our own.  It is astonishing that anybody believes we should roll that back.</P>
    <P>There is no threat to the role of the Catholic Church in passing a law to allow remarriage after a lengthy separation following the breakdown of a first marriage.  The church operates effectively and influentially in countless countries where divorce has existed for a long time.  I said at the time of the defeat of the 1986 proposal that the Catholic Church played little or no role in influencing voters in that referendum. Subsequent to the defeat in 1986, many commentators wrote about the &ldquo;key influence&rdquo; of the Catholic Church in defeating the proposal.  This was simply not correct, and I stated so at the time.</P>
    <P>Some commentators on this issue are as guilty as those they accuse.  Many are caught in a time warp of their own prejudice reflecting the Ireland of the 1940s and 1950s.  Their view is one typically believed by the Dublin middle classes and reflected constantly in certain media outpourings.  If the Irish people answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to this referendum the floodgates will not open, although it is often claimed that this is what will happen if we introduce certain legislation. They were supposed to open when we changed the laws on homosexuality. I have lived through several <Col N="529" /> decades of predictions about floodgates opening and it has never happened.</P>
    <P>Some floodgates have certainly opened.  We are experiencing a wave of pregnancies outside of marriage, and many of the women involved are very young.  That is a fact, not a dire prophecy and it carries negative implications. If the anti-divorce campaign is committed to the future of the nuclear family, why do not people like William Binchy and Nora Bennis devote their considerable skills and commitment to preventing teen pregnancies?  At this end of the continuum, young people are living together without benefit of church or State approval; babies are being born to single mothers and the institution of marriage is being frayed visibly and measurably.  However, the people who say that marriage must be protected are not working in the area where the institution is already being eroded.  They are putting all their energies into the divorce issue.  They would remind one of the man who dropped his keys on the street who, when someone, seeing him searching the ground under a lamp post asked if that was where he had dropped them, said &ldquo;I dropped them over there, but the light is better here&rdquo;.  When the anti-divorce campaign spread confusion, it does it with slogans that have little substance but carry a scary tune.  It is like the minor key music which starts when the villain appears in a movie.  It sets out to get a shiver going up the spine of the nation by telling the people that the minute divorce is on the Statute Book every marriage will become temporary and conditional.</P>
    <P>That is such tripe, it is difficult to find a parallel but it is like saying the minute someone takes out car insurance he is dying to crash his car and make bits of himself.  I have yet to meet a driver who was affected in that way by taking out car insurance and I have yet to encounter a good, loving, supportive marriage that could be made temporary by the introduction of divorce law.  It is insulting to suggest that the structure, the essence, the reality of a relationship could be changed absolutely by the <Col N="530" /> introduction of a new law.  It is also very silly.  The change in the law regarding homosexuality did not make hetorosexual relationships unstable.  Nobody would even suggest that.  Why would the introduction of law on remarriage make a happy marriage suddenly disintegrate? Nobody elects any of us to this House to create legislation built on fiction.  It is fiction to suggest that divorce on the Statute Book will rock every good marriage in the country &mdash; that is pure fiction, comic book stuff.</P>
    <P>We are elected to enact legislation that is responsive and realistic; legislation that meets the real needs of real people not the specifications of any group who have a notional Ireland in its head and wants us all to march into that notional Ireland in the way the children marched into the mountain when the Pied Piper of Hamelin played his tune.</P>
    <P>In the real world where I live, marriages break up.  Couples who believe in marriage and who married each other in high hopes and joyful expectations may experience marriage breakdown.  They do not have contempt for marriage or the family and have no desire to inflict further suffering on anybody.  They want to learn from their failures and commit themselves to a solid second relationship.  They believe in marriage and the family to the extent that they want to make a public affirmation of their second relationship, to enter a State recognised formal commitment. There is nothing stopping them having a second relationship right now.  Nobody can stop them living together.  However, they take the relationship and marriage seriously.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to assume that everybody who wants a divorce is shallow, unfaithful, trivial, uncommitted and uncaring about their children.  Now there are many of those people around but they are not usually knocking on the doors to get married again or even married the first time.  It is people who have suffered a marriage breakdown, yet have faith and belief in the structure of marriage who want the right to remarry; people who have made mistakes and <Col N="531" /> learned from them.  People who have a love for children want to make sure that children from their second relationship have the same, not better, supports as the children from their first marriage.  I have made no secret of the fact that I am among that group, although personal experience is not the reason I support this move.  I support it because I believe it is my job as a responsible legislator to provide the framework to allow people to live decently and responsibly within a changing Ireland and to protect children in the process.  I will, therefore, make only one personal comment.  It is infinitely sad and tawdry that anti-divorce people seem to believe that marriages and families should be buttressed by surrounding them with the wreckage of other people's marriages rather than letting those other people embark on a new commitment.  I know a great many happily married people but I do not know many people who would feel better about their marriage because someone else is not allowed to remarry.  It is a perverse and pointless suggestion and I am confident the electorate will reject it.</P>

      <P>That was a splendid speech by Deputy McCreevy, it was very well put.  Marriage breakdown is a reality in Ireland and it is time our laws and Constitution recognise the realities and not the legal fiction.  It is time that people who are happily married extended the right to those whose marriages are long over to formally end their marriage, if that is their choice.  It it time that the State should give the opportunity to separated people who wish to have a second change in a way <Col N="532" /> that is given legal recognition and legal protection.  Anyone can make a mistake.</P>
      <P>I married at the age of 21 and I could easily have walked into a relationship that did not work out.  I would like to think that I &mdash; and my husband &mdash; would have a second chance if it did not work out.  No one who walks up the aisle in hope knows how the interplay of two personalities will work out over many years.  Most people hope it will be forever and are willing to work at it being forever and that is the situation for most people who get married in this State.  However, it does not work out in some cases.  It is about time we started to bury the hypocrisy and recognise the reality &mdash; to call someone married who has not lived with a partner for 20 years is not to recognise the reality of that situation. I think we have come a long way as a society since 1986 and we are more willing to recognise realities.  I hope we will recognise realities on 24 November. We no longer pretend that marriage breakdown or child abuse does not happen in holy Ireland.  We have evidence all around us that these things are part and parcel of the way we are.  I hope we have less patience with legal fictions.</P>
      <P>We have come a long way since 1986 in the very substantial corpus of legislation that has been put in place.  There is protection for people affected by marriage breakdown.  Whether people are married, separated or divorced our laws provide there are continuing obligations to dependent spouses and children.  One cannot divorce one's children but if one divorces one's spouse we are recognising that the relationship as a two-way bond no longer exists.  However, the financial dependencies survive beyond the divorce and under our Constitution it will be a condition of getting a divorce that appropriate financial provisions will be put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Giving formal recognition to marriage breakdown does not cause breakdown. However, it does provide an important framework where couples can resolve what part of their marriage obligations are over and what remain because the relationship is over.  Too <Col N="533" /> often people who separate simply walk away from these issues and there is not any ending.  I do not know how many times I have dealt in my clinics with women who have been left on their own and because there has not been a formal procedure none of the issues such as caring for the children or financial support has been dealt with.  In a situation where people are in a position to formalise the end of a marriage and not just the halfway house of legal separation, we may well find many more couples who will sit down together with the assistance of the family mediation service and resolve those issues and face up to them rather than divorce Irish style which we have enjoyed for so many years where one partner walks away and the loose ends are not addressed.</P>
    <P>One of the most sinister and subversive arguments being put forward by the anti-divorce campaign is that divorce will damage existing marriages.  I think they are trying to appeal in some subtle way to the insecurities among people who are happily married and do not envisage divorce for themselves to deny what should be a civil right.  Marriage is a voluntary relationship between a couple and I do not think its existence is threatened by what happens to other couples and the chance we give to other people to embark on a second relationship.</P>
    <P>We are not talking about easy divorce. We are talking about divorce to be introduced only when all the obligations have been fulfilled and when there is no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation.</P>
    <P>Another argument being used by the anti-divorce lobby is that people will be divorced against their will.  They are fingering the notion of no-fault divorce. I do not believe William Binchy, Nora Bennis or others supporting the anti-divorce campaign want to see fault divorce introduced either, they are against divorce.  It is a much more civilised arrangement for people who continue to have a relationship with one another as the mutual parents of their children to <Col N="534" /> agree on a divorce through mediation and in harmony rather than on the basis of trading accusations and faults against each other.</P>
    <P>In regard to the argument that people may be divorced against their will, what type of a relationship would continue if it was simply one sided?  It cannot be a case of one person being married and the other not.  Marriage, by definition, is something that is mutual and in circumstances in which the partners have been separated for a long time and the courts find that there is no reasonable prospect of a reconciliation, it flies in the face of reality to say such a marriage exists in any way other than on paper.  Divorce is the only honest way to face up to such a reality.</P>
    <P>The final scare tactic being used by the anti-divorce lobby is that it will cost £350 million in social welfare payments. That is nonsense and those promulgating that are aware of it, but it makes a nice sound bite for radio chat shows. Our social welfare system already supports the majority of lone parent families &mdash; whether they are alone as a result of separation, divorce or for other reasons &mdash; where there is no bread winner or adequate income to support the family.  The legal labelling of a separation as a divorce will not change that reality and that is why the cost of divorce in terms of social welfare will be a modest £1 million after five years, a small price to pay.  The cost in the first year will be £200,000.</P>
    <P>It is important that people who become divorced now or in the future know that they will continue to qualify for widow's and other pensions.  The 18 Bills introduced, including the Family Law Bill, provide for sharing occupational pensions for fair provision in regard to the family home.  Such provisions will apply in the case of a judicial separation or a decree of divorce.  The legal effect of divorce will simply allow the partners to enter a second marriage which may be formalised and viewed with respect.</P>
    <P>The introduction of divorce is about choice, not about compulsion.  We must <Col N="535" /> acknowledge that it is a civil right of those who are separated to have their positions legalised.  We cannot continue to perpetuate legal fictions in the name of protecting marriage.  Such legal fictions do not have a bearing on happy marriages, but their preservations does a disservice and an injustice to those who are separated and is in contravention of their civil rights.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly)</i>: I welcome the opportunity to speak.  The debate that has taken place since last week has been measured and reasoned and I will continue in that vein.</P>
      <P>I am speaking as one who recently made a commitment to another person through marriage.  The efforts necessary to live up to that commitment are not buttressed, supported or aided to any degree by denying others whose relationships have failed, the right to legally separate and to have a second chance in life.  Anyone who propagates that theory is propagating a myth.  It does a great disservce to the notion of marriage, to commitment and to healthy human relationships to assume and preach that imprisoning people in a failed relationship will do anything to help those embarking on a commitment through the institution of marriage.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate and oft-stated fact that in contemporary Irish society marriage breaks down and none of us is in any doubt about that.  Those of us who deal with county council business, constituents' queries, housing lists and so on cannot have any doubt that separation and marriage breakdown occurs, causing much hardship.  We must address this problem in a realistic manner and not stick our heads in the sand and pretend that by denying those whose relationships have failed the right to remarry we are doing anything to improve the lot of anybody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Divorce is not a catalyst for marriage breakdown and the consequential crumbling of the social fabric some claim it will be.  It is simply a legal recognition that marriage has broken down and no <Col N="536" /> longer exists in anything but name. Judicial separation is at present the most comprehensive remedy available to people in such circumstances here but, as we know, that denies the parties involved the right to remarry.  The absence of divorce has not prevented marriage breakdown and our society will continue to have to deal with the social and economic consequences of marriage breakdown.  The legal provision enabling the irretrievable breakdown of marriages to be recognised already exists in legislation on every aspect but one, the right to remarry. The Judicial Separation Act has at least demonstrated to people that when a marriage has broken down an arrangement can be entered into between the parties involved to provide for continuing support for the spouses and children and that the breakup of marriage is not the end of the world.  However, unfortunately it does not allow people to embark on a legal commitment to a second relationship.  As Deputy McCreevy stated, the Judicial Separation Act has demonstrated that the floodgates are far from opening in the manner that was predicted.</P>
    <P>The claim that we are anti-family is a categoric falsehood without foundation. The family is the irreplaceable cornerstone of society and this has been illustrated by the commitment of the last and current Government to the preservation of the family through providing additional funding for marriage counselling organisations since the establishment of the Department of Equality and Law Reform.  We are also realistic enough, while acknowledging our commitment of the family, to realise that marriages can and will break down. Therefore, as well as being committed to the family we are also committed to finding a remedy for those whose marriages have irretrievably broken down.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that divorce is for those whose marriages have irretrievably broken down.  There is no desire to create a divorce culture here and this proposal will not do so.  For this reason we have ruled out any suggestion of <Col N="537" /> easy divorce.  There will not be &ldquo;quicky&rdquo; divorces under this legislation and this is spelled out in the provision which states that spouses must be living apart for four years of the five years preceding the application and the court must also be satisfied that there is no reasonable prospect of reconciliation.  I compliment the Minister for inserting that provision in the legislation.  The court must be satisfied that efforts at reconciliation and mediation have been made and that is what the applicants want.  That is further support for the institution of marriage.  Those who oppose the proposal are doing the people a disservice by pretending the Government is not committed to protecting marriage.  This is an illustration of its commitment to protecting the family.  Spouses may resume living together for a short period of up to one year without affecting the possibility of applying for a divorce in the event of a trial reconciliation being unsuccessful.  In addition, a further and important requirement of the amendment is that provisions will be made for the spouses and children involved as the court sees fit.</P>
    <P>I wish to bring this question closer to home by considering the position in my constituency.  I put it to the prophets of doom that marital breakdown is not a massive avalanche smothering all before it.  The latest figures for judicial separations in my constituency show that there were 106 applications in 1993-94, about two per week, of which 27 were granted, approximately one every two weeks.  What we are talking about is a definite but hardly overwhelming social reality.  We cannot pretend this is not happening.</P>
    <P>Those who oppose the introduction of divorce would deny those involved the right to remarry.  They have a fixed vision of this country and do not believe in introducing any measures which do not fit in with it.  However, at a time when tolerance is being actively promoted on this island one would think they would adopt a more pluralistic approach to social issues, such as marriage breakdown.  One would think, in <Col N="538" /> the light of modern Irish history, that people on this island would be much more open and receptive to the feelings and wishes of minority groups and others in society who may not agree with them.</P>
    <P>Taken together, this Bill, the draft Family Law (Divorce) Bill and the Government paper, <i>The Right to Remarry</i>, represents the most comprehensive detailed presentation of a referendum proposal ever published by a Government and put before the people. This amendment has been proposed as a remedy to a social problem which clearly exists.  The introduction of divorce has been proposed because marriages break down; it has not been proposed to facilitate the breakdown of marriages.  Simply stated, divorce is the legal recognition of a social problem which already exists.  I commend the proposal not alone to the House but to the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to consider the context of the current debate on the proposed referendum on the question of whether divorce should be allowed under the Constitution.  Regardless of one's personal standpoint on the issue, most people probably agree that the outcome of the referendum will be of major importance in determining the direction which society will take over the coming decade.  Consequently, in anything approaching normal circumstances, the issue would have been debated fully and at length before the final decision was placed in the hands of the electorate.  The report on marital breakdown notes as element No. 19 of its proposals: &ldquo;The Government proposes to proceed with a divorce referendum after a full debate on the complex issues involved&rdquo;.  If the scope and nature of the overall debate to date are anything to go by, the much needed examination of the complex issues associated with marital breakdown and the likely impact of introducing divorce is unlikely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate to date has been extremely disappointing.  Both sides of <Col N="539" /> the argument bear responsibility in this regard with each party showing scant respect for the genuinely held views of their opponents.  Many comments have been short on substance and objectivity but extremely vocal in terms of abuse and intolerance.  For example, as recently as last Sunday, I read that the chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, Mr. Niall Stokes, launched an extraordinary attack on the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Deputies who oppose the introduction of divorce.  If one ignored the disgraceful language used by Mr. Stokes, the general tone of his comments was chilling and indicated a total lack of tolerance for opinions contrary to his own.  In particular, the attitute adopted showed scant regard for the core benefit of democracy which is the opportunity to freely express one's own opinion while accepting the overall will of the majority.</P>
    <P>I hope that such profoundly abusive and intolerant viewpoints will not figure prominently during the remainder of the campaign.  They add absolutely nothing to developing our insight to the problem of marital breakdown and do not assist in identifying the most effective way of assisting those directly affected by such a family crisis.</P>
    <P>To date media coverage of the issue also seems highly biased in favour of the pro-divorce side.  If one was to attempt to summarise the basic message projected by a range of articles, the following two points are made again and again: first, the only acceptable vote is a &ldquo;yes vote&rdquo; and, second, if one opposes the introduction of divorce one is insensitive to the plight of those affected by marital breakdown, that one really supports the introduction of divorce but is afraid to do so publicly and that one is totally out of step with the opinions and wishes of the people.  Many of these attacks are made by people who have never been elected to any public position. There must be objectivity and both sides of the case must be made in a civil and constructive manner.  Both sides of <Col N="540" /> the argument deserve a full and fair hearing by the media.</P>
    <P>I have devoted the initial part of my speech to stressing the vital need for objectivity, openness and tolerance in the debate.  Similarly, I strongly plead that we focus on the likely advantages and disadvantages of introducing divorce in society.  It is only when this has been done by all participants to the debate that we will be able to say that we are properly exercising our duties both at legislative and executive level.</P>
    <P>Despite the tone and nature of my comments to date I freely admit that I find the topic of divorce a particularly difficult one to assess with any degree of certainty.  However, in preparing my comments for today I have focused on two key issues regarding divorce.  Does marriage breakdown constitute a serious problem in current day Ireland and how can society best deal with the problem?</P>
    <P>On the first count it would be extremely dishonest of me to state that there is no problem in relation to marital breakdown in modern Irish society. A number of findings point in the opposite direction.  For example, there is increasing evidence of violence and abuse in the home.  Such conduct is totally unacceptable in any society which considers itself civilised.  While we often tend to recall the past in positive and sentimental terms there were also many unspoken problems in relation to the family and the widely observed practice was to maintain a discreet distance from obvious conflict within our families. While such a practice minimised the level of external interference in the life of the family, unfortunately, it sometimes allowed grossly unjust behaviour to go unchallenged.  Despite the general air of gloom which is created increasingly by the revelations regarding violence and abuse in the home I have no doubt that such exposure is necessary to protect the many victims of such violence. When society makes it abundantly clear that any form of abuse in the home will be exposed and the guilty parties suitably punished then and only then is <Col N="541" /> the problem likely to be successfully tackled across the community.</P>
    <P>Before I leave the subject of abuse in the home I wish to stress that significant improvements in this area are unlikely until the development of the necessary legislative changes is complemented by the expansion of relevant support services. Changes in the law cannot be effective in isolation.  Too often a Deputy encounters at constituency level a total lack of awareness regarding the safeguards which exists to protect and support the vitims of abuse.  As a general point, the lack of such integration between legal innovation and the provision of State sponsored support services is one of the main reasons social problems of various types are not being tackled effectively.</P>
    <P>Another indicator of the level of marital breakdown in modern Irish society is the level of dependency on deserted spouses' benefits and allowances. According to the 1994 report of the Department of Social Welfare, there are currently approximately 15,000 recipients of either the deserted spouse's benefit or allowance.  While this level of desertion must be considered in the context of almost one million family units, it provides a further insight into the level of marital breakdown in modern Irish society.  The onesided decision by a partner, generally the husband but not always, to ignore his or her responsibilities results in much pain and suffering for the family. The period of desertion can range from a short time to forever.  While the easy response to desertion is to heap blame on the missing partner, little benefit will derive to the family from such posturing. The only responsible role we can adopt as legislators is to commission research into the various factors which provoke such behaviour.  Only through the insights gained by such research can we move at the twin levels of legislative change and Executive action.</P>
    <P>In general, most people agree with the view that our society is largely based <Col N="542" /> on the family unit.  There is almost universal agreement that we must do everything in our power to further the wellbeing of the family in every possible way.  My worry is that while we have excelled in our aspirations for the family, we have not been as effective in introducing practical supports, especially for families that encounter serious problems.</P>
    <P>We cannot bury our heads in the sand as far as the major changes which continue to take place in our society are concerned.  The level of desertion I mentioned is one indicator of the deterioration in the stability of the family unit.  The very worrying level of abuse and violence is another appalling indicator that the cosy idea we may have of the quality of Irish family life does not apply to all families.  Yet another indicator of change is the rapid increase in the number of lone parents.</P>
    <P>The 1994 report of the Department of Social Welfare indicates that there are 29,823 recipients of lone parent's allowance. They are classified as unmarried parents.  A further 8,034 recipients of the allowance qualify as separated spouses.  According to the most recent CSO report approximately one in five births occurs outside the traditional family unit structure.  The implication of these issues for the future of society requires intensive consideration.  For the ordinary married couple with a family, modern life involves facing challenges and crisis on a regular basis.  One can only imagine the extra burden which must be carried by a single parent.</P>
    <P>Marital breakdown is a major problem in modern Ireland.  The ever increasing number of single parent families adds significantly to the challenge faced by the Government of the day as they attempt to cater equally for all citizens. I focused earlier on extreme examples of family breakdown such as those provoked by violence, abuse and desertion.  There are two other categories. I have no doubt that a number of spouses remain in seriously damaged marriages without any official record of their plight.  There are a number of <Col N="543" /> reasons for this hidden suffering.  Many partners, often women, remain in an unsatisfactory marriage for the sake of the children.  Despite the major changes in our social habits over the last 20 years or so the almost universal commitment to children, thankfully, remains the core element of our society.  However, it might be argued that remaining in a failed marriage may not ultimately be in the best interests of the children.  Financial necessity leaves many women in particular with no apparent option but to remain in a bad marriage.</P>
    <P>While we may fairly claim that the State's commitment to a variety of relevant social welfare programmes has been substantial over the last decade we tend to forget that the single most important material element of any family unit is the home.  If in practical terms a woman would like to terminate a bad marriage and feels capable of securing the necessary weekly income to do so, accommodation poses a major problem. Selling the family home and dividing the proceeds can often leave both partners in limbo.  They do not have a sufficient level of capital to enable them to purchase a new house and they may not easily obtain local authority housing.</P>
    <P>Another category of family breakdown involves cases where one or both partners have formed a genuine relationship outside the marriage which they would like to establish on a permanent basis.  Frequently both partners are anxious to dissolve their marriage and there is every likelihood that the children, if any, will continue to receive full emotional and economic support from both parents.</P>
    <P>I have concentrated on the various reasons genuinely put forward to justify the introduction of divorce.  Only the most insensitive people could doubt that marriages have broken down with little or no likelihood of reconciliation.  How do we deal with this problem?  A series of opinion polls indicates that unlike the 1986 referendum when there was a two thirds majority against divorce a majority of the electorate now wish to <Col N="544" /> introduce such a facility.  As a result of the persistent findings of the polls, there is a democratic necessity to afford the people an opportunity to give their verdict on the matter by holding a referendum and I have no problem with that. The day that we decide the people should not have the final say in a matter of critical importance will be a poor day for democracy.</P>
    <P>As a public representative it is important to state my voting intentions in the referendum.  Hopefully, my comments indicate that I have given extensive consideration to the matter over the past few weeks and I have narrowed my views on the issue to the following key questions: is marital breakdwon a major problem in Ireland and is the introduction of divorce the most effective way to deal with the problem?  I have little doubt that many Irish marriages have broken down totally and a number of others are at risk.  The second issue is more difficult.  Apart from my personal beliefs I have three problems with supporting the introduction of divorce at this time.  First, we have carried out far too little research into the cause of marital breakdown and the services which must be developed to provide maximum support for such couples.  The level of investment in counselling services is grossly inadequate and, but for the tremendous work of the church and voluntary organisations, the position would be much worse.  We have not seriously assessed the implications of introducing divorce, nor have we examined in detail the financial supports which will be necessary to ensure that the family and, in particular, children do not suffer significant loss in living standards.</P>
    <P>Our own party committee stated: &ldquo;the research shows that, in general, marriage breakdown and divorce have a negative effect on children both short and long term, psychological and social&rdquo; although this was not universal.  The introduction of divorce is likely to reduce the incentive for many couples experiencing difficulty to persist with <Col N="545" /> their marriage.  This has been the universal experience elsewhere.  For these reasons the introduction of divorce at this time would constitute a major step into the unknown.  Consequently, I will vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the forthcoming referendum while urging that we tackle the task of supporting the family with renewed urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mulvihill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to be afforded the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  The forthcoming referendum on divorce will be not only a momentous occasion in the development of family law but also in the development of a more pluralist, modern society.</P>
      <P>As has been said frequently in recent weeks divorce exists in our society in everything but name.  That is totally unjust especially bearing in mind the reforms in family law implemented over the past decade or so.  Despite unprecedented reforms it is clear they cannot be brought to fruition without recourse to the prospect of remarriage.</P>
      <P>In voting for divorce, we do not vote to undermine the family but rather for legal recognition of marriage breakdown. On too many occasions we chose to deny the existence of marriage breakdown. We have matured in the past decade or so and are no longer willing to sweep social issues, such as divorce, under the proverbial rug which has long ceased to constitute an adequate response to social ills.  It is a measure of our growth that we have now come to realise that.  Because of that maturity this Bill will be accepted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must also be pointed out that divorce is not an end but rather a response to a social ill affecting many of our citizens. We do not ask the electorate to vote for divorce simply for its sake but rather because it constitutes the only <Col N="546" /> reasonable solution to the pain inflicted on those parties involved in difficult marriage relationships.</P>
    <P>As a nation we pride ourselves on being fair to our fellow citizens and that is another reason it is important that the forthcoming referendum on divorce be accepted.  A society within which a sizeable minority is constantly denied the right to remarry by the happily married majority is far from just.  At a time in our history when we are endeavouring to heal divisions it is important to demonstrate that we are in tune with the feelings of the minority within our society.</P>
    <P>There have been suggestions that the Government has not adopted the proper approach to the forthcoming referendum. On behalf of my Labour colleagues and the Minister I categorically reject such suggestions.  The Minister and his Cabinet colleagues have gone to great lengths in their preparations for the introduction of this referendum and have introduced a total of 19 Bills &mdash; providing the legislative support for this referendum &mdash; whose provisions encompass the protection of children, pensions and social welfare rights.  As a family lawyer the Minister has brought his considerable skills and knowledge to this exercise.  I would go so far as to say this will be the best campaign in the history of constitutional referenda.</P>
    <P>The Government proposals are aimed at avoiding the bitter divisions which characterised the 1986 divorce referendum. I congratulate the Minister on the work he has done on this issue since he assumed his portfolio.</P>
    <P>I ask people generally to show compassion and charity to those seeking the right to remarry.  It is unfair and wrong to deny them the right to legalise new relationships; indeed to do so would be to discriminate against them since the right to remarry is a civil right long established in many other jurisdictions. It is high time it was introduced here to cater for those in need of it.  Some people contend that the right to remarry will lead to the initiation of a &ldquo;quickie <Col N="547" /> divorce&rdquo; culture.  Nothing could be farther from the truth since the Government proposals will allow parties to divorce only after they have adequately demonstrated their marriage has irretrievably broken down and they have been living apart for more than four years. This should more than satisfy those opposed to the concept of &ldquo;quickie divorce&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of quickie divorce and those who engage in such argument merely engage in the tactics deployed in the course of the 1986 referendum.  The proposals are sensible, fair, just and will protect the family, without affecting the many happy families within our society.</P>
    <P>I call on all parties and Members to support the Minister and Government in their bid to introduce the right to remarry.  The establishment of this right will not be served by engaging in the continuous bickering and negative campaigning witnessed already in this House.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Haughey say never has he had any constituent request that divorce be introduced here. He must be about the only Member who has not received such a request.  All other Members to whom I have spoken told me that daily at each of their clinics &mdash; and the same is true of mine &mdash; people ask when this referendum will be held so that they can extricate themselves from their unhappy relationships and continue to live happily with another party thereafter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on his balanced approach in bringing forward these legislative proposals with regard to the forthcoming referendum on divorce.  I have no doubt it involved much reflection on the part of the Government and the Minister in particular, on what proposals were most likely to succeed in obtaining a majority vote on such a major issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By enshrining many proposals in the constitutional amendment the Minister and Government are reflecting the very wide spread of opinion within the <Col N="548" /> House and nationally and the fears of many of the electorate about introducing a divorce culture in addition to the requisite safeguards for families, children and the many issues that arose in 1986.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mulvihill pointed out that since 1986 there have been many legislative changes within the family law area generally, not the least of which was the introduction of 19 Bills which should help to reconcile many of the problems and fears held by the electorate in 1986 when they were concerned about property rights, pension rights, taxation and with the rights of children.  As one who campaigned in that referendum for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote I can readily understand the fears then expressed and with the benefit of hindsight, the reason the electorate was not prepared to take that major step without the necessary clarification, particularly bearing in mind the total confusion in the public mind, exacerbated by a considerable number of people who exaggerated or dramatised many of the difficulties that would ensure from the introduction of divorce at that time.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding those fears, the intervening nine years have afforded all Members an opportunity to reflect on the steps necessary in the family law area to eliminate such fears and confusion, thereby allowing those who have encountered marriage difficulties a second chance.  I hope we shall not witness the scaremongering that obtained in 1986 when many fair-minded people, for one reason or another, voted &ldquo;no&rdquo;. We look forward to adequate information being disseminated by the Government through this House, the media and elsewhere to dispel any fears or confusion about these legislative proposals.</P>
    <P>No Member of this House wishes to encourage or facilitate the break up of marriage but equally no parliamentarian can legislate to prevent such an eventuality.  We cannot bury our heads in the sand any longer, failing to acknowledge that there are 75,000 couples &mdash; judging from the last Labour <Col N="549" /> Force survey &mdash; deemed to be separated, living in this State and that in excess of 23,000 people are dependent on deserted wife's benefit or single parent's allowance.  This constitutional amendment is necessary to allow all of those people a second chance.  The experiences of these people reflect the reality that marriages break down irretrievably. Between 1982 and 1987 the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown was established.  Many of its members, some perhaps for the first time, heard evidence on the breakdown of marriages.  There were differences of opinion about the solution, but all Members acknowledged there was a serious problem for a minority of families. Some public representatives not necessarily in favour of divorce sat on that committee with open minds and at the end of the deliberations saw divorce as the best and only option to return to some form of sanity through regularising the union of separated people whose marriages had broken down.</P>
    <P>The first respite for separated people was the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 introduced as a Private Members' Bill on behalf of Fine Gael by Deputy Shatter.  The House agreed that it should form part of the legislation to assist separated couples.  It was an important milestone in family law in so far as it has given people an opportunity to examine its effect.  The fears about the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act opening the floodgates to separation and, eventually divorce were groundless because of the strict conditions the courts apply to the grounds for a separation.  The Act has succeeded fairly well in meeting the needs of spouses and children, and meeting their family needs and obligations.</P>
    <P>The proposal in this Bill is well balanced. It meets people's fears in that a &ldquo;quickie divorce&rdquo; culture is not contemplated. It enshrines the need for reconciliation. This Government and previous <Col N="550" /> Governments have increased the funding in recent years to many organisations involved in mediation and counselling. It deals with the law's obligation to children and spouses in advance of divorce being agreed by the court.  In other words, one will not qualify for a divorce unless one can show that a process of reconciliation was undertaken and the needs of children and the other spouse have been dealt with.  Thus, it is reasonable to ask the people what other fears they may have in allowing a constitutionally restrictive second chance if the need arises for a minority of people.</P>
    <P>The referendum is about drawing together in a legal mechanism the many unofficial family unions without damaging the existing family structure and without being irresponsible as to the needs of children and spouses and the need for reconciliation which is enshrined in the proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>The right to remarry is required for a number of people and this proposal achieves that objective in the most restrictive way.  Attitudes to the right to remarry have changed in the last nine years.  This has been helped by the Government, and, in particular, the Minister, Deputy Taylor who introduced many family law reforms.  With regard to the issues which are important, namely the right to remarry and the recognition that marriage breakdown takes place, we will not be found wanting by the people when they vote on 24 November.  I hope needless confusion and fear will not be generated in the campaign.  I hope the issue will be well debated in a balanced way so the fear that stalked the land in 1986 will not be generated in an irresponsible way in 1995.  I will vote for this Bill; I will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum and I will ask my constituents to do likewise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>Marriage breakdown and divorce are painful subjects. However, the problem will not go away and it has to be faced realistically sooner or later.  There has been nonsensical talk of us as gatekeepers manning floodgates against the modern world. <Col N="551" /> However, the modern world is here. There have also been fears expressed about the fabric of society.  People have been emigrating since the 1840s and nobody cares too much about what happens to these sometimes illegal immigrants.</P>
      <P>Divorce exists in many democratic countries, including all the European countries.  The bishops and their churches are entitled to their say, but many of their statements have nothing to do with the referendum.  The church is entitled to state its views but it must put its own house in order first.  There was at one time an ambitious plan to send missionaries from Maynooth to China to convert 1.2 billion people; it might be more appropriate to send a mission to Maynooth if missionaries able to tackle the modern world could be found.  The church has not been impressive in tackling the modern world in a realistic way.</P>
      <P>I will stand up to any bishop on the issue of marriage breakdown and divorce. I have seen the pain and trauma of marriage breakdown in my clinics as clearly as any bishop.  Let the bishops have their view but we are entitled to legislate and we must do so.  Running away from the problem will not solve it.</P>
      <P>I am not impressed with the posturing of the Progressive Democrats.  It has been the most divided party in this House on social issues through the years.  It has always allowed a free vote and has been like a pantomime horse &mdash; one side going one way and the other side going another.  Its so-called unity only papers over the reality in the party. Let it behave in this way in the future on other issues.  It has run for cover in the past on tricky issues and I am not impressed by it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish this was a simple removal of the ban on divorce.  The Government has, as Deputy Mulvihill said, put time and thought into putting legislation in place to prepare the way.  We are also spending money to make all the relevant information available to the public to inform minds and consciences.  As <Col N="552" /> Deputy Hogan said, let us have no more scaremongering or panic as we had in 1986, when people without backsides in their trousers were worried about succession rights when they would succeed to nothing but poverty in many cases. However, they were stampeded and frightened by sermons from priests and lay people.</P>
    <P>Many people give the impression that Christianity was founded somewhere in Ireland and we have patent ownership of our version.  This is a small country of 3.5 million people with its own problems. We are not in a position to lecture the rest of the world or countries like China with 1.2 billion people as if we have a holy grail and our version of truth is more pure, honest and has more integrity than anyone else's.  I am not impressed with that attitude.</P>
    <P>Most politicians have been around and have had to emigrate and suffer unemployment.  They meet people from the top and bottom of society.  It is ridiculous to speak here of sanctimonious solutions.  There is pain and trauma in the world and marriages break down. All we are asking is that people should have the right to remarry if they wish. We are not forcing marriages to breakdown; no sane, responsible person wishes to see that but all families have been touched by this and we know the pain it causes.</P>
    <P>People who wish to abide by any church's teaching on this question are free to do so.  We would not force anyone to end his or her marriage or to be divorced but we ask that people be treated as adults.  In a democracy people should be able to make up their minds free from pain and pressure, and be able to decide for themselves if they wish to remarry.  That is all we are doing.  Legislation has been put on the Statute Book and this is the final step to allow people to remarry.</P>
    <P>I was sick and tired of the fear and panic engendered during the last referendum nine years ago.  I was in the middle of it in Limerick and heard the crude scaremongering.  People with good background and education <Col N="553" /> descended to the most base, mean, materialistic and mercenary arguments. There were no questions of religion, ethics or morals &mdash; it was crude materialism which won the day.  This time I hope we have a more civilised debate. People should be allowed room to make up their minds.  They will get information and leaflets from both sides and should be allowed to decide how to act.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey must live in a rarefied world &mdash; he never met anyone looking for divorce or suffering from the trauma of marriage breakdown.  I do not know how any politician, whether a councillor, Senator or TD, could make such a statement.  Anyone who lives in the real world knows marriage breakdown is all around us.  His argument is like saying if hospitals were banned, people would stop getting sick. However, divorce is banned in Ireland and that does not stop marriage breakdowns. Even if the referendum is defeated it will not stop.  That must be accepted.  Deputy Haughey is playing to a certain gallery but he does not fool me.</P>
    <P>I hope this referendum is carried in November &mdash; I do not know what will happen if it is defeated.</P>

      <P>Each person should be allowed his opinion and we will not all agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This referendum is about whether people should have the right to remarry when their marriages have irretrievably broken down.  I campaigned for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the 1986 referendum and was disappointed at the outcome but in retrospect there were huge gaps in legislation. If the referendum had been passed there would have been chaos in the courts and great difficulties for people who would have filed for divorce <Col N="554" /> under the new circumstances.  In hindsight, therefore, it may not have been bad that the referendum was defeated so that the legislation now in place could be used to best effect to protect those seeking a divorce, their families and homes.</P>
    <P>About 19 Acts connected with this matter have been passed since the last referendum.  These provide for circumstances where marriages have broken down so that children and spouses can be protected.  It is only right that this should have been done.  Now, people are being asked whether couples whose marriages have irretrievably broken down should have the right to remarry. I believe they should be allowed do so. Although some will say if the referendum is passed the number of marriages breaking down will increase and the family will be undermined, I do not believe that will necessarily be the case. At present, marriage breakdown is a reality.  We all know it happens and few families have not been touched by it &mdash; approximately 70,000 people have been affected.</P>
    <P>Not anyone I have met whose marriage has broken down has approached this in a casual manner.  All of them have gone through unbelievable heartache, pain and emotional distress during the breakdown.  They did not suddenly walk out on their spouses and children. It happened over a number of years, the decision was difficult and emotional and much pain was caused.  These people did not enter a marriage flippantly &mdash; they wanted to commit themselves to it for life but unfortunately, for one reason or another, it did not work out.</P>
    <P>I reject the idea that the referendum will open the floodgates and hundreds of people currently married will decide to divorce.  That will not happen; people have far too much invested in marriage and their personal lives to do that.  In Northern Ireland, huge numbers of people have not sought divorces.  The position does not seem much different from the Republic.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> Various Governments have improved matters by introducing marriage counselling and mediation.  These have been successful and many marriages in great difficulty have been helped.  Counselling has resolved many problems.  When one is in a marriage it can be difficult to see the wood from the trees; when one is so close to another person it is hard to stand back.  Mediation and counselling help people to look at problems from the viewpoints of oneself and one's partner. I am delighted Governments have increased the moneys to these bodies so they can get on with their good work.</P>
    <P>Like others, I do not believe divorce should be made easy.  It should only be granted where it is proven that the marriage has irretrievably broken down. The wording put before the people in this referendum will ensure divorce is not made easy and the vast majority are happy with that.  I agree with the Progressive Democrats that in an ideal world the Constitution is not the best place to put such working but people want to feel that in voting in favour they are not assenting to quick divorces. There may be challenges to putting this in the Constitution but people do not want to vote for easy divorce and this wording gives them that assurance.  It is a very personal decision and people will make up their own minds.  To a certain extent, the debate will take place over the airwaves and in the printed media but it will not be the normal political campaign of knocking on doors.  Most people know somebody who has been &mdash; or have themselves been &mdash; touched by marital breakdown so they will not be influenced by people knocking on their doors from the Divorce Action Group or anti-divorce groups.  They have listened to the radio over the last few years and have watched programmes on television, they have their own personal experiences and have read about it in the newspapers.</P>
    <P>If the referendum is defeated, there will be a huge number of foreign divorces. Such exporting of our problems <Col N="556" /> would be regrettable and we must face up to the fact that this issue happens in this country.  We may not like it but we must accept that it is happening.  That is another reason I urge people to vote yes.</P>
    <P>A newspaper journalist telephoned me this morning to ask my attitude to divorce and if I would be canvassing my constituents.  I told him that I was going to vote yes and that I will be urging a yes vote.  However, I do not think that knocking on doors urging people to vote yes or no will make any difference.  I do not believe that this will be won on the doorsteps.  I have been at meetings in my constituency where people are voting yes or no for their own reasons.  It is a very personal decision and I do not believe that I or any other politician will influence them.  It is important that we say how we will vote but I do not believe that we will greatly influence people.</P>
    <P>If the referendum is lost some commentators will blame political parties or the church.  However, the people will decide this and I do not think that anybody else can be blamed.  We must respect their opinion as long as there is a proper debate without fear or confusion. Unfortunately, some of the debate so far has confused people.  I talked to some people recently who are voting yes and they are more confused now than they were at the start of the debate.  I hope that there will not be a great deal of confusion in the debate &mdash; it is a clever tactic for those against divorce to confuse people who will decide at the end of the day that they do not want social change and will vote no. People in every country are not very positive about social change because they are unsure what it will bring about. Unfortunately, that tactic is beginning to work and the Government and others must work to ensure that people are very clear about what they are voting for &mdash; the right of those whose marriages are irretrievably broken down to remarry.</P>
    <P>The other issue is the church's problems and whether that will undermine <Col N="557" /> its position in this debate.  I do not believe that the church's problems have anything to do with this debate, this issue stands on its own.  The church's problems are unfortunate but are not connected to this referendum and should not be used for or against.  It is wrong for people to bring that issue into the debate as it is separate.  It is similar to many other issues on the liberal agenda &mdash; if one is for contraception that means to many people that one is for abortion, divorce and everything else, which does not necessarily follow as they are all separate issues.</P>
    <P>Many of my party colleagues have already stated that they will be voting no.  I have no doubt that many members of Fine Gael and some members of the Progressive Democrats and Labour will be voting no.  I respect their views which I believe are influenced by their personal experiences and to which they are entitled.  I am delighted that they are expressing those views and I do not go along with the idea that if one votes no one is some sort of arch conservative.  It is interesting to talk to people socially about why they are voting no and it is surprising which way some people are voting.  I must respect somebody's right to vote not the way I want them to and they must respect my point of view.  I will try to persuade them to vote yes and I know that I have no chance of doing so in some circumstances.</P>
    <P>We should not start mudslinging and attacking people with different views. Some people believe that divorce will undermine marriages and society, which I do not believe.  However, we should respect each other's views and it is very important for us to set a standard, not to mudsling and to be clear on the issues.  I am voting yes and if I am asked &mdash; as I have been &mdash; I will be encouraging others to do the same.  Divorce is a compassionate way to deal with a problem in our society and a realistic response to the needs of a modern and pluralistic society.  If the referendum does not succeed I will accept the people's views, but I hope that people will vote yes and put this issue behind them.</P>

      <P>The people can feel far less threatened and fearful in 1995 than was the case in 1986.  The reason for that, as stated by other speakers, is the vast amount of legislation we have put through this House over the last nine years.  There is one fundamental piece of legislation in the area of family law reform &mdash; the right to remarriage &mdash; which we have not yet tackled, but we are now so doing.  This must be put to the people because of the constitutional ban on divorce and we must do so in a very forthright and positive way.  The defensive attitude of some of my colleagues in the House, especially from members of the party opposite, is regrettable.  It was summed up for me in the contribution made by Deputy Eoin Ryan when he said that if asked he would tell people to vote yes.  Why should the Deputy wait to be asked?  I hope we can be positive about this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main planks in the legislation I mentioned was the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  Nobody could say that this legislation has not been working well.  It has worked very well and because of that we should feel positive about moving to the next step, which is to ask the people to give us the power to introduce the concept of the right to remarriage.  The ban on divorce has failed to protect marriage.  Why have we had this insertion in our Constitution since 1937?  It is flawed to assume that by banning divorce and by consequently muzzling the Oireachtas we will not have marriage breakdown.  This was the flawed assumption made by Éamon de Valera and the writing fathers of our Constitution in the late 1930s.  It was a steadfast but very naive acceptance that the awful consequences of a failed marriage were better than the remedy of divorce. That is why we have this constitutional ban.  We did not have it in the earlier <Col N="559" /> years of the State.  It was introduced in 1937 on the basis of a terribly flawed assumption on the part of the authors of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves if divorce is a desirable mechanism for dealing with a complex social problem or is it itself a social evil.  Is it, in the famous words of Dr. Woods, a Frankenstein stalking the land?</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Are we prepared to introduce a desirable mechanism?  That is what the people must decide.</P>
      <P>Of course there are no winners in marriage breakdown, and I do not believe anybody ever said there were. However, what and where is the evidence to suggest that divorce threatens the stability of marriage by lessening the seriousness with which the parties to a marriage treat their responsibilities?  I have not seen such evidence and I have not seen the proponents of this argument, either on the last occasion or in the run-up thus far to this amendment, produce such evidence.</P>
      <P>Divorce is not a cause of breakdown but a reflection of the changing attitudes in society towards a lifelong marriage.  If we work from a premise that divorce will wreck families and break up marriages we must ask what were the adverse consequences of our family law legislation on marriage to date?  What family law legislation has created the battered wife or the deserted wife, or has given rise to children being prisoners in a marriage that has become, for many reasons, less than harmonious? What family law legislation has invented the callous, calculating wife beater? These problems existed before the legislation was introduced and enacted.  It is the same with regard to divorce legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable that we have had so many comparisons, from the so called anti-divorce lobby, with the USA and the UK.  Are we saying that our system of judicial administration is similar to <Col N="560" /> that which exists in the USA?  The answer to that is no.  One need only consider the nauseating O.J. Simpson circus to thank goodness that we in this country have not gone down the road of the USA in so far as our legal system is concerned.  It is also fundamentally unfair to make a comparison between the USA and the UK.</P>
    <P>I have not heard much, in terms of comparisons, between the likely divorce legislation here with the situation obtaining in Spain and Italy, countries that could perhaps be regarded as much more similar to Ireland.  In both these countries society, by and large, subscribes to the Roman Catholic religion in statistical terms similar to those in this country.  For example, in Spain there are fewer divorces than marriage breakdowns in this country and Italy has one of the lowest divorce rates in the world.  In view of this, I hope that we could focus the debate on the consequences of divorce in so called Catholic countries, rather than seek comparisons, on a very unfair basis, with the situation obtaining in the USA.</P>
    <P>If we as legislators introduce a programme of family reform it must be just and fair.  In order to be both we must favourably consider the concept of remarriage as to deny it would be fundamentally unfair.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputies from all sides of the House agree that divorce will not solve the problems of marriage breakdown. These can only be solved by education, mediation, support and reconciliation. Divorce will not solve such problems and nobody ever intended that it should.</P>
    <P>However, divorce will allow for an absolute end, a chance to rebuild, a chance to begin again and a choice of a second relationship with the lessons from the previous tragic breakdown hopefully learned from the sad experience. I am voting yes to the Bill before us.  I will be asking, and am now again asking my constituents in LaoighisOffaly to enable the Government to introduce legislation to allow for a second chance and for remarriage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="561" /> When we as practising politicians look at the nuts and bolts of a campaign, it will not be sufficient in the course of that campaign for us to pass through the lobbies, then sit on the fence and say it is up to the people to decide.  This is where I agree with the provision of information and spending Government money on information to support a yes campaign.  If we are to be true to our ideals in politics, it would be illogical and a grave disservice for a Government to introduce a referendum and then to run away telling the people they can vote whatever way they like.  There must be the initiation of a campaign and of influence.  We must also encourage, in a positive manner, the people to go along with the proposal in the programme for Government to allow the tens of thousands of people in this country who are in a most difficult and traumatic situation the choice &mdash; nobody will force them &mdash; to commence or regularise a second relationship, with lessons hopefully and duly learned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this important debate.  As in 1986, I welcome the fact that the opportunity of introducing divorce to the country is being put to the people, and as in 1986, I will be supporting it and campaigning for a yes vote.</P>
      <P>Circumstances have greatly changed since 1986 and many lessons were learned from the failures of that campaign. All of us in the House will have deep memories of it &mdash; there was such a dramatic change from the early part of the campaign where there was so much support for change &mdash; and because of them, many of us approach the matter with a good deal more wisdom and caution on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation in which the matter will be considered by the people has dramatically changed, for a number of reasons.  One is that nine years have elapsed during which we have not had divorce and regrettably, the level of marriage breakdown has continued to increase.  The argument that divorce would, of its nature, cause an increase <Col N="562" /> in marriage breakdown is not as simply put now because the levels of breakdown have been so high in the intervening period without divorce.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that the problems associated with marriage in society do not relate to the issue of divorce, but to other pressures and a debate should give us an opportunity to consider these. The Joint Committee on the Family is looking at family issues in a broader context and this debate affords us an opportunity to consider the reasons an increasing number of marriages are breaking down.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the dramatic legislative changes introduced since the previous divorce referendum, for example, the status of children legislation, the landmark judicial separation legislation, the family law legislation and the legislation dealing with pension entitlements.  During the previous referendum the concerns about property rights, etc., made it very easy for the anti-divorce lobby to encourage people to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Some Opposition Deputies said they would find it difficult to campaign in favour of divorce.  I understand their concerns &mdash; it is very difficult for people to say they are passionately in favour of divorce &mdash; but we regard divorce as a means of solving the problems of marriages which have been broken down for many years.  The groups who wish to maintain the <i>status quo</i> say they want to protect the role of the family and the kind of marriages to which everyone aspires on the day they marry.  The inclusion in the Constitution of the four year requirement will ensure that we do not go down the same road as those societies which have made wrong decisions and added further pressure to an already pressurised institution.</P>
    <P>The issue of costs, which gave rise to concerns during the previous referendum, has been clarified.  During the debate on the social welfare legislation the issue of pension rights was debated in detail.  This was an important debate as it highlighted the fact that while the double entitlements paid to widows and <Col N="563" /> other dependent spouses in a small number of cases and the provision of increased legal aid will give rise to minor additional costs, the cost of divorce will not be much greater than the cost of separation, which is already borne by the State.  This issue cannot, therefore, be used by the anti-divorce lobby to encourage people to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; to divorce.</P>
    <P>I read Dr. Garret FitzGerald's address to the 1987 Patrick McGill Summer School in Glenties which dealt with the 1937 Constitution on its 50th anniversary. At that stage Dr. FitzGerald was a veteran of a number of unsuccessful referenda.  He referred to the historical background to the Constitution and the reasons Mr. de Valera imposed restrictions on divorce and strengthened the position of the Catholic Church.  He believed de Valera had realised that he could not take on the political opposition and the Church together and, therefore, conceded to the demands of the Church to bring the political opposition with him.  He was willing to give de Valera some kudos for having had that wisdom.  He stated clearly that given his experience of the referenda on alternative wording for the anti-abortion clause and the introduction of a restrictive form of divorce and the scale of the minority vote in the referendum on the Single European Act, all future constitutional issues would have to have broad parliamentary backing and fairly wide national consensus if they were to succeed.  The Minister for Equality and Law Reform learned from these lessons and undertook painstaking preparatory work for this referendum.  Although support for the divorce referendum is not universal it has broad parliamentary backing.  However, we are not sure about the level of national consensus on this issue.  According to the polls, there is broad national consensus on it but as those of us who were involved in the previous campaign know some sections of the electorate are soft, so to speak, and may change their minds on polling day.  Much work has been undertaken <Col N="564" /> since the previous referendum and I hope we have learned lessons similar to those learned by Dr. FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>Yesterday there was a historical meeting in Dublin between the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, the Taoiseach and the leaders of the other political parties.  There was also a major meeting of a different kind north of the Border between business, religious and political people.  We should give some consideration to the North-South element during this debate.  I understand the views of traditionalists who value the family structure and the contribution made by the Church to society. However, it is possible to retain the best of these elements while giving other people a second chance.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned at the increase in the number of decrees of nullity granted as a legal means of resolving the problem of marriage breakdown.  I am aware of an extraordinary case involving a woman with two children who was married for seven years and who was told she could have a State annulment. The number of State annulments has increased greatly.  They have been a legal means of responding to the problem of marriage breakdown, but they are a totally unacceptable means of doing so.  They require people to declare that their marriage never existed and that gives rise to issues regarding various rights.  Legislation has been advanced to meet the need to address the problem of marriage breakdown which Deputy Haughey denied exists and his remarks appear to have given rise to a good deal of comment.  The problem of marriage breakdown needs to be addressed given the levels of utilisation of every current legal avenue open to people to sort out their problems, whether by judicial separation, desertion, lone parenting supports, use of nullity procedures or Church annulment having regard to the vast numbers who have received one and are remarried in the eyes of the church, but not in the eyes of the State.  It is generally accepted that approximately 70,000 <Col N="565" /> people in new relationships are living outside the law.</P>
    <P>I hope the referendum will be passed, but I do not take it for granted that it will.  It requires a major gesture of generosity on the part of people who are secure in their marriages and backgrounds to be willing to support it.</P>

      <P>The Interdepartmental Co-Ordinating Committee on Island Development was established in June 1993.  It was re-established under my chairmanship in February 1995.  The committee's terms of reference are: &ldquo;To review and prioritise development strategies and recommend on actions to ensure a co-ordinated approach to all aspects of island development, including the question of structural relationships&rdquo;.  I will send the Deputy a list of Government Departments represented on the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The development and improvement of living conditions on offshore islands involves initiatives by a number of Government Departments, State agencies local development organisations, local community and voluntary groups. <Col N="566" /> Each Government Department represented on the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee continues to maintain full responsibility for its own areas of policy which affects the living conditions of island communities.</P>
    <P>Members of the committee last week met representatives of Comhdháil Óileáin na hÉireann.  This meeting was part of the ongoing consultative process that is essential in drawing up the report.  Comhdháil representatives made a presentation to the committee and key issues were discussed.  The meeting was constructive and very useful and the committee will address the points made by the Comhdháil representatives in finalising its report.</P>
    <P>In addition, in my capacity as chairperson of the Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Island Development, I recently met Ms Wulf Mathies, the European Union's Commissioner for Regional Affairs.  This meeting addressed the important issues of island access and island development. The conclusions of the meeting will be reflected in the report.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that all inquiries regarding matters affecting offshore islands have met with a standard type response with which this matter has been considered by the interdepartmental review committee? The committee has been deliberating on matters for a long time, since June 1993, as confirmed by the Minister of State.  Will he indicate why it is taking so long for the committee to issue its report or did he find that when he took up office and, as he said, re-established the committee, it had not been undertaking work prior to his appointment? Is there any explanation for the long delay in the committee concluding its deliberations and presenting its report in view of the urgency attaching to the issues under discussion?</P>

      <P>Since becoming Minister for Justice, I have dealt with this matter in great detail on a number of occasions in the House and, as I have stated on those occasions, in approaching a serious issue such as crime, we must be careful to set out, correctly and precisely, the extent of the problem.  We cannot hope to reduce crime if we do not start out from the correct base.  The crime problem is not a recent phenomenon.  There have been increases in crime recorded for each year since 1989.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Generally, we have to look at the problem from two points of view.  First, and most fundamentally, there is the <Col N="571" /> question of our broad strategic approach to the problem &mdash; are our efforts, as a society, focused on the correct targets?  Second, there is the question of resources.  I will deal with both issues in the course of my response, but before I refer to either it is right to say that we should begin by looking dispassionately at the facts.</P>
    <P>The figures for 1994 which will be published shortly will show a 2 per cent increase in indictable crime for the Dublin Metropolitan Area as a whole.  This upward trend is continuing in 1995. However, the crime situation differs from area to area.  Last week, for instance, I attended a meeting in an area of Dublin where there has been a substantial drop in crime due to the successful targeting of key criminals.  It should also be borne in mind that violent crime is a very small fraction of the overall number of crimes committed.  In this regard, it is worth noting that much of the current increase is due to one offence in particular, larcenies from motor vehicles.</P>
    <P>While it is not an answer to any problem to say it could be worse, it is instructive, in terms of developing a better understanding of the problem of crime, to look at what has been happening in other countries.  The Report of the Lord Mayor's Commission on Crime which was published earlier this year points out that crime figures for Dublin are below those for urban areas in England and Wales which, in turn, are below the western European average.  That same report shows that the level of crime in Dublin has not increased greatly since 1983.  This does not tell us that &ldquo;all's well&rdquo; in Dublin in so far as crime is concerned, but that there appears to be a worldwide trend and we will have to work ceaselessly and employ a variety of strategies in Dublin and other large urban areas if we are to avoid going the way of urban areas throughout Europe and beyond.</P>
    <P>One message which comes across clearly in discussion with other countries is that it is critical we address <Col N="572" /> causes as well as symptoms.  The Inter-Departmental Report on Urban Crime and Disorder was an important and significant contribution to looking at the causative factors and developing strategies to deal with them.  Much has already been achieved by way of implementing that report and my Department is currently reviewing the effectiveness of the particular strategies adopted.  I will have more to say on this subject of strategy when the review is finalised.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware I have already taken it as one of the cornerstones of our strategic response to crime that we comprehensively tackle the drugs problem.  I have fully outlined my plans in this regard and Deputies will be aware that a crucial element of the strategy is that we attack the demand reduction side as well as the supply side. The former will require inputs by the Departments of Health and Education, in particular, and I am confident these inputs will be forthcoming.  Deputies will be aware also that I have announced comprehensive plans to reduce the supply of drugs by means of legislative and various other changes. The treatment of drug abusers in our prisons, particularly Mountjoy, is also being examined and I will be in a position shortly to outline my proposals to Government.  Because a number of these offenders are responsible for high levels of crime in Dublin, I am anxious that facilities are available to allow prisoners to be treated and thereby reduce recidivism.</P>
    <P>Resources for those charged with the responsibility of fighting crime are also crucial and, in this regard, I have provided a total of £413 million for the Garda Síochána this year &mdash; the highest amount ever &mdash; to allow the force to effectively tackle crime.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are 3,992 gardaí allocated to the DMA at present.  Drug units have been established in each of the city's five Garda divisions and their activities are co-ordinated through the central drug squad based in Harcourt <Col N="573" /> Square.  The approach has enabled the central drug squad to monitor the activities of drug dealers all over the city and it has significantly enhanced the Garda intelligence gathering capability.  In addition to the central drug squad, full time drug units operate in Santry, Cabra, Raheny, Dún Laoghaire, Crumlin, Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Store Street, Pearse Street, Kevin Street and Donnybrook.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware from answers to previous Dáil questions that these sizeable resources will be employed, among other things, to maintain the strength of the force, advance civilianisation and also advance a major information technology plan for the gardaí aimed at increasing the overall efficiency of the force in its battle against crime.</P>
    <P>A number of steps are also being taken to minimise the amount of Garda time spent in court.  There are three garda inspectors attached to the Bridewell who have responsibility for co-ordinating Garda appearances in the Four Courts.  As regards the present procedural arrangements for dealing with criminal cases and, in particular, the amount of Garda time spent unproductively, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which is at an advanced stage, will address the problem.  There are also a number of provisions to be included in the Courts and Court Officers Bill which will improve the efficiency of the courts in bringing cases to trial more quickly.</P>
    <P>Additional funding has been provided this year towards the implementation of special measures to prevent and detect crime.  One such measure is the installation of closed circuit TV cameras in areas of Dublin City centre as an aid to policing.  The installation of a system in the Temple Bar area will be the first such project to be undertaken.  Funding for the project has jointly come from the Department of Justice and Temple Bar Properties Limited.</P>
    <P>The international experience has been that the installation of these cameras leads to a substantial drop in crime <Col N="574" /> and that this decrease is a genuine one, not just a displacement of the problem to another area.</P>
    <P>Projects such as this are part of the answer to making our streets safer. Funding has been provided for the coming years to extend this scheme to other locations, such as O'Connell Street, Grafton Street, Henry Street and to other city centre areas and outlying areas as well.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these measures, together with legislative changes and other strategies such as the comprehensive plans that I have announced to deal with the drugs problem, provide for a considered response to the problem of crime.  I am acknowledging that the task is one that requires continuous attention and continuous review of strategy.  As Minister for Justice, I am committed to the vigorous pursuit of this task as a matter of top priority not only for me but for the Government as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been telling the Minister for Justice since Christmas that 80 per cent of indictable crime is drug related.  I am pleased the Minister accepts that.  Will she accept that there are parts of Dublin city where the increase in crime is considerably higher than 2 per cent and that it has spiralled out of control?  Will she tell the House what precisely she intends to do in these areas in order to protect vulnerable people who live in or pass through these places?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I acknowledge there are parts of the city of Dublin where the level of crime would be higher than the average, as the provisional figures indicate. There is a direct correlation between the levels of crime in the inner city and the instance of heroin addiction. Most of the heroin addiction and the supply of heroin takes place inside Dublin city area and slightly outside the core of the city.  Most heroin addicts live in Dublin.  There is no doubt there is a direct link between people who are on heroin and the level of crime.  The measures I have outlined are being <Col N="575" /> implemented in these areas as well as all over Dublin.  I have had numerous discussions with the Garda Commissioner about my concerns that there are parts of Dublin city where crime levels are a great deal higher than they should be and I have asked him to be conscious of that when deploying the Garda Síochána.  I indicated in the Dáil that already this year the vast majority of the gardaí passing out from Temple-more are being deployed in the greater Dublin area.  This is one of the ways of getting to grips with crime.</P>
      <P>In relation to Deputy O'Donoghue's general inference that somehow nothing is happening in those areas, I have already said publicly that there is a link between the level of crime and the level of drug abuse and drug selling.  By and large, perpetrators of serious crime, including the drug trafficking that takes place in these areas of Dublin city, do not operate in a readily transparent and readily detectable way.  There is a complex system of agents and runners and a number of transactions can take place before drugs are actually delivered to the buyer.  The agent on the street may not be the person who is handling the drugs.  Detection becomes harder as the original perpetrator moves further away.  The principal requirement on which the Garda depend in these cases is good intelligence.  For that reason information technology systems are being expanded for the Garda so that they can make use of the most modern equipment and resources to get the intelligence they need to fight inner city crime.</P>

Even that statistic does not give me any joy in view of the fact that a number of crimes are still being committed with firearms.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3, 21, 29, 34, 50 and 114 together.</P>
      <P>It is common knowledge that there is pressure on the existing prison accommodation. However, the provision of additional prison accommodation is not the only way to tackle this problem.  As indicated in the Whitaker report and reflected in my Department's policy document <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan,</i> imprisonment should be imposed only as a last resort and an extensive range of alternatives should be available.  I am examining the possibilities for additional use of non-custodial options for treatment of offenders and in this regard I am currently preparing a submission to my colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>As a consequence of the peace process, some prison accommodation will be freed up, but it is necessary to take account of possible demands on that, such as the demand arising under the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons, which comes into effect from 1 November this year.</P>
      <P>The question of optimising the use of existing accommodation and of providing additional prison places continues to be examined in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="578" /> In parallel with my Department's examination, Deputies will be aware, that on 28 June this year I established the interdepartmental committee, consisting of representatives of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Justice, Health, Education, Enterprise and Employment and the Office of Public Works to examine all aspects of the Castlerea Prison project and report to me before the end of the year.  I have recently requested and received from the committee an interim report.  I am examining that report at present.  On completion of my own review of the situation and on full consideration of the report of the interdepartmental committee, I will then decide what course of action might be appropriate.</P>
    <P>As regards existing prison places, the position is that a total of 2,210 places are currently available as follows:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Finally, turning to the matter of costs incurred for the Castlerea prison project, my Department's expenditure on the project to 30 August 1995 has been £1,204,000 approximately in respect of the provision of a prison perimeter wall and associated works.  My advice is that there are no direct costs accumulating for my Department arising from the deferment of the project.  I am informed that the Department of Health in conjunction with the Western Health Board have, in relation to the closure of St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, approved <Col N="579" /> a package of developments for the Roscommon Mental Health Services costing £3.5 million, which includes the provision for Castlerea of a psycho-geriatric unit, a high support hostel, two medium support hostels and a vocational training workshop.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept the urgent need for additional prison accommodation?  Fifty prisoners approximately are granted temporary release every week and there has been an increase to 4,404 in the number of bail offenders in 1994.  Does the Minister intend to provide prison accommodation? Did she ask the Minister for Finance if the proposal for the prisons was cancelled or deferred?</P>

      <P>I do not know how many times I have answered the Deputy's questions and replied to this matter on the Adjournment.  The Castlerea project is deferred, not cancelled.  It was a decision of Government to defer it.  The interdepartmental committee is continuing its work and must report finally to me before the end of this year on its assessment.  I accept and acknowledge that there is huge pressure on prison places.  The Deputy can rest assured that I am as aware of that as he, and any decisions I make will take that into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>As a new Minister, when I first answered questions at Question Time I responded to questions on Castlerea prison and stated that Castlerea prison was proceeding and a very small amount of money was available to my Department in 1996.  There <Col N="580" /> is an inference that had the previous Government remained in office, the prison would have magically appeared overnight.  It would not have, of course. When I became Minister the planning was at a very early stage and tenders were being sought.  The work proceeded. In view of such issues as the peace process, the release of prisoners and so on, there was a need to examine the full process of providing prison places and adjusting the number of places that might become available because of the peace process and to generally look at the non-custodial area. That examination will be completed very shortly and I will bring my decisions to Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that only a very small number of places will become available as a result of the peace process and what is required is 600 prison places if bail restrictions are to be brought in?  Does she accept that there is no need for an assessment but that it is time to proceed with prison places?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Places will become available because of the peace process but the number will not be large, as the Deputy said.  I have seen the figure of 600 in reports and it has been stated in this House, but I suggest that figure was also available to the Fianna Fáil Government if it wanted to act on the matter.  I will bring proposals about bail to Government.</P>
      <P>I will work towards ensuring that fewer people will become involved in the revolving door syndrome so that we can have prison space adequate to our needs.  The increase in the need for prison space has been growing steadily for years and did not just happen when I took office in December 1994.  I am taking what steps I can to tackle the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Full temporary release is granted to offenders close to the end of their sentence and includes the requirements to be of good behaviour, to be of sober habits, and to report to the Garda Síochána at regular periods &mdash; usually daily.</P>
      <P>Other conditions may also be stipulated as appropriate to individual cases. This system has been available by statute since 1960 under the Criminal Justice Act of that year, and has been operated by all previous Ministers for Justice since then.</P>
      <P>As with other forms of temporary release, should an offender fail to comply with the conditions he or she may be arrested without warrant and immediately returned to custody.  The penalty for a breach of any of the conditions of temporary release is imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the good behaviour stipulation would apply to prisoners who have been granted temporary release.  In relation to that, will the Minister justify the reasons she had no figures for the numbers who had reoffended while on temporary release?  If it is a condition of temporary release that one should be of good behaviour one would imagine that should include not reoffending.  How can the Minister justify the absence of statistics on how many people had reoffended while on temporary release?  Surely it is in the public interest that the Minister and the House can be assured that people granted temporary release on her authority do not reoffend?  Who is monitoring the adherence or breach of the conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said previously in response to a parliamentary question, some statistics in the Department are not maintained in a way in which they can be immediately retrieved.  That is <Col N="582" /> not satisfactory but information technology and technology generally is being implemented in the prisons, in the courts and in the Garda Síochána in order to improve the situation.  I inherited a Department that did not have the facilities to retrieve the statistical information available.</P>
      <P>There are a number of forms of temporary release: full temporary release obviously means what it says and the sentence is not shortened in any way but prisoners are being allowed out earlier than their term in order to allow them to socialise again and to get used to the idea of being out.  It also allows them to be monitored to see how they are settling in.  In recent years, not just this year, an extra consideration for full temporary release is the extra pressure on prison places.  It is as plain to me as to everybody else that has been part of the reason.  However, the full temporary release system has existed since 1960 and would exist even if we had spare accommodation because it is seen as a system that is good for prisoners.  The impression is given that if we had enough prison places there would not be full timporary release but that is not the case and temporary releases have been granted for all sorts of reasons since 1960.</P>

      <P>The Minister states that this has been applied since 1960 but would she not admit that the number of people so released on full temporary release has increased from 1,979 in 1990 to 3,564 in 1993?  Is the Minister happy that nobody in her Department or in the prison service knows how many of the 3,564 people so released in 1993 have reoffended?  What will the Minister do about this completely unregulated interference with custodial sentences, which was recently criticised by the Prison Officers Association?  As the person with responsibility for the continuation of the practice of interfering with custodial sentences, what does the Minister intend doing to provide the House with information as to the adherence to and <Col N="583" /> monitoring of the conditions for temporary release?  What is the point of having conditions attached to temporary release orders if there is no monitoring of the adherence or of the breaching of those conditions?</P>

      <P>Persons on full temporary release usually have a small portion of their sentence still to serve.  Once that period is up, they are no longer part of the prison system.  In the interim between the granting of full temporary release and the completion of the sentence, they are obliged by conditions laid down, for example, reporting to a Garda station or being under the care of the probation and welfare service. There are no figures relating to persons who are no longer within the system because once their sentences are completed they are no longer under the control of the system.  Deputy O'Donnell's question related to the number of people granted early release who reoffend. I do not know the figures relating to those who have left the system. We are in the process of compiling the figures relating to the period between the granting of full temporary release and the expiration of the sentence.</P>

      <P>Work on the drafting of a Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill is receiving top priority in my Department and I expect to introduce the measure this session.  I should also mention that sections of the 1994 Criminal Justice Act which provide for the designation of certain Naval officers as <Col N="585" /> enforcement officers for the purposes of the Act are expected to be brought into force shortly to enable these officers to have power to stop, board, search and arrest in relation to drug trafficking at sea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the multifaceted package I announced in July will be able to go ahead.  Already much progress has been made on a number of the other non-legislative programmes. These include the operational and organisational changes required to make the different forces more efficient and more effective, for example, better co-operation between the Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners, Customs and Excise and the Navy.  These are operational changes which will not suffer from cutbacks in resources.  Practical work is already under way to improve liaison between the Garda Síochána and Customs and Excise and facilitate the creation of a joint task force.  I do not believe there will be any damage to these proposals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This criticism has been made.  That is why better co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the Revenue Commissioners is included in the package.  Even as we speak, they are meeting to bring proposals to Government by November on how better to operate the two systems.  Despite criticism of the Revenue Commissioners, they are still bound, as in any other <Col N="586" /> criminal investigation, to provide evidence in order to bring a prosecution.  It is not simply a case of knowing about somebody having considerable assets and getting tax from them.  They must also have evidence that the money was ill-gotten if they want to bring a criminal prosecution.</P>

      <P>I wish the Minister well in her task of preventing the importation of illicit drugs with her quite elaborate set of proposals.  International figures suggest that no matter how much money one throws at the issue, one may only stop 5 per cent of the total importation of drugs into any country.  Would the Minister agree that those figures stand up?  If so, would she agree that steps other than those envisaged in the new legislation will need to be taken?</P>

      <P>I cannot comment on international figures when I have no information about how they were gathered. I agree with the Deputy that, despite this package of measures, people who want to get drugs through will manage to do so without detection. The package I brought forward is not just a single issue package to try to stop drugs being imported.  It also involves health and education to tackle the use and abuse of drugs, targeted particularly at our young population who might be seduced by their peers into trying drugs. It is to ensure that we tackle the problem from all sides that the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach and the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, are involved.</P>

I am also considering other legislative changes that may be required to give increased powers to customs officers who will now be allowed to be present when gardaí are questioning a suspect.</P>
      <P>Even if changes were introduced regarding the right to silence, corroborating evidence would still have to be produced, rather than merely the fact that a person did not answer questions.

      <P>I have indicated that the law relating to pub and dance hall licences is antiquated, having been introduced in 1935. I do not believe any Member was attending dances at that time when they were very different from today. Members may not be aware that licences are granted to pubs and dance halls to hold dances or raves in September each year and that there is no provision for the gardaí to intervene until the following September.  That is wrong.  Even if the gardaí find drugs on a premises they cannot revoke the licence.  I have indicated to the gardaí that during the month of September I want them to vigorously oppose granting licences to the proprietors of premises where there is evidence that drugs are being sold or used on them.  A dance hall owner is at present serving a sentence having been prosecuted for allowing drugs to be sold on his premises.</P>
      <P>The 1935 law is antiquated and I am considering changing it.  If possible I will try to introduce the necessary changes by way of ministerial order to speed up the process rather than having to introduce additional legislation.</P>

      <P>I have already taken a number of significant steps to strengthen the hands of the gardaí in tackling so-called white collar fraud. The use of the term &ldquo;white collar crime&rdquo; somehow implies that this type of crime is respectable compared to other offences &mdash; I prefer to call it, what it is, serious fraud which covers such <Col N="589" /> offences as forgery, embezzlement, obtaining credit by fraud, falsification of accounts and the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that there are a number of statutes which were enacted in recent years containing provisions which are particularly relevant to the fight against serious fraud.  For example, the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, made computer hacking a criminal offence and the Criminal Evidence Act, 1992, allowed computer evidence to be admitted in evidence in criminal proceedings. In addition, the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, provides for the confiscation of criminal proceeds and enables the Garda Síochána, on foot of orders made by the District Court, to obtain access to information from banks etc., for the purpose of carrying out investigations into money laundering and other serious offences.  I also made a commencement order earlier this year bringing section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act into operation which requires financial bodies to take certain steps to assist in the detection and prevention of money laundering.  This section obliges a bank or building society, for example, to identify any person for whom it proposes to provide an ongoing service, such as opening an account or for whom it undertakes a transaction involving a sum in excess of £10,000.  In addition, identification must be carried out in any case where money laundering is suspected. Section 57 of the Act provides that a financial institution must make a report to the Garda Síochána where it suspects that money laundering is taking place in relation to its business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am at present preparing legislation on fraud and offences of dishonesty in general.  The work is well advanced and I intend to bring my proposals to Government later this year.  The legislation, which will be based on recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Fraud and the Law Reform Commission, will involve consolidating over half a dozen statutes dealing with dishonesty and strengthening the law in a <Col N="590" /> way which fully reflects the realities of modern day fraud.</P>
    <P>In April this year I established the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation in line with the recommendations contained in the report of the Government Advisory Committee on Fraud.  A chief superintendent was appointed straight away as head of the new bureau and he has been involved in the selection of suitable staff to increase the strength of the bureau to the level recommended by the advisory committee.  One inspector and three sergeants were assigned to the bureau on 14 September, 1995 and an additional inspector will be assigned there later this week.  Fourteen additional gardaí will also be assigned to the bureau on 5 October 1995.  Arrangements are also well advanced for the employment of full-time professional accountants for the bureau and these posts will be advertised shortly through the Civil Service Commission.  I have also made provision in this year's Estimates for the purchase of specialised fraud-related information technology equipment for the bureau and the requirements in this regard are being assessed at present.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we are serious in our endeavours to tackle fraud which has become far more sophisticated in modern times.  I have provided the additional manpower and resources to the Garda Síochána and I am determined to have the available legislation used to the full and the new legislation on fraud and offences of dishonesty published and enacted as quickly as I can to strengthen the powers of the gardaí and the courts.</P>

      <P>As a recent fraud awareness survey carried out by Stokes Kennedy and Crowley established that 39 per cent of top Irish companies admitted to having experienced fraud in the past two years and that at the very least £9.4 million was taken through such fraudulent means, does the Minister accept that the information technology in the fraud bureau needs to be <Col N="591" /> up-dated and that people with information technology skills need to be employed there as a matter of urgency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do and that is why, on taking up office, I proceeded as quickly as possible to set up the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation. As the establishment of such a bureau had been in the pipeline for some time before I took office, I was happy to be able to institute it immediately. Resources are now available for new fraud related information technology to be purchased and put into use by the bureau.  Members may be interested to know the level of cases going through the courts at any one time, covering such matters as false pretences, forgery, fraudulent conversion, embezzlement, obtaining credit by fraud, falsification of accounts and the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud.  There is nothing on our Statute Book called &ldquo;white collar crime&rdquo;; those are the crimes that are generally referred to in that manner.</P>
      <P>There were 438 commercial fraud cases reported in 1994 and 301 to date this year; there were 1,181 cheque-credit card fraud cases reported in 1994 and 605 to date this year.  A total of 187 people have been charged by the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation &mdash; the Fraud Squad &mdash; during 1994-95. There is a high level of this type of crime but in order to prosecute evidence has to be presented in court.</P>

I am not considering any proposals at present; it would be a matter for the Minister for Finance to decide what lists should be published in any newspaper relating to the non-payment of taxes.  I presume the Deputy is referring to the lists of those who owe back taxes and which everyone peruses when published.  If someone is convicted in court of fraud, it will be reported in the newspapers.  Just because they might be well off does not mean they will be allowed hide their name from the court.</P>

The Minister mentioned that 14 additional gardaí will be appointed in October.  Were these posts advertised internally or will they be open to those with particular qualifications, such as accountancy or other professional qualifications, which are essential in the investigation of fraud cases?  Was there <Col N="594" /> an enthusiastic response to the advertisement of these posts from within the Garda Síochána and, if not, what does the Minister propose to do?

      <P>The Minister has not answered a straight question which is directly related to Question No. 5 on the Order Paper.  If I put down a question or ask a supplementary question directly related to it I am entitled to a straight answer as a matter of course.  I again ask the Minister to give a straight answer to the question I posed, which was simple, lucid and clear.  I asked if the Minister for Justice was advised at any stage by the Garda authorities that there was an allegation of white collar fraud in semi-State companies and if she would be surprised if she were not so informed since the State is the shareholder. That is a straight and simple question and the Minister has an obligation to the House to answer it.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Juvenile crime, which refers to those who are under 18 years of age, is a matter deserving of the highest priority and a number of measures are being taken to specifically deal with the problem.  These measures reflect the complexity of the problem and represent a broad-based strategy designed to deal with the issue and the underlying causes.</P>
      <P>Firstly, the Government's renewal programme includes a commitment to introduce a Bill which will streamline the process of early intervention regarding juveniles who offend, examine Garda and court procedures in relation to them, provide for the involvement of their parents and deal with the need for suitable custodial facilities for those who require that type of intervention. To that end, juvenile justice legislation is being prepared in my Department which will replace the remaining provisions of the Children Act, 1908 with a comprehensive statute which will be responsive to modern conditions.  Great progress has been made between the three relevant Departments involved, Justice, Education and Health, under the guidance of Minister of State, Deputy Currie, and preparation of the legislation is advancing because of this progress.</P>
      <P>Secondly, the Garda national juvenile office is responsible for all matters relating to juveniles.  The office is responsible for the overall administration of the Garda juvenile diversion programme; development and implementation of the Garda schools' programme; supervision and support for Garda juvenile liaison officers, of whom there are in excess of 80 in the country; on-going liaison and contact with all statutory and non-statutory bodies involved in the area of juveniles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="598" /> As regards the Garda juvenile diversion programme, juvenile offenders who meet certain conditions may be dealt with under the scheme as an alternative to prosecution.  The programme provides for the cautioning of juvenile offenders under 18 years of age, subject to certain conditions, as an alternative to court proceedings.  The main aim of the programme is crime prevention through the education of young people as to their responsibilities both to themselves and to society in general and through the rehabilitation of those who commit crimes at a young age, by allowing them to acknowledge that their behaviour was wrong and assisting them to change their attitudes so that they can develop into mature and responsible adults.</P>
    <P>There are Garda juvenile liaison officers appointed in every Garda division in the country and these members are specifically selected for this work. They undergo relevant training and operate in a full-time capacity.  Juvenile liaison officers are involved in all aspects of youth work, both locally and in some cases nationally, through their involvement with youth clubs and organisations, by attending meetings and seminars and through visits to schools.  This involvement is aimed towards a greater appreciation of the Garda role in society and the importance of law observance.</P>
    <P>Juvenile offenders accepted into the programme may be dealt with by way of formal or informal caution and may be placed under the supervision of a juvenile liaison officer for a specified period. The programme is under constant review and assessment in all respects, including resources, staffing and administrative procedures.  Adjustments within the programme take place whenever and wherever appropriate.</P>
    <P>One of the aims of the Garda Síochána schools programme, which is now operating in every Garda division is to prevent crime.  The Garda Síochána have recently developed a resource package for members making presentations in relation to drugs. <Col N="599" /> Thirdly, there are a number of community based inter-agency projects funded by the Department of Justice. These projects specifically target young people at risk and are aimed at crime prevention.  Projects are in operation in Ronanstown (GRAFT), Tallaght (KEY), Limerick (Moyross) and Cork (Knocknaheeney and Holyhill).  A new project has recently been approved for Blanchardstown (WEB) and other proposed projects are receiving consideration.</P>
    <P>Finally, the probation and welfare service of my Department places considerable importance on diverting juvenile offenders referred by the courts into a variety of projects in the community with an educational and social skills focus.  One such project, currently under way in Cork, is designed to reduce the level of car crime.  The objective here is to get young persons involved in car crime to understand the seriousness of their behaviour by offering education and basic training in car maintenance, rules of the road and the consequences of car stealing, in particular, for victims and their families.</P>
    <P>A variety of projects developed in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway are kept under review and new interventions will be developed where possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was given a lengthy reply.  Is she aware that of all the young people who get into trouble only about 2 per cent could be described as sociopaths or psychopaths, those whom no one can do anything about? Will the Minister zero in on boys and girls aged under 15 years?  Is she aware that there are no secure detention centres for girls under 15 years of age and that the costs involved for a health board looking after such a girl, who may need round the clock surveillance, can amount to £100,000?  That is the figure I was given by the Eastern Health Board some time ago in the case of an uncontrollable young girl who kept burning down every place she was in.  Will the <Col N="600" /> Minister reconsider opening an under 15 secure detention centre, under the aegis of the Department of Justice, for sociopaths and psychopaths?  Is she aware that the Department of Education cannot deal with the type of young person who is totally out of control? Will she zero in on this?</P>
      <P>I am not concerned about the other 98 per cent of youngsters with whom one can deal.  Rather I am concerned about the 1.5 to 2 per cent of the sociopaths, or psychopaths on whom the Minister should concentrate and I promise her she will discover a large drop in current crime levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully understand and empathise with Deputy Briscoe's concerns raised repeatedly in the House.  I do not believe the treatment of children as young as 15 should include their becoming involved in the criminal justice system which is why this State always considered that their treatment, offenders or non-offenders, rather is a matter for the Departments of Health and Education.  If the Deputy tables a question to the Minister for Education he will receive a reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might inform the House of what has been happening to the young people about whom Deputy Briscoe speaks, to whom judges refer frequently and who have no secure place of accommodation. I am referring to those children deemed to be out of control and/or unruly.  The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, announced recently that a range of additional facilities would be developed to cater for children in conflict with the law or in need of care.  These will include the development of an additional 28 to 30 places for boys in the older, more serious category and the provision of four separate additional reformatory school places, including three secure places, for seriously disruptive girls, a continuous call on the part of many judges.  In addition to extra provision for young offenders, the Minister of State.  Deputy Currie, also announced that he would arrange for the establishment by health boards of a number of <Col N="601" /> special child care facilities for children found to be out of control, thus constituting a multi-faceted approach.  Indeed, the fact that his ministerial remit extends across the Departments of Health, Education and Justice means he is ideally placed to ascertain where those Departments and their differing roles should be dovetailed.  Under his guidance, and that of the interdepartmental committee, great progress has been made on the preparation of the juvenile justice Bill.  Many of the problems raised consistently by Deputy Briscoe will be solved when we have up to date legislation on our Statute Book to deal with the problems encountered by young people, especially when one bears in mind that some of the legislation with which we have been dealing dates back to 1908 when circumstances were very different.  With the advent of that Bill Deputy Briscoe can be assured that we will witness improvements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, three secure places. There are not that many young people coming through our courts who are so unruly they cannot be accommodated in Trinity House, Oberstown House or some other existing facility.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding the long treatise the Minister read on the role and success of the juvenile liaison officers scheme &mdash; I highly commend it and I am glad to note the Minister is still giving it the emphasis it deserves &mdash; is it not strange, though she referred belatedly to the forthcoming juvenile justice Bill promised by her predecessor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;she placed no emphasis on her perception of the role or responsibility of parents which I have been exploring at public and private <Col N="602" /> meetings for many years?  Has the Minister and/or her officials had an opportunity to study the reports of the committee on crime presented to her Department?  That committee engaged in much research and focused on this very issue.  Does she accept that to target a multi-faceted programme to address juvenile, disorientation and/or anti-social behaviour, while neglecting to focus on the role parents can play in addressing this serious, growing problem is remiss of her?  Will the Minister give views on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the little bit of <i>contretemps</i> at the beginning of my reply distracted Deputy Liam Fitzgerald somewhat, in which case I must reiterate that I did answer the question fully. For example, I said that the &ldquo;commitment to introduce a Bill which will streamline the process of early intervention&rdquo; in relation to juveniles who offend, examine Garda and court procedures in relation to them, provide for the involvement of their parents and deal with the need for suitable custodial facilities for those who require that type of intervention comprise some of the main headings of the appropriate Bill and will cover all such elements.  Indeed, the Bill is long overdue which is why difficulties are being encountered within the system needing to be addressed urgently, one of which is parental involvement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give us the benefit of her wisdom on what she perceives to be the merits of a greater focus on parental responsibility?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The relevant Bill is in course of preparation and the various studies and Deputy Fitzgerald's references to experiences in other countries are being examined within its ambit.  It is not for me to anticipate what might be included in it before it is approved by Cabinet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that we have the highest rate of juvenile offenders <Col N="603" /> within the member states of the Council of Europe is the Minister taking any action to accommodate such offenders being aware that Wheatfield Prison was established specifically for them but which, because of overcrowding, can no longer house them as orignally intended?  With regard to the accommodation of juvenile offenders in St. Patrick's Institution, how can the Minister justify 2,227 committals of juveniles to that institution in 1993, it having a capacity for 122 only at any given time? Would she agree that that institution is being presented with thousands of such offenders, committed by the courts, leading to a revolving door syndrome of juvenile offenders being released into the community there being no other place for them within the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be happy to reply to many of those questions when we reach the question tabled by Deputy O'Donnell on St. Patrick's Institution but Deputy Briscoe's question refers to crime by people under 18 years of age, the responsibility for whom falls within the remit of the Departments of Health and Education rather than that institution.</P>
      <P>The young people committed to St. Patrick's Institution and Wheatfield, of whom there are many, are aged between 18 and 21 years, thus comprising a separate segment of our prison population.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the juvenile justice Bill, is it the intention of the Minister and her Department to keep children out of places of detention in so far as possible, perhaps providing day centres for their accommodation? Is it her intention, that of her Department and the Government, to introduce curfew orders in respect of such juvenile offenders?  Is it the intention that parents be required to sign bonds testifying that their children will be of good behaviour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It should be the objective <Col N="604" /> of any humane society to keep very young children out of places of detention. That is why my reply, while somewhat lengthy, was necessary to inform Members on how we deal at present with juveniles, with the Garda juvenile diversion programme and juvenile liaison officers which will be included in the relevant Bill, thus encompassing all methods we can devise, based on our experiences and those elsewhere, to keep young people out of such places of detention.  The issues such a parental control, curfew orders and the like are being examined at present by the Interdepartmental Committee on Education, Health and Justice so that the best possible legislative provision, incorporating the best, most recent, knowledge and experience available to us, can be included in what will be the first major review of that legislation since 1908.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred earlier to the use of the juvenile diversion programme as an alternative to prosecution.  Is the Minister happy that when the juvenile diversion programme option is chosen by the DPP there is sufficient follow-up supervision of those involved when they are still at large in the community?  Is the Minister aware that some of the young people who offend would have made admissions of serious sexual offences and that this alternative to prosecution is slack? Complaints have been made to me by the parents of children abused by offenders who were then put on diversion programmes rather than prosecuted, that it was a loose arrangement and that these people were not adequately supervised.  They had only to report infrequently to a social worker or a juvenile liaison officer.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that where the juvenile diversion programme is used as an alternative to prosecution of serious sexual offences by young people it will have to be tight to reassure the public that reoffending will not occur while the person is in the so-called care of the juvenile diversion programme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the juvenile diversion scheme should be used as effectively and tightly as possible and I am satisfied it is.  I know the case to which the Deputy alluded as she has been in contact with my office about it.  The decision as to who will go on that scheme is taken very carefully.  It is not a means of avoiding paying the price for an awful offence; it is considered if the person is of a young age and it is felt they would benefit from the scheme rather than being detained.  It is important that those who will be part of the juvenile liaision programme are carefully selected and I am assured they are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister target the small 1.5 to 2 per cent of young people with the interdepartmental committee? This is an opportunity for the Minister to take solid action.  That small percentage translates into not more than 120 young people in the country.  If the Minister can tackle that hard core of ringleaders she will make a large impact on crime.  Most of the children can be dealt with and respond to proper treatmenat and care.  However, there are also out of control young people whose parents plead with the State to take action. If the Minister could focus on that small number it would be the key to the solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise the Deputy's concern.  They are a section of the juvenile offenders who are being carefully targeted in the preparation of this legislation, not only as to how they would be treated but also as to how detention facilities might be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be happy to answer a question on the freedom of information Bill if one is put down, but it is not a matter included in this question.  I am constrained in what I can say about the two cases before the courts.  The charges involved relate to alleged unauthorised communication of official information contrary to sections 4 (1) and 13 of the Official Secrets Act.  The question of whether to take a prosecution is a matter for the Garda and not for me or the Government.  There is no conflict, therefore, with what the Government may say.  As the Deputy knows, it is a matter for the Garda to prepare a case and approach the DPP if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the freedom of information Bill the Deputy might put down a separate question.  The discussions <Col N="608" /> between my Department and the other relevant Department in that matter are ongoing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying she has no view as to whether it might be considered a vindictive act to take a prosecution against a journalist for making public a document which seriously embarrassed the Government and the Garda in relation to the Allied Brinks robbery?

      <P>I can only repeat what I said.  I am constrained in what I can say in answering Deputy O'Donnell's question, in that my answer may not confirm or deny whether the case to which she refers is one of the two cases.  If the Deputy wishes to imply that I or the Government demanded that the Garda take a prosecution in this or any other case, that is not so.  Because a prosecution is pending or a case is being taken she is trying to draw an inference that it has something to do with us.  It is purely a matter for the Garda and those who feel they have been wronged to take such a case.  It has nothing to do with the Government being open, transparent and accountable &mdash; which it is &mdash; because the prosecution and judicial processes are independent of Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 39 together.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1994 provides that applications for confiscation orders against persons convicted on indictment of drug trafficking offences and non-drug trafficking offences may be made by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Act also provides that applications for restraint orders freezing assets which may be liable to realisation if a confiscation order is imposed may be made by the DPP.  In this regard, I understand from the DPP's office that the DPP made applications to court for restraint <Col N="610" /> orders in two cases as I informed the Dáil on 11 May in answer to a parliamentary question.  However, I understand the DPP subsequently withdrew one order because he did not intend to proceed with the prosecution.  The second case is still being processed.</P>
      <P>An application for a confiscation order has not been made under the provisions of the Act.  As the Deputy will be aware, the DPP is independent in the exercise of his functions and I am not in a position to make any further detailed comment about these cases.  However, this legislation is an essential tool in bringing major criminals to justice and I am anxious that it be used to its full potential.  This issue of a prosecution ultimately rests with the Garda and the DPP, based on the evidence gathered.</P>

      <P>I realise the Minister cannot go into detail but is she satisfied this provision of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 is being implemented to the degree one would wish?  I am sure she agrees it is surprising only two applications were made despite a considerable number of convictions for the supply of drugs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the commencement order for the relevant sections of the Act were only signed in March and May this year so it is still somewhat early to measure the effectiveness of the provisions &mdash; we need a longer period.  I know the Garda are vigorously pursuing the so-called &ldquo;drug barons&rdquo;.  As prosecutions are instituted and convictions obtained, we will see this legislation being used more. It is still too early to assess the use and full potential of the Act but I will watch closely to ensure all its terms are effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government policy agreement contains a commitment to introduce legislation to abolish ground rents as a specific lien on residential property and convert them into normal commercial debt.  I am examining the measures which would be necessary to give effect to this with a view to putting the matter before Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to see the programme for Government is being pursued by the Minister.  Does she join in my concern for the approximately 250,000 householders whose ground landlords, as the law stands, can claim one-eight of the value of the property when the lease expires?  This leaves many people in an invidious position. Will she bring in the necessary legislation to give homeowners the simple freehold of their land on the expiry of the lease?  As property values rise, she will be aware that one-eight of the value of a property may be substantial and hundreds of thousands of homeowners in Dublin, Limerick and Cork will be faced with bills of as much as £10,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Ground rent has given rise to concern in many areas, especially where it is hard to track down ground landlords.  This commitment in the Programme for Government has been examined in the Department to see how it can be fulfilled.  Complex legal and constitutional issues are bound up with ground rent so I cannot give any indication at this stage as to when the legislation will be ready to bring to Government.  I have a comprehensive programme of law reform in areas mentioned earlier such as drugs, and am giving them top priority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The nature of what is proposed in the Government programme is relatively limited.  The obligation to pay ground rents would still remain although the legal nature of the debt would change. The Deputy will be aware that to go <Col N="612" /> beyond that &mdash; to seek to abolish ground rents without compensation &mdash; would be unconstitutional and would have to be considered carefully.</P>
    <P>On the positive side, the Deputy may know the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) Act, 1978 prevents the creation of new ground rents on dwelling houses, so any difficulties which exist are diminishing.  Also, 64,000 people have so far availed of the special purchase scheme introduced in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act, 1978 and subsequently extended indefinitely by the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Act, 1987.  The intention of that scheme was to provide a ready means by which any person can in effect abolish ground rent payable on a dwelling house.  That is not available to everyone because of the occasional legal complexity in the ownership of ground rents and houses but the scheme exists and I urge the Deputy to assist his constituents if he thinks they can avail of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in Deputy Byrne's question because a number of my constituents are in this position.  Could the Minister explain in more detail what she means by converting ground rents to a commercial debt?  In her reply to Deputy Byrne's supplementary question, she said there were constitutional implications and an onus to compensate property owners. Deputy Byrne's party has vociferously articulated the opposition to ground rents for many years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I support that.  Does the Minister think the real objection of householders to the concept of ground rent cannot be addressed because the Minister is sidestepping the issue by calling it something else, while the principal objection remains?  Has she or have her officials consulted ACRA and is that body satisfied with the alternative proposals being drafted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="613" />
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said to Deputy Byrne, the matter is being examined in my Department, although it is not receiving the same priority as some of the other issues we discussed earlier. The Deputy will accept that in the same way as we all have to create priorities in our lives, the onus rests on me, as Minister, to create priorities in my Department. I know that submissions from ACRA have been received and examined in my Department and any requests to officials preparing this legislation will be accepted.  I extend that invitation to the Deputy if he knows people in ACRA who want to talk to them.</P>
      <P>As he knows, there is an ongoing campaign to abolish ground rents and the proposals in the Programme for Government are to change the lien on the property.  At present, the landlord owed ground rent may seek to have a judgment mortgage registered against the property for the amount of the debt.  One of the problems is that that puts a debt on the mortgage of the house, whereas if we changed the nature of the debt it would not prevent sales of houses and so on as it would be an ordinary debt.</P>
      <P>However, as I say, the matter will receive further study and perhaps the Deputy can ask me what progress has been made in a few months' time when I am next listed for priority Question Time.  In the meantime, I extend that invitation to discuss the matter with the officials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> When we last had a debate on divorce in 1986, the tactics of fear and intimidation adopted by both sides in the campaign left a sour taste all round and were quite frightening. I would like to think that we, as a nation, have matured since then and have become more tolerant and accepting of each other's views.  I hope that the debate this time will be more reasoned and calm and that the firmly held views and opinions of both sides will be tolerated and respected between now and polling day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate in the Dáil on divorce has been interesting with many divergent views, which are firmly held and believed on both sides.  There are Deputies in all political parties who are for and against divorce and Fianna Fáil is no different from any other party &mdash; over the past few days some of our Deputies have spoken in favour of divorce while others have been totally opposed.  The only difference is that the anti-divorce Deputies in Fianna Fáil have given their views and ideas in this House while Members of other parties seem to have been silenced.  I hope that Deputies, particularly in Fine Gael, who <Col N="770" /> have expressed their views privately or otherwise will speak in this House on why they are opposed to divorce.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with holding a referendum as it is the very essence of democracy.  We, as legislators, must give the people an opportunity to decide to say yes or no to divorce.  Irish voters are a highly sophisticated and intelligent electorate and will make the right decision at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Taylor, is a very reasonable man whom I had the pleasure of working with when we were in Government with the Labour Party. He should clarify once and for all during this debate how he proposes to spend the £500,000 of public money allocated for this referendum.  There seems to be a great deal of confusion and the public is very annoyed at the secrecy surrounding this expenditure.  We heard that an advertising agency has been selected to undertake a national advertising campaign to promote a yes vote, which is very wrong.  During a recent referendum campaign, the then leader of Fine Gael, now the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, said that he would like to see moneys allocated for referenda being used to give both sides of the argument.  Taxpayers' money should not be used to fund one side of a particular argument &mdash; it should be made available to both sides.  This is Government propaganda at its best and the public is very annoyed by the way it has been handled.</P>
    <P>The issue of divorce and remarriage was always going to be a difficult problem for legislators and society.  While we have a very strong family tradition, I accept that marriage breakdown is a reality of life and affects some families, including those of TDs.  Although our marriage breakdown rate is less than 5 per cent any marriage breakdown is a tragedy for the couple and the children involved &mdash; who, more often than not, are the ones who really get hurt.</P>
    <P>However, rushing down the road of legal remedies may not be the only answer to marriage breakdown.  Surely, we are obliged to look at other options <Col N="771" /> and to try to find the reasons for marriage breakdown.  Issues such as poverty, bad housing and unemployment are major causes of marriage breakdown and are also leading to the decline in marriage among young people.  There has been a sharp decline in marriage over the last eight years: in 1986 there were 18,500 marriages while there were only 16,200 marriages in 1994.  The lack of a job, inability to get a house and high mortgages have a devastating effect on those who wish to marry.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party has put forward a number of proposals for enhancing the status of marriage and saving marriages through counselling.  In the past, tremendous counselling services were provided by the church and voluntary organisations.  The time has come for the Government and all of us to look at providing proper funds for skilled, professional counselling services throughout the country.  These services exist in Dublin and some of the other major cities but are not as strong or well funded in rural areas.  It is essential to look at the whole area of providing skilled professional counselling &mdash; in other words, saving marriages through counselling.</P>
    <P>Helping families in need is another area we must look at.  There must be State support for families under stress, including household budgeting, money advice centres and personal development courses.  We should also look at education for marriage.  It is very important that young people are educated and prepared for marriage as a life long relationship.  The school curriculum can be used for this purpose.  Children and young people should learn about the importance of marriage as a source of well-being for most adults and of its importance for the stability and general welfare of society.  We have seen too often in the past young people getting married without any knowledge of the responsibilities and, more importantly, without any adequate funding for providing a home or resources.  We have seen pregnant young people rushed into marriages which do not work.  This area <Col N="772" /> has to be looked at seriously.  Our young people should be educated to see life long marriage as a desirable status for adult life and the Government should develop an educational programme of this kind as quickly as possible.  We should look at mediation and protection for our children.  Our spokesman, Deputy Woods, has proposed that a commissioner for children, attached to the courts, be appointed.</P>
    <P>We should look seriously at the upgrading of family courts.  The type of courts we have is a cause of scandal, especially in rural Ireland.  The Circuit Court in country towns hears family law cases only one day every three months, or four days a year.  Delays of from over one year to 18 months are average before a person gets his or her case to court.  It is a scandal that should be tackled immediately.  We should have, at the least, increased numbers of Circuit Court judges.  We should have separate family law courts with specialist judges in country areas, as is currently the practice in Dublin, together with the upgrading of court houses to provide private consultation rooms and waiting rooms to ensure that spouses do not have to wait together.  From my knowledge of the courts system in rural areas, it is clear that it is totally inadequate and undesirable, given what families are expected to put up with.</P>
    <P>At present there are 75,000 people in broken marriages.  There are 29,000 unmarried mothers, 15,000 deserted wives and approximately 8,000 separated spouses.  Many of these cases have arisen because of violence, abuse and other reasons.  All political parties have taken credit in recent months for the number of pieces of legislation that have been introduced since 1986.  I welcome the legislation introduced by different Governments and I compliment Ministers on introducing legislation that has benefited women especially in many instances.  For example, the deserted wife's allowance has been substantially increased, the lone parent's allowance and the unmarried mother's allowance have been improved and better rights <Col N="773" /> for part time workers have been introduced. This is very important because in many cases where the wife finds herself no longer supported by the husband she has had to take up part-time work, too often with little rights.  Legislation recently introduced to address this area is welcome as it provides for proper redundancy payments, proper holiday leave and holiday payments for many part-time workers, many of whom are women.</P>
    <P>I would not be in favour of divorce.  I am concerned about the implications it would have for children.  This has not been well researched or thought through properly.  We should consider seriously many of the solutions I have suggested to deal with the problem of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>It is important that the views of the people be reflected in the House.  Too often in the past Deputies who have been prepared to speak out on what they believe to be right have been described as backwoodsmen, bogmen, countrymen or whatever.  While I respect the views of the media, ultimately the people will decide &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  While I am not in favour of divorce, I will not be shoving my view down the throats of the people I represent in County Wexford.  It is only right that I make my views known to the constituents I represent.  It is, however, up to constituents to reflect between now and polling day and to decide what they believe is best.</P>
    <P>I take exception to recent remarks made by Mr. Niall Stokes, chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission, when he said that approximately 20 Deputies in the Fianna Fáil Party and the Fine Gael Party should be banished from Dáil Éireann because of their views.  We are elected to this House by the people of our constituencies. Mr. Stokes has been appointed chairman of the Independent Radio and Television Commission because of his political affiliations.  I invite him to stand in Wexford, Dublin or anywhere he chooses to see if he would get elected to this House.  If he does, I will be the <Col N="774" /> first to congratulate him.  However, I will certainly not tolerate a man who has been given a high powered position in the area of communications saying that Deputies in the Fine Gael Party or the Labour Party are not fit to represent their constituents in the House.  The House accommodates all kinds of Deputies.  The people of the constituencies we represent have some type of respect for us when they return us here year after year.  Mr. Stokes should go jump in the lake or wherever he likes.</P>
    <P>My views are personal.  I believe I should put them on the record of the House because they are views which I believe I should communicate to the people whom I represent in my constituency. However, I will not be shoving them down the necks of any of them.</P>

      <P>I concur with the latter points expressed by Deputy Browne regarding the opinions expressed by a column writer outside the House about certain Members within it.  In preparing a few words I had decided not to dignify such trash with a reply.  Deputy Browne has dealt adequately with the matter.</P>
      <P>All of us bring certain perspectives and personal experiences to this debate. I am fortunate in that I come from a stable family background.  My parents are happily married.  I am single so my views cannot be informed by any direct experience of the state of marriage.  As a Catholic I hope the proposals before the House for enactment will never directly impact on me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A fact which gives me considerable discomfiture is that I represent a constituency which has invariably found itself at variance with the so called liberal agenda.  In the 1986 referendum my constituency voted approximately 80 per cent against the referendum proposals. In view of this, I differ from the personal and political opinions of the <Col N="775" /> majority of the people in my constituency.</P>
    <P>However, there is a more rational, sane and temperate attitude to much of the debate on this occasion than was the case nine years ago.  I have had informal discussions with many people in my constituency on this matter, some of whom I agree with, but with many of whom I disagree.  However, there is an element of willingness to agree to differ in the present debate which is welcome.</P>
    <P>It would be hypocritical of me if I were to see myself solely as a mouth piece for my constituents on this issue. It is our duty to explain why we believe the proposal before the House is laudable. In the wider context, much ado has been made of the fact that the Government is spending State funding on this issue.  On such a complex issue it behoves the Government to ensure that the facts are clearly spelt out to the public in a coherent fashion.</P>
    <P>Whatever about personal experiences, there is an inescapable, unavoidable context to this whole debate, which is the enormity of the problem of marital breakdown.  In 1986 much of the debate was characterised by those who wished to have the proposals rejected on the basis that the introduction of divorce would destabilise marriage and lead to marriage breakdown.  The sad reality is that the rate of marriage breakdown has increased enormously even in the absence of divorce.  A Central Statistics Office survey shows that in 1986 18,000 marriages were categorised as broken while this figure had increased to 38,000 by 1993.  There are approximately 76,000 people directly involved in marriages which have broken down while an indeterminable number of other people, children and family members, suffer the pain and human misery associated with marriage breakdown.  It behoves us as legislators to tackle the realities of marriage breakdown rather than to legislate for an aspirational or Utopian society which clearly does not exist even in the absence of divorce.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> This debate is essentially about the right to remarry.  Apart from the legislation which will give people the right to remarry, all the necessary legislation to deal with the problems associated with marriage breakdown has been put in place.  It is important to give recognition to those people in second unions and who have had children with their new partners.  Since the introduction of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which further recognised the reality of marriage breakdown, there have been more than 9,000 applications for judicial separations.  In 1993 there were more than 4,400 applications for barring orders.  These statistics are testament to the enormous human misery suffered by people whose marriages have broken down.</P>
    <P>Even though the age profile of the population suggests that an increasing number of people should be getting married the reality is that since 1986 there has been a decline of more than 2,000 in the number of people getting married.  These statistics are proof positive that there is an enormous problem in society which requires the urgent attention of the Legislature and which can only be tackled by gaining the approval of the electorate to a constitutional amendment which will allow for remarriage.</P>
    <P>There has been much debate on whether this matter should be dealt with by way of a simple amendment to the Constitution and a consequent legislative response.  There is no need to remind Deputies that the public are sceptical of politics and politicians.  We must strive to bring this distrust to an end and build up trust in legislators. While there is a culture which recognises the sanctity of marriage and its positive contribution to the good of society, it is also recognised that many marriages have broken down.  However, people want assurances that in responding to that problem they do not open the gate and allow in floodwaters which will wash away the stability they have come to associate with the family <Col N="777" /> and marriage.  This is why the Government has proposed that the broad terms under which a decree of divorce may be granted should be written into the Constitution. These are as follows: couples must have lived apart for four of the five previous years, there is no prospect of reconciliation and proper provision is made for spouses and children.</P>
    <P>The other fundamental problem associated with divorce relates to property. There is a letter to this effect in today's edition of <i>The Cork Examiner.</i> To use this issue as a mechanism to secure a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote is patently dishonest. The legislative machinery is already in place to deal with all aspects of marital breakdown and adequate and proper provision is made for spouses and children. In my constituency people have many concerns about family farms, milk quotas and property in general.  In the context of the money which will be spent, it should be made clear that there is a deliberate campaign of misinformation on these issues.  The provisions to deal with these issues are already in place and people should not seek to distort the facts.</P>
    <P>It has been stated that the Government is anti-family.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  In general, this House is pro-family and there is no conspiracy to destroy the pillars of society which have served us well.  Nevertheless there is an obligation on us to recognise the realities.  We have invested enormous amounts of money in counselling services provided by the church and voluntary organisations which carry out excellent work and the family mediation service.  We have set up the Commission on the Family which will report to the Government and the Joint Committee on the Family which will report to the House.  We have also increased from 16 to 18 years the age at which people can get married.  These measures and the consensus on their introduction prove that there is no anti-family movement or conspiracy within the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>In his foreword to a new book &ldquo;The Physics of Star Trek&rdquo; by the <Col N="778" /> American astronomer, Lawrence Krauss, Professor Stephen Hawking acknowledges that time travel is possible. He says: &ldquo;One of the consequences of rapid interstellar travel would be that one could also travel back in time&rdquo;.  Professor Hawking, who is one of the world's greatest scientists this century, is also quoted in the 1 October edition of <i>The Sunday Times</i> as stating: &ldquo;If you combine Einstein's theory of relativity with quantum theory, it does begin to seem a possibility&rdquo;.  If Professor Hawking visits this island in the coming weeks he will discover that not only is travelling back in time a possibility but it is a factual reality.  The additional building block required to power the necessary quantum leap back in time has now been fully constructed by some of those groups and organisations campaigning against constitutional change.</P>
      <P>The contribution so far by the Anti-Divorce Campaign Group and the No Divorce Campaign Group is based on the pretence that we are still locked in a 1986 time warp.  They believe that all that is required to continue to lock the casualties of broken marriages into a constitutional twilight zone is to dust off and regurgitate the 1986 slogans, having sprinkled them with a smattering of 1990s public relations sound bites.  I believe that many of those who trusted the slogans in 1986 or were frightened by the scare stories into voting &ldquo;no&rdquo; will vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; this time because of their experiences and understanding of social reality.  In addressing the personal tragedy and trauma of those whose marriages have collapsed many people now recognise that it is time to end our constitutional groundhog days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1986 we were told that the prohibition on divorce in the Constitution prevented marriages breaking down. The Labour Force Survey published that year showed there were 37,000 separated people in the State while the 1994 survey shows that this figure had increased to 75,000.  Is it not now time for those who oppose constitutional change to explain what they said in 1986 and why they got it so wrong?  In 1986 <Col N="779" /> Mr. William Binchy and others warned that if we allowed for divorce the rate of marriage breakdown would double within a decade.  A majority voted against divorce, yet the rate of marital breakdown doubled in less than a decade. I challenge William Binchy, Joe McCarroll and all those campaigning against change to acknowledge the reality that the presence of the prohibition on divorce in the Constitution makes no contribution to ensuring the success or viability of anyone's marital relationship.  Marriages break down for a variety of complex reasons and neither constitutional nor legislative measures can ensure all marriages are harmonious, loving and successful.</P>
    <P>It is fortuitous that the referendum in 1986 failed.  What would be happening today if it had been successful?  We would be confronted by statistics which would show a dramatic rise in the number of separated couples and we would be told that the sole cause for the increase in the number of marriages collapsing was the availability of divorce. The groups and individuals now campaigning for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote would be actively seeking a new referendum to reinstate the prohibition earlier removed.  About that, there can be no doubt.  Despite their success in 1986 they now choose to ignore social reality and the fact that their social analysis of the importance of the constitutional prohibition in protecting marriages has been proved entirely wrong.</P>
    <P>A central issue in the current debate relates to what we mean by marriage and what it is about it that is valued. Central to marriage is love about which we have not heard a great deal to date. Also central to marriage is partnership and the capacity of a couple to interact with each other in a harmonious, compatible and understanding way.  When the love is gone, the relationship has broken down, normal communications end and a couple separate.  The marriage is essentially over.  What is the purpose in maintaining as the legal fiction <Col N="780" /> a marriage which is long since sadly dead and buried?</P>
    <P>It is far too easy in this debate for either side to make generalised sweeping statements in authoritative tones about the lives of others.  Frequently, those statements have no reality or application to one's life and there is no basis for assuming they are of any real relevance to anyone else's life.  What do I mean by that?  The prohibition on divorce is seen by those opposed to change as binding people together in marriage who would, if divorce were available, separate, divorce and swiftly marry someone else.  Divorce, the slogan goes changes marriage from a permanent to a temporary relationship.  What the slogan means is that every night in this State husbands and wives go to bed together quietly saying to themselves that they are doing so only because divorce is prohibited.  What this slogan means is that every morning husbands and wives stepping out of bed sneak a sideways glance at their marital partner and think if only divorce were available I would not be here.</P>
    <P>That profoundly depressing and distorted view of marriage has no basis in social reality.  That perspective of marriage is alien to the overwhelming majority of people in this State who perceive the central ingredients in their marriage to be love, trust and partnership. In the world of those campaigning against change, love, trust and partnership appear to play no central role of importance in marriage.  Love, trust and partnership are the essential ingredients and binding force in marriage which makes it so fulfilling.  The constitutional prohibition on divorce does not play any such role.</P>
    <P>I ask all those who are committed to their marriage and who believe in the importance of marriage if they are only living with their husband or wife because of the constitutional prohibition on divorce?  If living with one's husband or one's wife is not due to the presence of a constitutional prohibition on divorce, why would one believe any other man or woman here is only living with <Col N="781" /> his or her husband or wife because of the prohibition?  I put that question also to those members of Fianna Fáil who today, and earlier, made it clear that they oppose constitutional change.  I also pose the question as to whether anyone who lives in the Republic truly believes that married couples in Northern Ireland, be they of a majority or a minority religion are any less committed to their marriages than those who live in the Republic because of the availability of divorce in Northern Ireland for almost 60 years?</P>
    <P>It is time to move away from the slogans and to talk about and confront reality.  What is the position today?  In particular what has happened since 1986?  In the period 1986 to 1994, 35,000 applications were made by spouses to our courts seeking barring orders to obtain protection from violence or other conduct which threatened their safety or welfare or the safety or welfare of their children.  The vast majority of those applications were made by wives.  A total of 16,000 barring orders were made in that period.  In many instances the issuing of barring proceedings did not result in a court hearing and orders being made, but in couples agreeing to separate.</P>
    <P>In the same period more than 20,000 applications were brought by wives for maintenance support against their husbands and there were in the region of 18,000 custody cases between separated or separating couples.  Since the commencement of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, which I put through the House and which became operative in 1989, approximately 12,000 separation proceedings have been instituted.  In 1994 there were 23,000 separated spouses, mostly wives, in receipt of single parent allowance, deserted wives benefit and deserted wives allowance.</P>
    <P>To deny a battered wife or an abandoned husband the opportunity of a second chance and the possibility of experiencing a happy married life with another can serve no social policy purpose. To do so is an extraordinary <Col N="782" /> cruelty.  To advocate that denying the possibility of a new marriage to a battered wife or an abandoned husband who has been separated for more than four years, in some way bolsters and protects other people's marriages is not only a perversion of truth, but a distorted view of marriage and what is central to the preservation of the marriage relationship.</P>
    <P>This referendum is about extending to those whose marriages have long since died the opportunity to remarry. It is about that and about giving them hope for a better and happier future. The agenda of those opposed to constitutional change is essentially to extinguish that hope.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate, to make my position on divorce clear and to support my party's position on it.  As a party, we support the right to remarry and recommend a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the forthcoming referendum.</P>
      <P>I commend the political parties, particularly my party, which, since the failed referendum in 1986, introduced legislative measures that largely dealt with the issues raised prior to that referendum. Some people in the rush to oppose the proposal in the forthcoming referendum forget that much of the legislation introduced in recent years was radical.  It was very much at the cutting edge of social legislation.  It was compassionate and well thought out legislation the reason for which people, not only in this House but in the public domain, could understand.  Those steps were taken by successive Governments to face the social reality that sadly exists here.  We are not unique in that.  That situation exists in every country and is one with which we must come to terms. We do not have a choice in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong to suggest that we should retain the <i>status quo</i>.  That does not contribute anything to the development of society here or the improvement of social legislation.  Many measures have been introduced, including judicial separation legislation.  I despair when <Col N="783" /> listening to those who speak of divorce as if it is the beginning of the process when it is the end of what is a very painful, difficult procedure involving a couple and their children.  I have no doubt that people do not want to see their marriages end but when they do they might want to be divorced.  We must approach the issue in those terms.</P>
    <P>I read articles in recent weeks written by people outside this House who oppose divorce.  Most of the arguments advanced in them are based on technical legal language as if the whole debate is being discussed in the abstract and compassion and humanity appear to be missing.  That is disheartening and, in some respects, dishonest, but it does not diminish the need for a proper legal framework to ensure that people separating or contemplating divorce understand the implications for the status of their children and their status concerning property and pension rights.  Those issues must be properly dealt with, but the question of humanity is far more important than all the other issues combined.</P>
    <P>If we were to ask the vast majority of people whether they opposed the right of people to remarry, I believe the consistent view would be that they do not. Unfortunately, when we deal with the issue as we are doing now, it is hijacked by high flying legal minds who seek to complicate the issue to such a degree that it raises unnecessary and baseless fears.  Such fears diminish the confidence of people to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in this referendum.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to take up the argument as to whether this provision should be written into the Constitution or whether the period a couple must live apart should be three or four years.  I might have some views on that but the sacrosanct issue in this debate is the right to remarry and it is on that issue I wish to focus.  The amendment to the Constitution brought forward by the Government deals with that issue and, if passed by the people, will allow for <Col N="784" /> divorce under a strict and narrow regime and, if the opportunity arises, the chance to remarry.</P>
    <P>I reject the notion that the introduction of divorce will somehow put all marriages under threat.  Marriage is tough enough for all of us.  I am married with four young children and I am aware of the difficulties of marriage but it is nonsense to suggest that my marriage will be threatened by the introduction of divorce.  It would be sad to think that the only thing holding my marriage and the marriages of hundreds of thousands of people together was the existence of a legal situation which prevented me from dissolving that marriage. I do not believe that to be the case and it is a falsehood to suggest that it is so.  We are dealing here with the painful reality of marriage breakdown. Many people, following much soul searching and trauma, have come to the conclusion that it would be better for them to dissolve their marriages.</P>
    <P>It is not true to suggest that because divorce may be allowed, individuals will rush out within weeks of getting divorced and marry somebody else.  We are allowing people time to reflect on their situation and perhaps have the opportunity of forming a second relationship which may or may not lead to a second marriage.  There is nothing compulsory in this and I do not believe people will see the introduction of divorce as an opportunity to remarry after a divorce. It will probably be the case that only one of the spouses involved will remarry but that choice should exist under Irish law.  It is the compassionate and honest approach.</P>
    <P>We all know people who are in second relationships, some of whom have been in those relationships for 20 or 30 years.  They have reared families, created wonderful homes and enjoyed loving relationships.  I do not believe people are telling those couples that they should forever remain as two single parents when they are obviously part of a loving family.  I do not believe our society would want to prevent people in that situation having the right to <Col N="785" /> remarry.  Why should we want to do that?  It is not the right way to approach all of the difficult situations that exist in society today.  The pressure and the difficulties of marriage are much greater now and they are realities not created by politicians or the legislature but by society.  It is our duty to face up to that.</P>
    <P>I respect people who come into this House and express a contrary view to mine.  I dislike the people who do not express any view for fear it will upset some vested group outside this House. If I have a view on a subject I have a duty to the people who elected me to outline that view to them openly and honestly.  They may agree or disagree with me but on any issue that may come before us in this House we must try to make an honest assessment.  We must make our positions clear and follow through on that.  If I have a view I do not expect everyone else to agree with it but I should have the right to persuade people on that issue, to express my point of view and to listen to convincing arguments put forward to change my views of others.  That is what democracy and debate is all about.  I welcome this opportunity to put forward in unequivocal terms my view that people should have the right to remarry under Irish law.</P>
    <P>In recent years the church has broadened its interpretation of marriage.  Figures are available on the number of annulments granted and, while I do not know the details of those, I can make the simple analogy that the church recognises there are certain circumstances in which people have the right to have their marriage annulled under church law and, because of that, have the right to remarry under church law.  I am not a desk thumping Catholic but I am a member of the Christian church in the broadest sense.  If that right exists under church law, I do not see any reason it should not exist under civil law.  It is a contradiction in terms to allow an annulment under one set of circumstances but to disallow it under <Col N="786" /> another.  That argument simply does not stand up.</P>
    <P>The church has faced enormous difficulties in recent weeks.  Those difficulties are real, not only for the church but for all of us.  In a modern world we must communicate our message in a modern way.  The church should learn from the experience of politicians over the past decade, namely, that one cannot afford to be economical with the truth.  People should be honest and upfront because they will always be respected for that.  If people are not honest it leads to speculation, innuendo and the possibility of wrong conclusions being drawn.  If the church adopts that attitude it will be serving itself and society in general very well.</P>
    <P>In producing his paper, <i>Measures Needed for Children in Marital Breakdown/Divorce Situations</i>, Deputy Woods has made a helpful contribution to this debate.  It indicates that as a party we recognise that divorce is not a cure for all ills but that there are many other issues which must be dealt with if this referendum is to be passed.  The paper produced by my party is a substantial contribution to the whole area of dealing with children in cases of marital breakdown.  I have a healthy scepticism of statistics which suggest that children of divorced parents are worse off than those who are living in an appalling home situation.  I have doubts about that but there should be a choice for families and children who find themselves in that position.</P>
    <P>What is missing from this debate is compassion and humanity in dealing with this whole area.  No two marriages are the same in the sense that the circumstances prevailing in each marriage are different, the financial and social positions are different and children with their skills and abilities can be different. All of these things go into the package that makes up family life.  It is wrong to take a general set of statistics and apply them as if that is the way it is in all marriages. All marriages are different and are under different pressures.  They will break up for many different reasons.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="787" /> The issue of the four year separation period is put across in a way that suggests a husband or wife arrives home some day at lunch time and decides they want to get divorced, as if it were a sudden decision.  It may happen that way in some cases but the impression is given that it generally happens that way. When a marriage begins to unravel difficulties begin to build up, to a point where the couple decide the best option for them and their children is to separate and ultimately to get divorced.  That period could be six, seven or eight years. It is not a sudden decision.</P>
    <P>To draw comparisons with the divorce regime in the UK or the USA and to use statistics from those countries to back up arguments regarding divorce in Ireland is not facing the facts.  The divorce regime that exists in the United Kingdom and in the United States is fundamentally different from what we are attempting in this constitutional amendment.  They do not have the same approach to divorce as we would have, following a successful outcome of this referendum.  There is a conservative and painstaking set of procedures to go through before, ultimately, a person will be granted a divorce.  In those circumstances, comparing issues in the United Kingdom or the United States with Ireland is not comparing like with like.</P>
    <P>If divorce is introduced here there is no doubt people will seek a divorce.  Its absence has not stopped people seeking to become separated, but they do not have the opportunity or the choice to remarry.  That is what is missing in the equation here.  Everything else has been put in place.  I ask people to look into their hearts and to their own family situations, the vast majority of which are happy.  Why would they want to deprive somebody of having that same opportunity, even if it is second time round, with children and a happy family home? I do not believe for one minute that the people are saying that.  Their fears, as I said at the commencement of my contribution, are being raised by legal arguments which tend to put the whole issue <Col N="788" /> in an abstract way and remove the human aspect of this difficult and traumatic problem of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>I ask the electorate to give serious consideration to this amendment and to ask themselves if they are of such a mind that they would deprive somebody of the right to remarry.  Life is not about putting ourselves in a box and if we happen to find ourselves in the wrong box that is it for ever and a day.  Life is about much more than that.  It is about understanding that we make mistakes, that we are not perfect.  It is about understanding that the future can be different for all of us and that none of us has the answer, that our set of rules should not exclusively be applied to everybody because it works for us.  It does not.  We might wish that it would.  Unfortunately, all marriages are not made in heaven. Those of us who have the happiest marriages would want that opportunity to be available to everyone else.</P>
    <P>In the next few weeks we have an opportunity to make a positive contribution in favour of those who, for various reasons, do not find themselves in the same situation as the majority and to say to them that we do not want &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; divorce in Ireland or a divorce culture <i>per se</i>.  By voting for this referendum they are not voting for those things; they are saying categorically that they will not allow that and in my view that is correct.  What they are saying is that if, after a sustained period, a marriage has ended and a person in separated and in a new and loving relationship and wants to marry and have children, we will give our blessing, so to speak, in legal terms.  Nobody on their own has all the answers.  All we can do collectively is try to be honest, compassionate and fair and hope that the justice we all want in society is available to everybody.</P>

      <P>I am conscious to this debate that we have serious responsibilities as legislators and as representatives of the electorate.  There is not one Member of the House who does not, on a day to day basis, whether in clinics or through personal contacts in communities, deal with the facts and consequences of marital breakdown.  No section of our community is immune. People make mistakes and break the vows they made or their marriages simply come under a level of strain that proves intolerable.  With the best will in the world, we all know that marriage is not a perfect institution.  No matter what we do in terms of preparation and supports, some marriages will not work.</P>
      <P>I see the process in which we are engaged and have been engaged for the past decade as one of constructing the circumstances in which people who marry have the best possible chance of that contract not simply working in some mechanical way but enhancing their lives and the lives of their children. We need to take this positive and affirming approach if we are to get the equation right in this debate.  It is not about marriage versus divorce; it is about the quality of marriage, how we give marriage the best chance of success and acknowledge and deal with those marriages which do not work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am struck by the reductionist approach which pervades much of the debate.  Simplistic messages with which we became familiar during the 1980s are emerging again and they serve no useful purpose.  They distract us from dealing with the complexity which is at the heart of any marriage in difficulty or which ends.  We should be clear about one thing.  Marital problems are not the product of the latter half of the 20th century.  The fact that people were consigned to silence when their marriages were not working reflects only the times which also sought to shut out violence and other abuses which we are seeing all too painfully these days.  Gradually the facts emerged initially as shameful and society reacted by ostracising people who separated or divorced, <Col N="790" /> particularly women.  The word &ldquo;divorcee&rdquo; carried heavy tones of judgment and exclusion.</P>
    <P>Our parents, grandparents and their parents did not enjoy universally happy and contented marriages.  If we are honest we acknowledge that for many, even when separation or, in some cases, divorce was available, it was socially and financially impossible to separate.  It is not that we had the perfect model and have lost it, but that we have opened our eyes to the frailty and the demands of the human condition.</P>
    <P>It is argued that for the common good divorce must not be allowed because with it will come a lessening of resolve to meet the commitments made.  The common good is not served.  I believe, by ignoring the problems.  Consigning people to stay in bad situations in the interests of some wider experience of a good situation is a very strange argument. I do not need anyone to be forced to stay in a contract which is over to work at maintaining my marriage contract. I believe the common good is served by openness, by clear social standards of what constitutes meeting the contract of marriage and by a focus on love and honour as a prerequisite to being able to meet the commitment until death do us part.  Nor is the common good served by warning women that men are just waiting to run off with another woman.  The misogyny reflected in that is breathtaking.  I believe that women are able to spot the fundamentally insulting nature of that argument and I think many men resent the insult to them as husbands and fathers which underwrites the view that the only reason they remain with their families is that they cannot divorce.  Yet we hear these arguments again and again.</P>
    <P>What we are trying to do in this legislation and in the forthcoming referendum is to deal with a real issue for many of our citizens.  The reality is that there is a wider family, a circle of friends and a community that shares in different ways the upset of marriage breakdown. How many people today can say they <Col N="791" /> know of no one, not one family member, no friend or acquaintance whose marriage has not ended?  As in all individual situations we see the strains and the pressures, the attempt to solve the problem and reconcile and sometimes the acknowledgement that the marriage is over.  We all know the lengths to which people will go to try to improve the situation and the sadness very often when that result is not achieved.  We see people rebuilding their lives and, in spite of great difficulties, getting back their self-esteem and raising and educating their children against impossible odds.  For so long our support for those people was completely grudging and inadequate.  I am glad this is changing and it is a major success that no Member of this House would deny people the help they need, whether counselling, mediation, support services or legal aid, inadequate though they are sometimes.</P>
    <P>There is still a wish to make the fairy tale come true and blame those who do not conform to the &ldquo;happy every after&rdquo; ending for the problems of society, to suggest that those whose marriages end are irresponsible or promiscuous, to present women as passive victims to whom marriage breakdown happens and on whom divorce is forced.  As a legislator, a woman, a wife and mother and someone who has worked with and represented women in many different areas, I reject that model and those arguments.  I believe, as I have said already, that we are beginning to work towards a model which is about putting marriage as a central element of life but around which we need to construct far more explicit conditions of support so that when a marriage ends there is a way of formalising that end and for some at a subsequent time the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>What strikes me about those who argue against divorce is how unchanging and absolute their arguments are and how they accommodate the facts of marriage breakdown, accept separation and even a second relationship yet deny the right to formalise that relationship <Col N="792" /> should the couple wish to do so.  This position leads to one very simple point. By acknowledging the reality of marriage ending we face a choice: a growing number of informal second relationships without all of the positive supports that a formal marriage can bring or the right when all of the conditions have been met for those people to remarry.</P>
    <P>In the last campaign a great deal of attention was paid to women's position. Women everywhere are making choices which our mother's generation could not have made, whether in deciding to end a marriage that has ceased to work or initiating separation proceedings, and very often women are the prime movers. Is it that this generation of women is suddenly irresponsible, promiscuous, stupid or could it be that today women have high expectations of marriage and when in spite of every effort the partnership disappears the possibility of rebuilding a new life is seen as a realistic and preferable option?</P>
    <P>There is a great deal of comment on the poverty of women.  There is no doubt that in society generally women experience poverty disproportionately to men.  Women are more likely to be dependent and to be in low paid jobs with less access to education and training. I do not think these sorts of structures should remain and we need to challenge them.  It is a very negative model of marriage which requires that we encourage dependency over partnership and sacrifice those for whom marriage has not worked in order to preserve it.  Marriage gains nothing, as Deputy Cullen said, from knowing that someone else is trapped and if the only reason a person stays in a marriage is that they have no economic alternative we have a serious problem with marriage itself.  Arguments based on fear, common in 1986, are re-emerging but I do not believe they will hold sway in a society which prides itself on the quality of education of its young people.</P>
    <P>The feminisation of poverty is not caused by separation and divorce but by the economic and social status of <Col N="793" /> women world-wide.  To tackle the poverty that women experience whether in separation, divorce, marriage or as single parents is about tackling the inequalities that women face.  It is about second chance education and economic opportunities for those who have missed out.  Most women continue to be bunched at the lower end of the labour market.  It is about valuing the unpaid work that women do and somehow creating a society where doing the unpaid work of child rearing and volunteerism in the community does not lead to a punitive economic status in society. These are the broader challenges and I urge women to look at these challenges and not equate women's poverty with the arrival of separation and divorce.  It is an inaccurate picture and we have to tackle those broader challenges which I have outlined, with or without divorce in this society.  Every other society must do so as well.  Creating an equal society for women in Ireland and world-wide is the task, not frightening women into thinking that divorce is the bogey they need to fear.  Frightening women about divorce does nothing to improve either their mental health or their economic status.  Staying in a marriage out of fear of the economic consequences is extremely understandable, however, in a society which does not support women in vulnerable situations and does not really offer women equal opportunities.</P>
    <P>I am very glad we are having a great deal of discussion about children.  What is important is to support children and have a child centred society, whether the child is from the first or second marriages or no marriage.  Recent events have reminded us of the appalling lack of child centeredness in this society. Scandal in the church may be the headline but the central issues are about arrogance and the potential for a mismatch between what one powerful group says and what some of its members do.  Today the church which has had much responsibility in health and education must put in place the high standards for safeguarding children's rights.  A church that has been so sure <Col N="794" /> of itself on the issue of private morality and quick to condemn contraception and say that women must have any number of children has been quite derelict in its duty to protect those very same children.  It is a harsh lesson in reality.  Complex social problems have to be dealt with carefully and slowly. What I want from my spiritual leaders are spiritual messages and I do not want them trying to frighten the State when it is doing its duty in catering for a pluralist society.  In this regard I welcome very much Fr. Bernard Tracey's comments in the October issue of the Dominican magazine <i>Doctrine and Life</i>&mdash; unfortunately I do not have time to quote from it now.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, his Department and staff have worked assiduously and carefully on this referendum campaign.  Much detailed background work has been done and women and men should be reassured that the legislation, in so far as possible, is in place.  Let us be honest and accept that new needs will arise and there will be new demands on all our services.  We are an evolving and changing society but we have tried to learn from the experience of those in other jurisdictions where divorce is easily available.  It is insulting to continue to insist that because some people have access to separation people will give up their relationships and commitments incredibly easily.  That is the challenge and test for our culture.  We must have confidence in our culture.  Let us not look back on the past through rose-tinted glasses but face the future with courage and a belief in the quality of our educational system, of our parenting and of our church.  Let us not move out of fear. Let us have a vision of a society that supports marriage and puts good things in place to help young people to grow up and make serious commitments.</P>
    <P>Many of the changes within marriages are very good for women and offer much more opportunity and choice for them.  However, our laws should reflect <Col N="795" /> the reality.  There has been much discussion on putting this into the Constitution. I personally would have preferred a simpler approach, namely, the deletion of the clause followed by legislation. I recognise that ambivalance on social issues in Ireland leads us to wish for an ideal while legislating for the reality of the present.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment sets out searching and rigorous terms.  It demands that arrangements be made for children and for a dependent spouse before any dissolution is granted.  I urge those people who are concerned about writing it into the Constitution, who would have preferred a simple deletion followed by legislation, to support this referendum, because our overriding concern has to be for those whose marriages have ended and who deserve the opportunity to remarry.</P>
    <P>There is strong evidence that children can cope with separation but that it is very difficult for them.  What is important is how separation is handled and the supports we put in place.  The vital message is that there are important psychological risks to children associated with major family discord and conflict, with or without divorce.  Denying the reality of marital breakdown and the reality that individuals wish to remarry is not the best way to help families and children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment of the Constitution to allow persons who have been separated for some years and between whom there is no hope of reconciliation to divorce and remarry.  I thank the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and especially the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, for the tremendous amount of work they have put into bringing forward this Bill and for trying to meet the demands of all those who discussed their worries and anxieties about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main Opposition party have claimed credit for the inclusion in the Bill of the four year requirement.  I too asked the Minister not to allow for a <Col N="796" />&ldquo;quickie&rdquo; divorce system such as that in the UK and other countries.  Like others, I have had direct and indirect experience of the working of that system. However, that does not mean we should deny the right of people to remarry where their marriage has irretrievably broken down.</P>
    <P>At the time of the last referendum the anti-divorce lobby said that the introduction of divorce would double the number of separations.  That has happened without divorce and many children and families have suffered. Although I appreciate their right to their view, I ask those who are against divorce to put the same effort into tackling the things that sometimes lead our young people into marriage without proper thought.</P>
    <P>There is no proof that divorce means more marriage breakdown.  Comparisons have been made between this country and the UK.  In the UK fewer than 15 per cent of young people go to any place of worship on Sundays.  We should compare our situation with that north of the Border where a divorce structure is in existence which has not lead to a greater incidence of marriage breakdown than here, because they have the same Christian ethos as we have south of the Border.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the lack of unity among the members of the main Opposition party.  Of the ten speakers who spoke before today, five were for the referendum and five against.  I was most amused by Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív's contribution.  Some months ago he suggested that we should rejoin the Commonwealth, but he has come out most trenchantly against the referendum and the rights of minorities whose marriages have failed, regardless of what church or group they belong to.  If we are to be inclusive we cannot continue in that entrenched manner.  I encourage people to consider seriously what has been said and not to listen to clichés.  We cannot remain in the dark ages and close our eyes to the fact that, with or without church annulments people who were previously married are living together <Col N="797" /> outside of marriage, that children are being born with no proper status and that women in such second relationships have no legal rights.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the opportunity of contributing to the debate.  I encourage people to support the referendum and give those who are in dire need the opportunity to which they are entitled. It will not damage those who are in happy marriages and it will not change the status of the marriage ceremony.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputy McDaid.  This debate on the proposed fifteenth amendment of the Constitution affords us an opportunity to consider in a rational way the Government's proposal to remove the constitutional ban on divorce.  This matter was the subject of a previous referendum in 1986.  On that occasion the decision of the people was clear and unmistakable.  It was an emphatic refusal to remove the ban.</P>
      <P>There is no arguing with the assertion that over the last 12 to 15 years social change in Ireland has been quite dramatic. Social norms which were accepted for centuries were suddenly replaced by the attitudes of a very liberal society.  The unquestioning acceptance and support for institutions which were part and parcel of Irish life diminished. Over a relatively short period the value system which stood us in good stead, despite many shortcomings, became diluted and was no longer subscribed to by many people.  The changed attitudes fuelled demand for change in social legislation which would have been unthinkable 20 or 25 years previously. In many ways the electorate in this referendum has the advantage of being able to assess the impact of the free availability of divorce in other jurisdictions. The nearest example is the UK.  Divorce has been a fact of life there for a long time.  We must ask ourselves if we honestly regard that kind of society as being the most desirable and in the best long term interests of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="798" /> We must ask ourselves if the availability of divorce has contributed to the development and evolution of the societal structures they have there at present.</P>
    <P>Available statistics indicate that at present stable marriages are in the region of 96 per cent.  That figure does not indicate that there is a major underlying demand for change or for the removal of the ban on divorce.  I am not suggesting that all those marriages are in a state of blissful happiness; the position is far from that.  Human nature is full of imperfections.  Absolute compatibility in marriage without any problems throughout life is not a realistic expectation. The ups and downs of daily life may be too much for many people.  The removal of the ban on divorce from our Constitution will mean that in time marriage will become merely a temporary arrangement, with all the psychological and emotional trauma that entails for those involved.  However, I do not have any difficulty in supporting the putting of the referendum to the people on 24 November.</P>
    <P>In the UK where divorce is freely available approximately two in five marriages end in divorce, the highest divorce rate in Europe.  There is scarcely any argument against the assertion that in those circumstances the state of marriage is seriously trivialised.  The number of children born outside wedlock has increased steadily, from one in ten to one in three since the 1970s.  The devaluation of marriage because of the easy availability of divorce is a major contributory factor.  Those are not my words, but the summarised words of a UK lawyer involved in family law who wrote an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> last week.</P>
    <P>Divorce has a devastating impact on the living standards of divorced couples with an immediate demand for State support in many cases.  I have been involved in public life for more than 20 years and on a daily basis I deal with the difficulties faced by lone parents and those who are separated, many of whom live in abject poverty.  Unless the State is <Col N="799" /> prepared to put the necessary financial support structures in place in a divorce available society that problem will accelerate.</P>
    <P>Divorce leaves people traumatised and devastated and the implications for children are equally devastating, carrying an emotional and psychological impact for life in many cases.  Fianna Fáil introduced necessary measures to cater for the children of those whose marriages have broken down, illustrating that structures are necessary to deal with the difficulties associated with marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>I believe that in this referendum people will consider the issue at length before voting.  The collective decision of the electorate will have a profound impact on our society in the future.  At least one Member stated that because divorce is freely available in Europe we should also have that facility.  I fail to understand the logic of such an assertion.  That Member is simply stating that as divorce is freely available in the rest of Europe, for good or for evil, it should be automatically available here.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a divorce culture will have an adverse effect on the commitment to marriage.  The conventional family has exerted a very steadying influence in our society.  I believe members of all parties subscribe to that view and any undermining of its role in society is undesirable.  Consequently, in the referendum on 24 November I will vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague, Deputy Kirk, for sharing time with me. The primary purpose of this debate is not to enable Members of this House to make a decision on whether to introduce divorce.  We are engaged in the exercise of submitting a question to the people as a whole &mdash; democracy at work in the best possible sense.  It is one of those rare occasions when we cannot be accused of imposing the will of a handful of politicians on the population at large.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The debate has already shown that <Col N="800" /> there are at least some Members who are so fervently opposed to the idea of divorce that they would much prefer if a referendum were not held.  There appears to be a notion in some quarters that a solid vote in this House in favour of holding a referendum will in some way ensure that a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote is inevitable. Our highly sophisticated electorate has demonstrated more than once that this is far from the case.  Any Member of this House who seeks to prevent the people from making the ultimate decision is, in effect, saying that they, the people, must not be given the opportunity of disagreeing with what he or she happens to believe.</P>
    <P>Many people demand that their public representatives should always come clean and declare their positions on important decisions such as this.  I will try to explain my position as briefly and as concisely as possible, but I have no intention of seeking to impose my views on anyone.  It should go without saying that the family unit is the single most essential element in constructing the fabric of a healthy society and that the ideal framework for that unit is a marriage freely entered into with a life long commitment.  Irrespective of whether the referendum is carried, it will continue to be the solemn duty of this State to ensure in its laws and administration that the institution of marriage is respected and protected as far as possible. As other Members pointed out, this would include much more support than there is at present for agencies and groups involved in marriage counselling and much more important advice and preparation for those entering marriage. A few years ago I suggested that a marriage licence should not be issued until at least 12 months had elapsed after the application, a sort of compulsory engagement.  It was interesting to note that the Minister made a similar suggestion subsequently, although with a much shorter timespan.  We must urgently carry out research to ascertain the causes of marriage breakdown.  This could be done by checking the records of judicial separation cases.  It is time to <Col N="801" /> begin looking at prevention so that we can minimise the number of breakdowns.</P>
    <P>We have all heard the simplistic expression that all marriages are made in heaven, but this is patently not the case.  If that were true, it would mean that men and women would be denied the freedom of choice in selecting their partners for life.  Unfortunately, in some cases marriages are decided on too hastily and for all the wrong reasons, a fact recognised by the Catholic Church which in its wisdom granted many thousands of annulments throughout the world down through the years.  In our case, the State is much less realistic.  If either of the parties to a church annulment were subsequently to enter into what the church would regard as a valid marriage, he or she would be guilty of bigamy in the eyes of the law.</P>
    <P>Marriage was never intended to be a guaranteed bed of roses.  I am always wary of people who boast, after many years of marriage, of never encountering even the slightest difference of opinion, not to mention the possibility of the marriage breaking down.  Such an unlikely scenario would demand the inclusion of at least one saint in such a union, if not two.  For the majority of us lesser mortals our marriages have had their ups and downs but they managed to survive and emerge even stronger at the end of the day.  However, in a minority of cases the marriage which has irretrievably broken down should never have taken place and it has become necessary to dissolve the partnership in the interests of all concerned.  This is happening already under the judicial separation legislation.  It is time for the State to recognise reality and follow the example of the Church by declaring such marriages to be invalid so that the people concerned may subsequently enter into a proper marriage, if that is their wish.  Accordingly, it is my intention to vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in the referendum.</P>
    <P>I did not make my decision lightly.  I thought deeply about all of the implications, including the alleged risk of creating what has been described as a <Col N="802" /> divorce culture and the implications this might have for the institution of marriage. This later point I was concerned about until I discovered that the rate of divorce in Northern Ireland is extremely low when compared with Great Britain, despite the fact that the divorce laws in the United Kingdom do not provide for the restrictions that we propose to insert in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>Only yesterday I discussed this matter with an eminent Protestant churchman in Northern Ireland.  He confirmed that divorce was a comparatively rare occurrence north of the Border and explained that this was a reflection of the strong Christian views on marriage held by both Catholics and Protestants alike.</P>
    <P>In proposing that we should allow the right to remarry I am convinced that we are not about to create a divorce culture or undermine the institution of marriage. We are Irish and have our own tradition and culture and retain our own Christian values.  People should stop comparing us to other nations.  The great mass of our people will continue to have sufficient faith to persevere in the maintenance of life long marriages, as has been the case down through the centuries.  We can do this while at the same time facing the reality that not all marriages are made in heaven.</P>
    <P>I am reminded of the words of my highly respected colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, when he eloquently made the case that if the ideals of our Republic are to mean anything to us we must be prepared to frame our laws in such a way that the rights of even the smallest minority are respected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this Bill and the Government's proposals.  I have publicly stated my view in this House and elsewhere that in an ideal world the detailed provisions for divorce should <Col N="803" /> not be set out in the Constitution.  That view is shared by many on this and the other side of the House.  Unfortunately, we are not living in an ideal world.</P>
      <P>I am aware that many Irish people do not share my view and will not be easily persuaded.  I am convinced that this amendment will pass and believe strongly that a majority of Irish people now accept that we in this State cannot continue to deny people whose marriages have broken down the right to have a second chance.  I am convinced that a majority of the people wish to face up to the problem of marital breakdown and to do so in a way which is compassionate and humane, but I am equally persuaded that the Irish people do not want a quickie divorce culture. They believe the State should do everything possible to encourage life long marriage.</P>
      <P>The overwhelming duty of Government is to the 70,000 plus separated people who are relying on us to propose an amendment that will be passed by the people.  We cannot and must not fail in that duty.  If, in order to do our duty. we have to provide reassurance in the way suggested, then so be it.</P>
      <P>I wish to reflect for a moment on the nature of marriage.  Marriage is an agreement between two people to share their lives, to provide for each other and their children.  It is by far the most important legal contract which most of us will ever enter into.  Any person entering into marriage takes on a raft of legal responsibilities and duties, many of them set out in common and statute law, but marriage is more than that &mdash; it is also a Christian sacrament and an important part of most world religions. It is the only Christian sacrament which parallels and complements a social and legal institution.  The Christian churches preach that marriage is for life; they do not provide for divorce or officially recognise second marriages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years Irish law reflected and enforced the teaching of the Christian churches.  In effect, the State implemented the social teaching of the <Col N="804" /> Christian churches, particularly that of the Roman Catholic Church.  It is time for this to stop and to re-establish the distinction between the legal nature of marriage and the Christian sacrament. The law must be developed so as to deal with the reality of marital breakdown. Those who accept the teaching of the Church will continue to do so and nobody would have it otherwise, but the State has a duty to provide for those who do not accept the Church's teaching, we have a duty to cater for minorities.</P>
    <P>It is worth asking ourselves what the ban on divorce says about Irish society. Proponents of the ban would no doubt claim that it endorses our commitment to life long marriage.  I do not doubt the bona fides of those who hold that view, but I take a profoundly different view. The prohibition speaks of intolerance and paints us as people who refuse to accommodate minority views.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a few words about the peace process in Northern Ireland which is supported by every Member of this House.  This referendum marks a critical stage in the process.  Let me be clear.  I do not believe the introduction of a right to remarry in this State would make the South any more attractive to Unionists.  We should not think of it as a means of bringing a united Ireland any closer, but the two issues are strikingly similar.  At the nub of both is the issue of tolerance and the acceptance of diversity.  It ill befits us to lecture Unionists about accommodation and pluralism if we are not prepared to practise them ourselves.  If we are serious about the peace process, we must lead by example and do so now.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that the ban on divorce has not prevented marital breakdown, men from leaving their wives and parents from abandoning their children. Over the past 25 years we have introduced a wide range of family law, much of it to deal with the consequences of family breakdown.  The Anti-Divorce Campaign would have us believe that disputes about property, maintenance, the custody of children and so on are a <Col N="805" /> new and horrible spectre ready to descend as soon as divorce is introduced. The reality is very different.  The courts, the legal system, the welfare system and the Garda Síochána all deal with the consequences of marital breakdown every day of the week, largely at the behest of women.</P>
    <P>Women suffer most in circumstances of marital breakdown and it is women who most need and seek help from the State and the law in dealing with its consequences. Almost all barring orders and most maintenance applications are made by women.  Custody of children is awarded to the female partner in 90 per cent of cases.  Crucially in terms of this argument, a large majority of applications for judicial separation are made by women.  If it is women who suffer most when marriages break down, then equally it is women who stand to gain most from establishing a second stable relationship.  Remarriage offers many women the chance to restore living standards and dignity.  Not everyone will choose to remarry, but the State should not and cannot stand in the way of those who do.</P>
    <P>It is argued that divorce undermines marriage and causes marital breakdown. This argument has a simplistic appeal but is dangerous and also spurious.  It is like saying that the existence of Band Aid plasters causes more cuts and rotten teeth should not be extracted lest the extraction should cause further decay. In all those countries where divorce has been introduced in recent decades, such as Spain, Portugal and Italy, legal change has been dictated by social change which was already happening. The law has been changed in response to attitudinal changes resulting from the increased incidence of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>We in this House can scarcely be accused of responding prematurely to social change.  On the contrary, we in this Legislature have regularly allowed others to do our job for us.  Much of the legal response to sensitive ethical questions has been dictated by the courts, <Col N="806" /> not by the Oireachtas.  In areas such as homosexuality we ceased to implement a discredited law many years before we found the guts to change it.  Even in the area of divorce we are not without our little hypocrisies in that we continue to give <i>de facto</i> recognition to foreign divorces which would never stand up if they were tested in court.  It is time to stop this hypocrisy.  The ideal of a life long happy marriage is one to which we all aspire but we cannot create an ideal simply by inserting it into the Constitution. The reality for many people is a good deal less than ideal and we must deal with that.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues for sharing their time with me.  There has been much talk in recent times about marriage breakdown, its many causes and devastating effects but many of those who are most vocal have paid scant attention to the causes of marital breakdown since the last debate on divorce almost ten years ago.</P>
      <P>Marriages get into difficulty for a variety of reasons.  These vary from people being too young when entering marriage to couples not being able to withstand the pressures of poverty, poor housing conditions, ill health, addiction of one kind or another or domestic violence. Sometimes people who are insecure have difficulty coping with their relationships.  Sometimes people are incompatible or become so and drift apart.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Modern life puts many pressures on couples and families.  Unfortunately many of those who oppose the introduction of the right to remarry have been slow to tackle the social problems which contribute to marital breakdown.  If we are serious about being a caring society we must do more than merely pay lip service to these problems.  We must ensure that we build a society which nurtures and supports families and puts the family unit at the centre of the political stage.  Politicians and Church leaders must put people first.  That is why the Labour Party, on entering Government in 1992, made it a priority <Col N="807" /> to increase child benefit, fund an education system which affords all children an opportunity to develop their potential, restart the house building programme and make improvements in the health service.  Those are concrete ways in which families can be supported, protected and given the best chance of survival.</P>
    <P>It was a priority of the Minister, Deputy Taylor, to develop marriage counselling services to help people to prepare for marriage and provide much needed support and help for those with marital difficulties.  He has increased funding to this vital service by 150 per cent since 1992.  Under this ministry the age of marriage has been raised from 16 to 18 years.  The plans of the Minister for Education to introduce the long promised programme in relationships and sex education to prepare young people for adulthood and married life are well under way.</P>
    <P>Much has been achieved in supporting families and marriages in recent years but more remains to be done. Although progress has been made, sadly there will always be marriages which will break down, marriages which should never have taken place and marriages which may have worked once but which in essence no longer exist.  We are all aware of the truama caused by marital breakdown and, sadly, sometimes the most earnest efforts are not sufficient to rescue a marriage.  In practice people leave broken relationships only after long and careful consideration, usually after many years, on the painful acceptance that the marriage has finally ended.  It is not acceptable that such people should be legally tied to a marriage that has ceased to exist and denied a second chance.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day this debate is about treating people whose marriages have irretrievably broken down in a fair and compassionate way.  As a Government and as a society we must do all in our power to support and strengthen families and, at the same time, we must respect those whose marriages have <Col N="808" /> ended and allow them their civil rights &mdash; the right to remarry and the right to have a second chance at happiness.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly support this amendment of the Constitution. The State has a deep obligation to assist the perhaps 10 per cent of our population who are affected by marital breakdown, to assist separated people to rebuild their lives, secure recognition for marriage in a second union for spouses and dependants and to protect spouses and children who have suffered as a result of marital breakdown.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us echoes faithfully the provisions of the 1989 and 1994 family law Bills which were generally welcomed at the time and the raft of family legislation enacted in the last decade with one important addition, the right to remarriage for separated spouses.  The Government's guiding principle in drafting the Bill and the amendment to the Constitution is one of deep compassion for those involved in the breakdown of a marriage.  To their credit this administration has shown a strong sense of justice in seeking to remedy the current unsatisfactory position where remarriage is forbidden under the Constitution.</P>
      <P>Marriage breakdown is a reality in society.  The figures issued by the Central Statistics Office show that the number of separated spouses doubled to 75,400 people between the time of the last referendum and 1993.  Judicial separation applications are now running at 3,000 per annum.  When one adds the number of affected children almost 10 per cent of the population is touched by marital breakdown.  Although forbidden to remarry by Article 41.3.2º of the Constitution many separated spouses have formed second unions.  The number of marriages has declined from 18,500 in 1986 to 16,300 last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was surprised at the speeches made by two of my colleagues, Deputies Noel Ahern and Haughey, who did not seem to recognise the problem of marital breakdown and separation although they deal with constituents similar to <Col N="809" /> mine.  They would do well to look at reality.  While we all have aspirations it is our duty to face up to reality and minister accordingly.</P>
    <P>Marriage breakdown and separation have complex social, cultural and economic causes but they are a fact of society.  Having dealt with the problems which result from marital breakdown as fairly as possible since 1986 only one injustice remains to be remedied and that is the right to remarry.  It is striking how pressure groups that opposed the referendum in 1986 and are doing so now have so little to say about these problems, nor have they any answers to marriage breakdown.  Economic forces, especially unemployment, and the consequent squeeze on family income is disruptive of family life.  As Fintan O'Toole reflected recently, anti-social legislation pressure groups have delighted in hogging the limelight on these issues while the broader economic causes of social problems have been largely ignored.  With the passing of this amendment on 24 November, like that commentator I look forward to turning national attention to the key economic issues, especially unemployment and the elimination of deprivation.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Taylor, and the Department of Equality and Law Reform are to be congratulated for steadfastly extending the necessary legislation for the protection of separated spouses and children.  The Minister's calm and rational approach to carrying through this amendment is surely the people's preferred approach to this complex and delicate matter.  All parties in the House who contributed to the debate on legislation since 1986 should be congratulated.  The Children Acts 1987 and 1991, the Maintenance Act, 1994, and especially the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which was extended in the 1994 Act have laid the strong legal basis for the resolution of problems caused by marital breakdown.  The programmes of the partnership Government have been largely fulfilled.  The much needed Domestic Violence Bill is before the <Col N="810" /> House.  We are now addressing the issue of the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>I am one of those many Deputies whose gut instinct is not to include the conditions for divorce in the Constitution. Like many colleagues I would have preferred the simple deletion of Article 41.3.2º.  However, I understand the decision of the Minister and the Government to insert the strict remarriage conditions before us into the Constitution. Since the family's vital role as the fundamental unit of society is enshrined in the Constitution there is a presumption that the people should be consulted directly on the conditions of such a crucial change in family law.  The Government's correct desire to secure the widest possible backing for the right to remarry also necessitated the formulation of this amendment.</P>
    <P>The requirement to refer future proposals for constitutional change to the electorate copperfastens the strict conditions for divorce and the assurance that divorce will not be available on a casual basis.</P>
    <P>During the next seven weeks the anti-remarriage lobbying groups no doubt will search for a formula of frightening slogans, not to mention the scary music Deputy McCreevy and others are beginning to hear, in their urgent endeavour to prevent the introduction of the right to remarry.  No doubt we will be told incessantly that divorce is unjust to an unwilling spouse but surely it is the breakdown of marriage which is the major problem.  Surely it is profoundly unjust to prevent separated spouses, having fulfilled the strict conditions specified in this amendment, from remarrying.  Following the Family Law Acts of 1988 and 1994, the draft divorce Bill affords provisions for spouses and dependent children similar to those under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  In addition, the family court has extensive powers in drawing up maintenance orders, property adjustment orders and financial compensation orders to protect dependent spouses and children.</P>
    <P>We have been told by some Members <Col N="811" /> that the introduction of divorce will encourage a divorce culture and obsessive comparisons are made between circumstances prevailing in the United Kingdom and United States of America. Without divorce, the incidence of marriage breakdown has increased enormously since 1986.  As my constituency colleague, Deputy Woods, noted last week, 95 per cent of Irish marriages will remain intact whether or not this referendum is passed.</P>
    <P>On behalf of Dublin City Council I was delighted to welcome Mr. David Trimble here yesterday afternoon.  Talking to him, I was conscious of another Irish political entity, Northern Ireland, within which divorce has been available for many years past, where society remains intact; yet very few comparisons are drawn with circumstances prevailing there.  Those opposed to the right to remarry conveniently forget to make this comparison or the comparison between countries of the Iberian peninsula or other European Catholic countries with a culture similar to ours.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the case against the introduction of divorce will concentrate on the position of children affected.  We shall hear much of the University of Exeter and other studies suggesting that children are harmed by divorce whereas it is the breakdown of marriage which provokes such damage.  Research has demonstrated that the breakdown of marriage can damage some children while other studies conclude forcefully that many children are far better off when partners within a high-conflict family separate, and they can resume normal development without the risk of turmoil and violence.</P>
    <P>Researchers who have studied the incidence of marriage breakdown are aware that it can be hurtful and damaging to children but there is also evidence to demonstrate that children in severely conflict-ridden marriages can benefit from separation and divorce.  The frequently quoted University of Exeter study, because of its serious methodological flaws and inherent confusions, <Col N="812" /> fails to undermine that finding.  In the Irish Social Worker, Dr. Paul O'Mahony says that study, as scientific evidence on this key issue, is almost entirely worthless.  As Deputy Shortall noted, the Government is spending £750,000 per annum to assist 54 marriage counselling groups while funding for the Family Mediation Service which assists separating couples to resolve or at least manage their differences in a manner least damaging to their children has increased dramatically.</P>
    <P>Existing family law legislation also lays down the duty of the family court to render the children's welfare its paramount consideration in any agreement concerning custody or access, which condition will continue to operate if and when divorce is introduced.  It may well be that our &ldquo;no divorce&rdquo; regime has contributed to the large percentage of children &mdash; perhaps 20 per cent of first births &mdash; who live with cohabiting couples who are not married.</P>
    <P>We shall probably hear much about the cost of introducing divorce but, under our existing taxation and social welfare provisions, there are extensive provisions for separated spouses and their dependants.  For example, this year's Social Welfare Act ensures that divorced people and their dependants will not be at any loss under our social welfare code.  Of course, there is a cost to the breakdown of marriage. Although recent Governments have endeavoured to recover maintenance costs, the solution must lie in dealing with the cause of marriage breakdown rather than in victimising those who wish to remarry and regularise their unions.  In a spirit of compassion and maturity this House should fully support the Minister and Government by voting in favour of the Bill on Second Stage, with all Members campaigning responsibly for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on 24 November.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>A strong principle of the Progressive Democrats since its formation has been that people whose marriages have irretrievably broken down as a civil right, should have the right to <Col N="813" /> have them dissolved and the right to remarry.  An equally strong principle is that, in a parliamentary democracy, the duty of an Opposition, in particular, is to analyse and scrutinise legislation.  The duty of any legislator in this House is to speak the truth without fear or favour. It is the duty of this House to ensure that &mdash; whether it be regular legislation or legislation to amend the Constitution &mdash; we pass legislation that is clear, effective and most appropriate to prevailing circumstances.</P>
      <P>That duty falling on us is particularly strong when dealing with a constitutional referendum because, unlike most people, Members of the Oireachtas have two votes &mdash; a vote as a legislator and in the referendum, as a citizen.  We will have an opportunity this evening to vote on this Bill.  We shall have an opportunity to decide on an appropriate course to take when the vote is called at 10.30 p.m., or to go along with the crowd having failed to learn the ghastly, painful lessons we should have learned from 1986 which resulted in a huge cost not just to Miss X and her family but to the nation.</P>
      <P>When the vote is called this evening all of us will be afforded an opportunity either to learn that lesson, to put this constitutional referendum in an appropriate form to the electorate, or to simply wash our hands of our responsibilities saying that we cannot be trusted and hand over that responsibility to the Judiciary.  The duty we have is a compelling one which we should not ignore.</P>
      <P>This debate is one the Government wish had never occurred.  The Government wished this Bill would have gone through the House on the nod, it having been cobbled together behind closed doors.  The Government wished earnestly that no questions would be raised and great efforts were made to get everybody on board.  Once the largest Opposition party, Fianna Fáil, came on board, that strategy seemed to have been successful.  However, it is a failed strategy for which we shall pay a very heavy price.  In adopting it, we have abdicated our responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="814" /> I can think of no more significant duty falling on this House than to provide a forum for a full, constructive and, where possible, non-partisan debate on the amendment of our Constitution.  I say &ldquo;non-partisan&rdquo; because, in a Republic, a Constitution must take on board the rights of minorities, those with different ethnic, religious and cultural backgrounds.  In a Republic the Constitution has to respect diversity and give expression to the wishes and allegiances of many different people.  If we have a constitutional referendum that does not command the support of significant minority groups in our society, we have taken a partisan approach, not the pluralistic approach for which many people have campaigned for years.  I will deal later with what some of the minority churches have had to say on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats have been pilloried by many members of the Government, particularly by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, for daring to speak out.  We have been criticised and castigated for giving expression in this House to the misgivings of so many people about the Government's approach.  It is our duty to speak out when we believe the approach is wrong.  Having examined the nature of this debate, it is a sad reflection on this House that Government Deputies, who said in 1992 the very things I am about to say, seek to castigate and pillory us for giving voice to the exact same view.  For example, in this House last week the Minister of State, Deputy McManus, said the Progressive Democrats sought to stand in the way of lifting the ban on divorce in order to score cheap political points.  If we were interested in scoring cheap political points we would have gone along with the crowd &mdash; it is always easier.  We would have sat on our hands this evening and we would not have sought to put ourselves in our present position. We are not in the business of scoring cheap political points or adding to the trauma many thousands of victims of <Col N="815" /> marital breakdown have had to endure for so long.</P>
    <P>The issues at stake in this debate are crucial for this House and for society, not just for the present but also for the future.  They are issues which will also have an effect on our relationship with Northern Ireland.  I touched on some of those issues in my meeting yesterday with Mr. Trimble.  In the Downing Street Declaration the Government vowed to look at aspects of Irish life alien to the majority community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Government the Taoiseach said the Irish Government would examine those aspects of the law and the Constitution which were not pluralistic with a view to changing them. When the first opportunity arises to do so the option is taken of writing into the Constitution the wishes of a certain social group &mdash; we fail to give leadership. This strategy and this debate is being conducted on the basis that the Government took an opinion poll and is seeking to give the people a photofit of what it believes they want at a particular time.</P>
    <P>If there is a lesson to be learned from the last campaign on this issue it is that only when the debate begins that people will begin to consider the issues.  In seeking to write the provisions into the Constitution the Government is misjudging the wishes of the electorate.  The concerns are not about whether they are in or out of the Constitution but about how spouses, children and other parties are affected by the introduction of divorce. The Government should have concentrated on those issues, not the strategy of writing the matter into the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am not the only person who takes this view.  The Lawyers Divorce Campaign &mdash; a coalition of barristers and solicitors who practise in family law &mdash; has said in relation to the Minister's proposals:</P>
    <P>We believe it is unworkable, unfair and will lead to another sprawling and <Col N="816" /> expensive constitutional mess.  It will mean more trauma for couples in crisis, more expense and more uncertainty. We strongly believe that the Constitution is not the place to legislate. It is there to guarantee rights, freedoms and duties and to set up structures of the State.</P>
    <P>The group called on the Oireachtas to have a Constitution for the common ground, not a Constitution that seeks to start what it calls &ldquo;the battleground&rdquo;.  It ended by saying: &ldquo;If we proceed along this road we will need further referenda to sort out the legislative and constitutional mess.&rdquo;  The views of such experts should have been considered.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, said with regard to a different referendum in 1992, although his arguments are compelling in the context of this referendum. In the Official Report, 21 October 1992, volume 424, column 26 he said:</P>
    <P>The history of this sad and sordid constitutional mess is rooted in something which I find to be offensive, fundamentally anti-democratic and anti-republican. The claim made by some people is that politicians are not to be trusted and therefore into our Constitution had to be written a provision for the protection of the life of the unborn, so that no group of elected politicians could at some future stage remove that protection.</P>
    <P>He went on to praise his party leader for telling that group where to go and he ended by saying: &ldquo;That rest is history, but history has a tragic way of repeating itself.&rdquo;  History certainly has a tragic way of repeating itself just as the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has.  I am sure he did not realise history would repeat itself in a tragic way when he became Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Leader of Democratic Left, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa said in the same debate on 20 October 1992, Official Report, Vol. 423, cols.  1996 and 1997:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> Democratic Left does not believe that it is possible for appropriate for a modern democratic state to attempt to deal with complex issues or personal morality such as abortion, in the Constitution.  The 1983 Amendment which sought to impose the views of one section of Irish society, who oppose abortion in all circumstances, was fundamentally anti-democratic and contrary to the principles of genuine republicanism.</P>
    <P>...The interests of democracy can never be served by one group using the Constitution to force its view of a complex matter of personal morality on others who take a different view. It should not be the role of the Constitution or our laws to impose majority &mdash; or minority &mdash; ethics on everyone.</P>
    <P>In its submission to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in May this year the Church of Ireland said:</P>
    <P>One of the major challanges facing the Republic of Ireland is the creation of a genuinely inclusive society which tolerates and respects variety and diversity.  We have been heartened in recent years by the efforts of successive governments to legislate in areas and on matters which would not necessarily command the support of a majority but which have been aimed at creating a more inclusive society... Much, however, remains to be done and the Church of Ireland wishes to register its strong objections to the use of the Constitution as an instrument of determining complex social and moral problems.</P>
    <P>Its submission went on to point out that as well as providing a framework for the laws of the State, the Constitution is an instrument which embodies the ideals and aspirations for the character of society and, as such, it must be an inclusive document which encourges the allegiance of all citizens.</P>
    <P>Why do we in the House wish to ignore the wishes to the minority church when they are expressed so forcefully at <Col N="818" /> the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation? If we are genuinely interested in having a republic and a pluralist society, our duty is to win support for that.  It is not our duty to seek to undermine the creation of that society by writing into the Constitution the complexities of social legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform has given us many assurances as to the wording proposed in the Bill.  He tells us it is clear.  The Minister's words do not matter; what matters is their interpretation by the courts.  As the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan said during the debate on 21 October 1992, Official Report Volume, 424, columns 319 and 323:</P>
    <P>The Constitution means whatever the Supreme Court decides it means at any time, so clearly we can never be absolutely certain what any Amendment to the Constitution means when framed, debated, passed by this House and endorsed by the people.</P>
    <P>...The Minister's assurances were so wrong in 1983 that one must regard similar assurances given by the Minister... with awe and a mixture of fear and wonder.  Only a man with the ego of the Minister could give the kind of assurances the Minister gave yesterday after being so wrong in 1983.</P>
    <P>The specific wording of complex social legislation when written into the Constitution always creates ambiguities and uncertainties.  I can do no better than endorse the words of the Ministers, Deputies De Rossa, Quinn and Noonan. In 1992 they were in Opposition and perhaps it was somewhat easier for them.</P>
    <P>We have learned nothing from the X case.  History is about to repeat itself and we will force Mrs. X, who is not an abortion case but a marital breakdown case, to follow the same course as that unfortunate Miss X.  Can we say with certainty what the living apart provision means?  Is it appropriate to write such vague concepts into the Constitution? <Col N="819" /> All we can say for certain is that the Supreme Court will decide, not the Minister.  Can we say with certainty what &ldquo;appropriate provision&rdquo; is for the spouses and children?  What is appropriate to one may not be appropriate to another.  Instead of abdicating our responsibilities and deciding these issues we are passing the buck to the Judiciary.  Can we say with certainty what a &ldquo;reasonable chance of reconciliation&rdquo; constitutes?  I do not think we can.  By writing vague, ambiguous and uncertain words into the Constitution we are storing up enormous difficulties for the victims of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>It is certain that if people ask for legal advice in relation to living apart no lawyer will tell them to stay in the same house and live separately and they will get a divorce.  Any lawyer, in order to be certain, would have to advise their client that a physical separation would be better.  The provisions and the wording used will have the opposite effect to that intended.</P>
    <P>During this debate many Deputies have taken the view that this Bill will help some people if passed and will undoubtedly provide a legal remedy for many victims of marital breakdown. However the fact that it will help some does not mean we must accept anything. We have an opportunity to give real leadership and put appropriate legislation on the Statute Book.  The only effective way to do that is to have appropriate legislation in conjunction with the deletion of the constitutional ban on divorce.  We are offering the people an unreal choice &mdash; either an absolute ban or an inflexible formula which cannot be changed except by another referendum &mdash; and that is unfair.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party, speaking about these issues, said on 20 October 1992:</P>
    <P>By writing the words into the Constitution we will confuse people... This confusion also serves to make the point that it is almost impossible <Col N="820" /> to legislate for a complex set of circumstances by seeking to insert a sentence into the Constitution.... Almost every single word in the Government's proposed amendment is loaded with potential meaning.  No one can predict at this stage whether or not the issue will be the subject of litigation in the future.  What is clear is that statements of &ldquo;Government intent&rdquo; are a meaningless basis for predicting the outcome of any future test by the Supreme Court.  The words will be judged on what they mean, and not on what the present Government would like them to mean.</P>
    <P>What the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, said then applies equally to the provisions of this legislation, and I agree with it.</P>
    <P>The Government has not given adequate consideration to the interaction between the proposed Bill and existing provisions of the Constitution, as my colleagues Deputy O'Malley and Deputy Keogh highlighted last week. For example, Article 41 states that the family based on marriage is &ldquo;the natural, primary and fundamental unit of society and ... a moral institution possess[ing] inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Will this refer to the first or second marriage?  The Article goes on to say the State &ldquo;guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State...  The State pledges itself to guard with special care the institution of Marriage, on which the family is founded, and to protect it against attack.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When the amendment is written into the Constitution it will conflict with existing provisions.  Only the Supreme Court can adjudicate on how that will be resolved.  Besides the time factor, the expense and delay, it may well be that within four or five years, when all the Supreme Court interpretations have been made, many Oireachtas Members <Col N="821" /> will deeply regret the course taken in this debate.</P>
    <P>Last week the Taoiseach said that when he became Leader of Fine Gael, he declared that his party had the political courage to place difficult social issues before the Irish people.  It does not take courage to place issues before the people &mdash; that is the strategy of letting the people decide.  What takes courage is to give leadership, to seek support for an unpopular cause.  In 1992 the current Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>The real tragedy of the Government's approach is that it is unnecessary to force the electorate as this amendment does, if it goes through in its present form, to guess, guesstimate or take a chance on what the sentence will actually mean when the Supreme Court comes to interpret it.  It is unnecessary to force the electorate, unfairly, to select between competing and conflicting legal assertions... The very existence in this House of doubt and debate about the meaning of the various words shows that we should stop this progress now and choose a different course...  The proffering of a formula involving that level of uncertainty represents a grave failure of leadership.</P>
    <P>I agree with that.  Do we want a Constitution which prevents this legislature from legislating on the details of family law?  Do we want unchallengeable and unalterable court decisions as to what does or does not constitute &ldquo;living apart&rdquo; or &ldquo;a reasonable chance of reconciliation&rdquo;?  Do we want judges, not democratically elected politicians, to have the last word?  Do we believe that in three to five years the conditions we write into the Constitution, which we now regard as strict, will not be regarded as grossly unfair and inflexible?</P>
    <P>Recently a commentator said we were good in Ireland at half-grasping nettles but to half-grasp them is much more painful.  If this House votes for the Government's Bill it is voting no confidence in itself.  It is endorsing the view <Col N="822" /> of a growing number outside the House that politicians cannot be trusted.  I urge the House to reconsider the approach and ask the Government not to be so inflexible with the reasonable arguments put forward by the Church of Ireland, lawyers with expertise in this area, and so many others.  The Government will not be doing so for the Progressive Democrats but to create more favourable, effective and flexible circumstances where those citizens who are victims of marital breakdown can have realistic and compassionate legislation.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the proposed referendum is to provide the people with the opportunity to decide whether the Constitution should be altered so that divorce and subsequent remarriage will be possible for those whose marriages break down.  All Members of this House who deal with their constituents on a daily basis are aware that marital breakdown is a fact of life in today's Ireland.  We know the problems and costs of breakdown, both social and financial, are with us already. We are also aware that many whose marriages have broken down have formed subsequent relationships which have endured and in which children have been born.</P>
      <P>This Government, in common with previous Government, is committed to protecting the family and marriage and there is clear evidence of this.  The Family Mediation Service, in operation since 1986, has been expanded, with funding of £300,000 this year.  It has a network of nationwide mediators.  Grant-aided voluntary organisations are providing marriage guidance counselling service and pre-marriage courses with funding of £750,000 in 1995.  The legal aid service has seen its most radical nationwide expansion since its establishment 16 years ago.  These services are proof of the Government's support for marriage.</P>

    <P>As to the grounds for divorce, the Bill provides that the four year period of separation can be accumulated over a five year period.  This allows a couple to <Col N="823" /> attempt a reconciliation without jeopardising the possibility of obtaining a divorce, should that be the ultimate decision.  The four year period is a guarantee that spouses will not enter into divorce lightly; they will have the necessary time to reflect on the serious step they are undertaking.</P>
    <P>There will be no &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; divorces under the constitutional amendment, which reflects this society's awareness that marriage is a process which must be worked at and is intended as a lifelong commitment.  However, where that commitment has come to an end over a long number of years, it is a denial of what we understand by marriage to demand that spouses continue to be bound by a legal relationship which is devoid of any real meaning.</P>
    <P>The amendment ensures provision for vulnerable spouses and children. Detailed arrangements have been made for the position governing occupational pensions so that a court may earmark a proportion of the retirement benefit of a spouse who is a member of a pension scheme to provide for a benefit to be paid to a former spouse where the pension scheme contributor dies.  The vital contribution of a spouse who has chosen to look after the home and care for the family cannot be overlooked and must be taken into account by the court when deciding the overall adjustment of property.</P>
    <P>The Family Law Act increases the upper limit for the maintenance obligation for children in full time education from 21 years to 23 years.  Where the child has a mental or physical handicap the maintenance obligation may be indefinite.  The Act also provides for financial compensation orders, which may assign all or part of a spouse's interest in a life insurance policy in favour of the other spouse or a dependent family member.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Act, 1995 ensures that provisions of the social welfare code apply equally to those in need, regardless of whether their status is deserted, separated or divorced.  This <Col N="824" /> means, in effect, that a divorced person will not be at a loss in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements, as is the case for individuals who obtained a divorce abroad.</P>
    <P>The main areas in the social welfare code where protection of this kind is being provided is in regard to widows' and widowers' pensions, lone parents' and deserted wives' schemes, occupational injury benefits, family income supplement and prisoners' wives' allowances. A divorced person in employment who is supporting his or her former spouse and children may now qualify for a family income supplement if their pay is below the threshold.  The cost of these improvements has been estimated at less than £1 million over five years.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to give effect to the commitment in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, to hold a referendum in 1995 to remove the constitutional ban on divorce and remarriage on the basis of irretrievable breakdown. The Government has honoured its commitment to address in advance issues such as the protection of children, taxation, social welfare, inheritance laws and pension entitlements.</P>
    <P>This House should take a broad, humane view and address the reality of life and the welfare of people.  Much has changed since the last referendum in 1986 and many people who voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; in 1986 have changed their views.  This Bill is about the lives of 75,000 citizens in broken marriages and seeks to enable them to put their lives and legal affairs back in order.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to my Labour Party colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, for the calm, compassionate, reasonable and firm manner in which he has handled this very complex issue.  I am sharing my time with Deputy Boylan.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Kenny for sharing his time with me.  I will not <Col N="825" /> say that I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate, nevertheless I will not refuse the opportunity because that would be a soft option and one which a number of people will be taking.  We were elected to this House to face up to our responsibilities as legislators and we must also take the hard options, of which this is one.</P>
      <P>This is a difficult subject to debate but we must be realistic and honest with ourselves and those who sent us here and accept that many couples here have marital problems.  The family structure is very strong and will remain so as people are committed to marriage. Ninety per cent of marriages are successful. However, we must recognise that some people can get it wrong.  For some unknown reason it is not acceptable to say that some people have marital problems as if it is the one area where mistakes are not permitted.</P>
      <P>People can make mistakes, for various reasons, and they affect every strata.  I am aware of couples living in the poorest of circumstances on small farms or with small business who are struggling to bring up their families but one can sense the happiness in their homes.  Similarly, if a spouse is struck by ill health they support each other, which is marvellous to see.  Those who are comfortably off also enjoy life. However, the reverse is also true.  Difficulties in making ends meet or health problems place stress on families.</P>
      <P>I am not addressing those cases but in others a spouse may let his or her partner down or a person may change.  The old attitude was, &ldquo;you made your bed, now lie in it&rdquo;&mdash; that they knew what the person was like before they married them.  However, people hope that there will be changes when they get married, that drinking, gambling and socialising habits will change, but that does not always happen.  They, and their children, are then trapped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the children whom I am concerned about.  The children of broken marriages need guidance, more so now <Col N="826" /> than ever as there are so many distractions and opportunities for them to get into the wrong company.  If the parents are not living together, the State has a duty to ensure that those children receive a proper upbringing until they are 18 years of age.  None of us had any say in how we came into the world and we look to our parents for guidance.  If they are not living together children must have some other safeguard.  This Bill will introduce a safeguard and put structures in place to guarantee children their rights.  Similarly, wives should not have to put up with being battered.</P>
    <P>Some people are claiming that this Bill will open up a minefield of social problems and that marriage as we know it will break down completely, which is an insult to the thousands of happily married couples.  I do not accept the scaremongering of the anti-divorce lobby who see only doom and gloom. Marriage and family life are very strong here.  We can see people's commitment in building homes and taking out mortgages. However, we have to accept that marriages can go wrong.  I cannot say that divorce is the solution but I am prepared to address the problem.  The Church and the State have a role to play, although people's commitment to their own Church is a matter for themselves. I am not imposing divorce on anybody or asking anybody to remarry. However, there should be a proper legal separation procedure which will give rights to the partner who bears the brunt of the separation and to the children. I have no doubt that the people will make the proper decision on referendum day and I have every confidence in the people of Cavan-Monaghan to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to participate in this important debate.  I recall the last debate on this subject in the mid-1980s which, although I was not a Member of this House at that time, I felt was very divisive, difficult and harsh, particularly for those in broken marriages.  On this occasion, the approach by both sides has <Col N="827" /> been much calmer and rational, at least up to this point.  I hope that the remainder of the campaign will be conducted in a similar fashion.  On the last occasion, there was too much bitterness in the campaign for many people to make a rational decision.  I hope that all the arguments advanced by both sides will be clearly understood so that people can make their decision on this very important issue.</P>
      <P>Last week I addressed the Separated Spouses' Association on the issue and I was somewhat amazed at their lack of understanding of the complex issues involved, their unawareness of the legislation which has been put in place since 1986 and their inability to understand the meaning of that legislation for them. The second issue they raised &mdash; I felt it was crucial &mdash; was the financial implications of obtaining the right to remarry.  They expressed great concern that if the referendum is carried, those with money will be in a position to get a divorce much more quickly than those who will have to wait for free legal aid. As we know, while the service has been expanded considerably over recent years, there are still long waiting lists. That group expressed great concern that severe financial hardship would be imposed upon those who would have to wait for free legal aid.  Consequently, these issues will have to be substantially addressed at considerable cost by the Government to ensure that the service is developed whereby people do not have to wait as long as some would expect they may have to, thereby believing themselves discriminated against with regard to what may well become for them a right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I hear people speak in defence of marriage I listen carefully to what they are saying and then try to examine the record of our defence of marriage. In many cases we have not supported marriage and merely paid it lip service. For example, regarding the counselling services which have been put on a statutory basis, there are approximately <Col N="828" /> 75,000 families now in crisis.  Our allocation to this service was £750,000 in 1994 and the same figure in 1995.  If we were committed to defending marriage we would probably consider investing far greater resources in this very important service.  It is something the Government will have to look at.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned when I hear those who are opposed to the introduction of divorce and the right to remarry spell out the economic arguments against amending the Constitution to allow for divorce.  They speak of the effect of divorce on children.  Sadly, I have been in many a house in my constituency where I have found two people living together who should not do so in any circumstances.  These are people who married in good faith many years ago, who had children and who continue to live in the same house although it does not benefit them and certainly does not benefit their children.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, probably addresses situations such as this effectively.  However, there is a culture which says there should be no divorce, that families should stay together and that husbands and wives should stay together at all costs.  This ought not to be the case for the individuals themselves and for children.  It is saddening and sickening to see, as I have seen, children broken and traumatised by the effects of what goes on in their homes where the partners have stayed together.  We see children who will not or cannot stay at home, who end up in detention centres and other institutions because they are living in a totally dysfunctional home that long ago should have gone through the process whereby the issues involved were addressed in a calm and rational way, and where, if it was the case that the parents could no longer live together in peace and harmony, they should have parted.  Such a course of action would have a far better effect on children than forcing them to live in a situation that is totally unsuitable for them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="829" /> I have seen women impoverished in homes in which there is marital discord but, following a divorce there is no reason to think that the economic circumstances of those concerned would get worse, they would get infinitely better because those concerned might have better control over whatever income is available to them through social welfare and so on.</P>
    <P>Women are impoverished not only economically but in other ways.  If a couple has to stay together because the culture is such that they should not part, that there is no divorce and, therefore, no right to remarry, the situation then emerges where individuals find themselves in second relationships.  They have come through a marriage that has broken down and, having lived together happily for many years, find themselves in the difficult situation where they cannot, according to their remit, go through a second marriage ceremony in order, as they see it, to put things right.  I recall a case where a lady had lived in a situation where nobody in her family, including the person who thought he was her husband, had realised that she had been married 30 years before.  She carried the cross and worry for 30 years that somehow a document would appear, such as a birth certificate, marriage certificate or some other State certification, that would blow her cover.  She lived with this through her life and all her children had, according to the law which I do not fully understand, effectively the wrong names.</P>
    <P>I see no good reason, in so far as a partnership has broken down and a certain amount of time has elapsed to confirm this, that those who then wish to remarry should not have the right to do so.  If we are capable as a nation of tackling this issue in a compassionate way we will have developed significantly as a society from when we last discussed this issue in 1986.  If we implement much of the legislation already in place to cope with family breakdown and the breakdown of marriage between husband and wife we will be doing a terrific service for society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="830" /> For a long time we have lacked compassion and have always taken the view that things should be swept under the carpet, whether it be child sex abuse coming from a specific section of society, harsh regimes in children's centres and in schools in the past and so on.  Our way of dealing with these issues has always been to sweep them under the carpet.  If we do not talk about them openly they will not be discussed and they might go away.  Similar considerations apply to wife battering etc.  I visited a women's aid home in the past week and was saddened to see young children with mothers who had come through very traumatic situations and were there because of a variety of problems within the family setting.</P>
    <P>It is time we recognised that even though we claim to be a great Christian country and adhere to a specific religious persuasion, we have not acted any better than many other countries which do not strongly adhere to any specific religious belief.  We have much progress to make.  We can tackle this issue in a social and compassionate way and, therefore, mature as a society.</P>
    <P>Many issues must be tackled.  Some have already been addressed in the different Bills that have been introduced since 1986.  This issue should have been properly and rationally addressed long before now.  The fact that it is again before us and that it is being addressed in perhaps a more reasonable way means that at least those with a different point of view will be able to put it forward in a calm way and in a way that is not as divisive as previously and which led to the defeat of the introduction of the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>I supported the right to remarry and divorce then, I do so now and will continue to do so right through the campaign. I do not request that people be swayed by my arguments.  I simply say that in my experience as a public representative I have learned a great deal about the problems of family and married life.  I, therefore, believe it is essential that all the information is put fairly and squarely on the table so that all the <Col N="831" /> people can understand the issues.  If this referendum campaign fails it will be because the people are still not satisfied that they have all the information to enable them to make up their minds in comparison with the past occasion when there was much doubt, worry and concern genuinely held by people who failed to grasp the complexities of what we were trying to do.</P>
    <P>I hope we get it right on this occasion.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>I commend the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, for raising at a very early stage in her ministry the necessity to alter the bail laws.  During her time in office she has shown a strong commitment to reform of the criminal justice system and, in particular, the bail laws.  She deserves the support of the House in this regard.</P>
      <P>Before the Government came into office the Department of Justice was in the hands of the Fianna Fáil Party, yet nothing was done to reform the bail laws.  Now that the Minister has raised the issue, shown her determination to deal with it and won the support of her colleagues in Government, the Fianna Fáil Party has come into the House with a Private Members' Bill.  Yet it did nothing when it was in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public are concerned about law and order issues.  Last night at a meeting of Westport Urban District Council the <Col N="832" /> Minister for Justice was called upon to set up a part time police force.  This indicates the concern among the general public about the level of crime.  Last week having left this House at 5.10 p.m. I parked my car in Lower Mount Street. As I was paying the parking charge I saw the traffic warden walking up and down the street.  However, during the three minutes it took me to leave a message into an office in Lower Mount Street my car was broken into, the windscreen and one of the side windows were broken and my car phone was stolen.  This cannot be allowed to continue.</P>

      <P>It is fair to say there will be much coverage of the verdict in the OJ Simpson trial in tomorrow's newspapers and this debate will not be a priority.  However, once this seven day wonder is over the concern of the community about crime and lawlessness will bring us back to reality very quickly.  I warmly welcome this Bill.  Before referring in detail to the urgent need for change in our bail laws I commend Deputy O'Donoghue on his highly effective and responsible pursuit of law reform at a time when there is an unprecedented level of serious crime in society.  The problem has been greatly aggravated by the perception that the Minister for Justice is encountering severe difficulties in making any meaningful response to the crime explosion.  It is felt that the Minister finds it almost impossible to obtain the unequivocal support of her Cabinet colleagues even for the measures she considers most important.  For example, we can all recall the poor response to her publicly stated plan to deal urgently with the deficiencies in the bail laws.  Her lack of political skill in the matter proved an impediment to acceptance of her proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="833" /> It must be freely admitted that there are genuine but potentially fatal policy differences between the three Government parties on law and order and on civil liberties.  These differences have, of necessity, been glossed over as the Government has striven to project a unified front on a large number of issues in the interests of openness, transparency and accountability.  I fervently urge the Government to come clean on its plans to tackle the crime wave and ensure that further crime is not committed by an accused person out on bail. If a stalemate has been reached in the Government parties, it is not only desirable but absolutely vital that the crisis is openly admitted.  If the matter cannot be speedily resolved by them, then the only responsible step open to them is to give up office without further delay. Failure to deal speedily and comprehensively with the current stand-off will be paid for directly by the numerous unfortunate victims of crime.</P>
    <P>I do not underestimate the profound difficulties facing the Government parties. However, as the members of the previous Government are only too well aware, even the perception of a major error of judgment in modern political life can result in swift and devastating retribution.  The recent debacle about the number of prison places strongly suggests that the current Administration has reached the end of its honeymoon. It must now accept the two stark options open to it.  It must either come to an acceptable accommodation on the inter-party differences and rapidly bring forward the necessary legislative and operational changes to allow the ordinary citizens live without fear for their personal safety and property or if the Government establishes that its internal difficulties are too extensive and pronounced to offer a realistic hope of future cohesion in the formulation, processing and implementation of criminal law, it should do the honourable thing and face the consequences.</P>
    <P>The response of the Opposition parties to the crisis in the justice area has largely been controlled and responsible. <Col N="834" /> The Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Justice, Deputy O'Donoghue, has been particularly admirable in his approach. Rather than indulge in the many opportunities for cheap political point scoring offered by a Government in crisis, he has focused his considerable energies on developing positive and potentially effective initiatives.  His offer of practical assistance to the Minister in her hour of need &mdash; may be hours of need &mdash; has, unfortunately, been met with a dismissive and extremely insecure response. One can only hope that in the interests of the public the Minister adopts a more receptive attitude in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>The proposed changes in the bail law offer an early opportunity to the Minister in this regard.  If we accept for one moment that a penalty is imposed by the lack of cohesion in the current Administration on our overall response to the rocketing crime level, it is time to briefly consider the scale and nature of the crime problem in society.  Only the most blind observer will deny that the extent and nature of criminal activity in society has been on the increase for years. While the illegal acquisition of money or property continues to be the focus of most crime, the diversity and extent of violent crimes against the person has shown a nasty upward turn in recent decades.  While brutal crimes such as murder, rape, sexual abuse and grievous assault were a rare occurrence in the relatively recent past, today we can rarely read the daily newspapers without seeing reports of such crimes.</P>
    <P>Numerous explanations have been offered for this extremely unwelcome trend.  Many people strongly believe that the perceived breakdown in traditional values in a variety of areas is largely responsible for increasing crime rates.  Increased permissiveness, a reduced sense of responsibility and a general sense of a loss of morality have been identified as contributing to recent patterns of crime.  Dramatically increased levels of unemployment are also widely blamed.  However, the single most important factor in the immediate <Col N="835" /> past must be the seemingly major explosion of our drugs problem.</P>
    <P>Figures released in recent times are extremely frightening.  There may be as many as 5,000 heroin addicts in Dublin city alone.  Feeding their habit may require in the region of £150 per day or approximately £50,000 per year.  We should consider the trail of disaster drug addiction leaves.  Young lives are totally destroyed, physically and mentally.  Personal aspirations and plans are consigned to the rubbish bin.  The addict's family is plunged into a frightening situation. Their loved one has utterly changed into a haunted person with an ever decreasing sense of responsibility to other members of the family unit.  In many instances the family is the first target of the criminal behaviour which almost inevitably follows drug addiction. Ultimately, the family may even come to fear the addict in his or her descending spiral of behaviour.  The family unit becomes unrecognisable from its original state.  The cost of maintaining a drug habit is alarming.  If one victim was required each week for each addict to steal the necessary funds to feed his or her habit, 5,000 addicts would generate a massive quarter of a million crime incidents and victims in one year, a frightening but, unfortunately, true statistic.</P>
    <P>The increasing link between criminal activity and drug abuse has effectively resulted in a snowballing effect on our legal system.  In the initial stages our Garda force is increasingly being forced to divert scarce resources towards dealing with the primary and secondary effects of drug abuse.  This immediately takes a certain degree of pressure off non-drug related crimes.  Our courts are the next link in the chain of justice to be damaged.  A clear consequence is obviously the increased workload which is being forced through an inadequately staffed courts system.  While this immediately generates totally unacceptable delays in the processing of individual cases, the lack of any transparent audit system on the quality of <Col N="836" /> justice administration prevents one from assessing whether the rushed processing of cases reduces the quality of the system's performance.  The inevitable outcome of the overall explosion in drug related crime is that extra prison spaces are required.  The overall pattern points in one direction, one either deals rapidly, comprehensively and effectively with the overall problem in a systematic and planned manner or one effectively endangers the overall legal system.  I sincerely urge the Minister to turn over a new leaf and inject the necessary elements into her operation of the justice portfolio.  If she rectifies the omissions, she could be assured of support and tolerance from this side of the House as she goes about her vital tasks. However, a continuation of the current state of stagnation will leave the Opposition benches with no alternative but to pursue the overall situation to its logical conclusion.</P>
    <P>The limitations of our current laws regarding the granting of bail are undoubtedly aggravating an already dire crime situation.  The Minister correctly identified this problem at a very early stage subsequent to assuming office.  The recent report of the Law Reform Commission on an examination of the law on bail provides shocking new information on the extent of abuse of our bail laws.  The contents of table B on page 36 of that report are particularly alarming.  The table shows that only 36 per cent of the 98,772 reported offences in 1993 resulted in detection. Therefore, two thirds of reported crime goes without redress.  Another relevant finding from the table is that 9 per cent of all detected crimes were carried out by people on bail at the time of arrest. That involved a total of 3,201 detected crimes during 1993.  Taking into account the 3:2 ratio of reported and detected crimes, it is reasonable to estimate that a staggering 10,000 crimes are committed annually by those on bail.  That is equivalent to approximately 30 crimes and 30 victims daily.  Those are shocking figures and clearly indicate the urgency of reform in the granting of bail.  It also <Col N="837" /> means that every day reform is delayed a further 30 victims are potentially unnecessarily added to the list of those violated by criminal acts.  That is the equivalent of 210 cases a week and almost 1,000 incidents monthly.</P>
    <P>As well as generating many avoidable victims of crime, the laxity of our bail laws has two further appalling consequences. It is extremely difficult for our various law enforcement agencies to continue to perform at their current excellent level when they see the extent of repeated offences committed by those released on bail.  Those involved in crime are only encouraged by the status quo.</P>
    <P>The Minister has strung out her honeymoon period to heroic levels.  To fully discharge her difficult portfolio, she must rapidly prepare an unprecedented range of measures to turn the overall tide decisively in favour of the vast majority of law abiding citizens in our society.  She could do no better than learn from the application and effectiveness of Deputy O'Donoghue, who has been a good friend to her in this House by being constructive, forthcoming and assisting her.  A major problem faced by the Minister is that her Government colleagues are not on her side.  They have not taken the crime problem seriously and we are all suffering as a result. Fianna Fáil has approached the problem in a constructive and positive manner and I strongly urge the Minister and parties not to vote down this Bill tomorrow night.  It is an important Bill and close to the Minister's heart, but it may not be close to the hearts of some of her colleagues.  The Bill has been introduced as expected and demanded by the public.  The decision to enact this legislation is not mine, it lies with the Minister and the Government.  They have a responsibility to enact this legislation as quickly as possible to give people the assurance, confidence and protection to which they are entitled.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1995, known as the bail Bill, <Col N="838" /> introduced by our spokesman on justice, Deputy O'Donoghue.  I align myself with the comments of my colleague, Deputy Dan Wallace.  Last week the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, made all sorts of excuses for doing nothing on the issue of bail.  She used the recently published report of the Law Reform Commission as a smokescreen for her inaction.  I found the Minister's response to the initiative of my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, most disappointing. The reality is that the report of the Law Reform Commission had been available to the Government since 17 August and the Minister cannot hide behind that report.  Rather than put this burning issue on the long finger, the Minister should immediately honour the commitment she made publicly earlier this year and support our Bill to amend the Constitution in relation to the bail laws.  The Minister would have our full support if she were to take that honourable course and ensure that the balance is tilted in favour of the victim as against the perpetrator of the crime.  She would no doubt have widespread support from the public who demand that legislators tackle the issue of crime head on.  As a Deputy representing a Dublin constituency, it would be unwise of any of us to ignore the demands being made by our constituents.</P>
      <P>I am amazed that the Minister did not avail of the opportunity during this debate to reverse her disastrous decision in relation to the construction of Castlerea Prison.</P>
      <P>The serious crisis in relation to prison space is central to this debate.  My colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, and others have re-emphasised that point not just in this debate but in other debates over the past months.  The Government must consider every possible means to proceed with the construction of Castlerea prison and any other prison required to accommodate the growing numbers of criminals in our midst.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the many demands on our public finances and support the Minister for Finance in his efforts to <Col N="839" /> control public spending.  Fianna Fáil has put on the record its views on public spending and what this Government should be doing in that regard.  For that reason I ask the Government to examine new ways of getting private sector investment for the construction of prisons. I know the Government is aware of proposals presented by Mr. Liam Lenihan at the &ldquo;Property 2001&rdquo; conference last month on tax incentives for investment in public buildings, capital and infrastructural projects.  The lesson to be learned from the urban renewal scheme is that substantial private sector funds are available for investment if attractive tax breaks are provided.</P>
    <P>Designation, as every Deputy in this House is aware, has been a major driving force for urban renewal development. Private sector capital, with the incentive of a tax break, could be attracted to fund what would normally be public and centrally funded buildings such as prisons.  Projects could be undertaken on a sale and lease back structure, for example.  Investors would get tax breaks for 13 years and the Government would rent the accommodation at a low rate.  The Government would retain control in having the option to purchase at the end of term.</P>
    <P>Because this matter is so serious I ask the Minister immediately to rescind her decision in relation to Castlerea and examine as a matter of urgency the possibility of private sector involvement in prison building.  We cannot afford to delay any longer on this issue.  Six hundred prison spaces are required immediately. Prisons could be built under a tax incentive scheme and when, hopefully, the present crisis in prison space is behind us, the prisons could be converted into community, sports or leisure centres.  Account should be taken of that at planning and construction stages to allow for modification when appropriate in the future.  Innovative and radical thinking is required to deal with the prison crisis and I urge the Minister and the Government to consider the option <Col N="840" /> of private sector involvement.  I put this forward as a serious proposal and hope it is taken in that manner.</P>
    <P>The Minister must also deal as a matter of urgency with the problem of the delay between the arrest and charging of a suspect and the subsequent trial. The shortage of judges is obviously a major problem and the Minister must address this matter.  As my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, pointed out in his contribution to this debate, only three Circuit Court judges are permanently available in Dublin to deal with indictable crime.  Fianna Fáil's Criminal Procedure Bill, 1995, published by Deputy O'Donoghue, will provide for a fast track approach to specific crimes and allow for a real reduction in the delay in cases coming for trial.  It is totally unacceptable that in our capital city it takes an average of at least one year to process a case from arrest to trial.  That is a central issue in this debate and it has been pointed out by my colleagues on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>The serious drugs crisis has been referred to by almost everyone who has contributed to this debate.  An all out assault must be made on those involved in the drugs industry.  The drug barons, the pushers and those making a living from destroying our young people must be rooted out of society and every legal weapon used to do so.  I encourage the Minister to explore every possible avenue in this area.  She will have my full support.</P>
    <P>The growth in the use of the ecstasy drug has been frightening.  Last year 10,000 ecstasy tablets were confiscated by the gardaí.  This year so far, that figure has risen to a staggering 180,000. Many awareness campaigns are under way to highlight the dangers of this drug.  We must get the message across that ecstasy can kill.  Unfortunately, many young people, through peer pressure, are not aware of the danger of taking even half a tablet.  For that reason, I regret that the UCD students union has <Col N="841" /> advised students in its awareness literature that if they are using ecstasy for the first time, they should take only half a tablet.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to representatives of the students union and I am aware it has an excellent poster campaign highlighting the fact that ecstasy can kill.  I would argue, however, that any representative group campaigning on the dangers of ecstasy should spell out unequivocally that this drug can kill. The tragic death of Stephen McMillan at the Point Depot rave event some months ago brought this harsh reality home to all of us.  While the motivation and intent behind the students union campaign is genuine &mdash; and I encourage it to continue with its work &mdash; it should think again in relation to this aspect of it.  Young people must be made aware of the dangers of this drug and the fact that it can kill them.</P>
    <P>The central issue we are debating tonight is bail.  The reality is that the law as it currently stands does not permit our courts to remand a person charged with a criminal offence in custody even if the court is satisfied that the accused person is likely to commit serious criminal offences if released.  The Minister is on public record as saying she wants changes in our bail laws and we support her in that.  She is also on public record as saying that she wants to have a referendum to amend the Constitution in this regard.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has been accused of being mischievous on this issue.  That is not the case and the record speaks for itself. It is clear that when the Minister made her views known publicly, there were objections from Labour backbench TDs.  What is the policy position of the Labour Party and Democratic Left on this crucial issue?  As I understand it, clear divisions have arisen between the Minister for Justice and the Tánaiste in this regard and I would like to hear from our fellow parliamentarians in the Labour Party and Democratic Left about their policy position on this issue. They have managed to paper over many <Col N="842" /> cracks but there is a fundamental principle involved here.  We support the Minister for Justice in her endeavours. Those people who hold personal positions and whisper from the back benches but who go through the lobbies at the end of the day should get off the fence.  They should make their positions known.</P>
    <P>This debate provides an opportunity for the Minister for Justice to show her strength and leadership and to indicate that she wants to stand by her own public commitment.  I suggest she should do that by supporting our Bill.  It has been the practice in the past that if the Opposition puts forward a Bill worthy of support, the Government accepts it on the basis of some amendments being made. I hope that will be the case tomorrow.  I ask the Minister for Justice to support the Bill put forward by my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>

      <P>This debate is taking place against a background of increasing crime in the Dublin area.  In the circumstances, it is essential to seek extra powers to deal with the problem.  The demand for changes in the bail laws is just one of the suggestions to tackle the problem of increasing crime.  Any changes in our bail laws should be carefully considered before being introduced. I say that with a great deal of background information and much practical experience of the difficulties being experienced by people in the Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The law on bail can be traced to a Supreme Court judgment in the O'Callaghan case in 1966 which decided that bail might be refused only on two grounds: first, where there is evidence that an accused person would interfere with witnesses or other evidence in a <Col N="843" /> case and, second, where there is evidence that an accused person would not stand trial.  An attempt by the Director of Public Prosecutions in 1989 to change the position failed when he argued that a balance did exist of equal constitutional rights: the right of the accused to their liberty and the right of the public to bodily integrity and the protection of their property.  At that time it was decided that the right to liberty was superior to the other stated right.  Today that would probably be argued as being slightly out of date.  Any changes in curtailing liberty could be considered as a form of punishment in respect of a person who has not been convicted of any crime.  It could be described as a form of preventive justice, which does not exist in our legal system.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission report enables us to consider this matter carefully rather than as a reaction to the increasing crime level being experienced. Any laws introduced in this House should be carefully considered rather than passing them as a reaction to events forcing us to take immediate action.  The report of the commission is divided into six chapters.  It deals with the areas of law relating to bail in Ireland, offending on bail, the extent of the bail problem, prediction studies, the laws relating to bail in other jurisdictions, preventive detention and the arguments and alternative methods of dealing with bail offending.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments being put forward for changes in our bail laws is the circumstance where a person on bail commits a crime on the understanding that the punishment will only equal the amount apportioned for the first crime and that they can offend with virtual impunity.  Section 11 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, requires the imposition of consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail and is referred to in the Law Reform Commission's report which states that a number of judicial decisions involving this section would suggest that it might not be working as the Oireachtas had <Col N="844" /> intended.  In the case of grave offences, and to avoid unjust punishment on the accused, the sentence should be adjusted downwards.  This practice has developed and must be considered.  We must examine this section with a view to considering what changes are required.</P>
    <P>The traditional remedy for breach of bail is the forfeiture of bail money but it is rarely enforced.  We must ask ourselves why this remedy is not enforced by the courts.  Often the reasons given are that the spouse may have been the bails person and would be left destitute if bail were forfeited.  We will have to examine this and ask ourselves why the bail system is not working.  The provisions of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 regarding the confiscation of the proceeds of crime may partly address the career criminal using their time while on bail to improve their finances.</P>
    <P>If we change our bail laws how will we deal with persons detained without bail prior to their trial and who are then acquitted?  It is difficult to decide what would satisfy a person who was deprived of their liberty.  In some continental jurisdictions there is a move to provide a system of compensation in such cases.  Do we wish to consider this course of action and the cost it might entail for the taxpayer?  The best course of action would be the proposal regarding the new offence of breaching of bail conditions.</P>
    <P>The conditions of bail should be that the accused refrain from offending while on bail or create an actual offence of offending on bail.  This would mean, in relation to an offence committed while on bail, that two offences would be committed, the actual offence of, say, robbery and a further crime &mdash; which is a separate offence &mdash; of breaking of bail conditions.  The commission notes that this approach would not result in the detention of the accused person prior to their trial in respect of the original offence.  A combination of this new measure with a reactivation of the consecutive sentencing would be the best approach to our difficulties.</P>
    <P>Crime is committed often by persons <Col N="845" /> on drugs and &mdash; this is a new phenomenon and the most difficult one we have to face &mdash; the addiction causes the offender to relentlessly feed the habit from which they are suffering; therefore, it clouds their opinion as to the correct way to respond to measures we introduce.  The problem of dealing with crime associated with drugs is a difficult one.  If all those people are taken into custody prior to their trials we may have a large number of people flooding the prison service which would require us to introduce a medical counselling service in the prisons to deal with the situation while awaiting trial.  This should be examined.  It is not necessarily the only reason a change should be considered in the bail laws.  I outlined my attitude to change in the bail laws.  If all measures contained in the commission's report are considered by the House to be inadequate then we will have to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the work being done by the Garda in the constituency of Dublin South West in Tallaght, Clondalkin, Crumlin and Terenure.  They do an excellent job with limited resources. The information I get from them is that they need extra gardaí to deal with crime at ground level.  The provision of extra gardaí is the first step towards dealing with crime in my constituency. If this request is acceded to it will go a long way towards solving the problems being experienced.</P>
    <P>If we make our bail laws stricter there is no guarantee that crime committed by persons released on bail will be reduced significantly.  In Britain where the bail regime is stricter, a higher proportion of crime is committed by persons on bail than is the case here.  The Garda estimate that 9 per cent of all detected crime in Ireland is carried out by persons while on bail.  Concern has also been expressed about the early release of prisoners serving long sentences and the crimes committed by them.  Regulating bail is not the only solution to the problem.  Nothing less than a radical overhaul of the prison service and <Col N="846" /> measures to speed up the criminal court process will be the long term solution.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to bring the Courts and Court Officers Bill before the House and the provision for the appointment of 17 extra judges. This will begin the process of reform that is urgently needed.  We should consider all aspects of the Law Reform Commission's report and deal with it seriously.  If we concentrate only on one aspect, that is, changing the bail laws, the problem may continue to escalate out of control and we may well have to come back to this House and again address the matter.  Why not examine all aspects of our laws relating to crime and bring forward a comprehensive package of reforms required to deal with the problem?</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Some criminals commit serious crimes against the person when out on bail.  The Oireachtas should reflect on the general public's growing anxiety and frustration with this issue.  The ordinary citizen may not understand the subtleties of the legal views expressed by the various civil liberty groups but they know that when the forces of law and order have gathered sufficient evidence in serious cases and the Director of Public Prosecutions believes that the alleged criminals should stand trial it is upsetting to see some of those criminals roaming the streets and committing crime while out on bail.  However, reform of the bail laws is not the only answer to the crime wave.  I have seen figures indicating that at least one in ten alleged criminals commit serious offences while out on bail.  Other reports show a higher percentage but there are no hard and fast statistics.  Many speakers referred to the time lapse between the arrest of the alleged wrongdoer and the consequent court hearing, which seems inordinately long.  We obviously need more judges to adjudicate on serious crimes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The view of the Law Reform Commission seems to be that by international standards, we have fewer persons in custody pending trial and that <Col N="847" /> Ireland is unusual among the common law jurisdictions in having failed to introduce much more comprehensive bail legislation during the past few years.  Nobody in the civil liberties movement can ask why fix it if it is not broken.  Our crime rates are spiralling and have been for many years &mdash; which is one of the problems I have with tonight's motion.  Even if we were to hold serious crime rates at today's level it would be totally unacceptable by our standards.  There is not much point in saying it is only a fraction of the crime in New York as by our standards it is particularly bad.</P>
    <P>The report of the Law Reform Commission should be studied and the people given the opportunity to vote on stricter bail conditions.  This would give a much clearer indication to judges of the persons who would be allowed out on bail.  Gardaí feel they are fighting crime with one hand tied when they see alleged criminals on bail who seem to have the blessing of the establishment. In Dublin, in particular, there seems to be scant regard for the so called restrictions placed on alleged criminals.  Basically this is tantamount to giving the finger sign to the Garda which is the same as insulting the general public. There must be very definite checks and balances when alleged criminals are held in custody and cases should be held quickly.  For instance, the question of very poor defendants will have to be looked at and one may wonder if O. J. Simpson had been poor what the decision would have been.  It is very important that poor people have access to the best legal representation.</P>
    <P>I would like to see criminals who rob and plunder and cause serious bodily harm held in custody.  I do not want to see this type of wrongdoer out on bail and the general public share that view. The fight against crime is multifaceted and no single measure will ever come to grips with the crime wave.  It is incumbent on everyone to ensure that the many pieces of the jigsaw are put together.  The question of bail is but one <Col N="848" /> part of the jigsaw, although it is an important one.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will give serious consideration to the report of the Law Reform Commission and would like to see the general public having an opportunity to vote in a referendum to reduce the possibilities of criminals reoffending while on bail.  It is important to put the issues in context and as well as reform of the bail laws we want more prison places.  I heard Deputy Michael Kitt wax eloquently about the prison in Castlerea.  I have always been a supporter of that project and hope it will come to fruition.  I find it hard to take Fianna Fáil's efforts to drive a wedge between the Fine Gael Party and its partners.</P>

      <P>I agree with most of what the previous speaker, Deputy Connaughton, said.  In the context of criminal law, it is extraordinary that for the fifth time in 12 months we are discussing a motion or a Bill on the question of bail.  One would think that solving the bail difficulties would be the solution to the problem of serious crime.  The issue of bail is a serious one, but it is a very small component of the criminal law.  I am becoming weary of speaking on bail in Private Members' time.  It is extraordinary that on the very day of the publication of the Law Reform Commission report, Deputy O'Donoghue should move a Bill that he believes will solve our problems.  Why did the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, bother to commission a report if Fianna Fáil were going to pre-empt its findings by introducing a two-page Bill?  I do not believe Deputy O'Donoghue or his colleagues are so naive as to think a change in the bail laws will solve the problem of crime.  If we accept that Deputy <Col N="850" /> O'Donoghue and his colleagues are not so naive, we must examine the political motivation behind their Private Members' Bill.  Listening to the Members opposite, one would think there had been no crime before Fianna Fáil left office last November.</P>
      <P>If we are going to tamper with our bail laws and put a constitutional referendum before the people, we must first provide a specific remand centre and deal with delays.  A radical overhaul of our court system will be called for if we are to provide an efficient and consumer-friendly criminal justice system. Government and legislators must accept much of the responsibility for the delays in bringing accused persons to trial, but the Bar and the Judiciary are not without fault.  I was amazed by what a member of the Dublin Bar Association said on radio today, and by the comments of an eminent senior counsel, Mr. James Nugent, in today's newspapers.  One would think that 100 per cent of the blame for the delays lay at the door of the politicians.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal to appoint 17 new judges, but I challenge her and the Government to best employ these judges by changing the work practices and conditions of judges and barristers. These must be subjected to a review.  It is extraordinary that, as we discuss a bail Bill for the umpteenth time, the long vacation in the Law Library has come to an end and the courts are resuming normal work.  The long vacation whereby the courts in this State close down for most of the summer and much of the autumn is outmoded and unjustified and contributes in no small way to the delays in the administration of justice.  It is the practice for some members of the Judiciary in this State to work a six-hour day and a four-day week.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  Although some judges operate efficiently and adopt consumeroriented practices, others refuse to leave their ivory towers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an enormous increase in the amount of business being channelled through the courts in the past few <Col N="851" /> years.  If we are to have a streamlined system of criminal justice administration we will have to separate the civil list, the criminal list and the family list, with particular reference to our Circuit Courts. There has been a huge increase in the family law area but, unfortunately, we still do not have a system of family courts.</P>
    <P>There is a fundamental message for our friends in the Law Library and on the Bench in the way we in this House have changed our work practices over the past five or ten years.  We have streamlined our working hours and increased our workload considerably. We have done so because not to do so would have met with considerable opposition from the public.  As practising politicians we are a most unpopular group of people, but if we had held on to old work practices which operated since the foundation of the State and continued until approximately ten years ago, we would not have been able to withstand the level of hostility from the public at large.</P>
    <P>Nothing has changed in the Law Library or in our courts however.  Why can the Circuit Court not sit on Mondays? Why does it not commence its deliberations until after 11 a.m.?  Why does the Circuit Court rise, more often than not, between 4 p.m. and 4.30 p.m.? Until the courts adopt a working programme similar to here, there will be no confidence in our justice system.  We must examine the role and function of the county registrars who are people with expert legal backgrounds and much to offer in terms of dealing with the court lists.  Reform of that function is overdue.</P>
    <P>Although changing our bail laws is important, it represents but a small component in the overall programme to tackle increasing rates of crime.  There is no simple solution.  If there were we could have drawn from the best in the Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and PD Bills.  We have not done that because the solution is not as simple as these Bills would have us believe.  We should take time to <Col N="852" /> consider the content of the Law Reform Commission report.  The bail laws should be reformed because we have the most lax system of bail in Western Europe.  This is further underlined in the Law Reform Commission report which finds that, among Council of Europe states, we have the fewest prisoners on remand.  The only reason for this is that our bail laws are too liberal.</P>
    <P>We must deal with the problem of prison places.  If we changed our bail laws in the morning to coincide with Deputy O'Donoghue's proposals, where would we get the places and the money to deal with the hundreds of people who would be taken off the streets in advance of the findings of any court?  It would be fundamentally unfair to treat innocent people in exactly the same way as those who are guilty.</P>
    <P>The difficulty with prison places can be tackled by examining the overall number of places in the context of the peace process. Portlaoise Prison, a fine institution in my constituency, could be expanded to accommodate prisoners in a much more effective manner than that proposed by the Department of Justice.  I ask Deputy O'Donoghue to hold off, to consider and digest the bulk of the Law Reform Commission's report and let us together, between now and the next occasion a bail Bill is introduced, deal with the problem and if the answer is to put it to the people, then so be it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Noel Ahern and O'Dea. I congratulate my colleague, Deputy O'Donoghue, for introducing this Bill. Many important issues have been raised during the debate.  I would point out to Deputy Flanagan that the treatment of this Bill by the Government is in stark contrast to the treatment meted out by Fianna Fáil administrations and Fianna Fáil-led administrations when his colleague, Deputy Shatter, successfully piloted through &mdash; if my memory serves me correctly &mdash; three Bills from the Opposition side of the House.  That will <Col N="853" /> not be forgotten.  Article 40.4.1º states: &ldquo;No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with the law.&rdquo;  That is an important Article and having regard to the turbulent background against which our forefathers drew up the Constitution, I am sure they were well aware what it meant.  At that time there were many difficulties in respect of civil rights and personal liberties. We must, therefore, be careful when altering that Article by way of legislation.  This Bill is very specific in regard to how it would operate relative to that Article.</P>
      <P>Many individuals reoffend while on bail.  Up to 25 per cent of muggings and robberies are committed by people on bail.  This has a detrimental effect on many sections of our law enforcement agencies.  It brings the Judiciary and the work of the Garda, particularly at local level, into disrepute.  Many individuals brought before the courts are allowed back into the community on bail and commit similar crimes again.  The community feels very aggrieved and is frightened about what is happening under the current interpretation of our bail laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain circumstances the law on bail appears to be tilted towards the alleged criminal.  The public are prepared to accept a considerable tightening up of the law to deal with this.  There is nothing worse than attending a public meeting at which the majority in attendance declare a lack of faith in the judicial system, in the ability of the gardaí to protect them and the prison system to house and detain criminals. When 500 or 600 people unanimously express such a view at public meetings it is time for society to be concerned about why they have reached such a conclusion.  Part of the reason for this arises from the way our bail laws operate. Our communities are under siege from the law breakers, whether in the area of drug abuse, robbery with violence, joyriding or whatever.  Our communities are experiencing extremely difficult times and it is about time we <Col N="854" /> recognised that the ordinary decent person going about his or her business is entitled to receive protection from the State through the efficient operation of the courts and the Garda.  Many Members referred to the delay in bringing cases to trial, something which obviously impinges on the operation of bail laws.  If it takes a year or more to bring a case to trial, the effect will be obvious.</P>
    <P>We must deal with our bail laws in tandem with a range of other law enforcement issues that need to be tackled.  Over the years we have all contributed to the failure to provide adequate detention centres, whether for ordinary prisoners or under-age offenders.  We have a great deal of catching up to do in that regard, but we can delay no longer on this issue.  We may have to provide special facilities to implement the provisions of this Bill, but if that is the case we must be prepared. Otherwise, people will lose confidence in the ability of this country to protect its citizens properly and will turn to unorthodox methods which, as we know, can have serious repercussions. This happened in one part of our island, causing great dissension in communities and is no way for a modern democracy to operate.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue's Bill may have clashed with the Law Reform Commission's report, but it provides an opportunity to seriously debate the issue.  While Members were sincere in making their views known, we must now make progress.  It is pointless for the Government to ask what we did when in office.  We must face up to the facts. It is up to the Government to grasp the nettle and introduce appropriate legislation. If it is not in a position to do so it should do what Fianna Fáil-led administrations did when in Government, that is occasionally accept Bills introduced by the Opposition.  That would be an indication of democracy and it would be good for this House.  I fail to understand why this Government, which comprises Members who stated exactly what I am saying about Private <Col N="855" /> Members' Bills when in Opposition, cannot on this occasion allow this legislation to pass.  It would not mean the end of the world, rather it would contribute to dealing with the serious issue of the breakdown of law and order.</P>

      <P>This Bill proposes to change the Constitution, a matter that is never taken lightly by any party in this House.  It has happened on only 13 or 14 occasions since the Constitution was written in 1937, but if there is a major anomaly in the system then that must be done.</P>
      <P>Many people see this Bill as an attempt to restore to the Constitution a meaning which most sensible people believe it should have.  I do not possess any legal qualifications, but it seems extraordinary that, as a result of the decision handed down in the 1966 case, a person cannot be detained, even where the judge feels they will commit further crimes while on bail.  This is crazy.</P>
      <P>The position has changed dramatically during the past 30 years. There was a time when criminals were happy to commit a robbery once a month or once a year, but now they commit crimes on a daily basis to feed their drug habit.  We have to introduce laws to tackle this problem.</P>
      <P>This Bill could not be described as radical.  If a referendum were passed by the people, Irish law would only be brought into line with the law in the United Kingdom and other countries. Our bail laws are far too lax and liberal.</P>
      <P>The drugs problem is the source of untold trauma.  The big £2 million robbery does not affect people, rather it is remote from them and something about which they read in the newspapers and hear about on television.  What hits home more are reports of old age pensioners being mugged and robbed of £20 while on their way to the shops.  Up to one dozen of these attacks occur each day.  This instils fear and terrifies people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although there are 10,000 gardaí it <Col N="856" /> seems that one can never find one when needed.  About one week ago my namesake was attacked outside a Garda station in the constituency of the Minister for Justice and there was not a garda in sight.  There was one bangharda present within the station, but when the going gets rough ban-ghardaí are not always able to cope.</P>
    <P>For 25 years the resources of the State have had to be deployed along the Border.  Thankfully, we are now on the way to resolving this major problem. There is an expectation that some of these resources will be redeployed, but 13 months on no one has been moved. The Minister has said this is a matter for the Garda Commissioner and the only commitment she has given is that new recruits coming out of Templemore will not be sent to the Border.  That is ludicrous. There is an expectation that some of these resources will be directed to where they are most needed in order to tackle the drugs problem.</P>
    <P>A number of months ago the Minister said in this House that she would introduce a Bill to amend the Constitution, but she has had to back down because of pressure from what I describe as the &ldquo;soft on crime&rdquo; wing of the Labour Party.  I have had to deal with them for many years on Dublin City Council. They keep coming up with the same old nonsense and refuse to face up to reality.  One of their loose cannons, Niall Stokes, who slagged us on a different issue last week, recently called for the legalisation of drugs.  These gurus are dictating the pace and policy of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connaughton mentioned that the parties in Government had bonded well together.  It is my wish that members of the Fine Gael Party who have a sound record on law and order issues, whatever else we may say about them, will get the message across to some of these dreamers who are not living in the real world and keep coming up with the same old intellectual nonsense. I hope that members of the Fine Gael Party will find their soul, put the boot in and do what is necessary.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> As Deputy Flanagan said, there is no simplistic solution to the crime problem. This Bill represents only part of the solution. If an opportunity presents itself to resolve a particular problem, one should take it.  It is lunacy to reject a Bill because it will not solve all our problems.</P>
    <P>The standard answer given by Ministers was that we should await the publication of the report of the Law Reform Commission.  Deputy O'Donoghue has been accused of opportunism in presenting this Bill &mdash; that is lunacy.  It is precisely because he introduced this Bill that the report was published.</P>
    <P>According to the official figures produced by the Garda Commissioner &mdash; this is not Fianna Fáil propaganda &mdash; the crime problem continues to worsen. The resources of the State which were tied up for many years along the Border should now be redeployed.  The gardaí should be more visible while the problems in the courts should be resolved. As Deputy Flanagan mentioned, most judges work from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day.  That is ridiculous.  I do not wish to refer to the O. J. Simpson trial which took one year to complete, but recently I saw a film in which a judge in the Philippines heard 14 murder cases in the one day.  I am not recommending that the courts here should move at that speed, but they could be more efficient.</P>
    <P>That this Bill will not solve all our problems is no reason it should not be accepted.  If the Minister is not in a position to give a commitment to do this she should give a definite commitment to stand up to her colleagues in Government and do what she stated she would do a few months ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill. Deputy Connaughton asked why Fianna Fáil did not hold a referendum sometime during the past seven years.  The reason is as follows: in 1990, the statistics showed that approximately 2,000 offences were committed by people while on bail.  This figure rose alarmingly to approximately 3,400 in 1993 and by a further 1,000 to 4,404 in 1994.  It <Col N="858" /> is obvious, therefore, that there was a startling rise in the number of detected crimes committed by people while on bail from 1992 onwards.  The problem had become so serious it was obvious there was an urgent necessity to do something about it.</P>
      <P>The then Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, responded by referring this complex matter to the Law Reform Commission, the expert body charged with the responsibility of advising the Government on whether the law should be changed.  That was the right and natural thing to do.  It has been obvious for some time that the O'Callaghan decision of 1966 is out of date. The interpretation of the Constitution by the Supreme Court may not have been out of joint with the times in 1966 but it certainly is now.  It becomes more irrelevant and wreaks more injustice on the population at large as each day passes.  It is not an exaggeration to say that the interpretation of the Constitution by the Supreme Court means that our bail laws are gravely unjust.</P>
      <P>The law in this area is complex and the question as to whether a referendum is necessary to change the bail laws, in light of the fact that this was the interpretation of the Constitution by the Supreme Court, exercised many minds, academic and otherwise.  The Minister for Justice at the time, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, asked the Law Reform Commission to study the matter. However, the present Minister, Deputy Owen, did not agree with that approach and decided unilaterally to pre-empt the commission's decision.  She announced that she would do the decent thing and initiate legislation to ask the people whether they wanted to amend the Constitution to enable us to change the bail laws.  The Bill proposes to do precisely what the Minister for Justice said it was right and proper to do in advance of the report of the Law Reform Commission. Consequently I am at a total loss to understand the Government's opposition to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice was overruled by her colleagues who, unlike her, were happy to use the commission as an excuse for inaction and prevarication.  However, the commission has now reported and all the excuses have evaporated.  I do not have sufficient time to deal in detail with its report but, unlike some, I do not find it particularly enlightening.  However, that is neither here nor there &mdash; it has reported and there is no further excuse for inaction.</P>
      <P>There is an old adage which states that the law is an ass.  The donkey-like qualities of our bail laws are best illustrated by reflecting soberly and calmly on how they operate in practice.  As our bail laws stand, a house breaker who is thought unlikely to turn up for trial can be denied bail.  However, a mass murderer or a serial killer must be granted bail if there is no reason to believe he will fail to turn up for his trial or will interfere with witnesses despite it being abundantly clear that he will continue to kill people in the period leading up to his trial.</P>
      <P>Two cases of recent vintage in my own area come to mind.  In one case a gentleman was charged with robbery. No violence was involved but he had a number of previous convictions for robbery. On some of those occasions he failed to turn up for trial.  That was mentioned at the remand hearing and he was denied bail.  The second case was where a person was charged with a particularly gruesome gangland style murder.  There was no evidence to suggest that he would interfere with witnesses or that he would not turn up for trial but there was plenty of evidence to show that he had every intention of increasing the body count in the interval leading up to his trial.  The court was compelled to give him bail and only the vigilance of the gardaí in Limerick, whom I commend, prevented him from increasing the body count.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been a number of trials in <Col N="860" /> the past decade in the United Kingdom and two in particular come to mind.  In both cases the people were charged and convicted.  The person on trial was charged with serious psychotic type serial killings.  Under the more sensible and sane bail laws in the UK they were detained pending trial.  They were not released back into the community even though there was no evidence that they would not turn up for trial or interfere with witnesses.  They were detained pending trial because of the certainty that they would not be able to stop killing if left on the streets.  If those cases had occurred here the courts would have been compelled to release them back into the community.  Can anyone seriously argue or advance the proposition that that is logical, right, just or sane?  To take an example from literature, the artful dodger would probably be denied bail because the indications would be he would not turn up for trial whereas Jack the Ripper or the Boston Strangler would have to be given bail unless there was something to indicate that they would not turn up for trial or interfere with witnesses.  That is the inadequacy and lunacy of our bail laws.</P>
    <P>The likelihood of a person reoffending is a criterion for refusing bail in most civilised countries and I am talking about countries where the criminal law regime is more liberal than in Ireland. The reason the law is so framed is to protect the citizens of those countries. Why should our citizens be asked to settle for less?  Are we saying our citizens are less entitled to protection than those of other countries?  That is what the Bill before the House seeks to address.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reflect calmly and honestly on the Bill and do as she promised last March, namely, accept the legislation before the House or introduce legislation which will achieve substantially the same result.  Despite the fact that I am asking the Minister to be reasonable and that it is on public record that she stated last March she would do the decent thing, I am somewhat pessimistic.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution to this Bill for which I do not see much need.  Any perusal of statistics on the breakdown of marriage would lead one to the conclusion that it constitutes a serious problem but not of the magnitude some people are endeavouring to portray. According to a 1993 labour force survey 58,000 of the approximate 1,600,000 people of our married population were separated.  Those figures illustrate that the rate of marriage breakdown here is between 3 per cent and 4 per cent, the worst statistics showing the percentage at approximately 4 per cent.</P>
      <P>We must ascertain the general effect marriage breakdown and divorce would have on our population, in particular, the consequences of divorce on children. We are aware of the problems and trauma to which they are subjected in the event of marriage breakdown. Therefore, the additional consequences of divorce following on the break up of marriage would not be in the best interests of children or of a stable future for them.  We are all aware of the trauma for children occasioned by the loss of a parent through natural causes, but the loss of a parent through divorce tends to totally divide families.</P>
      <P>We must also examine the financial problems caused by the loss of a parent through divorce.  Nobody has yet been able to quantify the additional costs to the State of the introduction of divorce. A figure of £500 million per annum has been mentioned which would appear to be fairly accurate if we take into account the cost in jurisdictions which permit divorce.  This means that if every marriage breakdown were to be addressed each would cost the State approximately £800,000 per annum, which figure undoubtedly would continue to rise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must examine carefully the consequences of divorce for children and their well-being.  While many legislative changes have been introduced since the previous referendum on divorce, insufficient work has been undertaken to afford those affected full protection, for example, to allow spouses who may not <Col N="865" /> wish to be divorced but who, because of the wording of the proposed referendum, may become involved in a no-fault divorce after four years.</P>
    <P>Anybody who contends that the present proposals amount to anything other than no-fault divorce after four years separation is merely leading the electorate up a blind alley.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has spoken to those involved in the break up of a marriage will fully understand that it is an established fact that most of those involved do not wish to remarry, and will make that point clearly to anybody who wishes to discuss the matter with them.</P>
    <P>Any examination of present family trends will lead one to the conclusion that the stability of families will be threatened if divorce is introduced here. Members will be aware of instances where, if divorce were to be freely available after a separation of four years, such families would already have broken up whereas, under present legislative provisions, such marriages are capable of being sustained once their initial problems are overcome.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the average duration of marriages ending in divorce is approximately seven years in the United Kingdom, approximately six in Canada and lower in the United States of America, the perceived likelihood that marriage will end in divorce renders prospective spouses somewhat wary of how much they should invest in the union. That will constitute a very serious question when it comes to considering whether to vote in favour of the introduction of divorce here.  Many spouses will want to ascertain how their present marital status and-or entitlements are protected within the present legislative regime of judicial separation and so on. They will want to ascertain whether they would be more secure under the legisative provisions obtaining or, in contrast, perhaps four years hence become involved in no-fault divorce proceedings.</P>
    <P>The electorate should be enlightened fully prior to voting in the referendum.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="866" /> While I have no hesitation in supporting putting this constitutional amendment to the electorate, when it comes to voting, I will vote &ldquo;no&rdquo; in the belief that we are not in a position to deal with the consequences of the introduction of divorce here.  Its effects generally, especially on children, spouses and their property rights, are not something with which I could live.</P>
    <P>The time is not right for the introduction of divorce and our legislation is sufficient to deal with the problem.  Divorce will merely add fuel to existing problems.</P>

      <P>It would be proper for people to reflect on the debate held approximately 15 years ago on contraception. At this stage we should ask ourselves the question &mdash; when we recollect the fuss and bother that arose in the course of that debate, with people appealing to their consciences and that of the nation, an Irish solution to an Irish problem &mdash; what it was all about. Yet, would anybody now dream of endeavouring to reintroduce the provisions of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935 on contraception? Of course they would not; they would be laughed out of court.  It is right to reflect on that, put it in perspective and, perhaps, think ahead 15 years.  I predict that in 15 years' time people will ask what all the fuss was about.  They will look back on this debate in the same way we now look back on the debate on contraception.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are the only European country without divorce or the right to remarry. Are we so special; have we something unique that should place us in that position? The late Eamon de Valera inserted the ban in the 1937 Constitution although it was not included in the Constitution adopted on the foundation of the State.  It would have been <Col N="867" /> better if it had not been included in the Constitution, when it would be a matter for this House to decide whether to introduce divorce here.</P>
    <P>We shall hear much in coming weeks of the phrase, &ldquo;what God has joined together let no man pull asunder&rdquo;.  I believe in that phrase but I do not believe that divorce, as we know it, or the prospect of remarriage is what pulls people asunder.  We do not have divorce here, we have 75,000 separated people, not caused by divorce but by marriage breakdown, by the fact that they could not live together.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to look at the definition of divorce.  Divorce means to sever, separate, detach or put away.  It does not, strictly speaking, give people the right to remarry.  If I look back to the days of my legal studies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and search the distant recesses of my mind, I recollect that divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>, which was divorce from bed and board, existed.  To misquote Shakespeare, he wrote in Henry IV: &ldquo;...get thee Henry from my bed and board...&rdquo;, and that referred to divorce <i>a mensa et thoro</i>.  We are talking about a different kind of divorce &mdash; divorce <i>a vinculo</i>, which is divorce with the right to remarry.  I raise this point on the basis that it is the separation from bed and board which is the divorce, not the right to remarry.</P>
      <P>With regard to providing for the right to remarry, I believe it is unchristian for me to deny the more than 75,000 people affected by marital breakdown the right to seek happiness in a second marriage. I do not say others are unchristian; everybody has to form their own view. However, that is my personal reaction to this proposal.  Divorce with the right to remarry is a civil right.  I would regard it as selfish of me to deny that civil right to anybody and I do not have the right to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On an individual basis I see no answer to the case made to give the <Col N="868" /> right to remarry to those unfortunate people whose marriages have broken down, in particular, those who may be broken and battered from monstrous situations in those marriages.  They are entitled to seek happiness in a new and stable relationship.</P>
    <P>There is a broader issue to be addressed on which I would not be as clear cut.  I do not know whether there will be a greater incidence of marital breakdown because of the introduction of the right to remarry.  In 1986 I remember a prophecy from those who opposed the amendment that marital breakdown would double in ten years if the right to remarry was introduced. That right was not introduced, yet in less than ten years marital breakdown has doubled.  Nobody can resolve this question and I accept it is a matter on which there can be different valid views. The case is clearly made for me, however, on the basis of the individual; that is, the right of the individual to seek happiness in a new marriage.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the reaction in Northern Ireland if this amendment is defeated.  We should have a modern pluralist society.  For some people in Northern Ireland the image that &ldquo;home rule is Rome rule&rdquo; still lingers.  Whatever justification there may have been in the past for that view there is none now.  However, the perception is there.</P>
    <P>I was in Armagh yesterday at a prayer breakfast and after it I met the members of the Independent Loyal Orange Institution who were protesting.  They were not protesting about my being there; they were protesting about the presence of the Rev.  Martin Smyth MP, not because he sat down to breakfast with me and 300 others but because some prayers were said before and after the breakfast.  They regarded that as absolutely out of order for him.  They believe, and I quote their newsletter, that he was duty bound to: &ldquo;strenuously oppose the fatal errors and doctrines of the church of Rome, and scrupulously avoid countenancing (by his presence or otherwise) any act or ceremony of Popish <Col N="869" /> worship.&rdquo;  It is easy to laugh at that but they genuinely believe it.</P>
    <P>This is an aspect which cannot be overlooked in this debate.  In article 6 of the Downing Street Declaration the Taoiseach is committed to examine with his colleagues &ldquo;any elements in the democratic life and organisation of the Irish State ... that can be represented as not being fully consistent with a modern democratic and pluralist society ... and undertakes to examine any possible ways of removing such obstacles.&rdquo;  That does not relate only to divorce but divorce with the right to remarry is a normal civil right in a modern pluralist democratic state.  If it is rejected it will be seen as contrary to the spirit of the Downing Street Declaration.  It will add fuel to the fire of those who have the perception that we are still ruled by Rome.</P>
    <P>I come from a constituency which decisively rejected the last amendment on divorce.  However, I will vote for this Bill.  I will campaign for the amendment in my constituency and hope I can change minds on this occasion.</P>
    <P>There is a question as to whether these changes should be written in the Constitution.  I have a lot of sympathy with the view that they should not.  The matter should never have been in the Constitution from the outset.  I would prefer not to see these changes written into the Constitution because I am a believer in parliamentary democracy.  I do not believe in pandering to those who say they do not trust politicians.  If we do not trust ourselves how can we expect others to trust us?</P>
    <P>I have sympathy for that view but I accept that politics is the art of the possible. The greater good is for the amendment to be passed and if it is easier to do that by having the changes written into the Constitution then I accept that. I also have sympathy with the view that the four year period is too long.  I would have preferred three years but it is not a point of principle for me.  If that is the view adopted as being best overall I accept it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" /> It is important to have a calm reasoned debate on this issue so that emotions are not raised as they were the last time.  We must listen to the points of view of others, respect them and let the people decide.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe spoke about the question of what is meant by divorce.  There is a misunderstanding about the term &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; which needs to be cleared up.  At present, marriages can be dissolved by the legal separation of people so they may live their lives separately.  We have a constitutional prohibition which prevents remarriage.  That is only one element of a divorce process available in many other countries.  Many people think we are introducing divorce and do not understand the element which is to be put to them, namely the right to remarry.</P>
      <P>This right is a commitment given in the Programme for Government and is a core principle of the Labour Party.  It will address the difficulties of over 75,000 people whose marriages have broken down and who have no right to remarry and restructure their lives. There is a lack of compassion in that regard and the proposed amendment will allow them to have some redress.</P>
      <P>It is almost ten years since the last referendum and we must analyse what happened in 1986 to ensure we do not fall into the same traps in 1995.  The campaign at that time centred mainly on property and social welfare issues.  Some political parties adopted an indifferent attitude to the issue and this caused difficulties for some people who did not know how to vote without guidance from their parties.  The Catholic Church actively campaigned for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote; I do not know what it will do this time. Further, the Government position was not clearly thought out, so there was much confusion in 1986.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the difference this time?  The property and social welfare issues have been addressed by legislation; many say they have been adequately tackled but there is always room for improvement. <Col N="871" /> However, most of the serious elements which arose in the 1986 campaign have been addressed in the social legislation passed by this House.</P>
    <P>Counselling and mediation services have received substantial funding increases.  This is a riposte to critics who say that the referendum will destabilise marriages.  Counselling and mediation services are a valuable asset.  In many cases where people genuinely wish to continue together, it is a means to ensure they have that opportunity.</P>
    <P>The courts deal with separation on a daily basis, in accordance with new legislation.  People are separated through a judicial process, which has been accepted as a legitimate way to resolve difficult marriages.  All a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote will ensure is the right to remarry &mdash; that is the only issue left to be redressed.</P>
    <P>People should be aware of the new social welfare and property rights provisions and an information campaign is required to that end.  The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995 ensures divorced people will not lose out on any social welfare entitlement.  This information should be made clear to people.  This Act provides for entitlement to widow's or widower's pensions and widow's noncontributory pensions and the retention of the entitlement to deserted wife's benefit and allowances.  Divorced parents are recognised for the purpose of lone parent's allowance.  Family income supplement can be provided to divorced spouses as adult dependants.</P>
    <P>The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act provides that the court can order the distribution of the family home, farm and other assets.  Property used by either husband or wife for his or her business or professional purposes cannot be interfered with by the courts but they can decide to protect or extinguish the right to inheritance.</P>
    <P>The protection of the family is probably the most important aspect of this matter.  In 1995, £750,000 has been provided for marriage and counselling <Col N="872" /> organisations; £300,000 has been provided for the family mediation service, whose Limerick office has expanded; and the Legal Aid Board has received a budget increase of up to £6.2 million, which is 132 per cent more than the 1992 figure.  These are important elements of the infrastructure required to deal with marriage breakdown.  The board has doubled its staff and has eight new offices with six more on the way. The minimum age for marriage has been raised to 18 years, with a three month waiting period for people who wish to marry.  These are further safeguards to ensure people do not marry hastily.</P>
    <P>The Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act has not been adequately explained to the public. Many people think we are only introducing it now.  It is already available and working, although whether it is satisfactory remains to be seen.  Many people are using it and it seems to work but in the future we may have to adjust or fine tune it.</P>
    <P>The Act provides that the court can make an order acknowledging that a marriage has irretrievably broken down and ordering the parties to live apart permanently.  Orders can also be made on maintenance for either spouse, whether by lump sum or regular payments; maintenance, lump sums and property for any children; the right to live in the family home; the right to transfer property to either spouse; and custody and/or access to any children. The courts can grant a separation if there is unreasonable behaviour; adultery; desertion for one year or more; or no normal marriage relationship for one year or more.  If a couple has been living apart for three years or more, or, if they have agreed to a separation for one year, they can be considered for a judicial separation.</P>
    <P>Many people want to know the main provisions of the Family Law Act, another provision to help people deal with marriage breakdown.  The improved measures to enforce maintenance payments include deductions at <Col N="873" /> source.  The courts are allowed to divide pension entitlements between spouses. Divorced couples will be treated similarly to married couples for tax purposes and succession rights are protected.</P>
    <P>A substantial portion of the infrastructure required to deal with marriage breakdown is now in place.  These elements are working and people are becoming aware of them.  The issue which remains is what happens to people who have been through that process. Must they remain as they are for the rest of their lives and will we turn a blind eye to any future relationships, as if nothing happened?  Each person must decide on the right to remarry.  Some people think we are forcing people to remarry in introducing this legislation but it simply allows them to decide whether they wish to do so.</P>
    <P>Another concern is that a divorce culture will result in the breakdown of marriage &mdash; people draw this conclusion from what they see as evidence from elsewhere.  They should look to the position in Ireland, specifically in dioceses which straddle the Border.  In one part of the diocese there is a right to remarry and in the other there is no such right. No one could say marriages are destabilised in the Northern Ireland portion of the diocese.  Many people in those areas live and behave in accordance with their beliefs.  They remain together if they can; if their marriages break down they separate and if they believe they should not remarry they do not.  We should analyse conditions for Irish people living on our island.  We should look at how divorce has affected people in Northern Ireland.  Nothing unusual has happened there.  They have a right to remarry and this is satisfactory for those who wish to do so.  Those who do not wish to remarry have the right to decide that.</P>
    <P>Divorce already exists in Ireland.  As I understand it, divorce means the breakdown of marriage, the separation of the two parties and the arrangement arising from that.  We are asking the Irish people to decide if the constitutional ban should be removed and if <Col N="874" /> people should be allowed to remarry. That is the simple question we must answer.</P>

      <P>I accept there are differing deeply and conscientiously held views on both sides of the divorce debate.  We wish to protect the family, the hallmark of Irish society and the fundamental unit around which it is built.  The marriage commitment in this country is considered a permanent contract. However, the phenomenal social change which has taken place cannot be ignored.  The incidence of marital breakdown in our society has continued to grow, despite the constitutional ban on divorce.  New families are growing up in a legal limbo.  For happy families, the emphasis on traditional family values should never be such as to make those who have not been so lucky feel guilty or ashamed.  Each of us nurtures ideals of the kind of world we would like to live in and the way we would like to live our lives.  However, the circumstances of life often get in the way.</P>
      <P>There is a wide difference of opinion between churches on the issue of divorce. These differences, however, do not reflect any shift from the stoutly held view that the family is a fundamental unit of society and that successful marriages require positive support from the Government.  Nor do these differences reflect any diminution to the commitment necessary for couples to make marriage work.  In an ideal world, marriages would not break down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no evidence to show a higher incidence of marriage breakdown in the North, where there is no ban on divorce, than here in the South.  This may be accounted for by the fact that strong family values are shared by the Presbyterian and Anglican communities, as well as the Catholic community in the North.  One day, we hope to sit down <Col N="875" /> and work out a lasting and peaceful settlement to the Northern question.  All sides have promised to be generous.  It is scarcely likely that in that settlement we will have a constitutional ban on divorce in the South and a totally different situation in the North.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the Catholic Church requires a constitutional ban on divorce to sustain its belief and teaching that divorce is wrong.  I do not believe that a Catholic living in the archdiocese of Armagh is any less a Catholic because he or she lives in a different jurisdiction than somebody living in the diocese of Killaloe or the archdiocese of Cashel.  The Catholic hierarchy must continue to advise its flock.  However, the State must provide laws which accommodate differing religious and social viewpoints.</P>
    <P>There has been a significant decrease in the number of marriages in Ireland, together with a significant reduction in the number of children born to each marriage.  One out of five children is born out of wedlock.  Meanwhile, the number of legal separations is growing rapidly and barring orders have become a constant feature of modern life.  The argument that the continuation of a constitutional ban on divorce could halt or prevent these social developments is unreasonable, unfounded and unsustainable.</P>
    <P>More and more resources have been made available and yet more are required to develop mediation and counselling services.  These provisions would help many couples where a marriage is in difficulty to restore faith in each other, work their problems through and, above all, take into account the needs of their children.  Notwithstanding the best of counselling and mediation, marriages have broken down irretrievably in the past and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The proposals by the Government require couples to be living apart for four of the previous five years before a court may dissolve a marriage.  Where a marriage is dead and separated people <Col N="876" /> enter into a new and happy relationship, I am unable to vote against giving them this second chance and allowing them the right to have their relationship legally recognised.  In all areas of life, people who have made mistakes yearn not to repeat them.  To be truly tolerant and compassionate, a person who enjoys a happy marriage would not wish less to their neighbour.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Divorce Irish style&rdquo; is a phrase often used in a derogatory way to infer that marital breakdown exists in Ireland and people deal with it, with or without a ban on divorce.  I would like to use it in a literal context.  We are not going to slavishly follow the way other countries implement divorce.  We will not have &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; divorces.  Only the people will decide how we, as a nation, implement divorce and whether, if the referendum is passed, we would ever wish to change the terms.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that anyone in a happy marriage, or those who run into the difficulties many marriages face such as problems with children &mdash; sometimes drug or crime related &mdash; financial difficulties, health problems and all the other challenges we face in our daily lives, will easily turn their backs on the marriage commitment and willingly face into the legal problems and torment associated with marital breakdown. Working and living in my constituency, I have heard many harrowing stories in my clinics and in people's homes of problems relating to marital breakdown. I do not feel that I have the right to deprive someone who has gone through that torture of the chance of a better life, a second chance to find happiness.</P>
    <P>I know there are people who will walk out of marriage without a just reason, leaving a good partner stranded. They are doing this when the right to remarry is prohibited under our Constitution and I have no reason to believe that it will not happen if the prohibition is removed.  I also know of people who stay locked into marriages where sexual and psychological abuse, beating, deprivation and other cruelties which no <Col N="877" /> human being should have to live with are a way of life.</P>
    <P>As a public representative and TD for North Tipperary, I believe that I have a daunting responsibility.  Many Fianna Fáil supporters in my constituency are totally against divorce and the removal of the ban, and I respect their views.  In the final analysis, however, a constitutional referendum is a matter for the people only.  Successive Fianna Fáil Governments have put in place in recent years a battery of legal reforms to pave the way for this referendum.  I believe fundamentally in the separation of church and State and, above all, in the right of minorities in a republic.  For these reasons, I will be voting &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to contribute to this debate and I consider the contributions made by many Members to be honest and genuine.  Our party has endeavoured to put forward a very honest manifestation of the different viewpoints within our parliamentary party on this subject. People throughout the country have different views on it.  I share the view of my colleagues, Deputy Michael Smith and Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, that as a legislator I do not have the right to deny people the right to remarry.</P>
      <P>I also doubt the argument which has been put forward that if we insert the right to remarry into the Constitution there will be an avalanche of divorce cases and separations and that people will easily take the divorce road.  Divorce is not an easy option for anybody. Couples getting married do not look ahead to separation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increasingly, many of the social problems brought to my advice centres originate in disharmony in the home and the separation process.  It is heartrending to meet separated fathers coming from dingy, damp, dilapidated inner city flats, having previously been in a fairly stable home.  They find themselves in these situations because of marital breakdown. They look for local authority housing because they want somewhere decent to <Col N="878" /> live where their children can visit them and so on.</P>
    <P>I also see increasing numbers of mothers in my advice centres since the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act.  I am not a legal expert, but I am unhappy about some of the arrangements made in terms of the material and financial provisions for dependants, particularly children.  I had a number of cases recently of women who have received judgments from the courts to the effect that they may stay in the family home until the children reach the age of 18 years, for example. There is a consequent worry about the educational possibilities for those children as they may wish to go on to third level.  Many young people are now dependent up to the age of 21 or 22 years.</P>
    <P>This Bill and the passage of the referendum, if successful, represent a huge challenge to us as a legislative body.  It does so in so far as we have to quickly develop strong demediation and counselling infrastructure within the State. We must also ensure and improve the economic and material provision for children and spouses without income.</P>
    <P>I am especially anxious that we develop the mediation and counselling dimension of this issue.  Historically as a country we lack a counselling culture. For example, in our education system the psychological service is at an embryonic stage and is very under provided for.  Often if parents approach one over difficulties with their children and one suggests that they see a counsellor there is a reluctance to do so, a certain loss of pride that one would have to do this. However, it is a natural thing; counselling is good for people.  We need to pay more than just lip service to the concept of counselling and to the infrastructure available to people generally.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to our party spokesperson on Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Woods, who has made a constructive contribution to this debate through our party's position paper on the right to remarriage and on a subsequent research paper on the impact of <Col N="879" /> separation and divorce on children.  The research he drew together in this document is very useful for people to enable them to assess the impact on children. Coming from the education sphere, I am extremely concerned about this dimension.</P>
    <P>What is clear from the research is that the negative impact on children is over a number of years or part of a process and develops in stages.  The fundamental and principal difficulty is the act of separation itself or the disharmony that preceded separation and was its cause. Disharmony and hostility between parents will damage children psychologically and impair them.  They will have the capacity to recover if the proper counselling is provided and, more importantly, if proper, consistent, stable parenting is maintained after the separation. In this respect, the importance of parenting, both pre and post divorce is critical if we are to help children and intervene in their developmental stage to ensure that the harmful impact of separation and divorce is minimised to the greatest degree possible.</P>
    <P>The financial and material dimension is equally important because financial loss and material deprivation will also have a negative impact on children and could retard their development in future years.  I am strongly supportive, therefore, of the emphasis our spokesperson has put on the situation regarding children. It represents a challenge, not just because after the referendum one would have divorce.  It should be a challenge now and it should have been a challenge a number of years ago.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that we have not developed proper services for children generally.  In this respect I welcome the proposal in our document that a Commissioner for Children should be appointed, attached to the courts, to represent children and to exclusively look after their rights in these situations.</P>
    <P>The stability of parenting is a critical issue.  It is equally clear that there is no one solution to the problem after divorce. There is no evidence to suggest <Col N="880" /> that one specific form of custody arrangement is better than another.  In America joint custody is perhaps gaining in popularity.  It is an area we should study more and follow up.</P>
    <P>The argument has been put forward that the post divorce period is the most detrimental stage on a child's development. Interestingly, the research indicates that this is not the case.  It is from the moment disharmony begins and hostility develops between the parents that the harmful impact is made on the child.  As one goes up the scale divorce adds a further level of harm or damage to children.  However, also interestingly, with proper counselling and a proper support structure, children can recover and move on.  This is useful and hopeful. It is vitally important that we develop this aspect.</P>
    <P>I am not won over by the argument that we have to proceed with this matter because of Northern Ireland.  We must proceed for ourselves as a society.  I recently spoke to loyalist politicians from the Shankill and to Unionist politicians. They courteously but firmly told me that it did not concern them what way we voted in this referendum; it was a matter for ourselves.  We should vote for this measure, and the people should vote for it to enable those in second relationships to have those relationships acknowledged by the State and accommodated legally, with their children.</P>
    <P>We should insert the terms into the Constitution.  If we consider ourselves a reasonable barometer of public opinion, it is clear that people generally were worried by the prospect of what is termed &ldquo;quickie divorces&rdquo; or the &ldquo;quickie divorce culture&rdquo; in any legislation of this kind or in any referendum. The mechanism of inserting the terms into the Constitution is a response to this opinion, which was substantial and won popular support throughout the country.  People had a vision of divorce in other countries.  It may have been a wrong vision.  Perhaps too many people are looking at too many programmes such as &ldquo;Dallas&rdquo; or emanating from Hollywood and so on and see the kind <Col N="881" /> of divorce depicted on them as an image.  However, we all know from our own work that separation is not an easy option.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe believes in the concept of parliamentary democracy over the popular will.  This argument could be extended across the board.  We have a written Constitution.  Do we need it?  Should we dissolve it?  I do not believe so because it is the fundamental guarantor of the people's rights.  It has been made clear to all of us that this is an issue which is fundamental to the public.  Ten years ago the people made their views clear in the way they voted. It is not that people do not trust their parliamentary representatives.  The fact that we have a written Constitution in itself is saying that we as a society wish to put a limitation on the legislature.  We wish to reserve for ourselves the right to arbitrate on certain issues.  This is something in which I strongly believe.  The Constitution today is not the Constitution de Valera framed in 1937.</P>
    <P>I support the passage of the Bill and will support the referendum for the right to remarry.  I have laid strong emphasis on the need for the State and society to develop a comprehensive infrastructure for counselling and mediation.  This Bill and opportunity represent a huge challenge for us to do something meaningful in the years ahead for children in this society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to much of the debate and no one has put forward a cogent argument which would justify the inclusion of the proposed wording in the Constitution.  It is evident that two debates are taking place in the House, one on an amendment to the Constitution which would allow people to remarry &mdash; I support this proposal &mdash; and the other on our amendment in which we disagree with the formula of wording chosen by the Government to remove the prohibition on divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I speak as an individual legislator and as my party spokesperson on human rights.  This debate is about championing <Col N="882" /> a minority right to remarry, which is essentially a human right.  When dealing with issues of justice and human rights we may deal with issues of injustice and the focus is very often on a flawed criminal justice system where battered women and refugees are not properly looked after and minority rights are not championed.  That is part of the territory with which I deal as my party spokesperson on justice.  As legislators, we are constantly challenged in our efforts to align our modern laws with a staitjacket document drawn up in the 1930s which by and large represents a style of thinking and set of moral values which had great support at that time.  We often find it difficult to make our laws fit into the mores of the 1930s.</P>
    <P>No cogent argument has been put forward for using the Constitution as a skirt behind which to hide and run from the people.  We should be much more self-confident about our role as legislators and should give leadership on this issue rather than following the dreadful precedent set in 1993, of stuffing provisions into the Constitution to insure ourselves against possible future change.</P>
    <P>One of the arguments put forward by a person who supports the inclusion of these 14 lines in the Constitution is that the people have a special relationship with their Constitution.  This is a load of rubbish, yet it was used as part of the argument for including the terms of divorce and remarriage in the Constitution, a sort of comforter to the electorate.  I wonder how many people have seen the Constitution.  If one did a survey of homes one would be more likely to find a copy of the &ldquo;Guinness Book of Records&rdquo; than a copy of &ldquo;Bunreacht na hÉireann&rdquo;.  I did not hear of this document until I was studying law in Trinity, and law students are a particularly rarefied breed of young person.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at what a Constitution is and what it is supposed to be. The Progressive Democrats believe the Constitution should set out in broad brush the fundamental laws of the State, including guarantees on fundamental <Col N="883" /> human rights and freedoms and the basic structure of State institutions. Moreover, it should command the allegiance of all the people and should not include terms which pander to sectarian interests.  The Constitution pandered to sectarian interests from the beginning and we are still pandering to them by seeking to amend the Constitution by inserting another fearful clause into it.</P>
    <P>The Constitution is a small blue coloured document of 160 pages.  It is not only a legal document but is very much a political document drawn up in 1937 by Mr. de Valera and others.  The constitutional lawyer David Gwynn Morgan calls it one of the symbols, like the national flag or anthem, through which a polity proclaims to itself and outsiders &ldquo;this is who we are&rdquo;.  It is a focus of loyalty and a statement of national beliefs, ideals and aspirations written as much for the lay person as it is for the lawyer. History has revealed that there were many different stages and influences involved in drafting the Constitution in 1937 which resulted in a mishmash of sometimes conflicting provisions which are often couched in hopelessly far fetched and elaborate aspirational language. Deputy O'Malley referred to the use of the capital letter &ldquo;F&rdquo; each time reference is made to the family which is not a proper noun.  It is worth nothing that because the Constitution is such a political, part legal and part religious document it does not lend itself to the rules which normally apply to statutory interpretation by the courts, which is a literal and predictable formula of interpretation. A huge degree of creativity attaches to interpreting constitutional provisions so that simple phrases or words take on a different meaning when they are read as they must be &mdash; judges are obliged to do this &mdash; in the light of the Constitution as a whole.  This includes the preamble to the Constitution which states:</P>
    <P>
      <i>In the Name of the Most Holy Trinity, from Whom is all authority and to</i>
      <Col N="884" />
      <i>Whom, as our final end, all actions both of men and States must be referred,</i>
    </P>
    <P>
      <i>We, the people of Éire</i>,</P>
    <P>
      <i>Humbly acknowledging all our obligations to our Divine Lord, Jesus Christ, Who sustained our fathers through centuries of trial</i>,</P>
    <P>
      <i>Gratefully remembering their heroic and unremitting struggle to regain the rightful independence of our Nation</i>,</P>
    <P>
      <i>And seeking to promote the common good, with due observance of Prudence, Justice and Charity, so that the dignity and freedom of the individual may be assured, true social order attained, the unity of our country restored, and concord established with other nations</i>,</P>
    <P>
      <i>Do hereby adopt, enact, and give to ourselves this Constitution</i>.</P>
    <P>The Constitution which is supposedly a statement of who we were and are has been described by constitutional analysts as attempting to reconcile the notion of inalienable popular sovereignty with the old medieval concept of a theocratic state: in other words it is a blend of revolutionary declarations and 1930s religion.</P>
    <P>Having set the tone of the Constitution with the wording in the preamble, which basically translates as &ldquo;free at last&rdquo; with the words &ldquo;but not from Rome&rdquo; in brackets, the draftsman made a confident assertion of the national territory and sovereignty thereof as follows: &ldquo;The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and territorial seas&rdquo;.  That statement was not a political reality then and it has not yet been one at any time since then. Nevertheless it is included in the Constitution, a part of what we are.</P>
    <P>In the context of divorce, Articles 40 to 44 of the Constitution deal with the fundamental rights of the individual, the family, education, private property and religion.  The Constitution is heavily dominated by Roman Catholicism. <Col N="885" /> These Articles, one of which the Government Bill seeks to delete and replace, owe much to the encyclicals of Pope Pius XI and even beyond that to the synthesis of Catholic social principles published in 1927 and known as the Social Code.  In the 1930s there was an ideal in Europe based on Kinder, Kuchen, Kirche and this was very much replicated in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>Not many people are aware that the Constitution was put to the people in a referendum in 1937 and it is interesting to note the result.  A total of 685,105 citizens voted for adopting the Constitution, 526,945 voted against it and 31 per cent of those entitled to vote did not bother to do so &mdash; nothing much has changed in that regard.  As Deputy O'Malley outlined, that narrowly adopted document has been examined on several occasions with a view to amending it.  Mr. Lemass examined it in 1966 and set up a committee to consider changing it and over the years there have been other political attempts to change it.  The Government has set up a special committee to consider reviewing aspects of it.  The hope of reconciliation in Northern Ireland is a continuous political motivation for examining the Constitution with a view to reforming it.</P>
    <P>Shortly after the Progressive Democrats Party was formed it published a draft Constitution which sought to express and vindicate rights and obligations of fundamental importance and to do so in a manner which would stand the test of time in a pluralist, democratic republic in part or all of this island. However, because of the absence of a Christian God in that draft it created something of a stir.</P>
    <P>Over the past 20 years Members will recall we have had agonisingly complicated battles on matters of sexual morality and individual freedoms, sometimes because of the difficulty in aligning laws reflecting the changing views and needs of Irish people, such as the need for the right to remarry, to the strait-jacket of the Constitution which is full of very specific, outdated and sectarian provisions.  There have been <Col N="886" /> many victories for individual rights resulting from a creative interpretation by individual judges based on unenumerated rights.</P>
    <P>Over the years we have seen compassionate judges doing their best for people based on the human circumstances of the cases before them.  In that way a body of constitutional law has evolved which is necessarily judge-made. Decisions have been handed down on the right to die, the right to life, on the appalling X case from which this House is still fleeing.  Legislation has not been introduced on the substantive issue &mdash; another flight from our responsibility.  All we have had the nerve to do is to legislate for the hypocrisy of exporting our very high abortion figures to the United Kingdom.  We were harshly criticised by the late Mr. Justice McCarthy in the X case for our failure which he described as inexcusable to leave bare of legislative direction the right to life amendment in the Constitution and that still remains the case.</P>
    <P>Whatever about the difficulties of aligning our modern laws with the provisions in the 1937 Constitution, experience should have taught us that we should not be inserting even more clauses into it when we could as easily legislate for what we want to achieve.  I favour the formula proposed by Deputy O'Malley, a much simpler and shorter one.  It provides that notwithstanding any other provision of this Constitution a court, designated by law, may grant a dissolution of marriage where it is satisfied that all of the conditions prescribed by law are complied with.  As outlined by my colleagues, there is great folly in inserting the proposed 14 lines which contains ambiguous language into our Constitution when we need not follow that route.  As pointed out by others, we need to learn a lesson from the difficulties caused by inserting the unnecessary pro-life clause into the Constitution in 1983.  Who could have thought that such an assertion of the right to life of the foetus could have the horrific outcome of the circumstances of the X case?</P>
    <P>An action taken by the then Attorney <Col N="887" /> General on behalf of the people to protect the constitutional right to life of an unborn child ended up after two years of legal wrangling in doing great injustice to the constitutional rights of the born child, the mother, a 14 year old school girl pregnant by child abuse.  It was only by the creativity of the judges in hanging their decisions on the three words in the preamble to the Constitution, &ldquo;Justice, Charity and Prudence&rdquo; that they found they could release that child from a State injunction to force her to go full term in an unwanted pregnancy. By inserting the equal right of the unborn into the Constitution, the X case demonstrated that we had unleashed a potential tyranny of internment on all women who found themselves pregnant and needing an abortion.</P>
    <P>The lessons have not been learned. Rather than constantly amending our Constitution, we need a new one.  The only solution is to replace the Constitution with a new document which would gain the allegiance of all Irish people, made up of Christians, non-Christians, agnostics, atheists, feminists, children, homosexuals &mdash; the new Ireland.  Such a document would not be based on a sectarian belief.</P>
    <P>Over the years, alongside the battles on sexual morality in the courts relating to condoms, abortion and the usual line up of sexual-social material including adoption legitimacy and judicial separation, a parallel battle has been fought in the political and media arena.  In an essay entitled, &ldquo;A Morality Debate Going Nowhere&rdquo;, Fintan O'Toole referred to the relentlessly polarised views of the people on both sides of the conservative and liberal divide in Ireland.  In many ways perhaps it is a morality debate going nowhere.  No one will ever win the argument because people have such different positions.</P>
    <P>He referred to the debate, and I believe it is a good description of it, as a perpetual <i>Somme</i> with both sides wading through the mud to take a few feet of ground, the air thick with impenetrable gases.  On one side are the forces <Col N="888" /> of good and God, their policy allegedly based on Roman Catholic values and on the other a less single minded amalgam of liberal voices raging against the control theory.  Perhaps, as Mr. O'Toole speculates, the two sides are essentially irreconcilable and the regular skirmishes are pointless and sterile.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this debate I thought it useful in terms of history to consult the Official Report of the Seanad of 11 June 1925 when a debate raged in that House on the proposed appeal of the divorce legislation which had existed prior to the establishment of the Free State.  The then Senator W.B. Yeats made a great case for the championing of minority rights.  As a Protestant, he warned of the dangers of a course of action which would have the result of taking away rights to remarry which would affect all the people in the new State, including Protestants and other non-Catholics who were not part of the majority religion.  What is striking in the debate is his assertive, self-confident championing of minority rights and we do not hear enough of the arguments based on minority rights.  There is no point in entering the <i>Somme</i> battle with the liberals and conservatives on both sides because it cannot be won.  The most cogent reason and argument to be made for removing the prohibition on divorce has always been and remains that of championing the rights of minorities.</P>
    <P>Much has been said of the numbers of people wanting to remarry and those who have failed marriages.  If there were only 100 people in such a predicament, this House would be obliged to allow them remarry.  I regret I do not have an opportunity to read into the record everything Mr. Yeats said but I would like to quote the following: &ldquo;I think it is tragic that within three years of this country gaining its independence we should be discussing a measure which a minority of this nation considers to be grossly oppressive&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When the White Paper on Marital Breakdown and the review <Col N="889" /> of the proposed changes were prepared some years ago by my colleagues, it stated in the opening chapter &mdash; and this remains the view of this party &mdash; that the vast majority of people in Ireland who get married go on to live together in lifelong unions.  The unfortunate reality, however, is that a minority of those who marry have their hopes and expectations of a permanent union dashed through the breakdown of their marriages.  Another point made in the opening chapter was that a primary concern of the Government must be to do all it can to assist the preservation of stable marriages and the avoidance of marriage breakdown.  It further stated that the Government must also endeavour to ensure that there is a proper response in our law on social policies where marriages break down.</P>
      <P>The White Paper went on to outline what had happened in the period since 1986 and what should be done in the years immediately ahead.  On that basis it also discussed various issues which arose in relation to the possibility of divorce being introduced here.  It considered the various forms a constitutional amendment might take and gave details of the scheme of a family law Bill.  Fianna Fáil in Government followed up on that White Paper.  In 1987 we said we would try to correct the mistakes made in 1986 from the Status of Children Bill to the position where we prepared and presented a White Paper.</P>
      <P>We continue to deal with the legislation outlined in great detail in our position document on which I congratulate our spokesperson on Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael Woods. In that document he outlines the legislation that has been passed, the reasons it was passed and what remains to be done.  There is not any need for me to go through all of that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In various documents and position papers put before the people we clearly stated that we would complete the domestic violence Bill, the property Bill and other legislation on tax and social welfare and that we would put an amendment to the people by the end of 1994. <Col N="890" /> Unfortunately, subsequent events prevented the Government of the day moving ahead with that speed.</P>
    <P>Because we in this party completed the legislative process that should have taken place in 1986 and because of the commitments we gave to hold a referendum, we support the holding of a referendum on divorce and the right to remarry, in addition to writing into the Constitution some essential details of the amendment to be put to the people.</P>
    <P>In the ten years since the last referendum on divorce two referenda have been held on European integration.  It is not unreasonable to hold a second referendum on divorce nearly ten years on, especially when one considers the circumstances in which the 1986 referendum was held.  Prior to the 1986 referendum, opinion polls showed that there was approximately a two thirds majority in favour of a change in the Constitution. That was reversed during the campaign, the principal reason being that there was inadequate preparation for the referendum.  In the people's view the cart was being put before the horse and answers were not forthcoming to questions raised.  The necessary legislation was not prepared or put forward in coherent position papers.</P>
    <P>In the intervening period &mdash; almost entirely under Fianna Fáil-led Governments &mdash; this large body of legislation has been put in place.  Given that polls continue to show that public opinion is favourable in principle to a change in the Constitution, it is reasonable for the people to be consulted again to see whether, in today's circumstances, they now wish a change to be made.</P>
    <P>In 1986, Fianna Fáil did not oppose the holding of a referendum and did not vote against the enabling legislation going through the Dáil.  On that occasion the party was officially neutral. As the record shows, some Fianna Fáil Deputies supported divorce and more opposed it.  Nine years later, most of the necessary legislation is in place dealing in detail with the rights of spouses, children and the division of property, all <Col N="891" /> with the aim of protecting the rights of the existing family.</P>
    <P>In 1992, the then Minister for Justice, Padraig Flynn, published a comprehensive paper on marital breakdown which reviewed the situation and addressed most of the arguments that have since surfaced.  He also prepared the draft No. 2 Bill on family law reform in which the various arguments are well listed.  I would also like to mention that the Oireachtas committees carried out a substantial amount of work from 1985 onwards in preparing the case for this debate and for the people to make their choice.</P>
    <P>Even in the absence of divorce the number of persons whose marriages have broken down has risen from 37,000 in 1986 to 55,000 in 1991 and is now estimated to be in the region of 75,000.  The White Paper also discussed the possible approaches to the constitutional amendment and gave the following commitment: &ldquo;The Government proposes to proceed with a divorce referendum after a full debate on the complex issues involved and following the enactment of other legislative proposals in the area of family law&rdquo;.  The holding of the referendum, therefore, was Government policy under the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition.  The Fianna Fáil election manifesto of November 1992 under which all Fianna Fáil candidates sought re-election, stated that the party would hold a referendum on divorce. The Fianna Fáil-Labour Programme for Government approved by the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party in January 1993 reiterated the commitment to hold a referendum on divorce and called for &ldquo;a major programme of law reform culminating in a referendum on divorce&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The national debate on divorce is one of the great debates of our time with great passions being expressed on both sides of the argument.  There is enormous media interest which will increase as we move closer to polling day.  A lively debate is taking place in the work-place and in public meetings on all aspects of the issue.  It takes its place <Col N="892" /> with the national debates on joining the European Union, the Maastricht Treaty referendum, the abortion referendum and the peace process.</P>
    <P>In the past 20 years marital separation has become a factor in many families. The reasons for marital separation are always complex, personal and highly charged with emotion.  There are serious considerations to be addressed by both persons and their families when marital breakdown occurs.  A large group of separated persons lives in this jurisdiction and there is a steady rate of judicial separations.  There are approximatley 75,000 separated persons and over 2,000 judicial separations are granted per year.  The needs, concerns, expectations and rights of those people should be addressed in a thoughtful, compassionate way in this divorce referendum. The majority of marriages in Ireland succeed and continue to be mutually satisfactory relationships. Stable and happy family life is rightly prized as a great blessing to individuals and society.  It is the safe nest from which most of us emerge as young adults to take our place in the work-force, as parents, guardians and counsellors of our children.  The web of family relationships is central to our lives whether we are fortunate enough to be able to retain and sustain our personal bonding or whether we have to, regretfully concude that a relationship is at an end.</P>
    <P>In this debate it is vitally important that we do not cast aspersions on the views of people who differ from us, that we seek to be mutually constructive, respectful and caring and that wherever possible we ensure that the real needs of people under pressure are considered.</P>
    <P>My party discussed the issues involved in the divorce referendum.  We are intent on dealing with it in a responsible and compassionate manner and we have consistently accepted that there are many views on holding a referendum. In an open and democratic way we listened to those who spoke in favour of or against a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  Among <Col N="893" /> my colleagues who did not get an opportunity to speak either within the party or outside there are serious fears about the impact of major legal changes, such as are proposed in this referendum.</P>
    <P>We have decided to vote for the legislation, recommend a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote and let the people decide.  In spite of adverse comment, we can do that effectively. The Constitution, drafted by Éamon de Valera, provides in Article 6 that the people have the right:</P>
    <P>... in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good.</P>
    <P>In other words, it envisages that the major issues of public policy should be referred to the people.  We have an element of direct democracy in our Constitution.  Having the ban on divorce in Article 41 rather than simply preventing divorce by legislation means that its introduction has to be approved by the people.  We on this side of the House believe that the people wish, as a condition of introducing divorce, to retain some direct control over its character.  They do not wish the introduction of &ldquo;quickie&rdquo; divorce as they have stated many times in opinion polls and in debate throughout the length and breadth of the country before and since 1986.  They want to ensure they will be consulted about proposed changes.  The requisite four year separation period provides some safeguards or deterrents against impetuous and socially damaging behaviour.  I am pleased the Government has paid close attention to our views on incorporating the four year separation period into the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Many societies wish to tighten up the divorce legislation because of the effects of too easily available divorce on family life, deserted spouses and children.  We are attempting here to introduce a tighter regime than exists in many other countries.  We are trying to legislate for the effects of what is likely to be a growing problem.  We do not want to needlessly aggravate the incidence of marriage breakdown but if we are realistic, <Col N="894" /> we must accept that it will probably continue to rise with or without divorce.</P>
    <P>In all our social legislation over the past ten years, we have tried to be enlightened, humane and caring.  Our approach has tended to be conservative rather than ultra liberal, but we have been equitable and progressive in the true sense of the word.  It is an error to think if we do nothing, marriage will remain in its present state or even revert to some past ideal.</P>
    <P>There are two fundamental issues in this debate: first, the weight to be given to the rights of a minority, those whose marriages have broken down and the degree of compassion that should be shown by society to individuals without damaging its fundamental interest; and, second, what action will contribute most to keeping the family as the fundamental unit of society.  The law insists that a marriage exists no matter how long there has been a complete and irretrievable breakdown.  That the law does not recognise that the life contract has been broken, or give freedom to enter another contract provided certain conditions are satisfied, does not change the reality that the contract has been broken.  Divorce does not change the nature of the contract.</P>
    <P>There has been an inevitable growth in relationships outside of marriage and children born outside of marriage now account for one in five births.  People in long term relationships outside of marriage are in complicated legal situations without adequate protection.  Many people in that situation want to be married and would like to have the right to remarry.</P>
    <P>If this referendum is defeated it is unlikely another one will be held for a very long time.  I would even go so far as to say, having listened to all the views, that there is not anybody in the House who will see another referendum on this issue.  The arguments made in 1986 will not be valid next time round.</P>
    <P>The law and the Constitution should reflect or, at least, take account of social reality.  It could be argued that the constitutional ban on divorce is increasingly <Col N="895" /> out of keeping with society.  My party would not have been particularly eager to change the position if this could reasonably be avoided, reflecting the fact that undoubtedly there is only a reluctant public willingness to change.  I do not detect an enthusiasm for this debate within the House, in my party, in any other party or among the people.</P>
    <P>Most Members of Fianna Fáil, for whom I can speak, recognise there is a problem which has to be addressed.  The parliamentary party has decided to support the passage of the referendum. Individual Deputies and Members have considered all aspects of the matter and have discussed it in detail with their colleagues, friends, family and so on.  Many have deeply held views as to the undesirability of a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  Their views must and will be respected and there will not be an effort to coerce them to another view.  It is ironic that Fianna Fáil is the only party making a real allowance for freedom of conscience, on the substantive issue to be put to the people.  We are proud to be able to accommodate differing views on the substance, unlike other parties who continuously preach about diversity.</P>
    <P>The referendum is about restoring marriage to a central place in society, in that separated people will gain the legal right to remarry if the divorce referendum is passed.  The common good will be better served by cautions and prudent change at this stage.  There is also the issue of the civil rights of minorities and the compassion that society is prepared to show towards those who have serious problems.</P>
    <P>In most other areas, society is prepared to give people who have made mistakes a second chance rather than condemn them for life.  It is appropriate that we address this issue now and listen carefully to separated people's call for action on their behalf.  As I said to the forum last week, I do not regard the Northern dimension as directly relevant to the situation even though divorce would be regarded by most people there <Col N="896" /> as a civil right and a religious liberty. We all recognise that in any future United Ireland, such a right could not possibly be denied to those who can, at present, avail of it.  It is significant that yesterday in discussions with my Deputy Leader and spokesperson on Foreign Affairs and the Ulster Unionist delegation they did not raise this issue.  No doubt they properly regard it as entirely a matter for us.  I, too, defend the right of people to take this very important decision in the light of their own needs and values, accepting but not being unduly influenced by the fact that others may decide to order things differently.</P>
    <P>The people will ultimately decide and we will accept their decision.  If it requires legislation we will deal with it but if not the matter rests for the long road.  We on this side of the House will support the legislation and vote with the Government tonight and on the other stages.  We will support a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote. However, many of my colleagues are against divorce and when they get the opportunity will vote against it.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Members who have spoken.  We have been accused of having a sham debate but this has been a good debate.  I hope the debate nationally will take its cue from the measured and considered contributions of Members.  In particular I want to thank my party colleagues, regardless of their point of view, for the way in which they put forward their views on what will go before the people.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most important debates of recent times. Marital breakdown, unfortunately, is a reality in today's Ireland.  In every county, town and village there have been marriage breakdowns.  It would be wrong to ignore the plight of people caught up in such difficult and painful <Col N="897" /> circumstances.  We as legislators must make hard choices.  We can either put our heads in the sand or deal with this very real social difficulty in a compassionate manner.  It is inevitable that this issue should be put to the people yet again, given that some 75,000 people are in broken marriages.  The Government has chosen the right option at this stage by giving people the opportunity in a referendum to introduce the right to remarry.  The Government has a duty to introduce this badly needed social legislation.</P>
      <P>The absence of divorce has not prevented marriage breakdown and it is no longer possible to ignore the situation. The day of reckoning is upon us.  If we care about those who find themselves in this situation we have an obligation to deal with this problem in a fair and compassionate way.  The right to end a marriage has existed for some considerable time but it is illegal to remarry.  The referendum will, I hope, rectify this situation.  I firmly believe it would be a grave injustice to those people who wish to begin afresh if they were deprived of the opportunity to do so.  The introduction of divorce can bring hope to people whose marriage has irretrievably broken down.</P>
      <P>On a personal basis I am reassured by the fact that it will be a requirement that couples must be separated for four of the previous five years before a divorce is granted.  Just as the majority of Irish people, I too am opposed to quickie divorce. There are many people who are in second unions who wish to have their new partnership recognised.  It seems only fair that these people be given the right to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland has changed considerably since the 1986 referendum.  The nature of family life has been transformed.  As a society concerned about family structure there is an onus on us to respond to these developments.  Such changes have made us a more tolerant and open society and I believe we are mature enough to accommodate diversity and difference.  As democrats we have a duty to those of different faiths and <Col N="898" /> views to make them feel included and truly part of our society.  Such diversity should be cherished and nourished as future generations will depend upon it.</P>
    <P>Divorce is a civil right.  It is unacceptable that some people are forced to be legally tied to a marriage that has ceased to exist as a loving and supportive relationship.  People decide to leave such sundered relationships after long and careful consideration.  Let no one think that divorce is entered into lightly.  For some the right to remarry will allow them to restart their lives and give them their full right as members of society.</P>
    <P>I am proud to say that the Labour Party will play an important and complete role in the campaign during the coming weeks.  I firmly believe that the passing of the referendum will make Ireland a more tolerant and understanding place in which to live and hopefully a more compassionate society.</P>

      <P>As a trustee of a divorce action group I will be supporting and canvassing strongly in County Clare for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote, as I did in 1986 when I was chairman of the Clare Divorce Action Group.  There is a fear that the referendum will be lost in rural Ireland so I hope that Deputies in rural areas will canvass and be more open.  I do not think they will lose votes when they go out canvassing for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  The Catholic Church has recognised that marriages fail and has granted annulments. In my 20 years practising psychiatry I have noticed an increasing number of annulments being granted and it is much easier now to get one than it was ten years ago.  I must refute the statement that divorce causes psychological effects on children, rather it is the constant rows the children see and hear at an early age that result in emotional damage.  This is something that is quite important and will be the most difficult part of the canvass. People are concerned about that and I would expect Members to discuss with <Col N="899" /> families the effects of divorce on children.</P>
      <P>I welcome the thrust of the Bill in allowing divorced people to be married. Some couples who have failed in their first marriage have successful second relationships.  The fear that happily married couples will be affected by the referendum is a myth that must be destroyed.  Happily married couples do not need divorce.  This Bill will provide an opportunity for those who are not happily married to leave the marriage.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that there will be a rush to divorce.  People will be much more cautious and there will be a trickle of cases until people see that the legislation is effective.  I welcome this Bill and will be voting for it today.  I will be out canvassing for a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote on 24 November.  I thank Deputy Owen for sharing time with me.</P>

      <P>I thank Members for sharing time with me.  The Central Statistics Office labour force survey of 1986 showed that 19,300 married women listed themselves as being in some sense separated.  That meant that 38,600 individuals were involved in marriages that were finished. By 1993 that number had increased to 75,400 individuals whose marriages were over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any other area of policy where it was evident that 75,000 people were suffering because of lack of legislation we would have already taken action to make good the damage being done.  We have done so in many other areas of social policy where new or newly realised problems existed in our society. We have seen much amending legislation in the last five to ten years to take account of the sad increase in sexual abuse cases and of inequalities in a number of areas.  If we had been in a position to amend our legislation without a referendum and allow some of those 75,000 people to remarry, we would <Col N="900" /> have done so.  This and other Governments have introduced 19 Bills in preparation for bringing this referendum before the people.  This is the last step in the process of ensuring that people can if they wish &mdash; it will not be obligatory &mdash; reorder their lives and give themselves and their families another chance with the opportunity to remarry when this referendum is passed.</P>
    <P>I hope, in the spirit of the debate we have seen over the last few days, the people too will recognise, now that the necessary legislation is in place to protect spouses and children in the context of property rights, legal aid etc., that this final legislation is required to make our society truly humane.</P>
    <P>In the debate of the last few days a number of points were raised which I, as Minister for Justice, feel it appropriate to address.  Following the enactment of the Judicial Separation Act, the number of applications for judicial separations increased by approximately 1,200 per cent.  Unfortunately, our courts were not in a position to deal adequately with this huge increase.  I am glad, therefore, that the Government has agreed to the terms of the Courts and Court Officers Bill which will come before the House during this session.  This will allow for an increase of 17 in the number of court judges to include three Supreme Court judges, two High Court judges. seven Circuit Court judges and five District Court judges.  It is an indication of the Government's intention to tackle the backlog in our court system.</P>
    <P>As part of my programme in the Department of Justice, I recognised that existing facilities in our courthouses were not suitable for family law cases. In a number of projects, including those in Longford, Carlow, Carrick-on-Shannon, Cork, Galway and many others, family law suites are included in the refurbishment to take account of the sensitivities of people who have to go to court to deal with family law business. It is not appropriate that such cases be <Col N="901" /> handled as they have been in circumstances and in surroundings that do not allow for privacy and take no account of the trauma of couples and children when they have to go to court.  I am satisfied that there is now a recognition of the practical side of the difficulties people have.  With those improvements I hope we will be able to deal with the backlog in our courts and that the passing of this referendum will not cause further difficulties for people going through the court system.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am replying to the debate on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, who is unavoidably absent today.  I have asked the officials to circulate my speaking notes. I do not think I will have time to read them all, but they were drafted in reply to queries raised on both sides of the House.  If I do not get around to reading them, Deputies can treat them as written answers to questions raised by different Deputies in the House.</P>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate.  The interventions were, for the most part, measured and considered in their content, and the debate has been conducted in a way that I hope will be an example to the rest of the referendum campaign outside this House.  I echo the call for a civilised and objective debate from the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, Deputy Andrews and the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Bertie Ahern.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a very constructive intervention, Deputy Woods, supported by a number of Deputies on the Fianna Fáil side, suggested that a five year strategic action plan should be drawn up to deal with the aftermath of divorce.  He helpfully went though the key elements which he saw as featuring in this plan and he will forgive me if I choose to highlight what I see as its main elements.  It has already <Col N="902" /> been indicated that the recommendations in the Fianna Fáil policy document on children will be studied carefully. However, even with the best intentions, it would be difficult to have a completed plan, properly costed and applied, in advance of the referendum. Nonetheless, the Deputy might acknowledge that many of the essential ingredients of the plan are already being progressed.</P>
    <P>For many Deputies, and for the majority of citizens, the possible impact of divorce on children is the key issue. It is important to separate fact from fiction in respect of the impact of divorce on children.  It is difficult to disengage the problem of marriage breakdown from the question of divorce.  Nonetheless this has to be done if the issues are not to be put in a false context.  This is particularly important when dealing with the impact of divorce on children because it is quite clear that the absence of divorce has not safeguarded those who are witnesses to the disintegration of their parents' marriage and who have suffered the emotional turmoil consequent upon disintegration.  Speaking in a professional capacity as well as a parliamentary one, Deputy Bhamjee has already drawn attention to this.</P>
    <P>There is a wide range of legislative provisions now in force which are of relevance to the plight of a child whose parents' marriage has broken down. The reality, however, is that these matters are not always capable of being regulated precisely by the legislation which, at most, can offer a rational framework within which compassionate and caring arrangements can be worked out so that the welfare of children is always to the forefront.  In certain circumstances, we must be honest and admit that the State cannot compel good behaviour between spouses in marital difficulty.  Such spouses have an important and personal responsibility to ensure that their separation is managed in a way which impacts with minimum <Col N="903" /> trauma on any children of the marriage and that the children do not become a weapon in emotional battles which are so often and so regrettably a feature of marriage breakdown world-wide.</P>
    <P>However, the State can ensure that the support services are there to facilitate spouses who wish to manage their separation in a structured and civilised manner.  Considerable research has been done in other countries in relation to the effect of divorce on children and it is regretted that many who are opposed to divorce in this country are willing to engage in the too easy identification of the presence of divorce with unquantified and harmful consequences for the well-being of our children.  This ignores the research which suggests strongly that the difficulties which studies observe in children of divorced parents are often evident prior to the divorce itself.  In other words, it is the situation of marital conflict, something which is already unfortunately clearly present in Ireland, which gives rise to behavioural problems and emotional distress.  It is true that those problems, in turn, may be minimised or exacerbated by the way in which the divorce is managed so that, for example, the more aggressive the behaviour of the parties to the divorce the more likely it is that any trauma the child is already experiencing will be increased.  However, this is not to deny the basic premise that it is the discord within marriage, which often exists for many years prior to the divorce, that can be the main source of damage to children.</P>
    <P>We must also be careful about making generalised statements which fail to do justice to the complexity of the picture. Many factors will influence the way in which children will adjust to parental separation.  The age of the child is obviously material, as is the extent to which conflict is a feature of the separation. Any change in economic status is also relevant as is the case of a child <Col N="904" /> who has been subjected to abuse or violence and the separation results in a dramatic improvement in his or her circumstances.</P>
    <P>A great deal of attention has focused on the overall findings of the Exeter study published in early 1994.  However, insufficient attention has focused on the fact that the data in that study did not demonstrate that the outcome for the children involved in it would have fared better if the parents in unhappy marriages had stayed together for the sake of the children instead of separating. Above all, the study did not reveal that children of divorced parents did any better or worse than children of parents who simply separated without a divorce.</P>
    <P>It would be foolish to deny that a child's psychological well-being can be damaged as a result of marriage breakdown. However, even within a so-called intact family, there is a wide variety of potentially damaging experiences to which a child can be exposed.  The Government is committed to sustaining the family and, in so far as is practicable, minimising the problems consequent on marital breakdown.  To this end, financial supports have been put in place, resources have been increased and there is a greater emphasis on mediation and counselling.  In our schools more attention is being paid to the development of relationship skills which over time may pay dividends in terms of our young people being better prepared for the difficulties which can sometimes arise in the course of marriage.  Increasing the age of marriage to 18, as provided for in the Family Law Act, 1995 should also be helpful.  Other legislative action aimed at putting children's interests more firmly at the centre when a marriage breaks down may also be possible and the Government is willing to listen to proposals for reform in this area. However, ultimately, the difficulties experienced by children are due to marriage breakdown and not to the fact that <Col N="905" /> one or other parent has a subsequent right to remarry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods again strongly advocated the protection of the family.  In this regard I remind the House that this Government's policy, as set out in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, is to reform our tax system and in particular to relieve the tax and PRSI burden on those with low incomes, especially those with families.  In line with this commitment, considerable improvements were made in this year's budget in the tax and PRSI systems.  In addition, significant increases were made in child benefit, the most significant for a long time.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to support the family is also evident in its decision to establish a commission on the family, whose task it will be to analyse the needs and priorities of families in the light of changing socio-economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>Various claims were made about divorce impoverishing women, but many Government speakers pointed out that this will not be the case and that such arguments do not stand up.  One item which has been raised both inside and outside the House is the devalued argument that divorce will mean that all constitutional protections will move to the second family and that the first family will thereby lose out.  This is simply not true.</P>
    <P>What is true is that divorce will dissolve the relationship between the spouses.  However, it does not follow that such dissolution will affect any of the rights conferred by Articles 41 and 42 of the Constitution on parents <i>vis-ávis</i> their children or on children <i>vis-ávis</i> their parents.  Parents remain parents after a divorce and that divorce can in no way diminish their inalienable rights and duties in respect of their children. Furthermore, as with the offsprings of married parents, and therefore members of families based on marriage, the children of divorced parents retain <Col N="906" /> their constitutional rights under relevant Articles even when the ties between their parents are severed.</P>
    <P>In addition it should be noted that under the Government's proposals an added constitutional protection is being given to families in that before granting a divorce a court must be satisfied that, having regard to the circumstances, proper provision has been, or will be, made for spouses and children.  A judge in a family court may not grant a dissolution unless he is satisfied that such provision has been made.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party has put forward the case both inside and outside this House that it would be better if some of the conditions under which dissolution is granted were not enshrined in the Constitution.  That is a tenable proposition and many people have canvassed for that in the past. However, I will outline some difficulties which would arise from that.  A divorce will not be granted unless certain conditions are met.  There will be literally dozens of conditions to be met before a couple are allowed to dissolve their marriage and are given the right to remarry.  Some of those conditions will be handed down by the judge on the day in court, others will be enshrined in the statute law, a draft of which is being published by my colleague and we have decided that some of them should be written into the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The argument is not about what conditions should apply but about whether they should be enshrined in the Constitution or in statute law.  In circumstances in which we have a form of direct democracy and when a prohibition on divorce is enshrined in the Constitution, it is only reasonable that we should insert some of the primary conditions under which divorce should be granted into the Constitution.  There is nothing wrong with that.  Perhaps, instead of using the word &ldquo;Constitution&rdquo;, we should use the German term, <Col N="907" />&ldquo;the basic law&rdquo;.  We know that all statute law must comply with the basic law, which is the Constitution and that such law cannot be changed without reference to the people.  What is so wrong about referring the primary conditions under which divorce is granted to the people when the present constitutional position prohibits divorce?</P>
    <P>This is an argument about ways and means and I understand the Progressive Democrats position.  That party can argue that all conditions should be enshrined in statute law or handed down by the judge on the day in court and not enshrined in the Constitution, but the Government holds a different view.  We believe that the primary conditions should be enshrined in the Constitution and that there should be further references to the people if there is an attempt to change them.</P>
    <P>I have two difficulties with the Progressive Democrats position.  Some of its members have argued their case in such absolute terms that it will be untenable for them to go forth from this House and advocate a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote.  I accept that is not the official position but some of its speakers went beyond ways and means of dealing with the matter and argued totally against the principle.  That party has cut a stick that others will use to beat it when this debate goes to the country.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We will wait and see.  Also, the Progressive Democrats Party is suggesting that the public should buy a pig in a poke because, while arguing that the conditions should be a matter for statute law, its members have not specified the conditions under which their party would allow divorce.  If the debate is simply about whether the conditions <Col N="908" /> should be enshrined in the Constitution or in statute law, the Progressive Democrats should be forthright with the public and spell out the conditions under which divorce should be granted.  It is not fair that the people should have to vote blindfolded, not knowing what would ensure in the House.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> For that reason I ask all Members of the House to reject the Progressive Democrats' amendment even though what they advocate is tenable.</P>
      <P>The Minister of Justice dealt with the issue of court delays.  I would like to outline to the House what the Minister and his predecessor and, indeed, Fianna Fáil Ministers, have done to progress and improve marriage counselling, mediation in marriage and to improve the legal aid system, but time does not allow.  If Members wish they may refer to my speaking notes in that regard.</P>
      <P>Many people, both inside and outside the House, referred to the fact that the Government proposes to expend up to £500,000 on an information campaign. The Government has a duty and responsibility to inform the public about its proposal.  In this context it has already produced an information paper on the divorce referendum entitled <i>The Right to Remarry</i>.  This paper details the legislative framework and the support services &mdash; mediation, counselling and legal aid &mdash; that are in place to deal with marriage breakdowns and which would apply on the introduction of divorce.  The paper also contains the text of the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill, 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An information leaflet has been prepared which addresses briefly the issues in the debate.  This leaflet contains information only and was prepared in response to requests from interest groups for information about the law <Col N="909" /> and support services in relation to aspects of marriage breakdown and for information about divorce.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Government has announced that it proposes to provide a facility to groups representative of the arguments for and against divorce to make their case to voters.  My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, is making the necessary arrangements and an <i>ad hoc</i> commission has been established to oversee this process.</P>
    <P>I detect a great degree of unanimity in this House.  There is unanimous agreement that the issue should be put to the people while a huge majority in all parties believe that we, as legislators, should advocate to the people that they should vote &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  As Deputy Ahern said, the law should, as far as possible, be in accordance with social practice.  If social practice has brought about a situation where marriage breakdown and separation are widespread it seems we should extend to separated people the <Col N="910" /> facility to bring their new relationships into accord with the law.  If there is no law available, they cannot do so.</P>
    <P>All we are proposing is that this facility be provided.  This will not lead to Nevada or Haiti type divorce and is not a cure for adultery, violence or any other difficulty.  Divorce will only be granted by a court under certain conditions enshrined in the Constitution after persons have been separated for four years out of five in circumstances where the judge is sure that proper provision has been made for spouses and children.  I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to you, a Cheann Comhairle, for your assistance in allowing me to raise this urgent matter to point out the total inability of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to deliver on the commitments he made in the continuing, serious demise of the sheep sector under his stewardship. His failure to take any effective steps to avoid a disastrous year for ewe sheep farmers, particularly those in his own lowland areas of the south east and throughout the remainder of the country, is the most graphic indictment of his management of our agricultural industry since he assumed office.</P>
      <P>The Bord Bia study produced this week, forming part of a comprehensive examination of the problems in our sheep sector, confirms the substantial deterioration since the Minister took office.  That study confirms that in the years 1992, 1993 and 1994 the average difference in price between Irish and French lamb on the French market was two to five French francs per kilo whereas the difference in price this year has risen to seven to eight French francs per kilo or almost IR£1 per kilo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to that stark reality in price differential, since his tenure in <Col N="914" /> office began, this Minister has overseen the largest reduction in our ewe breeding flock in modern times, there are 115,000 fewer this year compared with last year, a rate of decline four times that of any previous one.  In addition, there is the prospect of a fall in volume and output in the coming year because of the decline in the number of breeding ewes for next season.  Falling prices, falling output, a falling market share in our one fresh sheep market of substance have been accompanied by a Minister who has promised everything but delivered nothing to our sheep farmers.</P>
    <P>The Bord Bia study shows that failure to gain access to the higher price available to French producers means that the ewe premium, calculated at present on a Community-wide basis, simply does not compensate our farmers.  Therefore, it is quite clear from that study that our sheep farmers are at a further serious disadvantage because of the uniform ewe premium system.  Indeed the scale of the problem can be gauged by the fact that 73 per cent of our lamb exports are to that same French market.</P>
    <P>In the face of this disaster what is the future of Irish sheep farmers and, more importantly, what is the Minister doing about it?</P>
    <P>This year with early lamb prices some 15 to 25 pence per lb down on 1994 prices, in June the Minister made a big play of the fact that the Commission would produce a report on the sheep sector by end September, when he indicated that all would be well when that report had been published.  September has passed, we have seen no results and there is every sign that the issue will drag on, the Minister now promising us that something will happen before Christmas.  We are told that the bargaining will take place with the Spaniards &mdash; who have their drought problems &mdash; at the end of the present Presidency.  The message from the Minister's public relations machine is that all will be well.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="915" /> The Commission report has been concluded. What does it contain?  Has the Minister seen it?  As I said, the Bord Bia figures issued this week confirm there has been no price convergence whereas we were told that if prices were increased the ewe premium would be reduced.  Why does the counter argument not apply?  Since prices for Irish farmers are depressed, why is such a problem encountered in obtaining an increase in the ewe premium to meet that demand for fair play and equity?</P>
    <P>In the past week or two the Minister has been talking down expectations on this matter.  For instance, in a recent interview his comments related totally to lowland producers who, quite clearly, have been experiencing a particularly hard time.  Unlike farmers in disadvantaged areas, they have no access to headage payments or the rural world premium.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that lowland sheep farmers account for one million sheep and that the total number nationally is 3.67 million sheep for the market-place.  If the Minister does not deliver an extension of the rural world premium to non-disadvantaged areas in addition to an £8 per ewe top-up premium, it is clear he will condemn the remnants of our sheep industry to production in disadvantaged and mountainous areas only, when the lowland sheep farmer will be wiped out altogether.  The lack of confidence in the sheep sector is confirmed by the reduction this year in the number of breeding ewes by 115,000.  Therefore, it is clear that many farmers are increasing their number of dry hoggets rather than holding ewes for breeding purposes.</P>
    <P>There has been so much procrastination and camouflage by the Minister on this issue our farmers are now asking if the Minister accepts the need for any top-up payment in the face of a disastrous year.  Talking to farmers at the <Col N="916" /> recent national ploughing championships I became aware, like the Minister, that our sheep farmers have borne the brunt of falling prices this year.</P>
    <P>Earlier in the summer the Minister claimed that the APS schemes would help to improve prices whereas they proved a total diversion from the real problem.  While those schemes helped to order the market they did nothing for the producer in terms of price.  It took the over-hang of hoggets and some lamb off the market into private storage but made no difference to the price being paid to our sheep producers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been running away from this issue all year.  His promises, commitments and the visit of Mr. Fischler confirmed that he acknowledged there was a problem.  However, acknowledging and solving the problem are two different matters.  We were promised the APS scheme would solve the problem but it did not.  We were promised the report to be produced in September would provide the basis of a solution.  We have not seen that report or heard any ministerial comment on it. We were promised Mr. Fischler had come to Ireland to see the problem for himself and would deliver.  We await with interest any commitment to solve the problem with a top-up premium payment.  Most important of all, the Minister told us &mdash; mind you, from Brussels &mdash; that all would be well by Christmas.</P>
    <P>The Minister can run but he cannot hide.  Farmers have taken to the streets on two occasions this summer to highlight the plight of Irish sheep producers, yet they have got nothing but sweet talk and momentary diversions.  Having come into office on the crest of a wave, the Minister should realise the tide is coming in and he is heading for the rocks.  No public relations stunt can cloud this issue any longer.  Unfortunately, our sheep producers are at the precipice awaiting positive action.  None <Col N="917" /> is in sight and the time has come to deliver.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Cowen that prices in the sheepmeat sector have been very disappointing this year, especially in the early part of the year. Unfortunately, lamb prices failed to follow the normal seasonal upward trend from early March and the traditional price peak which normally occurs over the Easter period did not take place this year.</P>
      <P>The Minister has been conscious of the inherited difficulties these low prices pose for sheep farmers particularly those involved in early lamb production. The Minister and the Department have made strong representations to Commissioner Fischler and the Commission services in recent months for the introduction of some mechanism to alleviate the income difficulties suffered by Irish sheep producers.</P>
      <P>As early as last March the Minister submitted a memorandum to Commissioner Fischler in which he made a number of suggestions for compensating Irish producers for the inadequate support provided by the ewe premium.  He followed up this memorandum with bilateral contacts with the Commission and, in May, the EU Commission introduced the aid for private storage scheme for old season lamb.  This measure was confined to Ireland and was designed to remove the overhang of hoggets from last year's production which had been an important factor in depressing sheep prices here.  This measure was quite successful in alleviating the immediate problem and in stabilising sheep prices for a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the market difficulties persisted and, at the meeting of the Agriculture Council in June, the Minister secured a commitment from the Commission <Col N="918" /> to introduce market management measures to alleviate these difficulties. In response to this commitment, the Commission introduced a private storage aid scheme for lamb in Ireland in July.  This scheme provided an effective additional support for the market and succeeded in arresting the downward movement of prices.</P>
    <P>The commitment given to the Minister in the June Council also included an undertaking from the Commission to consider whether, in light of the result of the market measures, further action would be necessary, in particular, the possible upward adjustment in the level of the ewe premium and an acceleration of its payment.  He raised this commitment with the Commissioner at the meeting of the Council on 25 and 26 September and put a number of proposals to the Commission, including a top-up premium for member states with low prices and the extension of the rural world premium to non-disadvantaged areas in member states with low prices. It has to be recognised that this is part of an ongoing process and he intends to raise the matter again at the November Council.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that lamb prices have increased steadily during the month of September and that the price for the last week of September was 4 per cent above the 1994 level.  The recent improvement in prices has continued and prices are currently about 6 per cent above last year's level in spite of the fact that lamb disposals in the past few weeks have been well up on normal levels.</P>
    <P>Despite the improvement in the market, the Minister intends to persist in his efforts to persuade the Commission to introduce some worthwhile measure to assist Irish sheep producers, particularly spring lamb producers who have borne the brunt of the price fall earlier in the <Col N="919" /> year.  As a result of his efforts in Brussels, both the Commission and our partner member states are fully aware of the situation in Ireland.  He has given priority attention to this problem since it emerged earlier in the year and intends to pursue the matter vigorously to a successful conclusion.</P>

      <P>The time has now come for the EU to take off the gloves on French nuclear testing.  The second nuclear test, which is said to be more than ten times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb, must be the last.  The French Government has treated all of us with contempt.  It has defied the European Commission's call under the EURATOM Treaty for full information on the environmental dangers before any further tests were carried out.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, to make immediate arrangements in co-operation with like-minded EU states to take France to the European Court and ensure this most recent test, this last insult, is the final one.  I also ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs to put France on notice that we will seek a revision of the EURATOM at the EU intergovernmental conference next year to ensure that any EU state will not be allowed by law to behave in a renegade manner as the French are doing in the South Pacific.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The French have, in effect, put the whole of the South Pacific under house arrest.  Their response to legitimate concerns from the region and around the world can only be described as disgraceful. A more direct involvement of President Clinton in bringing an end to the nuclear testing should be sought by the Government.  We have always been <Col N="920" /> strong advocates of a comprehensive test ban treaty and the French should be told by the US that we have had enough.  They should agree to stop the tests and sign the comprehensive test ban treaty next year.</P>
    <P>I am aware many Irish people have boycotted French goods as a result of the nuclear testing and this is perfectly understandable.  The anger is not directed at the French people but at what can only be described as an arrogant and stubborn government.  I will not propose a recall of our ambassador or an all-out boycott of French goods at this stage, as we should concentrate our energies on taking legal action at European level.  However, this Parliament should make a significant demonstration of its anger by agreeing to boycott French wine in the Dáil restaurant, bar and shop.  I hope we have all-party agreement on this matter.  It would be a small gesture but it would be an important signal from this Parliament of its strong cross-party views.  I would be grateful to you, a Cheann Comhairle, if you would convey my views on this matter to the appropriate Oireachtas committee.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste outlined to the House on 20 September the total opposition of the Government to all nuclear weapons testing.  In the light of the further French test at Fangataufa Atoll yesterday, I reaffirm to the House the Government's unequivocal, enduring and consistent stance on testing nuclear weapons.  In this respect, I wish to record here the deep concern and disappointment felt by the Government that France, a country with which Ireland has much in common and with which we have long and close relations, should proceed with a further nuclear test, of considerably larger dimensions than the previous test, in the face of almost universal opposition and criticism, and despite the concerns which Ireland and many other friendly states have made clear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="922" /> The Government has availed of, and will continue to avail of, appropriate opportunities to convey its concerns to the Government of France.  This House will understand these concerns have not been expressed selectively; the Government has also made its views clear to the Chinese Government in relation to the two Chinese tests earlier this year.</P>
    <P>In common with a number of our EU partners, we have urged France to end without delay its testing programme in the South Pacific and to thereby set an international example in support of moratoriums on nuclear testing, with a view to early progress towards a comprehensive test ban treaty.  We have, in particular, emphasised the commitment made by the nuclear weapons states, including France, at the review conference of the non-proliferation treaty. This commitment was to exercise &ldquo;utmost restraint&rdquo; pending the entry into force of a comprehensive test ban treaty.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste has brought directly to the attention of the French Government Irish disappointment and concern that France has proceeded with this testing programme in the face of unprecedented opposition on the part of countries of the Pacific region and despite numerous appeals to desist, addressed to France by friendly countries, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>The House will already be aware that the Government has used the opportunities provided by meetings in the framework of the European Union to raise our concerns.  For example, the Tánaiste, at the EU Foreign Ministers meeting in Santander last month, emphasised the Government's views and the strength of opinion on this issue within Ireland to the Foreign Ministers of France.  A number of EU partners also made clear their strong views.  The Taoiseach also raised the issue with President Chirac at the informal meeting of heads of State or Government in <Col N="923" /> Mallorca on 22 and 23 September.  Yesterday, in the immediate aftermath of the French test at Fangataufa, the Tánaiste and a number of our partners took the issue up again with the Foreign Minister of France at a meeting of the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>Ireland has been active also at the multilateral level.  The Tánaiste in his address last week at the 50th Session of the UN General Assembly, highlighted the issue before the United Nations.  He drew attention to the fact that the great majority of the Irish people easily understand and share the deep concern of the peoples in the South Pacific.  He drew attention also to the dismay and rejection caused by the resumption of nuclear testing in the immediate aftermath of the successful outcome of the NPT review conference.  He emphasised the great importance the Government attaches to finalising a comprehensive test ban treaty early next year.</P>
    <P>The French Government, for its part, have indicated it will commit itself to a fully comprehensive test ban treaty. This is a significant statement.  For our part, we will continue to work to bring an end as soon as possible all nuclear tests.  That is our priority and we earnestly hope that France will heed the sustained and widespread calls to end once and for all and without delay its programme of nuclear testing.  I note these demands are widespread, not just in Ireland but more particularly in France itself.</P>

      <P>The automatic right to transfer in the court system is causing major upheaval in the Cork area.  Many criminals coming before the courts have consecutive crimes on the list and are well known to local gardaí and judges. Because they fear the severity of the sentence which may be passed on them, they feel that if they transfer their cases to Dublin they get an easier sentence. Research has shown this to be the case.</P>
      <P>One also finds the same hard core of people seeking to transfer their cases to Dublin.  This has the added advantages that the accused will be allowed out on bail to come to court in Dublin and the case will be postponed for a year to 18 months.  That also gives the person the opportunity to commit crime when on bail.</P>
      <P>We need speedy justice in Cork but we are not getting it at present.  That is not the fault of the Garda or the legal people but of the system which is allowed in that area.  On a given day in the Cork Circuit Court, up to 90 per cent of cases will contain a request to transfer to Dublin, which equals about 30 cases per session.  This has become the norm rather than the exception.</P>
      <P>The Minister should consider the cost to the State in such instances.  I call this the Cork to Dublin stagecoach, full of legal personnel, witnesses, defendants and gardaí going to the big smoke, so that the accused can pursue the possibility of a lighter sentence in Dublin. The records show there have been no criminal cases in Cork in the last few years, which is a damning indictment of the system.  During all this time the accused is on bail and there is substantial evidence that some of those on bail commit further crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is incredible that the Government would allow this exasperating, costly and inexplicable automatic right to transfer cases to continue in its present <Col N="925" /> form.  Action is now needed from this Minister.  She should consider the amount of time the local State solicitor puts into a case, only to have it transferred out of his jurisdiction and the frustration of the local gardaí, who must come to Dublin to hear the accused enter a not guilty plea and see him let out on bail to again commit crimes. There should be no automatic right of transfer of cases from Cork to Dublin. Also, two Circuit Court judges should be appointed in Cork, because that would save the cost incurred in transporting these people to Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for allowing me to speak on this matter.  The facility which allows people to transfer to Dublin is a farcical loophole in the law.  Gardaí, witnesses, family, offenders and those who have been wronged come to Dublin and are unaware whether they will be here for a day, a week or a month.  This is most unsatisfactory and huge resources are being lost to the State, especially in terms of gardaí being out of the city when they are badly needed in Cork.  In one case, a peace commissioner who is over 80 and has carried out his duty for many years was informed that, because there was a query by the defence as to the signing of the warrants, he would have to come to Dublin to give evidence.</P>
      <P>This is a crazy situation.  The Minister inherited the matter and we have been pursuing it for a number of years.  There are many things she cannot do but this matter should be addressed immediately. People and the judiciary in Cork are incensed that accused persons can use this loophole, which is of no benefit to the law abiding people of Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this issue, which is of considerable concern to many people <Col N="926" /> in Cork.  In accordance with section 31 of the Courts Act, 1981, when a person is charged with an indictable offence triable in a Circuit Court other than Dublin it is open to the prosecution or the accused to apply to the judge of the Circuit Court to have the trial transferred to the Dublin circuit.  Such applications must be granted under the provisions of the Act provided the party making the application gives seven days' notice to the other party of the intention to apply.</P>
      <P>A substantial number of criminal trials are, by virtue of this section, transferred to the Dublin Circuit Court every year and more cases are transferred from Cork than from any other Circuit Court.  The effect of such transfers is to increase the criminal case load in the Dublin Circuit Court thus contributing to the present delays in the hearing of such cases.  These transfers would in many cases involve additional expense to the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned by delays in the hearing of court cases and in particular in hearing criminal cases.  Any delay in hearing criminal cases gives rise to much anxiety on the part of victims of crime, particularly where the defendant is remanded on bail.  Such defendants, whose cases cannot be heard for lack of a judge, are free to commit further crimes if there is a delay in the disposal of their cases.  I am also concerned by additional and perhaps unnecessary expense to the State being incurred.  For these reasons, the accused's right to transfer a case to the Dublin Circuit Court was examined in the context of the review of the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994, and I subsequently obtained Government approval to include, in the Bill being prepared in my Department at present, provisions which will allow for the transfer of cases in certain specified circumstances only. I expect to introduce that Bill early in this session.  The Minister has already made a number of statements on the ongoing work on the Bill which, as <Col N="927" /> I have said, will be ready fairly shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Celtworld project in Tramore, County Waterford, was quite an exciting project, which went into operation in May 1992.  It portrayed Irish mythology and legend with the use of modern effects and technology. Unfortunately, it has not been a commercial success, so much so that the project is now up for sale.  The initial cost was in excess of £4 million and the price being sought is somewhere in the region of £600,000.</P>
      <P>Bord Fáilte, together with two major companies, contributed £1.5 million to the £4 million and the European Union contributed approximately £1.8 million. We are told that the banks put up about £600,000 &mdash; which, coincidentally, is the sum being sought for the project now. BES investors contributed approximately £230,000.  There were dozens of such small investors involved in that total investment of £230,000 who seem to be among the main losers in the project. I know that Bord Fáilte and the two Irish companies will lose £1.5 million, but these are individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are very annoyed that they have not got a satisfactory explanation of what happened.  For example, they feel the way the project has been disposed of prohibits them from finding out the financial affairs of the company over the past three years.  Rather than going into receivership or liquidation, it is being sold on and bids are being accepted in sealed envelopes.  This prohibits them from finding out what transpired in the past three years.  The company did not hold an AGM since 1992 when they invested their money, as one would expect in any company, so they had no way of finding out what was happening. They were promised at that initial stage that they would be allowed a director on <Col N="928" /> the board, which never happened.  Dozens of BES investors were totally shut out &mdash; not alone losing their money but given no explanation of what happened.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give me an undertaking that the investors will be told what transpired, how their money was lost and if there is any hope of it being recovered &mdash; although I doubt there is.  I know there are new and exciting plans for major developments in Tramore in the offing.  I hope that the Celtworld project will be included in any future developments because it is a wonderful idea but unfortunately it did not have the commercial viability which one would wish.  We have seen almost £4 million go down the drain as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny) Enda Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for raising this matter of importance to people in the Tramore area.  I visited Tramore, and Waterford in general, with Deputy Deasy some months ago and had the opportunity to see Celtworld at first hand.</P>
      <P>I feel it necessary to put this tourism project into its proper context. Celtworld in Tramore, County Waterford, was one of several hundred tourism projects which were evaluated by Bord Fáilte and approved for funding by its board under the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1989-93.  In fact, both Bord Fáilte and Shannon Development, who administered the programme in the mid-west, were legally contracted under global grant agreements, which were concluded directly with the European Commission, to administer the EU funds available under the programme for private sector led developments such as Celtworld.  The agencies' responsibility under these agreements included the appraisal of project grant applications under the programme, and payment of funds to successful applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time it was proposed for EU aid, Celtworld was regarded by Bord Fáilte as an innovative project, which <Col N="929" /> would depict Irish mythology and legend through the use of modern technology and audio-visual effects and would help to regenerate the fortunes of Tramore as a tourist resort.  I understand from Bord Fáilte that the project cost over £4 million and attracted EU aid for £1.81 million.  The balance of funding was provided by the private sector to the tune of almost £1 million, which included moneys raised through the business expansion scheme, by Tramore Fáilte, a subsidiary of the South-East Regional Tourism Organisation (SERTO), who contributed £737,000, and through term loans and leasing arrangements of almost £575,000.</P>
    <P>Celtworld Limited was established as a private limited company under the Companies Act with all the major shareholders represented on the board, including Tramore Fáilte, Vectravision and nominees of Kentz Group subsidiaries. The project opened for business in 1992 and within a short time ran into trading difficulties.  Bord Fáilte, with the agreement of the company, appointed independent financial consultants to carry out a review of operations.  The consultants concluded that, due primarily to a shortfall in the targeted level of BES moneys and in the forecast level of sponsorship, the project had been under-capitalised, and this had been exacerbated by an expensive introductory marketing campaign in 1992.</P>
    <P>Overheads were cut down, and in September 1993 Bord Fáilte, through the South-East Regional Tourism Organisation, approved a loan of £313,000 to strengthen the balance sheet and to alleviate ongoing operational difficulties. In return, SERTO had two nominees appointed to the board. Unfortunately, in the year that followed trading did not improve and Bord Fáilte decided to assist with the cost of another financial review in 1994 while continuing to monitor the project closely up to the present day.  However, <Col N="930" /> notwithstanding the best efforts of the company, and strong support from Bord Fáilte, the financial performance of Celtworld Limited continued to deteriorate to its present irretrievable position.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that Bord Fáilte has worked hard with this company for some time in an attempt to salvage the project.  Yet despite these efforts, the company found itself in the position where recently it decided that the best option available to it was to put the premises up for sale.  Bord Fáilte now accepts that Celtworld is not going to successfully trade its way out of its current financial difficulties and is in agreement with the company's decision.</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte has confirmed that a legal deed of covenant with the Celtworld company remains in place and that it will be relied on to the extent possible to ensure that a tourism attraction is reopened on the site.  Every effort is accordingly being made to ensure the continuing use of the facility for tourism purposes, in order to help protect the investment which has been made in the premises and maintain its strategic developmental role in the regeneration of the resort.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Deasy pointed out, Tramore was chosen as one of 15 areas in maritime counties for special tax status designation.  The Deputy can be assured that it is foremost on our list of priorities in this area.  However, its present value is likely to be substantially less than the investment made in the facility.</P>
    <P>I understand that since the launch in 1990 of the tourism programme 1989-93, the project evaluation and implementation procedures employed by Bord Fáilte and the other tourism agencies have been regularly reviewed, both internally and by external parties such as the European Court of Auditors, to ensure the highest standards in relation to the operation and applications of these procedures.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the fact that that no AGM had been held in this <Col N="931" /> case.  This was a decision of the directors who knew that Celtworld Limited was in some difficulty.  I understand that in respect of the BES investors, of which the Deputy rightly mentioned that 63 were involved with an investment of £230,000, many of these, or at least a number of them, were employees of the Bank of Ireland, Kentz Group subsidiaries and Tramore Fáilte.  I understand that their representatives were Bank of Ireland Trustees Limited, a subsidiary of Bank of Ireland who were bankers to Celtsworld Limited.  I also understand that the company secretary has informed Bord Fáilte that Bank of Ireland was invited to nominate a director to the board of Celtworld in 1993 but declined the offer.</P>
    <P>I regard the failure of Celtworld as <Col N="932" /> unfortunate, both for the many investors in the project and for the tourism interests of Tramore.  It is my earnest hope that we will see a tourism facility reopened at the site, and I assure the House and the Deputy that Bord Fáilte will be working with this objective firmly in mind.  Already in the Tramore area, as Deputy Deasy is aware, there is intense interest from a major contractor in terms of what could well be a flagship development for these tax status areas. I hope the Celtworld facility will feature, if not in this project then at least in some future project and that its value will not be lost to Tramore or its people.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>Section 8 (1) of the Police Forces Amalgamation Act, 1925, provides that the general direction and control of the Force is vested in the Garda Commissioner. The Act gives full authority to the Commissioner to effect transfers and other policy in the interest of the service and this authority has been upheld in many judgments of the superior courts.  This authority, however, is not administered arbitrarily by the Commissioner.  It forms an integral part of policy for the equitable distribution of the Force between districts and divisions.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are a number of factors taken into account when deploying personnel.  These include: the policing needs of the district to which the member is attached and the proposed new district; the member's ability to deal with the current policing needs of these districts; the member's general suitability and effectiveness, including special skills; the member's relationship with his/her colleagues and with the public; and the member's own wishes and his/her domestic circumstances.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy Clohessy's question, as I have already outlined, the transfer of members of the Garda Síochána is solely a matter for the Garda Commissioner and I have no function in the process.</P>

We do not have official figures &mdash; by which I mean figures that are finalised &mdash; as yet for 1995 but there are tentative figures indicating that, in the case of certain drugs, the seizure level is upwards.</P>
      <P>For example, as regards the drug commonly referred to as Ecstasy, 2,000 tablets were seized in 1993 and 28,000 tablets were seized in 1994.  However, so far this year, 180,000 tables have been seized.  This figure continues to rise.  As regards heroin, 1,284 grams were seized in 1993.  By the following year, this had jumped to 4,650 grams.  So far this year, in excess of 2,000 grams has been seized.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last figure only takes into account the amount which has been analysed in the Forensic Science Laboratory to date.  When all of the seizures have been analysed, this figure will be undoubtedly greater.  Overall, in the first six months of this year, the Garda made 2,835 drug seizures.  This is a 9 per cent increase in the number of seizures over the same period last year.  This is in line with the upward trend in drug seizures witnessed in recent years.  In 1992, the number of seizures increased by 20 per cent.  In 1993, the number increased by 15 per cent and last year the number increased <Col N="616" /> by 9.5 per cent.  As I already said, the number of seizures has increased by 9 per cent so far this year.</P>

      <P>My reply to this question has regard only to the escort costs relevant to the Garda Síochána Vote.  Military costs which arise from the escort of cash in transit are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated Garda costs of accompanying cash in transit in 1995 to date are not yet available.  However, for the Deputy's interest, I will repeat my reply to Question No. 35 on 11 May 1995.  The Garda manpower costs incurred in 1994 on approximately 27,000 Garda/Army escorts of cash movements from banks and post offices to cash holding centres and the Central Bank, as well as escorts of cash to post offices for the purpose of social welfare payments, was in the region of £1.5 million. Records are not maintained in such a way as to enable an estimate of the <Col N="617" /> transport costs involved in all of these escorts to be computed.</P>
    <P>As regards contributions from financial institutions, a total of £2 million was received by the Exchequer from the associated banks in 1994 in respect of security costs incurred by the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces.  Some £500,000 of that contribution was credited to the Garda Síochána Vote.  In his 1995 budget, the Minister for Finance made provision for an increased contribution of £3 million from the banks in the current year, of which £750,000 is to be paid to the Garda Síochána Vote.</P>

    <P>In attempting to assess the significance of these figures, it is necessary to <Col N="619" /> look at historical as well as other factors.  Prior to 1989, women did not compete on equal terms with men to join the Garda Síochána.  However, at present, approximately one in every five applicants invited for interview for entry to the Garda Síochána is a woman.  I am unable to say at this stage what the ratio of successful male candidates to female candidates joining the Garda Síochána is, as the current recruitment campaign is still in progress.  However, I can say that approximately one in every four candidates successful at the interview stage of the 1991 competition was a woman.</P>
    <P>The effects of the marriage bar, which applied to the Garda Síochána, as it did in the Civil Service generally, up to 1973, has severely impacted on the overall number of women in the Force, especially in the supervisory ranks. There are now equal opportunities for advancement within the Garda Síochána and I hope to see women rising through the ranks in a significant way in the future.</P>
    <P>In the context of likely future developments in this regard, it is important to say that the Garda Síochána is an equal opportunities employer.  It is committed to and supports equality of opportunity in employment and in promotion opportunities regardless of gender, creed, colour or marital status.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána, in addition to requiring compliance with specific legislation which makes discrimination illegal, takes all necessary steps to promote fairness and equal treatment.  All procedures and practices in this area continue to be monitored and reviewed by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, in recent years, the Cavan/ Monaghan division has had one of the lowest crime rates in the State. For example, in 1993, of the 23 Garda divisions, the Cavan/Monaghan division had the fourth lowest number of reported crimes.  In 1994, the division had the fifth lowest number of crimes. The 1993 figure showed a decrease of 4 per cent over the previous year and this pattern was repeated in 1994 when a decrease of 6 per cent was recorded.</P>
      <P>In addition, the rate of detection in the division in 1993 and 1994 was the second highest and third highest respectively in the State.  While provisional figures for 1995 indicate that there has been an increase in crime in the division, the indications are that this division still has the fifth lowest number of crimes committed per division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase referred to above was mainly caused by a series of crimes committed by travelling criminals between November 1994 and March 1995.  These crimes were mainly directed at business premises.  Due to the relatively low level <Col N="621" /> of crime, these crimes have had a substantial impact on the crime figures for the division.</P>
    <P>As a response to the situation, the Garda initiated a major crime prevention programme in which all business premises in the division have been visited. Opportunities for crime at these premises have been assessed and crime prevention advice given as necessary.  In this regard, some in the business community have responded and have fitted alarms and generally improved their security systems.</P>
    <P>During the past three months, the number of crimes reported has fallen back to the levels obtaining in 1993 and 1994.  I am informed by the Garda that they expect this trend to continue for the rest of the year.</P>
    <P>Garda management is satisfied that the deployment of Garda manpower in the Cavan/Monaghan division is sufficient to meet the current policing needs of the division.</P>

      <P>In terms of facilitating a properly informed and balanced discussion on the issue in this House, which is, I am sure, what Deputies are seeking, I believe the only fair and proper course is to await the Minister's statement, rather than for me to proceed now to attempt to deal with one particular aspect of the matter, that is, the allegations concerning surveillance on the Minister and others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 23 and <Col N="623" /> 107 together.  The information sought by the Deputies is not readily available for 1995.  However, the provisional figures for 1994 show that there were 3,120 crimes recorded in which tourists were the injured parties.  Of these, 2,548 crimes were reported in the Dublin Metropolitan Area, DMA, and 572 were reported outside the DMA.  Of the crimes committed in the DMA, I understand a victim support survey found that the major locations of crimes committed against tourists are O'Connell Street, Christchurch, Wicklow, Grafton Street/St. Stephen's Green and St. James' Gate, the Guinness Brewery.  I am informed that larcenies from unattended motor vehicles is the most common crime experienced by tourists. The number of tourists for 1994 is estimated at 3.68 million in the Republic. Even if each crime corresponded to one tourist, this means that only 0.08 per cent of tourists were victims of crime.  In other words, 99.92 per cent of tourists who visited this country did not experience crime.</P>
      <P>The issue of crime against tourists is one which receives the highest priority from my Department and the Garda authorities.  Close co-operation is maintained with Bord Fáilte to ensure that crimes of this nature are minimised to the greatest possible extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The measures taken by the Garda to deal with this problem include the deployment of additional Garda patrols, both uniformed and plainclothes, in areas of high tourist interest.  In this regard, it is noticeable that a limited number of locations feature in many instances of crime against tourists.  For this reason, the Garda are targeting these areas to ensure the safety of tourists. Other measures include the provision and distribution of an information leaflet by the Garda which is written in three different European languages and gives advice to tourists on how to protect their property and personal belongings.  These leaflets are also available at all sea ports and airports. This is a simple crime prevention device <Col N="624" /> which has proved to be of very practical value.</P>
    <P>Another significant measure designed to help in tackling the problem is the provision of the Garda Office which opened in March 1990 in O'Connell Street, Dublin.  This serves as a central location for advising tourists on preventive measures which they can take to safeguard themselves and their belongings. It also maintains a permanent Garda presence in the area.</P>
    <P>An initiative deserving of special notice is the launch by the Garda Community Relations Unit of a street map for tourists in Dublin, listing places of historical and current interest and also including crime prevention advice. Supervised car parks are depicted on the maps.  I understand it is intended to extend this project to other areas frequented by tourists.  In addition, the Garda have carried out security surveys of all youth hostel accommodation. Advice has been given on securing entry and exit points to these buildings and providing facilities to allow tourists to store luggage securely.</P>
    <P>As regards measures to help those tourists unfortunate enough to end up as victims of crime, an initiative in this area is the establishment of the Dublin Tourist Victim Support Service which was launched on 14 April, 1994 and which is being operated by the Irish Association for Victim Support, IAVS. This new concept is modelled on the existing Amsterdam Tourist Assistance Service and provides tourists who have been the victims of crime with a practical support service in order to assist them in overcoming the initial trauma of their experiences.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána has been involved in the setting up of this service and has provided premises for its operation at the Garda Dublin Metropolitan Area Headquarters at Harcourt Square. A grant is provided by the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  A co-ordinator with a victim support background has been appointed to head the team of volunteers who possess a wide range of foreign languages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> All volunteers have received extensive training to allow them to deal effectively with tourists who become victims of crime while on holiday in Ireland.  I know that this service will prove to be of immense benefit to any visitors to this country who may suffer the misfortune of becoming victims of criminal activity.</P>

      <P>It should be borne in mind that most of the proceedings instituted under the Misuse of Drugs Acts are non-indictable. In this regard, non-indictable proceedings were taken in 4,498 cases under the Misuse of Drugs Acts in 1994. It is further noted that convictions were obtained in 3,064 cases during the year. The total number of persons charged with possession and/or supply of controlled drugs in 1994 was 4,053.</P>

      <P>Recruitment to the Garda Síochána is governed by the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointment) Regulation, 1987.  Regulation 5 (D) of these regulations prohibit the Commissioner from admitting as a trainee garda, a person unless s/he has obtained a grade not lower than D in at least five subjects, (including English, Irish and mathematics), in the leaving certificate examination of the Department of Education or in another examination which in the opinion of the Minister is of a standard not lower than the standard of that examination.  These regulations gave effect to the recommendations made by a Garda Training Committee set up in January 1985 under the chairmanship of Dr. Thomas Walsh.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner is of the view that this is the minimum acceptable standard of education for entry, having regard to the varied, complex and intricate course of studies required to be undertaken by trainee gardaí and to the diverse nature of their duties as operational police officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Candidates applying for entry to the Garda Síochána must be between the ages of 18 and 26 years.  This to a certain <Col N="627" /> extent allows for the entry of a more mature person and with the equivalent qualification to the leaving certificate provides scope for persons who have not the leaving certificate qualification to secure other qualifications to gain eligibility to Garda recruitment competitions. For the information of the Deputy the qualifications include: matriculation of a university, a general certificate of education (advanced level), NCEA national certificate and NCEA national diploma.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 31 together.  In the interests of fairness to the Garda Commissioner and everybody else concerned, I think it is necessary to begin by reiterating certain facts which were contained in a statement which I issued on this matter on 14 July last, following reports on the matter which had been carried in the media on that day.  The statement was to the effect that on 31 May, the committee forwarded a letter to me in the following terms:</P>
      <P>The Joint Committee, at its meeting on 16 May, decided that it should be briefed on the problems associated with drug taking in second level schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="628" /> To this end, I would appreciate if you would extend an invitation to the Garda Commissioner to attend a public session of the Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>The letter having been transmitted from my office for attention within the Department was then mislaid.  I have, incidentally, apologised to the committee for any inconvenience caused in this regard.</P>
    <P>My Department received a reminder from the committee on 5 July, made its initial contact with Garda Headquarters on the 10th and faxed a reply to the committee on 11 July, which was in terms agreed by the Garda Commissioner and signed by my private secretary. That letter was as follows:</P>
    <P>I am directed by the Minister for Justice, Mrs. Nora Owen, T.D., to refer to your letter of 31 May.</P>
    <P>The Minister passed your invitation to the Garda Commissioner who has informed her that the issue you wish to discuss is relevant to the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The role of the Garda with regard to secondary schools relates to talking to the students in relation to drugs generally.  For this reason the Commissioner suggests that the Department of Education would be more relevant to the work of your Committee.</P>
    <P>He would be happy to assist your Committee and considers it more appropriate to provide a written briefing to your Committee on the aspects that concern the Garda on this issue.  This would be more desirable than his attendance at a public session of the committee.  Accordingly, if you could prepare, on behalf of the Committee, a list of the questions to which answers are required, the Minister will be glad to transmit it to the Commissioner, for the preparation of the answers to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="629" /> Neither the Commissioner nor I had any knowledge, in advance of the Dáil Committee meeting on 13 July, that the proposal contained in my letter was unsatisfactory from the committee's point of view.</P>
    <P>I received a letter from the committee on 13 July seeking the Commissioner's attendance and requesting that: &ldquo;... the Minister ask the Commissioner to confirm his attendance&rdquo; at its meeting scheduled for 27 July.  That letter was forwarded immediately to the Garda Commissioner.  I was advised by the Garda Commissioner that he might be unable to attend the meeting set for 27 July, due to a prior commitment, and I requested him, therefore, to confirm that he would attend a public meeting of the committee either on the date indicated or on such other date as may be mutually agreed between him and the Joint Committee.</P>
    <P>There was subsequent correspondence between the committee and the Garda Commissioner and the present position is that the Commissioner has prepared a briefing document for the committee and has confirmed the attendance of a senior Garda officer invited by name to attend a joint meeting of the Joint Committee on the Family and the Select Committee on Legislation and Security which is due to be held on 12 October, 1995.  I have also accepted an invitation to attend.</P>
    <P>The matters raised by the invitation extended to the Commissioner were discussed between the Commissioner and myself in July, 1995, and he outlined to me at that time his dilemma regarding the role of the Commissioner and his anxiety to fulfil that role as well as cooperate with the committee.</P>

      <P>Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, which came into operation in November 1993, contains provisions for co-operation among member states in regard to certain matters in the justice area, including unlawful drug trafficking. An example of this new co-operation was the establishment of the EUROPOL drugs unit in 1994.  The unit is charged with the essential mission of exchanging and co-ordinating drugs intelligence in the European Union.</P>
      <P>Ireland's fight against drug trafficking has been substantially strengthened by our participation in the EUROPOL drugs unit: a liaison officer from the Garda Síochána is serving with the unit. I will continue to monitor whether we should increase our personnel there. Some of the seizures of drugs by our law enforcement agencies have been facilitated by our participation in the work of the EUROPOL drugs unit.  The recent signing of the EUROPOL Convention by all member states will enhance the individual and collective anti-drug trafficking strategies of member states even further.  Further progress on establishing EUROPOL is hoped for during the coming year.</P>
      <P>As far as financial assistance is concerned, ECU 1,800,000 has been made available from the general budget of the EU in 1995 for police co-operation measures under Title VI.  My Department has submitted a project for funding from that allocation which would involve the exchange of operational police personnel involved in drug trafficking between a number of member states.  No decision by the EU Commission on the application has been made yet.</P>

      <P>I should say at the outset that so called &ldquo;ram-raids&rdquo;, and I take it that by this term the Deputy is referring to incidents where criminals use high-powered motor vehicles to break down and smash the shutters and windows of premises, are committed more frequently outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area than within it.  However, experience has shown that the perpetrators of such crimes are usually from Dublin and the vehicles used in the raids are stolen there.  It should also be borne in mind that in many incidents, criminals travel to and from scenes of crime in stolen vehicles but do not actually use the vehicles to force entry onto the premises concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to deal with such incidents, the gardaí have introduced random special patrols on primary and secondary roads used by the criminals.  In addition, intelligence gathering concerning the activities of persons suspected of involvement in such incidents has been enhanced and this is yielding positive results.  Furthermore, many Garda mobile units in the Dublin Metropolitan Area Divisions which adjoin the &ldquo;country&rdquo; divisions are equipped with national emergency radio sets which permit direct communication with patrol cars from outside Dublin.  This is <Col N="634" /> also proving to be of benefit in combating crimes of this nature.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41, 43 and 110 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My commitment to tackling the problem of illegal drugs in the prisons is a <Col N="636" /> matter of record in this House and elsewhere. I have already taken action on several fronts and further measures &mdash; some of which are in themselves of a radical and innovative nature &mdash; are at an advanced stage of planning.</P>
    <P>I want to begin by stressing that suggestions that the problem of illegal drugs in the prisons can be solved overnight by measures such as an energetic security clampdown or the provision of methadone maintenance, which I will refer to later, are simply not credible. The problem is much more complex than that.</P>
    <P>Recent action which I have personally approved in respect of Mountjoy prison includes the opening last June, of a special search room in the prison and the upgrading of the closed circuit video monitoring equipment for the supervision of visits.  In prisons other than Mountjoy special new measures are also being taken to tackle the drugs problem. For instance in Cork prison, the special netting which has been erected over the main exercise yard has closed off the main route for smuggling drugs into that prison.</P>
    <P>The importance of education in tackling this problem cannot be overstated. The comprehensive drugs education programme for prisoners, which is currently in place, is widely recognised as being of the very highest standard. Indeed the specially commissioned video which is a cornerstone of the programme has recently won an international short film award.</P>
    <P>As I outlined in my reply to a Dáil Question on 8 June last, I am examining proposals for the treatment of drug addicts in prison which include: the establishment of a secure drug free unit; the provision of methadone maintenance for those prisoners assessed as suitable for same.</P>
    <P>As part of the drugs package approved by Government in July, I will be reporting back to Government on my proposals shortly.  I have appointed a high level project team in my Department to oversee the planning of these measures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 118 together.</P>
      <P>It is standard practice to grant a request by persons in prison custody to meet with an official of my Department to discuss any issue of concern to that person.  However, no such request can be granted under threat of prison protest action, including hunger strike.</P>
      <P>In the case of the hunger strike referred to by Deputies Keogh and O'Malley, the core issue was whether INLA prisoners should, in principle, be able to qualify for compassionate parole concessions, on the basis that they had adhered to a policy of non-violence since the cessation of violence by the Provisional IRA was declared.  My Department became aware that it was the wish of the protesting prisoners that discussions about possible concessions for them should take place through the IRSP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the evening of 29 August, 1995 discussions took place between officials of my Department and a representative of the IRSP, through an intermediary, to clarify all the issues surrounding this hunger strike.  It was made clear, during the course of those discussions, that Department officials would have no difficulty in meeting with spokespersons for the prisoners, whether those spokespersons were inside prison or outside, but that no such meeting could take place until the hunger strike had ended. It was further indicated that a meeting could take place once the Governor of <Col N="638" /> the prison confirmed that the protest had actually come to an end.</P>
    <P>The hunger strike ended on 30 August, 1995 and, following confirmation by the Governor of its ending, the way was cleared for discussions between officials of my Department and representatives of the IRSP regarding the peace process and matters concerning Republican Socialist Movement prisoners.  Those discussions took place, in line with what had been agreed the previous evening.</P>
    <P>The assessment of the outcome of 30 August meeting is nearing completion.  I am, however, reasonably confident that the matters of concern to the Government have been sufficiently clarified to allow the RSM prisoners in Portlaoise prison to qualify, in principle, for short-term compassionate parole concessions, in certain circumstances, with each application being judged on its own merits.</P>
    <P>Finally, I believe a word of tribute is due to those, including Deputies who managed to bring this potentially very serious situation to a satisfactory conclusion. I am sure that Deputies will have no difficulty in agreeing with me on this.</P>

      <P>The law on the matter is as follows.  Regulation 5 of the Garda Síochána (Admission and Appointments) Regulations 1988, specifies that the Commissioner shall not admit a person as a trainee unless, <i>inter alia,</i> if a male, he be not less that five feet nine inches in height and built in proportion and, if a woman, not less than 5 feet 5 inches in height.  This height differential between the sexes is permitted by section 5 of the European Communities (Employment Equality) Regulations, 1985 which amends section 17 of the Employment Equality Act, 1977 by the insertion of section 17B (1) (A) which provides that: Orders, Regulations, Rules, Directions, Instructions, Arrangements or Schemes to which that section applies shall not treat men and women differently except <i>inter alia</i>, as to requirements relating to height. Section 17B (2) (a) of that Act applies this provision to the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>I trust the Deputy would agree that equality considerations do not require that the physical requirements for a job must be identical for men and women. They require the elimination of unjustified discrimination as between men and women.  The different height requirements for men and women in the Garda Síochána, which arise from the particular nature of the employment, are not contrary to equality law.</P>

      <P>Regarding prison places, my Department is currently examining the question of optimising the use of existing accommodation and of providing additional prison places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Decisions to grant temporary release from prison have for many years now <Col N="643" /> been influenced by pressure on accommodation. The overriding concern, however, when decisions are being made in individual cases is the safety of the public.  Early releases are largely granted &mdash; and have been granted by successive Ministers &mdash; to offenders serving relatively short sentences, or who are near the end of longer sentences.</P>
    <P>In many cases offenders are granted temporary release for positive humanitarian and resocialisation reasons.  These include occasions such as illness of near relatives, bereavements, employment interviews, or to help with the resocialisation programmes in the case of longer-term offenders.  The case for granting such releases &mdash; all of which are subject to conditions &mdash; would stand, even if there were a surplus of prison accommodation available.</P>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to the document <i>The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan</i> which was published last year.  Chapter 5 of the plan contains a review of the current temporary release arrangements together with a number of specific proposals for the future.</P>

      <P>The payment of excise duty on cigarettes by means of tax stamps came into effect on 4 September and, from that date, all packs of cigarettes produced in or imported into the State and put up for retail sale must have a tax stamp affixed.</P>
      <P>To allow time, however, for stocks of unstamped cigarettes to clear through the retail system, the legal provision making it an offence to offer unstamped packs of cigarettes for sale or delivery will not come into operation until March of next year.</P>
      <P>When brought fully into effect, section 74 of the Finance Act, 1994 will make it an offence to offer for sale or delivery in the State cigarettes, otherwise than in a pack to which a tax stamp, on which duty at the appropriate rate has been paid, is affixed.  The cigarettes in such cases will be liable to forfeiture and the persons concerned will be liable to a penalty of £1,000 in respect of each offence.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the introduction of tax stamps will greatly strengthen the power of Revenue staff in the detection and prosecution of offenders including street sellers.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The responsibility for ensuring the adequacy of general practitioner services for medical card holders rests with the chief executive officer of the relevant health board.</P>
      <P>The appointment of general practitioners to posts in the GMS scheme forms part of an agreement reached with the Irish Medical Organisation on the terms and conditions for the provision of a general practitioner service to eligible persons.  The decision to fill a vacancy or create a new post in the scheme is a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board following consultation with the organisation.</P>
      <P>In making a decision on the filling of a vacancy or the creation of a new post within the scheme, the agreement requires the chief executive officer to take the following considerations into account:</P>
      <P>(a)&nbsp; the provision of a proper level of access to general practitioner services for medical card patients;</P>
      <P>(b)&nbsp; that patients have a reasonable degree of choice in selecting their practitioner and</P>
      <P>(c)&nbsp; that due regard is given to the question of the viability of general practices in the area in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1985 there has been an increase in the number of doctors providing services to medical card holders from 1,486 in December 1985 to 1,657 at the end <Col N="650" /> of June 1995.  In that period the average number of patients on each doctor's panel has decreased from 877 to 776, an average reduction of over 100 patients per panel.</P>
    <P>These figures do not indicate that there has been any diminution in the level of general practitioner cover for medical card patients.  However, if the Deputy is aware of and wishes to provide me with details regarding difficulties in the provision of general practitioner cover under the scheme in a particular area, I will certainly have the matter investigated with the relevant health board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Methadone maintenance is an internationally recognised treatment option as a means of reducing the risk of spreading HIV from contaminated needles and of stabilising the behaviour of intravenous drug misusers. The majority of drug misusers reside in the Eastern Health Board, which is engaged in expanding its range of treatment services in order to cope with the demand for these services.  At present methadone maintenance is provided to drug misusers through satellite clinics at Baggot Street, Amiens Street and Ballyfermot and also at the Drug Treatment Centre, Pearse Street.  I am aware that there are waiting lists for treatment at each of these centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Plans are in progress to open two further satellite clinics before the end of the year.  In the light of these developments the board will be keeping the situation under continuous review to <Col N="651" /> ensure that it is in a position to respond to needs as they emerge.  As part of this response the board will be keeping a number of options for delivery of services under consideration.  The introduction of a mobile methadone clinic may arise in that context.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the recommendations of the report on the establishment of a protocol on prescribing of methadone which was published in 1993 is at an advanced stage.  Most of the recommendations have been adopted. At present over 450 people are prescribed methadone by their general practitioners.  Consultations are also in progress with appropriate professional bodies for general practitioners and pharmacists with a view to increasing the number of general practitioners and pharmacists involved in providing services for drug misusers.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The long-term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain specified illness to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of the particular illnesses.  This scheme has not been extended since 1975 and there are no plans to extend the scheme to include asthma.</P>
      <P>The long-term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with on-going medical conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses &mdash; general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc. &mdash; due to a long-term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member on a personal basis.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief <Col N="653" /> executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    <P>Persons who suffer from an on-going medical condition can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or long-term illness book and are certified as having a long-term medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32.</P>
    <P>Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
    <P>Under the drug refund scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from conditions such as asthma.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Aiseirí, Cahir, County Tipperary is a private residential facility which provides treatment for persons suffering from alcohol and other substance misuse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report on the development of the psychiatric services, <i>Planning for the Future,</i> which was published in 1984 and which has been accepted by successive Governments, recommended that the emphasis on the management of alcohol and other chemical dependency problems should be on community-based intervention.  In line with this recommendation, health boards, including the South-Eastern Health Board, are developing comprehensive community-based addiction treatment services and are considering ways in which services provided by voluntary and/or private facilities might integrate with health board services.  In the South-Eastern <Col N="655" /> Health Board area, residential treatment for persons suffering from alcohol and other substance misuse who have special needs is available at the board's psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>Treatment services for addiction, both in the community and in hospital, are provided by health boards as part of the mental health services, not the general medical services.  The board's services are available to all those who require them, irrespective of income. For this reason it would not be appropriate to include the treatment of addiction in any private centre within the general medical service scheme.</P>
    <P>However, the South-Eastern Health Board recognises the contribution of Aiseirí to the treatment of persons from <Col N="656" /> its functional area with alcohol problems and provide financial support to the centre.  The board provides a grant of £20,000 per annum subject to the centre's accounts being available for examination.  The board also purchased a house in Wexford which it has leased to Aiseirí and has made a grant of £15,000 available to carry out essential repairs/refurbishment to the premises.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>The leaflet, which is the subject matter of this question was prepared for a number of reasons as follows. First, my Department receives numerous requests for information about the law and support services in relation to aspects of marriage breakdown and for information about divorce. Second, I am aware that many interest groups are constantly in need of information of that kind for their members and for the members of the public which they serve.  Third, it has been clear from many public meetings which I have attended that there is a demand from the public to be informed about the legal and administrative provisions which address the problems of marriage breakdown.  The leaflet was prepared against that background and it has been distributed widely on that basis.</P>
      <P>The leaflet contains information only and I am unable to agree that it engages in advocacy of a particular position on divorce.  A total of 19,000 copies of the leaflet have been printed of which 1,000 copies are in the Irish language.  The cost of producing the total number of copies was £2,136.</P>

      <P>In relation to the stance taken by the national delegation at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 110 on 20 September.</P>
      <P>The commitments entered into by Ireland, as detailed in my speech to the Plenary session of the Conference on 6 September are as follows:</P>
      <P>Aim to ensure that women constitute at least 40 per cent of the membership of State boards.</P>
      <P>Strengthen and extend the scope of employment equality legislation and outlaw discrimination in non-employment areas on grounds of gender, marital and parental status and on other grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Follow through on the process of consultation with women's organisations and bodies responsible for the health of women concerning a discussion document, published by the Minister for Health, which reviews the health status of Irish women and <Col N="688" /> examines how the health services can better meet their needs and prepare a plan.</P>
    <P>Implement a policy to develop a comprehensive family planning service within the public health system.</P>
    <P>In the education system, provide for equal participation by females in all areas of the curriculum.</P>
    <P>Provide that, at third level, each education institution will have to develop and publish a policy promotiong gender equality.</P>
    <P>Increase Ireland's official ODA by 0.05 per cent points of GDP each year in order to achieve the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GDP.</P>
    <P>Implement the 20/20 concept as included in the Copenhagen Programme.</P>
    <P>Provide for appropriate involvement of Irish NGOs in the implementation of the Platform to be agreed at this Conference.</P>
    <P>Continue to mainstream gender in Irish aid programmes.</P>
    <P>Enact legislation to extend further protection for women and children in situations of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>The total number of Ministers and officials on the delegations was 18.  In addition, the Oireachtas was represented by four parliamentarians accompanied by two committee clerks and there were seven non-governmental representatives.  The cost of the eight members of the delegation funded by my Department was approximately £34,500.  In addition, grants totalling a maximum of £24,200 were given by my Department to NGOs to assist them to attend the Conference and/or the NGO Forum.  Details of costs incurred in respect of other members of the delegation should be sought from the relevant Ministers.</P>
    <P>I am very happy with the contribution made by the Irish delegation during the negotiations.  In particular, I am pleased <Col N="689" /> that the Irish delegation was able to make valuable contributions to achieving agreement on contentious issues, especially in the final days of the conference, when Ireland was represented on a high-level group dealing with the most difficult subjects.</P>
    <P>In the coming months I will be implementing measures to follow-up on the Platform for Action agreed at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women.  When the final version of the document becomes available from the UN it will be circulated to all Government Departments and will also be available to non-governmental organisations and the public generally.</P>

      <P>It is advisable that cycle helmets should always be worn while cycling. I consider, however, that the wearing of helmets is better encouraged by way of educational and publicity campaigns such as those undertaken by the National Safety Council.  The activities of the Council in this area include the distribution of leaflets and posters and the provision of advice in schools by road safety officers.  The Rules of the Road booklet also encourages the use of cycle helmets and draws attention to their safety benefits.  I am satisfied that legislation to require the wearing of cycle helmets would not be appropriate, with consequent prosecutions and penalties for contravention particularly in the case of minors.</P>

      <P>The strategy document <i>Recycling for Ireland</i> undertook that the Government would, <i>inter alia,</i> continue and intensify the promotion of public awareness on recycling issues, in cooperation with local authorities and industry.  Measures have been, and will continue to be, taken in line with this policy.</P>
      <P>Priority is however being given at present, as envisaged in <i>Recycling for Ireland,</i> to the development of recycling infrastructure, in terms both of collection and processing facilities.  An industry task force is completing proposals which I expect to receive shortly, for an industry-led recycling initiative.  Appropriate publicity will be mobilised as this and other initiatives are developed.  As regards publicity for waste management more generally, I refer to the policy statement on waste management issued in conjunction with the Waste Bill, 1995.</P>

    <P>My Department's involvement relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure in the payment of individual grants.  The amounts recouped in 1993, 1994 and up <Col N="699" /> to 31 August 1995 to each local authority are set out in the following tables. The Department's statistics relating to <Col N="700" /> the schemes do not include specific information on cases where recoupments were disallowed but there have been relatively few such cases.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 and 85 together.  The disabled persons and essential repairs grants schemes are administered by local authorities in accordance with the Housing (Disabled Persons and Essential Repairs Grants) Regulations, 1993 and, subject to these regulations, it is a matter for each authority to determine whether a grant can be paid in an individual case.</P>
      <P>Essential repairs grants are payable for houses which cannot be made fit for human habitation in all respects at a reasonable cost in circumstances where, with the carrying out of the essential repairs, the house can continue to meet short term accommodation needs. Accordingly, the regulations restrict the payment of essential repairs grants to houses where there would be no continuing need for housing provided by the local authority in the vicinity of the house to be improved.  There is no similar restriction in relation to disabled persons grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to compliance with the requirements of the regulations, authorities may pay essential repairs grants in respect of houses in rural villages. The payment of essential repairs grants in respect of houses to meet family-type <Col N="703" /> needs would generally be precluded by the regulations by virtue of the fact that a continuing need for housing would exist.  However, it would be open to an authority to consider the use of the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 89, 97, 98, 99 and 100 together.</P>
      <P>Discussions are continuing between my Department and the Departments of Health and Justice in regard to the provision of accommodation for young offenders, including accommodation at the special schools for young offenders at Lusk, County Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the concerns of the Lusk Community Council in relation to security in the area.  Indeed, Minister of State, Austin Currie, and I met with <Col N="706" /> representatives of the council on 18 July 1995 to discuss the council's concerns.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the council, I view its concerns with the utmost seriousness. Security arrangements at the centres in question are kept under constant review.  At present, a Campus Review Committee is conducting a major review of security issues at the Lusk site.  This committee is comprised of management and staff representatives of the three centres on the campus.</P>
    <P>Officials of my Department will be meeting with local management this week to review progress on various measures to address the problems referred to by the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Lonergan report was a confidential security audit on Trinity House School, Lusk, conducted by Mr. John Lonergan, Governor, Portlaoise Prison at the request of the Department of Justice. The report was completed in June 1991.  Given the nature of the report, I would not consider it appropriate that it be made publicly available.</P>
    <P>I attach a list of the counties of origin of children currently in the Special Schools for Young Offenders at Lusk, County Dublin.  The Deputy will appreciate that the details in question can very from week to week, particularly where children placed on short term remand are concerned.  However, as a general rule, the majority of placements relate to children from the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Given the uncertainty surrounding demand for places for children from outside the Dublin area; the relatively small numbers likely to be involved; and the very high cost associated with any such development, I have no plans at present to extend provision in the young offender area beyond the locations already mentioned.</P>

      <P>The centre to which the Deputy refers was originally planned for development on a part of the site at Finglas which currently houses the Finglas Children's Centre.</P>
      <P>In 1992, the then Minister for Education directed that a review be conducted into the original choice of site and that consideration be given to possible alternatives.</P>
      <P>This review concluded that the site originally selected was unsuitable having regard to the scale of existing operations at the Finglas Children's Centre and the relatively small area available for the new development.</P>
      <P>Following consideration of a range of alternative options, it was concluded that the proposed new facility for juvenile female offenders should be located at Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin where the existing Oberstown Girls' Centre is located.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The report of the Special Education Review Committee made a number of recommendations concerning additional teaching resources in order to assist children with special needs who attend ordinary primary schools.  These recommendations include the weighting of pupils according to category of disability in the context of support-teacher allocation.  The recommended weighting ratios range from 0.75 pupil equivalents in the case of a pupil in need of remedial teaching to five pupil equivalents in the case of a profoundly deaf pupil.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, as part of my Department's ongoing response to the need for additional support teachers, I allocated a further ten resource teacher posts to the primary sector with effect from September 1995.  This brings the total number of such posts in place to 36.  This allocation is in addition to the 55 remedial teacher posts allocated for the 1995-96 school year.  There are now 1,188 remedial teacher posts in the primary sector.  In keeping with the Government's commitment for increased access to remedial education, I will continue to review needs in this area and consider how best these needs can be addressed within available resources.</P>
      <P>The Special Education Review Committee also recommended that the capitation grant for children with special needs should be the same whether the pupils attend an ordinary primary school, a special class or a special school.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to be as positive as possible in relation to its recommendations and to implement them as quickly as resources permit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The higher education grants scheme 1995 states that in cases where the candidate's parents are legally separated, the reckonable income shall be that of the parent with whom the candidate resides; it shall also be that of the parent with whom the candidate resides where that parent is not legally separated but <Col N="725" /> where it can be established by the local authority in accordance with other criteria specified for the purpose by my Department that the parent is separated. These criteria are that the parent must present a current deserted wife's benefit book or a current lone parent's allowance book or a maintenance agreement/order or an affidavit sworn before a Commissioner for Oaths that she/he is separated.  It is a matter for local authorities to investigate and take appropriate action in cases where irregularities are suspected.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's attention is drawn to the provision in the higher education grants scheme 1995 which stipulates that, if an applicant's failure to provide full and complete information is the result of a deliberate material omission or inaccuracy, the applicant will be liable to prosecution, loss of grant and repayment, with interest, of any portion of a grant already received.</P>

I am informed by them that the position of <Col N="727" /> sergeant at the Garda station in question is vacant since the retirement of the former sergeant there on 2 September 1991.  There are two gardaí attached to the station at present.  In addition, one of the sergeants based at Westport has responsibility for supervision in administration and operational matters at Newport and they report that this arrangement is proving satisfactory to date.</P>
      <P>An official vehicle allocated to Westport is shared by the members attached to Newport and Louisburg stations for the purpose of patrolling both subdistricts. In addition the traffic corp unit based at Castlebar together with the detective units at both Westport and Castlebar frequently patrol the Newport area.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are aware of a number of late night incidents which have occurred in the town but they are satisfied that such incidents are being dealt with effectively by the local gardaí. I understand from the Garda authorities that they are satisfied that the present strength and resources are adequate to meet the policing needs of the area and they have no plans at present to alter these.</P>

The remainder were committed on remand or for trial.  Of this number, 872 were subsequently transferred to other institutions and 56 were given full temporary release, after serving a portion of their sentence, in 1993 from St. Patrick's Institution.  Seventy-nine were still in custody on 31 December 1993.  Information regarding the final disposition of these 79 prisoners in 1994 is not yet available.

Crime in the area is relatively low with 15 crimes reported in 1994.  The Garda authorities have also informed me that the last attack on an elderly person in the Ballymacarbery area occurred over ten years ago.  The Ballymacarbery area now has two community alert schemes which I understand are operating successfully.

      <P>I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that the registration referred to by the Deputy involves property vested on foot of two Land Commission schedules. The schedules in question were lodged in the Land Registry in 1989.  In the case of such schedules, the property is deemed to be registered as of date of vesting by the Land Commission.  Registration of these schedules in the Land Registry is thus, of necessity, afforded a lower priority than the registration of dealings.  Where a specific need arises which requires that registration of a schedule be completed, e.g. where a further transaction affecting the property in question arises, then the Land Registry endeavour, as far as possible, to expedite such cases.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that it is their practice, when major football matches are played at Croke Park, to implement a traffic plan for Balbriggan to cater for the extraordinarily heavy traffic heading south before the match and returning north after the match.  This can entail setting up diversionary routes, or, on occasions, switching off some of the pedestrian lights in the town temporarily to accommodate the pre and post match rush periods. This practice is also adopted in other locations throughout the country for the same reasons.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Attorney General that the information sought in the Deputy's question, other than on the issue of whether there is normally a written record of contracts between the RUC and the Garda on extradition cases, has been the subject of a request to the Chief State Solicitor by the legal representatives of the victims of Fr. Brendan Smyth in the context of pending legislation initiated against the State and is, therefore, <i>sub judice.</i></P>
      <P>The position in regard to whether there is normally a written record of inter-force contacts is that I am informed by the Garda authorities that normally no written record is kept of contacts of the sort referred to in the question.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that the correspondence in question has been replied to by the Chief State Solicitor.</P>

      <P>The Dublin metropolitan area is policed under the direction of an assistant commissioner who is based at Harcourt Square.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are 3,992 gardaí allocated to the DMA at present.  This number is reviewed periodically by the Garda authorities to ensure maximum service to the public.</P>
      <P>As an indication of the Garda authorities particular resolve to tackle crimes of rape and sexual assault, they established the domestic violence and sexual assault investigation unit in March 1993.  This unit is staffed by gardaí who are highly trained and experienced in dealing with domestic violence and sexual assaults.  The functions of the unit include overseeing the investigation of offences of domestic violence, child sexual abuse and other violent and sexual offences committed against women and children.  Enforcement practices in respect of protection and barring orders are also carefully examined.  The unit works in close contact with the Garda community relations section and liaises with organisations, both statutory and voluntary, which deal with violent and sexual crimes against women and children.</P>

I am informed by the Garda authorities that to obtain the information requested requires a considerable amount of Garda time and resources and it is being compiled at present.  I will convey it to the Deputy once it is to hand.  It should be noted that statistics like this will be more readily available in future years once the information technology programme is fully in place.</P>

I have been informed by them that since the Garda Síochána Corporate Strategy Policy Document (1993-1997) was drawn up the Garda authorities are evaluating methods for allocation and deployment of human resources throughout the State.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that a human resource allocation model is at present being piloted in four divisions within the country. This model identifies and quantifies the workloads which apply to the Garda Síochána and applies these measures so as to ensure that the allocation of personnel is the most equitable that can be achieved.</P>
      <P>I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the population statistics based on the 1991 census are being used for this model as population statistics for 1995 are not available.</P>

      <P>Details of the number of EU and non-EU nationals who are originally entered the country as <i>au pairs</i> and are now in receipt of assistance and rent allowance is not available.</P>
      <P>The legislation governing entitlement to unemployment assistance requires that applicants be capable of, available for and genuinely seeking employment.</P>
      <P>To be considered available for employment in Ireland, deciding officers would normally take the view that non-Irish applicants for unemployment assistance must show that they have a legal right to reside in Ireland and that there is no prohibition as part of the residency conditions from taking up employment in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Nationals of EU member states are entitled to come and seek employment in Ireland under the provisions governing the freedom of movement of workers within the EU.  Accordingly, where a national of an EU member state having being employed, or self-employed, in Ireland becomes unemployed, he/she is entitled to claim unemployment assistance.</P>
      <P>With regard to the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, section 171 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993, provides for the payment of SWA, including rent supplements, to &ldquo;every person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet his needs and the needs of any adult or child dependant.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The administration and day-to-day management of the SWA scheme has been devolved to eight regional health boards and my Department has no function in deciding entitlement in individual cases.  A statistical system has been in use for some years in the health boards which enables financial records to be maintained.  There is, however, no separate code which records a person's nationality or previous occupation.</P>

      <P>Workplace temperature is governed by the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Applications) Regulations, 1993, (S.I. No. 44 of 1993) which are made under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, and which, <i>inter alia,</i> implement EU Council Directive 89/654/EEC of 30 November 1989, concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the workplace.  The regulations require that during working hours the temperature in rooms containing work stations shall be adequate for human beings, having regard to the working methods used and the physical demands placed on employees.</P>
      <P>The regulations further require that in workplaces used for the first time after 31 December 1992 or which undergo modifications, extensions or conversions after that date, windows, skylights and glass partitions shall allow excessive effects of sunlight to be avoided, having regard to the nature of the work and of the place of work.</P>
      <P>Although the regulations do not specify maximum or minimum temperatures, I am informed that the National Authority for Occupational Safety and Health, which is responsible for their enforcement, advises employers and workers about the temperatures that would be considered appropriate to particular work activities and circumstances and the control measures which may be necessary.</P>
      <P>The authority is currently preparing guidelines to assist employers in complying with the regulations.  The authority expects to publish these guidelines in the near future.</P>

      <P>Following consideration of the report of the Efficiency Audit Group (EAG) on its review of the Defence Forces, the Government accepted in principle the conclusions of the group that there was a need for major reform in the structure and organisation of the Defence Forces. The Government decided to establish an Implementation Group to draw up a detailed and fully costed plan to give effect to the general thrust of the EAG's report.  This plan will be the first stage of a phased programme of implementation of the EAG's broad recommendations and its objective will be the reorganisation of the Defence Forces based on a three brigade structure, with a manpower level of around 11,500.</P>
      <P>The Government has published a document based on the EAG recommendations which summarises its response to these reports.  Based on the Government's decision, the Implementation Group will be reporting later this year and when the Government has considered the proposed implementation plan, it will then be decided how best to proceed.  The House will be kept fully informed of developments.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not readily available in the format requested.  I have asked the Central Fisheries Board to compile the information being sought.  This will entail contacting each regional fisheries board for a breakdown of catches of sea trout as requested by the Deputy.  As soon as the information is obtained from the central board I will gladly forward it to the Deputy.</P>

    <P>The Deputy will be aware that a review of national salmon management policy is under way in accordance with <Col N="765" /> the guidelines outlined on 29 June 1995. The existing regulatory framework for commercial salmon fishing is being assessed in the context of developing the practical long-term strategies for salmon management necessary to achieve the overall policy objectives.</P>

      <P>Howth is a working fishery harbour with a large community of leisure users accommodated in it and sharing its facilities.  The pier is a working area and part of the protective structure forming the harbour.  Fingal County Council, in succession to Dublin County Council, own the seats on the east pier under licence from the Department of the Marine.  The county council is responsible for their maintenance.</P>
      <P>There are no funds available at the moment to undertake the works of the nature suggested by the Deputy, Nevertheless, I am conscious of the need to provide adequate facilities for visitors to the harbour and am examining the possibility of identifying other sources of funding.</P>

      <P>Tawin Island, County Galway, is one of four priority locations identified by Galway County Council for possible inclusion in the Department of the Marine's programme of works to be undertaken over the next few years.  The other priority locations identified by the council are Gurteen Beach at Roundstone. Inishboffin Island and Inishmore Island.</P>
      <P>The council's proposals and the proposals submitted by the other coastal local authorities have been examined and the projects to be grant aided during 1995 have been decided.  Among those to be aided are Inishboffin Island, where a 75 per cent grant is being provided for a £100,000 scheme of gabion protection to the public roadway and undertaker services.  A further 75 per cent grant is being provided for a £75,000 sea wall protection scheme to prevent the erosion of access to Gurteen Beach at Roundstone.  Works at Tawin Island and Inishmore Island are not being grant aided during 1995.  These locations will be considered further, along with the other priority proposals submitted, during 1996 and subsequent years.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind the House that receipt of priority proposals from a local authority is no guarantee that any of their proposals will be undertaken or aided by the Department.</P>
