      <P>Does the Government intend to bring forward the necessary legislation to arrest the epidemic of drug related crime?  This morning's Garda Síochána report confirms what all Members are already aware of, that there is a drug crisis in every town and village.  The bigger the location the worse the problem is.  What legislative <Col N="662" /> proposals does the The Taoiseach plan to bring forward in this session to deal with the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ahern has received a copy of the Government's legislative programme so he already knows the answer to the question he asked.  The Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill is part of the Government's legislative programme and it is expected that it will be published this session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach knows, he rarely sticks with that document. He only covered about 10 per cent of the legislative programme in the last session so I had to ask the question. Will the Taoiseach support the recent call by this party for a national drugs forum to bring together various groups who have a positive input to make, such as the churches, educationalists and the Garda Síochána, to try to deal with the drugs problem?  The Taoiseach must admit that the drugs problem is getting out of control all over the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all the more reason it should be dealt with in a proper fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will be aware that the drugs problem is a very serious one affecting many families, one does not know where it will strike next. It is a problem with two dimensions. There is the supply dimension on which, obviously, our criminal justice authorities must act forcefully.  I have been seeking closer co-operation on EU policies to restrict supply.  The other side of the problem is that of demand, where individual decisions are made by young <Col N="663" /> people, on their own responsibility, to use drugs.  These decisions are fundamentally mistaken on their part, and everything must be done to deal with that issue.</P>
      <P>Heroin addiction is particularly marked in parts of Dublin where there is a problem of social deprivation and social exclusion.  Measures must be taken in the area of community development to improve life in those areas and to improve tenants' control to prevent drug pushers from entering such areas.  This is a comprehensive programme requiring multi-disciplinary and multi-departmental action across the board.  This Government is giving a very high priority to it.  We have already had a special meeting with all the relevant authorities on the subject and we will continue to deal with this matter.</P>
      <P>This is a social issue for which every individual has a responsibility.  It is not a problem that can be projected on any external authority.  Every individual has a responsibility to dissuade the creation of a drugs culture in our society and in Europe generally.  It is an issue on which we intend to give political leadership. We hope that we will be supported by every individual and every community in the battle against drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister for Finance took the Order of Business here two weeks ago he said the Government was examining legislation on child sexual abuse.  Does the Government intend to publish legislation in relation to the mandatory reporting of child sex abuse cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that existing legislation is adequate to deal with the matter.  As the Deputy knows, legislation on court procedures in this area was introduced and passed into law.  If there are any identifiable lacunae in the legislation, they will be filled.  However, as of now there is no specific promise in this area to which I can refer in answer to the Deputy's question.  I assure the House that if any problem is identified in the area of child sexual abuse which requires legislative action, that action will be taken as a matter of priority.  My understanding is that there is a need for enforcement and information rather than for new legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Kilkenny incest report recommended that there should be mandatory reporting for certain designated professionals, which is not included in legislation.  As new cases are now coming to light this week, I ask the Taoiseach if the Government will give serious consideration to the introduction of some form of mandatory reporting for certain designated professionals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A discussion paper on that matter is being prepared.  If, having listened to all the relevant professional advice, we are of the view that this would be a necessary and useful contribution to the fight against child sexual abuse, the Government would be willing to make the changes necessary in legislation.  However, we should not legislate in an area of such seriousness without careful thought and preparation <Col N="665" /> to ensure that the legislation introduced achieves the purpose for which it is designed.</P>

      <P>As the Minister for Social Welfare has announced the securing of local authority funding, when will the relevant legislation be introduced? Will it be introduced in 1995 since £140 million has already been paid out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Taoiseach about the timescale for the health boards Bill. He was a little off the mark last week when I asked him that question.  Perhaps he could also clarify the timescale for the introduction of the drug trafficking Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The health Bill to set out the roles, responsibility and accountability of health boards and their chief executives will be introduced before the end of this year.  Legislation to amend the Health Act, 1970, to implement the decision as regards the reorganisation of health board services, including replacement of the Eastern Health Board by a new authority, will be introduced before March 1996.</P>

      <P>In view of the proposed legislation on the promotion of the Irish horse industry, will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Defence, Deputy Barrett, why he is withdrawing the Army's team from proposed events in Toronto, Washington and New York in view of the promotion of Irish half bred horses in these countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect the legislation in question will be available in April at the latest.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Fianna Fáil Party on the interest it has taken in the drugs issue this morning.  I ask it to use its influence in local areas, where it is not being used at present, to support the location of drugs clinics.  There is a gap between the oratory here and the practical lack of support from Fianna Fáil for the location of drugs clinic in the western suburbs of Dublin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last session the Taoiseach stated that he would bring <Col N="667" /> forward legislation in the autumn to deal with this issue.  However, only three justice Bills are listed, including the Refugee Bill, 1995, and the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994.  There is only one Bill on the drugs issue.  Is that the only legislation arising from the crime and justice section of <i>A Government of Renewal</i>?  The Taoiseach outlined in great detail the action plan for the community drugs teams and many other issues.  However, few have been dealt with.  I agree with the new initiatives on counselling, medical treatment, rehabilitation, sport, etc., but few have been introduced.  The Taoiseach said that we need community groups and bodies to work together.  I have been saying that for years.  If the Taoiseach does not propose to introduce legislation, perhaps he would agree to the proposal from this side of the House to set up a national drugs forum immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The criminal justice (drug trafficking) Bill, which will increase the periods of detention in respect of drugs offences and strengthen the powers of the Garda Síochána considerably, will be introduced before Christmas.  The Leader of Fianna Fáil seems to be unaware of the fact that there is a large legislative programme in the Department of Justice.  This relates to legislation which will be introduced before Christmas.  I have four pages of legislation which is in the pipeline in the Department of Justice and which relates to crime and punishment in general. That will be introduced in the normal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The drugs problem is not simply one of supply, but also of demand and treatment.  Everyone has a social responsibility as regards the problems of demand and treatment.  In particular, Opposition and Government parties must support the Eastern Health <Col N="668" /> Board in the location of clinics in suburban areas.  It is important to do that and I do not believe that anyone can project that responsibility on to someone else's shoulders.  We all have a responsibility to ensure that clinics are available in the areas where people have access to them so that they can be treated in time in the community before their problems become insuperable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett) Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves of the report by the Minister for Defence pursuant to section 4 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993.</P>
      <P>In accordance with section 4 of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, I wish to report to the House on Irish military participation in United Nations missions in 1994.  The compilation of this report has afforded me, as a relatively new Minister for Defence, a very welcome opportunity to acquaint myself more fully with the various overseas operations in which Irish military personnel are involved.  Two periods of service as Minister of State at the Department combined with my position as opposition spokesman on Defence and membership of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs had already given me a considerable knowledge of and keen interest in our overseas commitments. In my capacity as a member of the UN sub-group of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I have visited the Middle East where most of our overseas troops are concentrated and I intend to visit the area again at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>I will speak first on the second United Nations operation in Somalia &mdash; UNOSOM II &mdash; in which our involvement ceased early this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House is aware, the then Government decided in February 1994 to replace the transport unit serving with UNOSOM II on completion of its tour of duty.  The Second Transport Company took up duty on 7 March 1994.  Concern for the security of the <Col N="673" /> contingent led to the dispatch to Somalia of two SISU armoured personnel carriers held by the Defence Forces. These arrived at the Irish camp in Baidoa on 9 May.</P>
    <P>The Second Transport Company continued the duties of the first Irish contingent operating a weekly supply convoy between Baidoa and Mogadishu, providing fuel, food, water and medical supplies to the military components of UNOSOM II in the Baidoa area.  It also assisted in the movement of the stores and equipment of units deploying or redeploying in the mission area and provided assistance to non-Governmental humanitarian organisations.</P>
    <P>Following a full scale review of the question of continued participation in UNOSOM II, the military authorities recommended against the provision of a further contingent from September 1994.  The matter was considered by the Government on 20 July 1994 and it was decided not to replace the transport contingent serving in Somalia on completion of its tour of duty in September.</P>
    <P>During 1994, the security situation in Somalia became increasingly unstable. Irish convoys came under attack on two occasions.  The House has already been informed about the first incident which occurred on 15 March 1994 and was almost certainly unpremeditated.  The second attack, which occurred in Baidoa on 12 August, was an attempted hijack which was frustrated by the alertness and rapid reactions of our personnel. We can consider ourselves very fortunate that, over a period of 12 months' service in Somalia, Irish troops escaped injury.  The bulk of our UNOSOM contingent returned to Ireland by air on 20 September 1994.  Six personnel accompanied our vehicles and equipment by sea, arrived home on 14 October and the three officers who held staff appointments at Force headquarters completed their tours of duty in January 1995.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon &mdash; UNIFIL &mdash; is our largest single overseas commitment.  The present contingent of 664 consists of a <Col N="674" /> battalion of 574, a Deputy Force Commander, an element of 47 in UNIFIL Headquarters Camp Command, 13 staff personnel, 12 military police at UNIFIL Headquarters and 17 members of the Force Mobile Reserve.  As part of an overall reduction in the strength of UNIFIL, in which eight other countries participate, the Irish contingent strength will be reduced by 33 in October 1995 and by a further 9 in April 1996.  Since 25 April last, the position of Deputy Force Commander has been held by Brigadier-General Pearse Redmond.</P>
    <P>The Irish battalion is deployed in south Lebanon with its headquarters in Tibnin.  In 1994 it continued to carry out its mission by operating observation posts and checkpoints, by conducting extensive patrolling and maintaining a village presence and by providing humanitarian assistance to a variety of worthy causes such as the orphanage in Tibnin and some village medical clinics. The battalion carried out a number of controlled demolitions of explosives.</P>
    <P>While 1994 was quieter than 1993, there was an upsurge in activity by armed elements in the latter half of the year and a number of serious firings occurred close to Irish positions.  These resulted from attacks by armed elements on positions held by the Israeli-backed <i>de facto</i> forces.  In one incident, on 17 July, a mortar round impacted within an Irish position causing a fire which destroyed the medical aid post, the company administration office and caused superficial damage to the canteen.  The canteen had already been damaged earlier that day by two tank rounds impacting within the position.  A billet and two defensive walls were also damaged in the first incident.  On 3 November, there was a co-ordinated attack by armed elements on three compounds held by the <i>de facto</i> forces.  The retaliatory fire resulted in four instances of heavy machine gun fire into or near Irish positions and in five shells impacting within one post.  One round failed to detonate, the other four caused widespread and significant damage to buildings including eight accommodation <Col N="675" /> units and also damaged three vehicles. The Government's grave concern regarding these incidents, which could have had very serious consequences for Irish personnel, was conveyed to the Israeli authorities by the Department of Foreign Affairs.</P>
    <P>The Lebanese Army made further progress last year in deploying southward and established two permanent checkpoints in the UNIFIL area of operations, one in the Irish sector, for controlling the flow of goods into their country.  The remaining Force to which Ireland provides a contingent is the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus &mdash; UNFICYP.  Twenty-five Irish military personnel are currently serving with UNFICYP.  Two officers and five NCOs are filling staff appointments at Force headquarters and a camp command component consisting of three officers and fifteen NCOs has been serving with the mission since 16 February 1994.  From 10 April 1992 to 31 July 1994, the force was under the command of an Irish officer, Major-General Michael Minehane.  Fifteen members of the Garda Síochána are also serving with the force.</P>
    <P>In 1994, UNFICYP &mdash; which has a total military strength of 1,171 &mdash; continued to carry out its mandate &ldquo;to use its best efforts to prevent a recurrence of fighting and, as necessary, to contribute to the maintenance and restoration of law and order and a return to normal conditions.&rdquo;  The principal task of UNFICYP is the maintenance of a buffer zone between the lines of the Cypriot National Guard and the Turkish &mdash; Cypriot Forces.  The force is also involved in humanitarian activities.</P>
    <P>Apart from two Lieutenant-Colonels filling the appointments of personnel officer and supply officer in the field operations division of UN Headquarters, the remaining 43 personnel currently serving with the United Nations are attached to a total of seven observer missions of which I will speak shortly.  Irish military involvement in ONUSAL &mdash; the United Nations <Col N="676" /> Observer Group in EI Salvador &mdash; ended on 31 May 1994.  The mission continues.  From 24 August to 4 December 1994, 37 Irish military personnel served, as volunteers on special leave with pay, with UNHCR in Goma, assisting with the Rwandan refugee crisis.</P>
    <P>In 1994, we continued to provide 17 officers to the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East &mdash; UNTSO &mdash; in which we have participated since 1958.  However, the United Nations is implementing a reduction in the overall strength of UNTSO and Irish participation will reduce to 14 from 18 October 1995 and to 13 from February 1996.  Our UNTSO observers are currently based in Israel, Syria, and Lebanon.  UNTSO's main tasks today are concerned with the conflict between Israel and Lebanon and Syria, working closely with UNIFIL and UNDOF &mdash; the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force.  It also maintains a presence in Egypt and Jordan although these fronts are now quiet.</P>
    <P>Since February 1992, an Irish Colonel has been serving with OSGAP &mdash; the Office of the Secretary-General in Afghanistan and Pakistan as senior military adviser to the Secretary-General's personal representative.  This mission is concerned with confirming violations of the Geneva Accords on the Settlement of the Situation Relating to Afghanistan and facilitating a comprehensive political settlement.</P>
    <P>Irish participation in UNIKOM &mdash; the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission &mdash; continued in 1994. The number of officers serving with the mission increased from six to seven in July, all of whom are based in Kuwait in both staff and observer appointments. The mandate of UNIKOM involves monitoring the demilitarised zone established on the Iraq-Kuwait border following the Gulf War.</P>
    <P>We also continued to provide officers to MINURSO &mdash; the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara.  An additional three took up duty in June 1994 bringing to nine the <Col N="677" /> total number of Irish officers serving as observers with this mission.  In 1994, the officers continued their tasks at the Force headquarters in Laayoune and at sector and team sites throughout the mission area.  Progress towards holding the referendum for which this mission was established has been very slow due to disagreement between the interested parties on the composition of the electoral register.  The date for the referendum, originally planned for January 1992 is not yet known.  Fifteen members of the Garda Síochána are also serving with this mission.</P>
    <P>The number of Irish military personnel involved in UNPROFOR &mdash; the United Nations Protection Force in the former Yugoslavia &mdash; in 1994 varied between nine and ten employed on staff officer and observer duties.  The force has now been retitled the United Nations Peace Forces (UNPF).  Nine Irish military personnel are currently serving with the force in which 18 members of the Garda Síochána also participate.  A further six members of the Permanent Defence Force are serving with the EU Monitor Mission in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>On 2 October, 1994, two Irish officers were deployed for service, in a civilian capacity, with the International Conference on the former Yugoslavia.  The role of this mission, which is co-chaired by the UN and EU, is to monitor the delivery of humanitarian aid across designated border crossing points between the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Bosnia-Hercegovina.</P>
    <P>The remaining UN mission in which Irish military personnel are involved is UNMIH &mdash; the United Nations Mission in Haiti.  In September 1994, a request was received from the United Nations for two officers to serve as observers with the Advance Team of UNMIH.  On 21 September, two officers took up duty as observers with the mission.  The primary role of the advance team was to assess requirements and prepare for the deployment of UNMIH on completion of the mission of the multinational force.  When this operation commenced, <Col N="678" /> two officers were deployed, on 22 February 1995, to serve as staff officers with the mission and the two observers completed their tours of duty on 31 March 1995.</P>
    <P>In 1994, there was a considerable reduction in the amount due to this country by the United Nations in respect of Irish participation in UN operations.  Arrears payments totalling approximately £4.7 million were received.  The amount currently outstanding, including the sum of £10.3 million due in respect of UNIFIL and a claim for approximately £1 million in respect of UNOSOM which will be presented shortly, amounts to about £12.4 million.</P>
    <P>The annual extra cost, net of reimbursements, of our current UN commitments, is about £3.6 million.  Normal pay and allowances of the 734 personnel involved amount to a further £13.9 million.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the considerable undertaking which it represents both in financial and personnel terms, the Government remain committed, with due regard to the safety of our troops, to the principle of military participation in UN operations in the cause of international peace.  As the UN celebrates the 50th anniversary of its foundation, we can reflect with justifiable pride that for 37 of those 50 years, Irish military personnel have been actively and continuously involved in UN missions, often in very senior positions.  I am confident that our personnel will continue to serve the United Nations with distinction demonstrating, in practical ways, our support for the highest ideals of that organisation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for outlining the position on our Defence Forces taking part in operations on behalf of the United Nations throughout the world.  The extent of our participation may come as a surprise to many. While most people would be aware of our participation in Lebanon, our participation extends way beyond that.  For 37 years Irish military personnel have <Col N="679" /> played a full role in peace keeping throughout the world and I hope that can continue.</P>
      <P>In 1993 when Deputy David Andrews was Minister for Defence we had a very interesting debate on the Defence Forces. For the first time we asked the Defence Forces to change their role from peace keeping to peace enforcement. While a number of amendments were tabled the only party who opposed the measure was Democratic Left.  In fairness, we were asking our Defence Forces to take a big step which could have had serious consequences.</P>
      <P>However, as the Minister has outlined there were no casualities during that period in Somalia although there were a couple of incidents that could have had serious consequences.  For that reason it is important to have an annual look at the functions of our Defence Force and its participation with the United Nations.  It is important not to commit people to vulnerable areas where death is the likely outcome.</P>
      <P>If my memory serves me correctly soldiers who participated in UNOSOM II had to volunteer.  That made participation much easier.  The transport company worked well in very difficult circumstances during that operation. When the Irish military personnel became aware that the security position was becoming unstable they decided not to renew their operation.  That was the right decision at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I live close to the Curragh I meet many of the military personnel who have served overseas and most soldiers look on serving in the United Nations as an opportunity to put into practice what they have been trained to do.  While I understand there will be a reduction in the number of personnel serving in the Lebanon we must continue our involvement with the United Nations and peace keeping throughout the world.  Our soldiers want to do it, it is good for them and they have been well received around the world.  The character of our <Col N="680" /> soldiers and the way in which they conduct themselves is acceptable in the United Nations.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the way in which the United Nations is being taken over by one country.  We cannot allow that to continue.  The United Nations is made up of a number of nations, all of whose voices must be heard.  The Minister referred to the financial implications, an area which deserves greater scrutiny.  If the United Nations is to have continued success in its peace keeping operations throughout the world, it is important that it is funded properly.  The position which obtained until now is unsatisfactory and must be changed.  Recently, attempts were made to ensure that countries were paid pretty well on time for any expenses incurred.  According to the figures presented by the Minister, arrears amount to almost £12.5 million. My information is that the United Nations has not made any contribution in the past six months.  The United States is the biggest culprit in this regard.  It appears the President of the United States is coming under severe pressure at home and has proposed a reduction in funding to the United Nations.</P>
    <P>We have a proud record of serving for the United Nations right around the world.  It costs us £3.6 million annually to participate in peace-keeping activities throughout the world on behalf of the United Nations and the least we can expect is to be compensated financially for that contribution.  A shortfall of £12.5 million is serious for a small nation such as ours and I ask the Minister to indicate what is being done to recover that shortfall.</P>
    <P>In the past 12 months there has been much debate in this House about the restructuring of our Defence Forces. There is widespread agreement that restructuring is necessary and while I do not want to make any political points about the way the matter is being handled, leaks occurred on the restructuring. Many rumours were circulating, for which there was no foundation, and, as <Col N="681" /> the Minister knows, such rumours affect morale in a serious way.</P>
    <P>Some years ago there was much unease among the members of our Defence Forces and morale was at an all time low.  That was rectified to a large extent by the then Minister for Defence, Deputy Lenihan, who made enormous changes which created a better spirit within the Defence Forces.  I would like to see that spirit restored.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister's intentions are honourable and I wish him well in his efforts to restructure the Defence Forces but he has referred on many occasions to consultation taking place.  I am not sure whether the average soldier would agree with the Minister in that regard.  Many soldiers feel decisions are being made about their future with little or no consultation with them.</P>

      <P>I hesitate to interrupt the Deputy but I must remind him, and the House, that the report with which we are dealing relates largely, if not solely, to the operation of the Defence Forces overseas under the aegis of the United Nations or the European Union.  I ask Members not to stray too far from the subject matter of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask for your indulgence, a Cheann Comhairle, as I am about to ask a question.  Part of the restructuring of the Defence Forces will involve a reduction in the overall strength of the force from approximately 13,000 to 11,500.  Is it possible to maintain our UN commitments with such a reduction in our force?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>UN duty provides an opportunity for members of our Defence Forces to put into practice what they have learned in training.  I would not like our UN commitments to be reduced as a result of a reduction in the strength of our Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> I agree with the Minister that it is important to maintain our policy of military participation in United Nations operations in the cause of peace throughout the world.  We have a proud record in that regard.  The members of the Defence Forces we have sent overseas have been great ambassadors for Ireland and they have portrayed a very favourable image of this country.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for outlining the way in which our Defence Forces have served overseas and the wonderful job they have done.  I wish to thank all the members of the Defence Forces who have participated in United Nations operations during the past 37 years. They brought great credit to this country. We are proud of them and long may it continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's contribution in which he gave a breakdown of the various forces overseas and I ask him to express our sincere thanks to the members of the Defence Forces who have done a great job participating in UN operations over many years.  We are extremely proud of them and the work they have done.</P>
      <P>As spokesperson for the Progressive Democrats, I welcome the Minister's report which arises out of the commitments made in the Defence (Amendment) Bill, 1993.  In accordance with the provisions of the Bill we are in a position to debate the deployment of Irish troops on UN duty in peace enforcement operations in many of the world's trouble spots.</P>
      <P>The transition from our traditional peace-keeping role to one of peace enforcement has been accomplished in the past year and while some concerns had been expressed about the move to enforcement, and all it entailed, the reality is that we must play our part in world security.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While some observers may feel that the change to enforcement from the traditional peace-keeping role is a significant step for a small country, we have to acknowledge the function of the United Nations in the world today.  The <Col N="683" /> UN is currently celebrating its golden jubilee so it is timely that we debate the role of the agency and how we see its future direction in relation to our Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The recent amendments to the Defence Act, which we are debating, authorised the commitment of Irish troops to any international force or body established by the Security Council or the General Assembly of the United Nations.  In fact, the legislation allowed the participation of Irish Defence Forces in military operations sanctioned by the UN.</P>
    <P>The organisation has come a long way since it began as the Moscow Declaration in 1943 when the allies agreed to establish an international agency to maintain peace and security in the wake of World War II.  In 1945, the war ended and the United Nations was founded. Today there are 185 member states of the UN and it is a force for conflict resolution throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The fact that Ireland as a small country is linked to such a vast organisation indicates our concern for world peace and security.  The past 50 years have not been peaceful.  While we in the west and in Europe generally reaped the benefits of peace in the post-war years, conflicts and confrontations flared up in many other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>While many political and humanitarian observers may direct their criticism at the UN, the reality is that the organisation is, a force for peace among warring nations or states.  The main criticisms now being levelled at the UN is that the agency does not act swiftly enough to prevent death and destruction in the world's trouble spots.</P>
    <P>The organisation has also been criticised for being over-staffed, wasteful and engaged in questionable activities in some parts of the world where conflict continues.  However, the question we must ask in this debate is, what value do we place on the saving of human life? There is no doubt that the actions of the UN have saved the lives of countless people in many parts of the world.  As <Col N="684" /> the UN celebrates its golden jubilee we must acknowledge its role, however limited or curtailed, in bringing hope and peace to many troubled nations.</P>
    <P>The involvement of our Defence Forces with the UN goes back approximately 40 years.  During that time we have played a significant role in UN operations in different parts of the world.  As a nation with a proud history of independence and freedom, the participation of Irish troops in UN duties has a special significance to other states and people who value democratic principles and the right to self-determination. As the UN celebrates 50 years in existence it is important to remember that peace has not come to the world and trouble spots such as Bosnia, the Lebanon, Rwanda and the Middle East are still a cause for great concern.</P>
    <P>One of the major changes in society over the past 50 years has been the rise in the power and influence of the media. Today we are instantly made aware of the major trouble spots throughout the world through the power of television, radio and the printed media.  Within hours, television screens, the airwaves and news columns are filled with accounts of the latest war or outbreak of violence.  We have seen the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, the mass murder of countless people in Rwanda and, even years after the conflict, the death of children who walked on leftover land mines in Cambodia.</P>
    <P>In spite of all its powers, the media's ability to shock fades as war continues. During the debate on the 1993 Defence (Amendment) Act the situation in Somalia was headline news.  Even though the images of conflict between the warring factions and the pictures of gunmen in open top transport, waving their weapons for the television viewers, have now faded one must ask if peace has been fully secured for that troubled country.  Shortly afterwards, the new horrors in Rwanda took over the international agenda.  The Irish troops were still in Somalia.  It must be remembered that peace has not necessarily been <Col N="685" /> secured in a country because it is not featured in the media.</P>
    <P>We have been reminded of the horrors of Rwanda by the recent visit of President Robinson who made an eloquent plea for world action to defuse the time bomb resulting from last year's genocide.  During her visit President Robinson visited two camps which house more than 800,000 Rwandan Hutu refugees.  She said that while the conditions had improved since last year the underlying problems had still not been addressed and no effort had been made to restore justice.  We take many of our democratic rights for granted and it is sobering to ponder on the plight of the many hundreds of thousands of people whose lives have been wrecked by civil and military strife.</P>
    <P>I join in paying tribute not only to the Irish troops for their courage and concern for those affected by war but to all Irish aid workers who labour under the most trying and difficult conditions to bring comfort and hope to people traumatised by terror, weapons and conflict in many parts of the world.  The Irish aid agencies are widely recognised as being very professional and well organised and they enjoy the widespread and wholehearted support of the public. Their work in the trouble spots of the world is vital for the restoration of peace.  During the debate last year I said that it is all very well having policy documents and strategic plans but we must ensure that the troops who take part in peace enforcement missions are equipped on a par with the best in the world, that they are provided with the resources and equipment necessary to enable them to do a difficult job to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>It was with some disappointment, therefore, that I noted the Government's attempts to reduce the establishment strength of the Defence Forces which will undoubtedly affect our ability to take part in peace enforcement operations. It is proposed to reduce the establishment strength from more than 16,000 to 11,500 through a voluntary early retirement scheme.  The danger is <Col N="686" /> that the retirement terms will not be attractive enough to encourage soldiers to leave and as a result of the age profile of the Defence Forces will continue to increase.  Under the present plans 1,300 soldiers will be made retire early.  The decision to set the establishment figure at 11,500 means the military authorities will face pressure from the Department of Finance to achieve those cuts.  The inference is obvious: if the cuts are not achieved then the finance for training and equipment may not be forthcoming. The objective of enabling the Defence Forces to become a more mobile and leaner organisation by revamping the command and brigade structure may be in serious doubt because of a lack of finance. I urge the Minister to ensure that the Defence Forces are given adequate finance to uphold an acceptable level of training and participation in UN operations.</P>
    <P>Prior to the debate I consulted with my party colleagues who in general are satisfied that the provisions of the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993, are working well.  I welcome the information given to the House by the Minister and pay tribute to him in that respect.  However, there are broader questions of national and Government policy which will flow from our participation in UN operations, be they peace keeping or peace enforcement.  While I acknowledge that there is a certain amount of danger involved in peace keeping there is also national prestige to be gained and, more importantly, our membership of the European Union is underlined to the world.  As I have said in the past, we must play our full part as the EU moves towards a collective security approach.</P>
    <P>The founding principle of the UN 50 years ago was the desire for peace and security in the world.  That is still a noble and achievable concept.  I hope that the International Law Commission will present a final draft code of crimes against peace and security to the UN.  It is only through a truly global approach that we can hope to win peace and security for all people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his most interesting report.  In many respects it is a progress report on the role and administration of the Defence Forces which are deployed in many countries.  On my way into the Dáil this morning I passed a number of young troops who obviously have just returned from duty in the Lebanon &mdash; they were wearing dress uniforms and UN berets. As a former member of the Defence Forces who served with them for 29 years at almost every rank I felt a great sense of pride when I saw those young soldiers who carry out their work at great risk and sacrifice to them and their families.  The few extra pounds they receive does not compensate them for this work which requires them to be constantly alert, highly trained and highly motivated or for the sacrifice they make by being separated from their wives, children and families.  This House and the public generally do not fully appreciate the sacrifices made by these men and women who work in isolated and dangerous areas in the interest of securing peace throughout the world. They are highly thought of in every country in which they have served and have never been in conflict with the native populations.  They have always been able to bridge the gap between the warring factions.  They have suffered the loss of comrades at officer, NCO and private rank who gave their lives in the interests of peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister for presenting a detailed report of the operation of the Act.  It was necessary for him to do so. People talk about the cost involved in sending troops abroad, but there is a more important element.  The Defence Forces have gained valuable experience under war conditions while serving abroad.  This cannot be gained on training manoeuvres in the Curragh Camp, the Glen of Imaal or Aiken Barracks in Dundalk.  Within the financial constraints imposed on the Minister, we should respond favourably to as many requests as possible to provide troops because the officers, NCOs and privates of the Defence Forces are the greatest <Col N="688" /> ambassadors we can send abroad.  I have seen at first hand the valuable contribution they made and continue to make in the interests of peace throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Although they lost a sizeable number of officers, NCOs and privates in the Congo this did not deter the Defence Forces; they did not run away simply because they had lost some comrades in that bloody battle, rather they have consistently sought permission to participate in peace keeping and observer missions in areas of conflict when requested to do so by the United Nations.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to the reorganisation of the Defence Forces and the Price Waterhouse report in particular.  It has been suggested that if the recommendation of a three brigade structure, consisting of approximately 11,500 men, is accepted the operations of the Defence Forces will be affected not alone here, but abroad.  I do not accept this.  It has to be recognised that the average age of personnel within the Defence Forces is rising beyond what would be considered reasonable in normal circumstances.  There are many reasons for this, one of which may be that members of the Defence Forces now feel that their employment is more secure than it was 20 years ago when rates of pay and conditions were appalling. Having served in barracks in Cork, Waterford, Kilkenny and along the Border I am aware of the conditions under which they had to serve.  Thankfully, those conditions have been substantially improved primarily because successive Governments began to recognise the value of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>In 1969 there was not even a platoon of regular troops serving along the Border when companies such as the 8th Battalion had to man all Border posts in appalling conditions.  If memory serves me correctly, there were approximately 4,500 operational troops in total.  In Aiken Barracks in Dundalk, then known as Dundalk Military Barracks, there were six regular troops responsible for administering the affairs of the FCA units.  There were no barracks in <Col N="689" /> Monaghan or Cootehill and only a non-operational military post &mdash; a Slua hall &mdash; in Castleblayney.  There was nothing between Cavan barracks and Finner Camp in County Donegal.  This was deplorable.</P>
    <P>Much has changed since then.  The conflict in the North during the past 25 years has focused the minds of successive Governments on the necessity of having a well trained and disciplined Permanent Defence Force.  Service with the United Nations abroad is one of the best ways to achieve that objective.  It should be borne in mind that non-operational troops account for 40 per cent of the total strength of the Defence Forces. I am convinced, therefore, that a total of 11,500 men in three well organised, well trained and properly equipped brigades would be adequate to meet our requirements at home and abroad for the foreseeable future unless there is further conflict in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I encourage the Minister to introduce an attractive early retirement scheme for members of the Defence Forces. The early retirement scheme for the public service introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government proved successful in that many public servants who had reached a certain age found it attractive to retire.  This allowed the recruitment of many younger people when Government policy subsequently changed.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces are an integral part of the overall public service.  The scheme would be attractive to encourage long serving members to opt for early retirement on a reasonable income.  In this way the Government and the Oireachtas will have recognised the service provided by these men and women.</P>
    <P>The members of the Defence Forces need have no worries about the intention of the Government.  Having spoken to the Minister I am satisfied that every effort will be made to make the package as attractive as possible within the financial constraints imposed.  We are talking about taxpayers' money and part of the public service.  Public service schemes have been introduced by successive <Col N="690" /> Governments and the scheme for the Defence Forces can be measured against those.</P>
    <P>Many officers are half the age of NCOs and men serving in battalions overseas.  Young men and women are appointed and trained as cadets and officers but the level of recruitment within the ranks is much lower.  The age level should be reduced.</P>
    <P>Three options were recommended in the Price Waterhouse report and the Minister opted for the third one proposed by the Defence Forces.  I am delighted he did so because he will have the support of the majority of those in the force.</P>
    <P>The closure of barracks is not directly related to this debate but the previous Minister met a delegation from a subcommittee which I chaired and gave a clear indication which was conveyed to RACO and PDFORRA that no barracks would be closed during the Government's term of office.  I am sure that guarantee will be honoured. However, no Minister can say what will happen in the future if there is a change of Government.  The Opposition should not dig its own grave because if there is a change of Government it might be called upon to fill it.  This is such an important issue that we should reach a consensus.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was in Aiken Barracks at a stand down parade for a former colleague on Sunday morning.  The media really only want to know about the Defence Forces if there is a conflict but they do not want to know about its mission and how it serves the country.  If there was a row in the House about the Price Waterhouse report and what the Minister was or was not doing the Defence Forces would get plenty of bad publicity.  This is good publicity and I hope it is recognised that this is the first time a Minister has put on record a detailed report on the operations of the force.</P>
      <P>I visited the Western Sahara as a member of an all-party group.  We went to the battle zone where the Polisario were fighting the Moroccans.  I am glad there is an Irish presence there.  The Moroccans are trying to populate their area so that the result of the referendum will be in their favour.  This has not gone unnoticed by the Departments of Defence and Foreign Affairs.  I would like to visit the area when the referendum is being held, if I can be facilitated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed statement to the House.  It makes very sober reading and shows the extent to which this country has become involved in peace-keeping and to some extent peace enforcement in many places from Somalia to the Lebanon, Cyprus, Pakistan, Goma and so on.  It reflects the conflicts and problems which have beset the world.  It is an extraordinary feature of modern life that while there has been a major enhancement of educational facilities, a <Col N="692" /> reduction in malnutrition, an increase in medical technology, major scientific advance and an explosion in information technology many small countries still face the raw struggle for independence or are involved in conflicts which are made worse by bigger countries pursuing their interests.  Ordinary people are caught in the middle and are exposed to incalculable atrocities, suffering, starvation and death.</P>
      <P>Any Government would be proud to be involved to whatever extent is possible in peace-keeping and peace enforcement.  However, it is not an easy task and while I do not wish to dwell on the expense that might be incurred it is an outright shame that enormous sums of money are due to the UN from many big countries.  I would prefer to concentrate on the extent to which changes can be made in an evolving world so that we can contribute towards making the UN more effective.</P>
      <P>There has also been considerable acrimony about the failure of the United Nations, not least in Bosnia where many people believed it should be possible to take more decisive action to prevent the atrocities and promote peace there.  I do not think the founders of the United Nations visualised some of the problems that would arise.</P>
      <P>The end of the Cold War must be heralded as an outstanding and welcome development.  There is however the other side of the argument, with the US being considered as policeman for the rest of the world.  We must continue to contribute towards helping the United Nations to play a more effective role in discharging its responsibilities and bringing to an end the human trauma and tragedy of death, starvation and ever-increasing ethnic conflicts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This morning the Minister referred to involvement in the UN by a relatively small unit of our Defence Forces.  We should pay tribute to and congratulate all the members of the Defence Forces who have done this country proud in many parts of the world since our first involvement in the Congo in 1958, three <Col N="693" /> years after we joined the United Nations.  Tribute should also be paid to the wives and families of these people who often suffer when their loved ones are involved in conflicts and in great danger.</P>
    <P>The Minister briefly referred to reports published in the last 12 months on changing circumstances, difficulties that must be faced and extraordinary near misses in Lebanon, where in the last year thankfully no Irish lives were lost nor did injuries occur.</P>
    <P>The review of the Maastricht Treaty at the Intergovernmental Conference next year will afford an opportunity to see to what extent this country will participate in a common defence policy. Our party has made it absolutely clear that while we see a continuing and distinctive role for this country, under no circumstances will we consider joining existing military alliances such as the Western European Union and NATO, particularly because of their policy on first attack nuclear warfare.  There is need for flexibility and for decisions by the people on a case by case basis.  The change in the Defence Act relating to peace enforcement will be a continuing feature in decisions taken by the Government on training and restructuring the Defence Forces in the future.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding what Deputy Bell said, the Minister can be satisfied that Fianna Fáil supports restructuring of the Defence Forces.  We were in Government when the necessity for these changes was examined.  The age profile of the Defence Forces needs to be considered. We support the retirement package and hope it will be generous and effective.  However a recruitment drive must be undertaken simultaneously because a retirement package on its own would not be sufficient to deal with the age profile.  A recruitment programme must be devised as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Commitments have been given but we are not sure whether they have been honoured in full, particularly in terms of consultation.  It is important that Defence Forces personnel working in <Col N="694" /> the United Nations who must carry out certain tasks and take risks in the performance of their duties are adequately consulted so that they understand where their future lies and have confidence that the Government will discharge its responsibility impartially.  We do not wish to exacerbate problems.  We are aware that changes must be made, but they must be made gradually to be effective.  The Government can be sure of support from this side of the House provided the consultative process is developed in a credible way and has the support of the people working at officer, NCO and other levels.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil supports our continuing involvement in the United Nations.  On the basis of the figures given by the Minister there are problems in terms of finances, but we cannot allow them to inhibit our involvement in peace-keeping and peace enforcement operations. Many areas in the world cry out for peace-keeping measures.  Originally the idea was that the United Nations would become involved only with the agreement of conflicting parties.  Ireland, because of its non-colonial past, has been a welcome contributor to the UN. Unfortunately there are many areas to which the United Nations is unable to commit itself in terms of humanitarian aid and peace-keeping tasks which are essential for stability and security.  The possibility of becoming involved in those areas must be enhanced and we will do everything possible to support the Government in providing resources, performing tasks and undertaking negotiations on delicate and sensitive areas. Fianna Fáil's support for these developments will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Last week in a very interesting statement on RTE a Dublin man, who was interviewed in Villierstown, County Waterford, famous as the home of John Treacy, recalled past experiences and some of the proudest moments of his life.  One was in the early 1960s when the Irish <Col N="695" /> UN contingent paraded down O'Connell Street on their way to the Congo and were led by none other than the Captain of the Guard, Captain Cathal Ó Laoghaire.  He remembers him as a striking figure who, shortly before that, had been the captain of the victorious Dublin All Ireland team &mdash; that is an interesting connection between the United Nations and Leinster House.</P>
      <P>That is the nice part of my speech and now war breaks out.  What I say is my own personal opinion and not necessarily a reflection on my party.  My views probably reflect those held by some members of all parties but not the majority.  I do not agree that the sole purpose of our UN membership should be peace-keeping activities.  I speak as someone whose family has been in the armed forces for many years, going back to 1916 and 1921-22 and subsequently in the Army.  My father and my two brothers were in the Army.</P>
      <P>I make no apologies for my views but neutrality as we practise it is a cop-out and I would term it cowardice at times. People have a phobia about being neutral in all things military but I do not agree.  We have a duty to protect the umbrella of civilisation under which we live and prosper.  The one time I remember that our armed forces were given the authority by this House to act in a military fashion, if necessary, was when the Irish UN force went to Somalia and they had the right to fight back if attacked because it was a matter of life or death.  The remit of peace enforcement as distinct from peace-keeping was taken on board on that occasion, which is the only occasion I can recall since the foundation of the State and it is a role we should be prepared to adopt at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Yesterday the Foreign Affairs Committee received three delegations, first, a delegation from the Kuwaiti Parliament, second, the Croatian Ambassador and finally the Ambassador from Bosnia-Hercegovina to the United Kingdom, Professor Muhamed Filipovic. We talk about getting involved in <Col N="696" /> humanitarian missions but when Professor Filipovic was in Ireland about six weeks ago he launched a blistering attack on Ireland for not taking a more active role in the situation in Bosnia.  He is a Muslim but, as he pointed out, the conflict is not just Muslims against Serbs or Serbs against Croatians but a very complicated dispute.  The fact that he is a Bosnian Muslim does not mean he does not represent Bosnian Serbs or Bosnian Croats.  People do not align themselves simply according to their nationality, it is a more complex situation.</P>
    <P>We have allowed ourselves to stand &ldquo;idly by&rdquo;, to paraphrase a former Taoiseach, and watch hundreds of thousands of innocent people being massacred in former Yugoslavia and primarily in Bosnia. I do not believe we were right to do that and everything that the Ambassador said when he last visited Ireland is correct.  We have been very remiss in not taking a stand and not protecting innocent people when they were being massacred.  Perhaps we had an excuse during the Second World War &mdash; several excuses could have been put forward such as we were a new nation, we were not militarily prepared to fight and not sufficiently informed of the horrific crimes being perpetrated by Hitler and the Nazis.  On this occasion we have no excuse.  We have known of the concentration camps, of the massacres and the murder of men, women and children during the past four years and still we see fit not to take part in any military force which would attempt to assist those unfortunate Bosnian people.  I do not believe that is right and the majority of Irish people do not believe it is right. I would welcome a referendum on this issue.  Yesterday the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs when responding to questions, one of which I tabled, said there was no question of Ireland taking part in a European army because the question has not yet arisen. If the question does arise, and I anticipate it will, when the integration of Europe becomes more solidified I would be a proponent of those who wish <Col N="697" /> us to be part of a greater European army, not for any aggressive purpose but to protect society and civilisation in western Europe.  I do not have time for people with a contrary view&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as I think it is a cop-out, cowardice.  We cannot expect to reap the benefits of membership of the European Union and the civilisation it brings with it and at the same time not contribute to the defence of people in the Union and people in other parts of Europe who are not in the Union such as those in former Yugoslavia.  I hear representatives of certain organisations say they do not want to be involved in military conflict in spite of having been recruited to the Irish Army.  I wonder why people join the Army.  Why do we need an army if we are not prepared to fight?  The peace-keeping role of the United Nations is praiseworthy but this is not what an army is constituted to do. We must be prepared to accept responsibility for protecting innocent people who are being slaughtered in our vicinity and, in my view, that extends to every country in Europe.</P>
      <P>Deputies often mention the neutrality of countries like Finland, Austria and Sweden.  Those countries have not always been neutral, some not even in modern times.  It is but a couple of hundred years since the Swedes were on the rampage, and they were quite a potent military force.  It is only 55 years since the Finns were at war and only 50 years since the Austrians were assisting Hitler.  The neutrality of some countries, who purport to be neutral, is of recent origin and is very utilitarian.</P>
      <P>I look forward to a referendum on this issue.  The Irish people have much more backbone than many people suspect. They do not want to see another human tragedy, such as we witnessed in Bosnia over the past four years, while we sit on the sideline, impotent and unwilling to go to people's assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I give the utmost praise to <Col N="698" /> the aid agencies here and to the individuals in those agencies who have gone to Bosnia, to the dangerous areas of Sarajevo and other sectors to distribute aid and to nurse the injured and the dying. They have done wonderful work.  A limited number of personnel from the Army and the Garda Síochána were also there as observers in Bosnia and other flashpoints.</P>
    <P>We are observers at the Western European Union, military alliance.  This is not sufficient.  It is time we got involved and played our part in protecting the civilisation of which we are a part.  We must have an army that is capable of playing its part on behalf of the innocent people of this world.  If the Army is not used for the benefit of such people, would it be better employed aiding the civil authorities, particularly the Garda Síochána, in combating crime which is rampant.  The question I pose today is why do we have an Army and if it is not prepared to fight and defend the innocent, do we need it?  That question should be answered, and it is being evaded under the humbug of neutrality. We are living in different times.  We are reaping the benefits of our membership of the European Union, but we are not prepared to do anything in return.  By that I mean defending those people who are defenceless and who are being murdered everyday.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government, the Members of this House and the people of this country to review their strategy and thinking on this matter, because we have not been playing our part as defenders of the weakest section of the communities in Europe.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister, and on my own behalf, I would like to thank all the Deputies who contributed to this very constructive debate.  We welcome the opportunity to having a regular reappraisal of the role of our Defence Forces, in this case in the context of world service and world peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> I will deal with Deputy Deasy's comments in a few moments but first I want to thank Deputy Power whose roots go back a long way in terms of service.  His father had responsibility for the Department of Defence, and he comes from a constituency with a high military presence. Deputy Power mentioned the issue of funding from the United Nations which is of concern to the Government.  The Tánaiste recently raised the matter with the United Nations and will continue to do so because peace does not come cheaply and the enormous efforts we are making entitle us to the financial assistance that is overdue.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently spelled out in clear detail the stratagem for the development of the Defence Forces, and fundamental to that is consultation, dialogue and consensus.  That is what the Minister will embark upon to ensure that any rationalisation does not lead to gross depletion of the efficacy and efficiency of the Defence Forces or infringe on our commitment to the United Nations.  There is no question of any diminution of our commitment to the United Nations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Clohessy is to be complimented for his support and for differentiating between peace-keeping and peace enforcement.  We would like to think that peace enforcement, that is, peace-making, is a new definition of the role of our troops overseas.  On the point made by Deputy Deasy, there is no question but that soldiers are trained to fight and it is in that context that they undertake their difficult missions.  They will not flinch from any challenge. However, in terms of discharging their peace-keeping role, one hopes the conflict will be short&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately Deputy Deasy has not waited for the Minister's reply.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that the number of times they have to go into action will be minimised.  However, in the case <Col N="700" /> of challenge or confrontation, there is no question but that our soldiers will fight as they have been trained to do.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy Bell for his valuable personal insight as a former serving member of the Defence Forces.  We all share a sense of pride at the return of our troops.  The 77th Battalion will be returning in three separate groups over the next few weeks, and one will see a definite bounce in their step, having successfully accomplished their mission in South Lebanon.  In that regard it is important that Ministers and Ministers of State continue, as they have done, to visit our troops overseas.  We are one of the few countries who send Ministers overseas to meet their soldiers and see what they do; seeing is believing.  One must see the degree of commitment, skill and expertise with which they carry out their duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bell suggested extending that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>We will consider that from the point of view of those who have an interest in, and have given a long service to, the Defence Forces.  In regard to the morale of the force, it is important that personnel know they have the collective support of the people at home and that Ministers go overseas on a regular basis to see them in action.</P>
      <P>The Defence Forces are part of the public service.  Therefore, in endeavouring to make all agencies in the public service more effective, their operations must be examined.  We are committed to rationalisation and effectiveness, there is no question of depletion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Michael Smith for his keen analysis of the consequences of conflict.  As he stated, invariably the innocent suffer, the civilian population, those in the front line.  He paid due tribute to the soldiers' wives who retain the stability of domestic life while troops serve overseas.  I pay tribute to the women personnel who play a valuable part in overseas operations.  This is an increasing aspect of the development of <Col N="701" /> the Defence Forces.  I also thank Deputy Smith for his support for the retirement package and for his constructive appraisal of the reality of the present position and the future role of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>As usual, Deputy Deasy made a thought provoking contribution and is entitled to raise the issue of neutrality. Neutrality has stood our Defence Forces in good stead.  It has been the cornerstone of their acceptability as effective peace-keepers that has made them so popular overseas.  It is a well known fact that the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Defence and the Government in general is inundated with requests from the United Nations and elsewhere for the participation of our troops in areas of conflict.  The fact that we are independent, neutral, non-aligned and can discharge our duties without any taint of alignment to one side or the other, with total impartiality, is a major factor in the success of our troops overseas.  To suggest we have stood idly by is not fair.  We are not standing idly by in Cyprus or the Lebanon, nor did we stand idly by in the Congo.  Our soldiers go to such places to discharge their duties in the manner in which Deputy Deasy wants, to protect civilian populations from massacre.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy referred to the conflict in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  On numerous occasions the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs made the strong views of the Government and country known in regard to our displeasure with what is taking place there.  However, in terms of our size, we must put matters in perspective.</P>
    <P>Having just returned from a visit to Irish troops serving with the United Nations in Lebanon, Cyprus and Israel I am fully aware of the tremendous value that service with United Nations missions has for the personnel of our Defence Forces.  I was struck by the dedication of Irish military personnel to the important work they are undertaking in the cause of international peace.</P>
    <P>Apart from meeting and observing the work of our personnel, which was <Col N="702" /> the primary purpose of my visit, I had meetings with senior military and political figures.  In Lebanon I had discussions with the force commander, Major-General Stanislaw Wozniak and the Deputy force commander, Brigadier-General Pierce Redmond.  The fact that an Irish officer holds such a prestigious appointment in the force demonstrates the high esteem in which the Irish Defence Forces is held by the United Nations.  General Redmond is, of course, only one of the many Irish officers to have filled very senior appointments in United Nations missions.  In Beirut, I also met Mr. Muhsin Dalloul, the Lebanese Minister for Defence.</P>
    <P>For the individual soldier, peace-keeping can present a major challenge. Potentially difficult situations are routinely defused by Irish soldiers using common sense and diplomacy, combined with the highest professional military standards.  In keeping the peace in Lebanon, our soldiers have won the confidence and support of people who come from a very different cultural background.  The success of Irish troops in the manner they relate to the local community is nothing short of remarkable.</P>
    <P>Apart from peace-keeping and peace making, I was struck by the considerable humanitarian dimension of their work.  I visited an orphanage in Tibnin sponsored mainly by Irish troops from their own resources and while I was there a new kitchen was being fitted. Those sponsoring and managing the orphanage pay great tribute to the Irish troops who sleep in the orphanage when shelling takes place.</P>
    <P>While in Cyprus I met Mr. Gustave Feissel, Chief of Mission of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, Brigadier-General Ahti Vartiainen, force commander and Colonel John Powell, chief of staff.  General Vartiainen's predecessor was an Irish officer, Major-General Michael Minehane, who held the appointment of force commander from April 1992 to July 1994. People who are under any misapprehension about the role of the Irish troops or <Col N="703" /> believe that international peacekeeping involves a soft touch, they have only to walk the buffer zone between the conflicting Turkish and Greek forces, who are only yards apart, to note the tremendous work being done by the troops.  As a result of their presence only trivial incidents arise.  There is potential for enormous conflict in such areas if United Nations personnel were not present.</P>
    <P>A total of 734 military personnel are currently serving with ten United Nations missions in 14 countries as follows: Lebanon, Israel, Syria, Cyprus, Kuwait, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Western Sahara, Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina &mdash; for Deputy Deasy's information &mdash; Macedonia, Haiti, Serbia and USA as well as in the United Nations Headquarters in New York.  The number of Irish military personnel currently serving overseas with United Nations missions represents 5.6 per cent of our armed forces.  This equates to 203 personnel per million of population.  Irish military personnel have also rendered service in United Nations missions in Iran, Namibia, Zaire/Congo, West Guinea, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Angola, Cambodia, El Salvador, Iraq and Somalia.</P>
    <P>The preservation of peace is not achieved easily or without cost to members of the Defence Forces and we are all very much aware of the sacrifices often required in order that the defenceless may be protected and made safe. We remember with deep gratitude the courage and heroism of those members of the Defence Forces who have died, or suffered injury, so that communities torn by strife can have an opportunity to live in peace and security.  I recently had the pleasure of laying the first wreath at a memorial erected by a young private from Donegal at the command headquarters in Nakura in memory of those who lost their lives on overseas duties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="704" /> The professional advantages of services with UN missions are very substantial. The benefits in regard to training are particularly evident in the context of our UNIFIL contingent.  In Lebanon our battalion personnel from junior NCO rank upwards have the opportunity to exercise command in dangerous operational situations.  Valuable experience is gained in patrolling and defusing tension.  There is much to be learned from holding staff appointments in force headquarters.  Interaction with contingents of other countries and exposure to methods employed by them is also very beneficial.  The wide experience gained from participation in UN peacekeeping operations is of benefit, not only to the Defence Forces in the discharge of their functions in aid of the civil power but also to various Government Departments and local authorities who, as occasion demands, have reason to avail of emergency services provided by the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The wealth of expertise within the Defence Forces in UN peacekeeping led to the decision to establish a UN school at the Curragh which opened on 16 September 1993.  The school was established with a view to filling a perceived need for a central institution to study and devise doctrine, determine training needs, conduct specifically designed peace-keeping training, study the operational implications of various UN mandates and analyse the training required to ensure troops in peace-keeping operations are properly prepared to fulfill the requirements of the specific mandate under which they operate.  In addition to its education and training role, this school also maintains contact with developments in the military forces of other States involved in peace-keeping in order to exchange and update doctrine and procedures.</P>
    <P>Numerous courses have already been conducted for Irish personnel going on overseas duty and an international observer and staff officer course was held for overseas students in the period 5-23 June last.  Because of the well established reputation of the Irish in the <Col N="705" /> field of peace-keeping, there was great interest in this course and we have already had inquiries about next year's international course.</P>
    <P>On 21 September 1993, the Government approved a statement of the roles of the Defence Forces which included participation in United Nations missions in the cause of international peace.  I assure the House of this Government's continued commitment to involvement in United Nations peace-keeping operations. I thank Members for their contributions.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill replaces the Refugee Bill, 1994, introduced by the previous Government which has been withdrawn. The primary purposes of the new Bill and its predecessor are essentially the same, namely to place our procedures for dealing with applications for refugee status on a statutory footing and to ensure that those procedures meet the highest standards in terms of fairness and impartialty towards applicants.  As Deputies will recall, when the 1994 Bill was referred to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, concerns were voiced on all sides of this House that it did not go far enough in seeking to safeguard the interests of applicants for asylum. In that context numerous amendments were tabled to the Bill and it was clear from the discussions that took place within the Select Committee that there was widespread support for the bulk of those amendments.  The Government decided that, rather than seek to incorporate a large number of amendments into the original text, the better course would be to withdraw it and to introduce a new Bill which would take on board the relevant amendments to the maximum extent possible.  This is a process that has involved a substantial amount of work including, in particular, detailed consultation with the Parliamentary Draftsman and the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my statement I will outline the main changes that have been made to the 1994 Bill.  They are concerned, <i>inter alia</i>, with the entitlement of an applicant to be heard in the determination process and the extent to which interpreters must be provided.  In addition I might mention, and this was urged extensively by the members of the Select Committee, that it is being made clear that the definition of a refugee will include a person persecuted because of his or her gender, sexual orientation or membership of a trade union.  I believe <Col N="707" /> that the new Bill fully meets the needs and legitimate expectations of applicants and I am confident that that view will be shared by the Members of this House.  Before I go into detail in relation to the new Bill, it might be of interest to the House if I were to outline the background to the decision to introduce legislation to deal with asylum seekers and refugees.</P>
    <P>Ireland acceded to the 1951 United Nations convention relating to the Status of Refugees in November 1956 and became a party to the related 1967 Protocol in November 1968.  Since our accession, we have fulfilled our obligations under both instruments, although the procedures to give effect to those obligations were administrative and were never placed on a statutory footing.  In the mid-1980s these administrative procedures were revised in consultation with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, usually referred to as the UNHCR.  The procedures were held to be legally binding by the Supreme Court in 1992.  However, it has been contended that these arrangements are not sufficiently transparent or formal to meet today's needs.  There is also a perception that because asylum seekers are a particularly vulnerable group of people it is in the interests of justice that their rights and entitlements should be clearly set out in a statute.</P>
    <P>In 1993, an interdepartmental committee was established to examine all aspects of policy and practice in relation to non-nationals.  Because of the importance of the issue of political asylum, the committee gave priority to this subject and produced an interim report which recommended that the existing administrative arrangements be put on a statutory footing, with the important addition of an appeals authority.  The committee also recommended that an independent body be established to examine and make recommendations on applications for refugee status.  The recommendations were accepted by the previous Government and incorporated <Col N="708" /> in the 1994 Bill.  They also form the basis of the new Bill.  Accordingly the Bill is designed to give statutory effect to our international obligations with respect to refugees and to introduce an independent procedure for determining who is entitled to refugee status as well as providing for an appeals system.  The 1995 Bill differs significantly from the 1994 Bill in the way in which it achieves this purpose.  It provides for new structures to give applicants an absolute right to be heard and it provides for additional procedures and safeguards in the determination process.</P>
    <P>At the heart of the Bill is the question of who is a refugee.  It is, therefore, important that we should be clear as to what is meant by the term &ldquo;refugee&rdquo;. The internationally accepted definition of a refugee is set out in the 1951 UN Geneva convention relating to the status of refugees, as amended by the 1967 Protocol.  It is this definition that is used in section 2 of the Bill which provides that &ldquo;a refugee&rdquo; means a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.</P>
    <P>When the 1994 Bill was before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, amendments were tabled to include within the definition persecution for reasons of gender, sexual orientation, or membership of a trade union.  The previous Minister for Justice was sympathetic to the suggested amendments and promised to examine the matter in consultation with the Parliamentary Draftsman.  We have followed up that undertaking and, as I mentioned earlier, the definition has been augmented by an explanatory provision in the definition section to the <Col N="709" /> effect that membership of a particular social group includes membership of a trade union and also includes membership of a group of persons whose defining characteristic is their belonging to the female or male sex or having a particular sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>The first substantive issue addressed by the Bill is the question of the legal status of a person recognised as a refugee in this State.  Section 3 sets out the statutory rights of a person who is declared to be a refugee.  These rights will apply to all persons already recognised as refugees in the State as well as to any persons recognised as refugees in the future.  Section 18, which I will discuss later, provides that these rights will also apply to close relatives and other dependent relatives admitted to the State for family re-unification purposes.</P>
    <P>Articles 3 to 34 of the Geneva Convention set out a number of specific rights which should be afforded to recognised refugees admitted into a State.  This is an aspect that is addressed in section 3 of the Bill and the general approach taken is to give recognised refugees rights similar to those held by Irish citizens.  Section 3, as is made clear from the first subsection, is not intended to be exhaustive.  It is only intended to cover issues which are particularly relevant to refugees or where there might be a doubt as to the legal entitlement of a refugee because he or she is not an Irish citizen.  Refugees will automatically have those legal rights which apply to all persons who are in this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Article 33 of the Geneva Convention provides that no contracting state shall expel or return a refugee to the frontiers of territories where his or her life or freedom would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  It goes on to state that a refugee who poses a danger to the security of the country or who has been convicted of serious crime and who constitutes a danger to the community cannot claim the benefit of this prohibition on expulsion or return.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="710" /> Article 33 is given effect to by section 5 of the Bill.  Indeed, section 5 goes further than Article 33 in that it applies to all persons, not just refugees, and it has been decided not to apply the second paragraph of Article 33 which prevents certain categories of people from availing of its protection.  The Government has decided that no person will be expelled to the frontiers of a country where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  The section is of general application and is not limited to applicants for refugee status.</P>
    <P>I might add that, regardless of section 5, when a person is declared a refugee under this Bill that person cannot be removed from the State.  It is only if that person's status as a refugee has been revoked in accordance with section 21 that the possibility of expulsion arises. Section 5 also incorporates a provision to put it beyond doubt that a person's freedom shall be regarded as being threatened if the person is likely to be the subject of a serious assault, including a serious assault of a sexual nature. This reflects concerns expressed during the select committee debate on the 1994 Bill that sexual violence can be used as an instrument of persecution.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the procedures for determining whether a person is entitled to refugee status.  The Geneva Convention defines the term &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; but the procedures to be adopted to determine who is entitled to be recognised as a refugee are left to the discretion of individual states.</P>
    <P>One of the main purposes of the Bill is to provide for statutory procedures which are not only fair but are seen to be fair and which fully comply with our commitments under the Geneva Convention. To this end, the Bill goes to very considerable lengths to ensure that all valid applications are thoroughly examined, that every applicant has the opportunity to put forward a case and that there is a comprehensive appeals procedure.  The primary purpose of the <Col N="711" /> Bill, therefore, is to safeguard the rights of applicants and to ensure that no valid application is rejected.  The State and the Government have an obligation to ensure that all applicants are fairly treated.  However, we also have a duty to make sure that the interests and safety of Irish citizens are not jeopardised. In addition, as a member state of the European Union, we have obligations to the other member states in this area.  The Bill has to take all these matters into account.</P>
    <P>The Bill must also ensure that the refugee determination process is not abused.  While we are all aware of the difficulties that can face genuine refugees in fleeing and escaping persecution, it would be foolish and irresponsible, however, if we did not also recognise that many applicants are seeking to escape from economic hardship rather than persecution.  We may indeed have every sympathy for such persons but it must be borne in mind that the primary purpose of the Bill is not to provide a solution to problems caused by economic situations but rather to offer protection to persons fleeing persecution. Of course, even cases involving economic hardship may not be clear cut.  There could be aspects of particular situations which would have to be examined to assess if genuine Convention grounds for seeking the protection of the State exist but such consideration must be undertaken in a way that ensures that the integrity of the asylum process is maintained.  This is something which the UNHCR, in its discussions with us, laid particular emphasis.</P>
    <P>There may, of course, also be people who apply for refugee status who pose a threat to the community.  This category would include a hardened criminal such as a murderer or rapist fleeing either prosecution or detention in another country and hoping to explain his or her forged documents or lack of documentation by claiming to be a refugee. Indeed, such applications have recently been made in Ireland.  It could also include a terrorist, or an agent working <Col N="712" /> on behalf of a foreign government, who might try to avail of the procedures to gain access to the country with the aim of engaging in political violence.  In addition, there are people who have gained international notoriety and are seeking a country of refuge.  The Government has a very important responsibility to protect the public and the national interest against such threats and, accordingly, powers to detain such people and in certain cases to prevent them entering the country in the first place must be provided.</P>
    <P>The Bill had to be framed to deal with all these types of applicants with the emphasis on the genuine applicant.  I consider that the right balance has been struck by providing an extremely open and fair system for dealing with applications for refugee status which will be subject to a limited number of essential protective measures.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to the details of the application procedures provided for in the Bill.  The first step for most applicants will arise when they arrive at the Irish immigration controls at one of the airports or ports.  The intention behind section 8 is that, if an immigration officer has reason to believe a person might be a refugee, he or she must be informed that they may apply for a declaration of refugee status.  The person must also be told that he or she may consult a solicitor and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.  Persons will, therefore, have access to independent advice before they decide whether they wish to apply for a declaration under the Bill. The onus is being placed on immigration officers to inquire of a person they believe may be a refugee as to whether he or she wishes to apply because a refugee fleeing from a country of persecution could not be expected to be familiar with our law.</P>
    <P>The situation will be slightly different for persons already in the State. Whether they are here legally or illegally, they will apply to the Minister for Justice and then be given an appointment for an interview with an <Col N="713" /> immigration officer.  At this point I draw the attention of the House to the provision in subsection (2) of section 8 which provides for the assistance of interpreters.  The corresponding provision in the 1994 Bill provided for the assistance of an interpreter &ldquo;where necessary and practicable&rdquo;.  When that Bill was discussed by the select committee last year, amendments were put down to the subsection because Deputies were unhappy with the expression &ldquo;where practicable&rdquo;.  They felt that it unduly limited what they saw as an essential right to interpretation in the interests of fairness.</P>
    <P>As Deputies may be aware, the provision was worded in that way to avoid putting an absolute onus on the authorities to provide interpretation on the basis that a person could refuse to co-operate and pretend not to speak any known language.  However, because what the Deputies wished to achieve was essentially the same as what the Bill was intended to achieve, it was agreed that the provision would be re-examined. The parliamentary draftsman was consulted and asked to provide a wording which would put the highest possible onus on the authorities to provide an interpreter but allow for the rare and exceptional case where a person refuses to co-operate with our authorities.  The wording in subsection (2) now refers to the provision of interpretation &ldquo;where necessary and possible&rdquo;.  I am satisfied that this will mean that interpretation will be provided in the normal course of events.  A similar approach has been adopted in relation to the other parts of the Bill that refer to the provision of interpretation for applicants.</P>
    <P>If a person makes an application for refugee status it will be referred to the Refugee Applications Board and the UNHCR will be notified.  However, before I go on to elaborate on how applications will be processed I should mention what will happen to the applicant while the application is being dealt with.  This is governed by section 9 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="714" /> If the applicant has arrived from abroad then, once he or she makes an application for a declaration regarding refugee status, the immigration officer will be obliged to give the applicant leave to enter the State.  I must emphasise, at this point, that the immigration officer is being given no discretion to refuse entry to any person who applies for a declaration.  It is also important to note that with the exception of Dublin Convention cases &mdash; I will explain the situation in relation to such cases later &mdash; once a person is given leave to enter under this section, he or she will be entitled to remain until either the application is withdrawn or finally determined. This is important for the applicant as it means he or she can remain during the processing of an appeal.</P>
    <P>However, under section 9(15) entry will be refused to persons who are the subject of deportation, prohibition or exclusion orders.  These will be orders made in respect of named individuals who are believed to have committed a serious crime or to pose a threat on security or public policy grounds.  Such orders are not and will not be made frequently and have to be made by a Minister, not an official.</P>
    <P>In general, however, all applicants will be admitted to the State and, as I have already mentioned, under section 9(2), will be entitled to remain until an application has been processed.  Similarly, a person who is already in the State, whether lawfully or unlawfully, will be allowed to remain until his or her application has been finalised.</P>
    <P>Applicants who would not otherwise be entitled to enter and remain in the State will be subject to certain controls which are set out in section 9(4) to (14).</P>
    <P>One such control is that applicants will not be allowed to work or go into business while their applications are being considered.  In most cases, as at present, the taxpayer, through the health boards, local authorities or central Departments, will carry the cost of housing and maintaining asylum seekers. It must be remembered that asylum <Col N="715" /> seekers are applicants for legal status in this country.  If they are granted this status, of course, they can work, but until such a determination is made it would be inappropriate that they should be allowed to work and establish themselves in the State.  We must be careful not to create conditions which could make it attractive to abuse the asylum procedures.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, immigration officers will not have any discretion to refuse entry to asylum applicants and, accordingly, the general rule will be that such applicants will be given free entry into the country.  However, if an immigration officer is clearly faced with a suspected foreign criminal or terrorist who is applying for asylum we do not wish to see such a person free to walk our streets.  Section 9(8) provides that, in the circumstances listed in the subsection, an immigration officer or member of the Garda Síochána may detain the person in question.  The 1994 Bill provided important safeguards in relation to detention in that every person detained had to be brought before a District Court which could order continued detention or release the person subject to certain conditions.  Because depriving a person of his or her liberty is such a serious step, additional safeguards have been included in this portion of the new Bill.  In the first place some of the grounds on which detention may arise have been amended.  Under the 1994 Bill, a person could be detained if he or she failed to establish his or her identity or destroyed or had forged identity documents.  During the debate on that Bill in the select committee, Deputies were concerned that these grounds did not take into account the situation of fleeing asylum seekers who might not have been in a position to obtain identity papers or whose only hope of escape was to use forged documents. The previous Minister for Justice accepted amendments to take account of such situations and they are included in this Bill.  The section had also been amended to provide that a person under <Col N="716" /> 17 years cannot be detained and the intervals at which continued detention must be reviewed by a court has been reduced to ten days from the 21 days permitted by the 1994 Bill.</P>
    <P>To return to the processing of applications for a declaration regarding refugee status, the question arises as to who will investigate the applications.  To ensure that the process is not just fair but seen to be fair, the Bill proposes that applications will be considered by an independent commissioner who will investigate each case to make a recommendation. Section 6 and the First Schedule provide for the commissioner who will be called the refugee applications commissioner.  The commissioner will have had at least seven years' experience as a practising barrister or solicitor and is required by the Bill to be independent in the exercise of his or her functions.  The commissioner will also have his or her own staff to assist in investigations and he or she will be in a position to provide an independent and objective assessment in each case as to whether the person concerned should be granted a declaration of refugee status.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the investigation of applications by the commissioner. The first step by the commissioner will be the appointment of an authorised officer to interview the applicant and to report on the application to the commissioner. This section gives an applicant an automatic right to an interview with an authorised officer.  While the 1994 Bill envisaged such an interview it did not give an applicant any specific right in that regard and it was possible for an application to be determined without the applicant having the opportunity to present his or her case.</P>
    <P>In addition to the interview and the commissioner's investigations the commissioner may seek the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs or the Department of Justice, or perhaps the UNHCR, in verifying the applicant's claim.  The applicant will, of course, be free to submit material or representations to support his or her application. <Col N="717" /> In every case the applicant must be supplied with the material and observations received relevant to the case so that he or she may rebut or explain any material which might not support his or her application.</P>
    <P>While an applicant will be given every opportunity to present his or her case, and to be aware of any material which might militate against his or her application, the question of adversarial proceedings will not arise.  It would be quite incorrect to envisage that there will be two competing sides in this process.  The role of the commissioner will be to investigate all applications in an independent and objective manner and this will work in favour of all genuine refugees.</P>
    <P>However, experience has shown that investigations of this type can be time-consuming as normally asylum seekers are from countries which are a considerable distance from Ireland.  Our European partners have found that a significant proportion of applications are manifestly unfounded.  This had led to considerable delay and expense in investigating such claims and has resulted in the investigation of genuine applications being delayed.  The UNHCR is familiar with this problem and the executive committee of the UNHCR programme adopted a conclusion in 1983 to the effect that national procedures &ldquo;may usefully include special provision for dealing in an expeditious manner with applications which are considered to be so obviously without foundation as not to merit full examination at every level of the procedure&rdquo;. The Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs of the European Communities, who are responsible for immigration matters, adopted a resolution in 1992 on manifestly unfounded applications for asylum.  In keeping with the UNHCR conclusion, and the EC resolution, section 12 provides for a special procedure for manifestly unfounded applications.</P>
    <P>If the commissioner forms the opinion that an application is manifestly unfounded, he or she may stop the <Col N="718" /> investigation and advise the applicant why the application is considered unfounded.  The applicant will have an opportunity, which includes the facility of an interview, to put forward the case that the application is not manifestly unfounded.  If the commissioner remains of the view that the application is manifestly unfounded he or she will recommend that the applicant should not be granted a declaration.  The applicant may, under section 16, appeal against that recommendation to the appeal board.  I would point out that the applicant does not have to prove that he or she is a refuge.  All that will have to be shown is that the application warrants a full investigation.</P>
    <P>An application that is not dealt with as manifestly unfounded will be the subject of a full investigation under section 13 where the commissioner will submit a report and make a recommendation to the Minister.  If the recommendation is negative, the applicant may appeal to the appeal board.</P>
    <P>Section 15 and the Second Schedule provide for the establishment of the Refugee Appeal Board.  It will comprise a chairperson who will have had at least ten years' experience as a practising barrister or solicitor, a representative of the Minister for Justice, a representative of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and two other persons.  The appeal board can, under section 16, either agree with a negative recommendation of the commissioner or reverse it.  In a case where the commissioner did not fully investigate an application because he or she considered it manifestly unfounded, the appeal board can direct the commissioners to carry out a full investigtion. One of the most important new provisions is in this section.  It provides that an appellant will have a right to an oral hearing before the appeal board. This is a significant change to the 1994 Bill which provided for oral hearings only at the discretion of the appeals authority.  It has been made because the Government believes that to be absolutely fair the procedures should enable an applicant to be heard by the persons <Col N="719" /> who will make the final decision on his or her case.</P>
    <P>The appeal board may direct any person to attend and produce documents for an oral hearing.  It may also permit the applicant to present his or her case through a legal representative.  The appeal board hearings will be held in private to protect the identity of applicants and their overall interests.</P>
    <P>To avoid any confusion I should explain that, if the Commissioner recommends that a person should not be granted a declaration, the Minister will not make a decision on the application until after the Appeal Board has had an opportunity to consider any appeal.</P>
    <P>Section 17 deals with the giving of a declaration that a person is a refugee. The importance of a declaration is that it is a formal recognition that the person named in the declaration is a refugee under the Geneva Convention and is entitled to the protection of the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister is obliged by this section to grant a declaration that a person is a refugee where the Refugee Applicatins Commissioner or the Appeal Board has recommended that the person should be declared to be a refugee.  The Minister can only refuse to give a declaration in the interest of national security or public order as provided for in the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the power to refuse a declaration under section 17 will be confined to the specific circumstances of threats to national security or public order where the Minister would be so advised by the agencies of the State responsible for such matters. Indeed, I would expect that it is a power which would be seldom used, if ever. Nevertheless, it has to be included to cover a situation where security information on an applicant, which by its very nature cannot be passed to the Refugee Applications Commissioner, becomes available to the Minister and which indicates that the applicant poses a serious threat to the State.  Of course, <Col N="720" /> the norm will be that where the Commissioner or the Appeal Board recommends that a person be granted a declaration the Minister will be legally obliged to give the person concerned a declaration.  Section 17 (5) deals with what happens to a person who has applied for refugee status but is found not to be entitled to such status.</P>
    <P>The approach taken in the Bill is that applicants who are refused a declaration are being put in the position they were in before their made their application.  If, before their application was made, they had no right to enter the State then, once their application has been considered and rejected by the Refugee Application Commissioner and the Appeal Board their right to be in the State lapses and provision can be made for their removal.  I should point out, however, that the provision has been significantly amended to provide for a situation where, although a person is found not to be refugee, there may be grounds for allowing him or her to remain in the State.  Accordingly, it will be open to the Minister to give that person permission to stay here on humanitarian grounds.</P>
    <P>However, where the person has been found to have neither a case for refugee status nor otherwise to have grounds to remain in the State, his or her removal from the State may be necessary.  I am anxious that the removal provision, no less than any of the other provisions of this Bill, should reflect the highest standards of natural justice.  Accordingly, the Bill contains new provisions to ensure that an applicant is given ample notice of a proposed removal.</P>
    <P>It is important that a country like Ireland should be generous in relation to the provision for reunification of families or refugees.  The Bill provides in section 18 that on application and verification of the family relationship by the Refugee Commissioner, a close family member of a refugee such as a spouse, parent or child may be granted permission to enter and reside in the State. This provision is similar to the provision in the 1994 Bill.  However, it has been <Col N="721" /> augmented by two important further provisions.  We are now providing that it is not only close family members who may be admitted to reside in the State but also other family members where a dependency relationship exists between the refugee and the family member.  In addition, we are providing that family members permitted to reside here will be entitled to rights similar to those which the Bill guarantees to persons granted refugee status.  These rights include the right to reside and travel freely.  In relation to health, social welfare, housing, education, employment, religious freedom and access to the courts, family members and refugees will enjoy rights similar to Irish citizens.</P>

      <P>Since the Bill is so lengthy and of such a technical nature, the remainder of my prepared script will be available to members.  I shall deal, on Committee Stage, with any questions raised on any of the sections.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind the work already undertaken on the 1994 Bill &mdash; particularly those comments made by all parties in the House in the course of the work of the committee &mdash; this Bill reflects the desire of my Department to afford refugee applicants to this country the highest standards of fairness and impartiality, while being consistent at all times with meeting our international obligations as a State and securing our national security.</P>

      <P>It has often been said that Ireland is the most difficult country to enter and the most expensive to leave, a sentiment not without some justification.  While the remainder of Europe embraces a multi-cultural ethos without great difficulty and while some people might be uncomfortable with it, it must be said that Ireland has remained in the Middle Ages with regard to the granting of asylum and the declaration of refugee status to people <Col N="722" /> exiled from their countries of origin out of fear of persecution or discrimination of one form or another.</P>
      <P>We must also face the fact that the smug idea that the Irish are incapable of racist bias has been shored up by hugely prohibitive red tape in the processing of applications for refugee status here. Persons displaced from their countries of origin have often become subjects of an even more obstructive and debilitating syndrome while waiting in a surreal haze of indecision as the powers that be decide whether or not to grant them refugee status.</P>
      <P>Against that background of indecision and injustice the previous Government introduced the Refugee Bill &mdash; one which the present Government now claims as its own &mdash; which is effectively a redraft of the Bill Fianna Fáil drafted early last year.  Despite having a ready-made model from which to work, the Government has prevaricated and procrastinated in a manner that shows quite clearly the priority it accords the problems the original Bill sought to address.  We must now face the Bill before the House and endeavour to move forward with it in as coherent, efficient and expeditious manner as possible.</P>
      <P>The status of refugees is an issue which should strike a chord with every man, woman and child here who has any grasp of Irish history, our history books being littered with the names and deeds of those driven from our country out of fear of persecution.  However, the downfall of history, all too often, is its relegation to the footnotes of modern times so that what appears to be a right of ourselves and our forebears is regarded as a luxury others scarcely deserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deference to some members of the rainbow Coalition Government who believe they are under surveillance, I should point out that in some countries certain people are under surveillance, are liable at any time to be lifted out of life by powers that oppose their stance on human rights or political issues.  Incidentally, I might say to those same <Col N="723" /> members of the Government who believe they are under surveillance, they are at present under surveillance all right, not by private detectives, but by the electorate.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill should provide a mechanism whereby persons who live in fear elsewhere can be allowed live in peace here.  We are familiar with the syndrome of people seeking to establish themselves as having refugee status elsewhere.  It is the luxury of watching disaster unfold elsewhere which, in large measure, has blinded as to the very valuable role Ireland can play in the provision of asylum to those people persecuted elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is now timely to do more than bemoan the inadequacies of others, to establish a pro-active stance ourselves, in addressing the problems of refugees who present themselves at our door seeking help.</P>
    <P>When enacted this Bill should from the basis of a sound future policy on refugees but the question remains whether or not it will so transpire. Section 3 deals with the extension of certain rights to those granted refugee status, seeking to confirm their right to enter into the workforce and to receive social welfare and health benefits once granted refugee status.  However, I have one difficulty with section 3 2 (a) (iv) which states that such a person, in relation to whom a declaration has been made and is enforced:</P>
    <P>shall have the same freedom to practise his or her religion and the same freedom as regards the religious education of his or her child as an Irish citizen.</P>
    <P>At first sight, while this would appear to be a generous, well thought out, pluralistic-based provision, I should like clarification on the right of such people, while awaiting a declaration, to freely practise their religion and have their children's religious welfare provided for.  A sinister interpretation of this section would simply consign such people to what I can only describe as a <Col N="724" /> never, never land, while awaiting a decision on their application, where basic human rights are suspended indefinitely.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in section 9 (4), the right of an applicant to leave the State during the processing of his or her application is restricted, it being made quite clear that such people shall not leave or attempt to leave the country without the Minister's consent.  This may be perceived as an unwarranted restriction on the rights of such persons to move freely.  While the purpose of this Bill is to monitor people's access to this country, it should not be construed as <i>carte blanche</i> to restrict their exit.  Would it not be more prudent to replace the necessity of obtaining the Minister's consent by requiring notification to be sent to the Minister?</P>
    <P>An amendment to this section declaring that the application of a person to be granted refugee status would lapse if he or she left the State before a determination of that application is desirable. That could be copperfastened by providing that a person could not renew an application if he or she were to have left the State pending the determination of the original application.  I am unsure as to our duty, if any, to the applicant's country of origin to ensure that he or she is sent back there if an application for a refugee status is refused.  The Minister might clarify this point.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the provisions of section 11 (6) and (7) dealing with the investigation of applicants by the commissioner. Those subsections reflect the classic legislation double-take where an ostensibly proper procedure is tempered and negated by a subsequent opt out clause.  Section 11 (6) provides that the commissioner shall furnish the applicant with copies of any submission, documents or representations made to the commissioner by any party regarding the application under consideration. That would appear to accord with the principles of transparency and openness as well as the ethics of fairness. However, a difficulty with that provision arises in subsection 7 which provides:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="725" /> Where information has been supplied to the Commissioner, a Department of State or another branch or office of the public service by or on behalf of the government of another state in accordance with an undertaking (expressed or implied) that the information would be kept confidential, the information shall not, without the consent of the other state, be produced or further disclosed otherwise than in accordance with the undertaking.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this section are open to wholesale abuse and provide a ready-made excuse for the authorities to refuse applications on the basis of information received regardless of whether it is sufficient to warrant refusal of an application.  The lack of a requirement to reveal that information to the applicant may provide the opportunity to refuse the application on spurious grounds which, because of the confidentiality aspect, are incapable of being properly monitored.  The last thing I or, I hope, any other Member would like to see is a situation where the refugee legislation might become a means by which applicants are refused refugee status.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 12 which defines the parameters of a category known as &ldquo;manifestly unfounded applications&rdquo; causes difficulty.  The scope for turning the refugee legislation into a preventative rather than a facilitating device appears to be present in that section.  I am sure the Minister will be aware that Amnesty International published a document setting out its objections to certain aspects of the Bill while generally welcoming it.  It also states that the category of manifestly unfounded applications is open to potential serious abuse and grave injustices. Amnesty International states that it cannot understand why all claims for asylum cannot be dealt with under the ordinary system.  It also states that experience abroad has shown that the use of fast-track procedures save neither time nor money.  I totally agree with the <Col N="726" /> observations and criticisms of Amnesty International in that respect.</P>
    <P>What the Bill will provide will be dictated by the manner in which we enact it.  We should use this opportunity to set up a reasoned and sensitive refugee policy which will be effective and fair.  We should view it not in isolation but in the context of Ireland's role in the new Europe and independently as a country which is probably more aware of and sensitive to the needs of problems of refugees.</P>
    <P>Other questions and areas need assessment and action, such as housing, basic welfare and health care while applicants are awaiting a decision on their application.  The establishment of resource centres is another issue which needs to be addressed.  Will we seize this opportunity to provide a refuge for those in fear of persecution or will we wallpaper over the obvious cracks in our refugee policy?  It is a choice which can determine the role Ireland plays in world affairs not only in coming years but into the next millennium.  What faults there are in the Bill may become apparent when it is enacted.  However, the most important single aspect of this legislation is the motive behind its enactment.  When this Bill becomes law the true test of its efficacy will be the manner in which individual applicants or those who are part of a programme will be dealt with.</P>
    <P>We are presented with a unique opportunity to reverse the general perception of Irish refugee policy by initiating one which is sensitive, reasonable and has at its heart the aim of protecting those who need it rather than immunising ourselves against the fears which others suffer.  We do not need to be thought of as a country to which it is impossible to gain entry, but rather as one where it is impossible to achieve tolerance of the violation of human rights.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to other criticisms of the Bill made by Amnesty International and ask the Minister to seriously consider the concerns expressed.  I am aware that the Minister of State, Deputy <Col N="727" /> Burton, has a great interest in this area and will do her level best to achieve the maximum protection of human rights through this legislation.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International observes that the Dublin Convention allows Ireland to send an asylum seeker to another European country in certain circumstances even if that results in the person being returned to the country from which he or she fled.  On Committee Stage the Minister may accept that there is a need for a separate provision guaranteeing that asylum seekers will not be returned to the country from which they fled persecution.  Amnesty said that it has documented evidence of that having occurred in the past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in Ireland.  It happened in other European countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonetheless, it is crucial that this legislation should take account of that possibility and that the law should be tightened to such an extent to ensure that could not happen to an applicant seeking refugee status.</P>
      <P>Amnesty International raised other concerns about the provisions of the Bill and there is no need to deal with them in detail because I am sure the Minister is aware of them.  It is important that its concerns would be expressed in this House to make the general public aware of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be churlish of me not to say that this legislation is welcome.  I also welcome the amendments to which the former Minister referred that were implemented by the Minister.  Although the Bill has been amended once, a new one introduced and the old one withdrawn, it should not mask the fact that further improvements could be made to this legislation.  I put the House on notice that Fianna Fáil will table further amendments on Committee Stage, having discussed the Bill in a constructive manner with interested groups and bodies. In general this is an enlightened Bill for an enlightened people who will certainly want to do justice to those who <Col N="728" /> are fleeing other countries out of fear and persecution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats warmly welcome this legislation, as we welcomed the previous Bill when it was before the House prior to the collapse of the last Government.  It is regrettable that it has taken a modern State such a long time to put in place appropriate procedures, in line with our human rights commitments under international conventions.  Over the years the State has been reluctant to enact proper legislation and procedures for asylum seekers.  This is a much better Bill than the previous Bill which we debated under the last Government.  It is an implicit recognition that the arbitrary secret and inscrutable procedures for asylum seekers practised over many years by the State would have no political support or the support of any member of the public in this modern age of adherence to our human rights commitments.</P>
      <P>It is particularly significant that we are putting these procedures in place this year when we commemorate the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine, which caused many generations of people to flee Ireland because of economic and political conditions.  In the 50 years that followed the Great Famine, nearly 4 million men, women and children left our shores.  Sadly this drain has continued ever since.  Its effect is felt daily in the lives of Irish people.  Generations of people are leaving our shores to make a better life, economically and politically, in new countries.  For generations our people have sought refuge in other countries from political and economic conditions which to them were intolerable.  It is a supreme irony that our country, by its laws, for many years denied people seeking asylum in Ireland that sanctuary and welcome which we have so vocally demanded for our own people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our record has not been good.  It has taken us almost 40 years to honour our commitments.  Article 14 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, to which <Col N="729" /> Ireland is a party, enshrines the basic right to seek and enjoy another country's asylum from persecution.  At best successive Irish Governments could be accused of inaction and apathy in this regard; at worst we have treated asylum seekers in a way that violates human rights.  We have treated them inhumanly in many cases.  We have denied them the protection we owe them under international law.  They have been incarcerated in Ireland, often in appalling conditions and we have denied them access to justice.  We have failed to meet many of the needs &mdash; medical, educational and social &mdash; of the few people we have grudgingly admitted into Ireland.</P>
    <P>The contribution which has been made by the non-governmental organisations such as Amnesty International, the Irish Refugee Council and many individuals over the years who have committed so much of their time and effort to vocalising the need to put in place procedures for people seeking asylum must be recognised by Members. For many years very few Deputies under successive Governments have taken an interest in the field of asylum law.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that many of the recommendations of those working on the ground &mdash; the Irish Red Cross, the Irish Refugee Council and Amnesty International, to name but a few &mdash; have been valued and included in the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister's speech displays a welcome generosity of spirit. I congratulate the Government for bringing forward a Bill which has that generosity and a degree of openness which was missing from the previous Bill.  This was well evidenced because of the good debate on Committee Stage of the previous Bill.  I am pleased the Minister has been willing to address the concerns I raised on behalf of the Progressive Democrats in relation to the special needs of those people who are in flight from persecution which they suffer by reason of their gender or their sexual orientation.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out on Committee Stage of the previous Bill, women may face a <Col N="730" /> huge additional difficulty in establishing their right to asylum because they may be in flight from gender-based persecution. This form of persecution is as real and as terrifying as any other but it has never been given explicit recognition under the Geneva Convention.</P>
    <P>The fear of persecution which entitles a person to asylum, under the Convention, must be based on a person's race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group of political opinion.  Gender-based persecution has never explicitly been recognised as entitling an asylum seeker to protection. Although some countries have intepreted &ldquo;social group&rdquo; as encompassing gender this is by no means the norm. Women are often the victims of forms of persecution which cannot be applied to men.  There are countries where women may be subjected by the State to forced abortion or sterilisation, for example in China.  There are countries where the State may provide no protection from rape by Government officials or forced marriage or bride-burning. There are countries where the State provides no help, protection or sanctuary for mothers who wish to protect their baby daughters from hideous practices such as female genital mutilation. The Bill, as previously drafted, would have provided no effective protection for women fleeing their countries in such circumstances.  Yet the terror and isolation of these women is as real in nature as the feelings of terror for people fleeing other forms of State persecution.</P>
    <P>Women refugees may sometimes face additional difficulties in establishing a claim to asylum by reason of the fact that their applications may be dealt with by all male boards, who may have an imperfect understanding of their experiences, difficulties and fears.  These women may come from cultures where it is customary for women to defer to men always and where men represent total authority.  They may have had experiences of rape, which may be highly relevant to their application for <Col N="731" /> asylum, but may not feel able to disclose that to a man.</P>
    <P>Field workers in Bosnia have stated that many of the women there find it almost impossible to tell of their experiences without the careful and gentle assistance by trained counsellors.  They are often so traumatised by what they may have gone through that any man will be an object of terror to them.  In practical terms, I hope women who come from cultures much more segregated than ours who need the encouragement and support of other women and skilled counsellors before they can tell their story will be sensitively dealt with by emigration officials.</P>
    <P>Training in international law and practice in relation to refugees will certainly be necessary for all those persons who are charged with dealing with refugees. I hope the Minister will consider some kind of training related to the particular needs of such women refugees.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the Minister's recognition that the traditional definition of refugee has sometimes led to extreme difficulties in the case of homosexual men or lesbians, in flight from persecution in their own country.  The persecution of gay and lesbian men and women around the world is well documented and, indeed, our record is not good.  We have only recently rid ourselves of the legislation criminalising homoxexual activity between consenting males in Ireland.  In certain Latin American countries gays have been subjected to torture and extrajudicial execution by State death squads.  In Iran, homosexual activities are punishable by death.  Amnesty International reports that in Mexico, Turkey, Costa Rica, Romania and other countries homosexuals may be subjected to arbitrary detention, torture and ill-treatment. When the previous Bill was before the House, many gay and human rights activists recommended to the Minister that protection be explicitly extended to gays and lesbians, but the request was refused.  I am delighted, therefore, that this Bill contains a <Col N="732" /> definition to include these categories of people.  The redrafted provisions will put the position of those fleeing gender-based persecution or persecution based on sexual orientation beyond any doubt, and that is to be welcomed.  In this respect, the Bill places Ireland at the forefront of progressive asylum practice and it is greatly improved in other respects also.</P>
    <P>In section 5, which relates to prohibition of refoulement, a basic concept in refugee law, has been greatly strengthened. In the first Bill, the State was prohibited from expelling a person from the State if it was likely the life or freedom of that person would be threatened as a result but it ignored the fact that the State remained at liberty to expel a person in circumstances where they would be subjected to violence which would not kill them.  The thinking seemed to be that it was appropriate to send them back to a country where they would be subjected to torture or other physical violence as long as it did not result in death.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage, we tabled an amendment which would have prevented the State from sending an individual back to a state in which his bodily integrity would be threatened.  I am delighted the Minister has taken on board the spirit of this proposal by inserting a new subsection which makes it clear that a person's freedom will be regarded as under threat if he is likely to be subjected to a serious assault, including sexual assault.</P>
    <P>Having tabled an amendment on Committee Stage of the previous Bill to give the Refugee Appeal Board discretion to admit additional family members, I welcome the fact that the definition of &ldquo;family&rdquo; for the purposes of family reunification has now been expanded.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the composition of the Refugee Appeal Board.  The original Bill proposed the establishment of a three person tribunal on which State interests were vastly over-represented. The new appeal board allows for the appointment to the five person body of <Col N="733" /> two independent persons.  It should be spelled out however, that the two persons, not being officers of the Minister or the Minister for Foreign Affairs, should be persons with expert knowledge in the field.</P>
    <P>I am pleased the new Bill provides for mandatory interviews by the commissioner's official.  The previous Bill simply gave discretion to the proposed refugee applications board as to whether the asylum seeker should be interviewed.  This was a serious flaw in the original Bill.  That this has now been addressed is one of the great strengths of the Bill before the House.  It demonstrates a real commitment by the Minister to improve practice in this area.  A number of areas in the Bill could be improved and I am sure we will engage in a fruitful debate on Committee Stage to improve certain technical aspects of it.</P>
    <P>Section 12 permits the board to dispense with a full investigation in cases where it considers the applicant's claim is manifestly unfounded.  This section is an improvement on section 12 of the previous Bill which only permitted an applicant whose application was regarded as manifestly unfounded to make written submissions to the refugee board.  This Bill permits the applicant to request an interview with the commissioner's officials and this is a welcome change.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Donoghue pointed out, the definition of &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; remains problematic.  The voluntary organisations also have difficulty with this definition.  However, the grounds upon which a refugee's application may be deemed to be manifestly unfounded remain largely the same as in the previous Bill.  These include cases in which the refugee did not reveal immediately that he or she had travelled under forged travel documents; cases where the applicant was untruthful in making his or her application and cases where the applicant gave what the Bill terms &ldquo;clearly insufficient detail to substantiate his or her claim&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The concept of manifestly unfounded <Col N="734" /> applications is used in other EU countries on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis and it is said that its use can be unfair to genuine refugees.  The voluntary organisations argue that it must be confined to clearly fraudulent claims.  I take the points the Minister made when she outlined the Government's position in this regard but the implications of this section will have to be teased out on committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The criteria in the Bill may fail completely to acknowledge the realities of life for refugees.  They are by definition, people whose status in their own country is irregular, people who have had to spin a tissue of lies to escape from their political tormentors.  The forged passport or the false identity papers, which the Minister would seek to use to bar their claim to refugee status, will have been their only method of escape and, in some cases, their only hope of life. When they arrive at our ports and airports they are tired and confused and sometimes they do not even know which country they are in.</P>
    <P>Refugees are traumatised vulnerable people to whom the idea of &ldquo;the state&rdquo; means terror, repression and tyranny. They may have been the victims of torture or other ill treatment and, therefore, they have a propensity to regard anybody in authority with great suspicion, particularly somebody asking questions.</P>
    <P>People with first-hand experience of working in this field are agreed that it takes time and sensitive treatment before the fears of genuine asylum seekers abate sufficiently to allow them give a full and truthful account of themselves. We have reservations about the provisions of section 12 which could deny the very people whom we are trying to assist the right to have their application investigated.  It could have the effect of riding a coach and four through the main benefits of the legislation.  This &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; obstacle could stop the whole process in its tracks.  We intend to discuss that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>We welcome the attempt to give some <Col N="735" /> latitude to people travelling with false documents or who have destroyed their documents by giving them an opportunity to demonstrate that their action was reasonable and in good faith.  That is an improvement on the position in the previous Bill.</P>
    <P>We are concerned that the words &ldquo;reasonable explanation&rdquo; are capable of a number of interpretations and I hope the Minister will accept amendments on Committee Stage to temper the severity of this section.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 22 may also be problematical.  It allows the Minister to implement the provisions of the Dublin Convention by ministerial order without debate by the Oireachtas.  There is a certain <i>déjà vu</i> about this debate &mdash; we seem to have gone through all of this before&mdash;but I remember having quite a lengthy discussion about the Dublin Convention and how the European aspect of asylum law is implemented in secrecy.  Many Members of the Oireachtas do not understand the implications of what is being agreed at Government level in the area of asylum law.  There is the domestic aspect with which we are dealing here, and the European aspect and many Members are not <i>au fait</i> with the status of agreements between this State and other EU countries.</P>
    <P>The Dublin Convention is an agreement between the member states of the EU which sets out the criteria for determining which state is responsible for examining an application for asylum lodged in one of the member states.  The convention envisages that, where an asylum seeker has lodged his or her application in what the convention regards as the wrong state, he or she will be returned to the state specified in the convention.</P>
    <P>The asylum procedures in several member states of the European Union fall far short of the ideal and indeed fall short of our provisions.  The definition of a refugee and the manner in which that definition is interpreted varies significantly from country to country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> For example, Germany has rather strict and inflexible rules for granting refugee status while other countries have more flexible and generous rules. If the Dublin Convention is implemented there is a danger that genuine refugees entitled to the protection of the Geneva Convention may be sent by the authorities in this State to another EU member state which will return them to the country from which they have fled.  For example, an asylum seeker who arrives in this country in flight from gender-based persecution and whose application, if it could be made here, would be accepted under our new rules might, under the Dublin Convention, have to be sent to another country which does not regard gender-based persecution as warranting refugee status.  This person may end up being returned to the country from which he had fled.  Obviously this is unacceptable and we will have to address this difficulty in the Dublin Convention on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>One of the first principles of refugee law is <i>non-refoulement</i>, to which I referred in the context of section 5.  This principle finds its expression in Article 33 of the Geneva Convention which provides:</P>
    <P>No Contracting State shall expel or return a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.</P>
    <P>The <i>non-refoulement</i> guarantee is expressly stated in the convention to be non-derogatable, that is it may not be the subject of a reservation by a state ratifying or acceding to it.  It covers not only direct <i>refoulement</i> to the country from which the refugee fled but also indirect <i>refoulement</i> or the sending of a refugee to a third state which will in turn return him to the state from which he fled.  The principle of <i>refoulement</i> is one of the cornerstones of international refugee law.  It is perhaps the single most important obligation assumed by <Col N="737" /> the State when it signed the Geneva Convention and is enshrined in section 5 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The member states of the EU are currently engaged in a review of asylum law with a view to harmonising it.  The Dublin convention should not be implemented in the State until this harmonisation has been carried out and only then if it is assured that the practice of all member states as well as the law conforms with the Geneva Convention. Given that the Dublin Convention is controversial and could, if implemented prematurely or in the wrong way, require the sending of genuine refugees back to the country from which they fled it must be discussed in a public forum before it is implemented in the State.  The proposal to introduce it by way of a ministerial order is undemocratic and I ask the Minister to reconsider it.</P>
    <P>A certain amount of tidying up could be done in regard to the position of people who have been given special leave to remain in the country while being denied refugee status.  Under section 17 (6) the Minister has discretion to allow non-refugees to remain here on humanitarian grounds.  This provision will be used with increasing frequency in the years to come.  The pattern of refugee movements has changed out of all recognition in recent years, with huge population groups fleeing from war, other forms of generalised violence or violations of human rights on a massive scale.  People who fall into this category may not be fleeing from the sort of personalised violence and persecution envisaged by the Geneva Convention but it would be morally repugnant to repatriate them forcibly.  While some of these people will be admitted as programme refugees&mdash;we have a good record in this area, for example, the Yugoslavian refugees&mdash;under this section many others will be given leave to remain here on a case by case basis.</P>
    <P>Another category of people who are not regarded as refugees may be given leave to remain in the country under section 5 which prohibits the Minister <Col N="738" /> from returning people to a dangerous situation.  People allowed to remain here under sections 17 (6) and 5 should be granted express rights under the Bill. Their status as people with humanitarian leave to remain here should be spelt out as they ought to have the same rights as proper refugees.  The Bill affords them no rights or formal status and this point needs to be clarified and addressed.</P>
    <P>The sections dealing with the provisions of legal advice and the assistance of interpreters should be strengthened. We regard it as very desirable that all asylum seekers should be entitled to free legal advice for the purposes of preparing their applications for a declaration or appeal.  The Bill is very technical and the provision of legal advice is vital if people are to make correct applications. There is little point in advising these people that they have the right to a solicitor if they cannot afford to pay for one.  Similarly, it is crucial for them to have access to a competent interpreter if they do not understand English.  Under the previous legislation the provision of interpreters was allowed only in cases where it was necessary and practicable.  This was an insufficient guarantee that interpreters would be provided and I tabled Committee Stage amendments which required the State to use its &ldquo;utmost endeavours&rdquo; to acquire the services of an interpreter where this was necessary.</P>
    <P>I am glad this formula has been applied in section 16 (11) (d) so that on the hearing of an appeal the appeals board must use its &ldquo;utmost endeavours&rdquo; to get an interpreter.  However, this requirement appears to be diluted at the crucial investigation stage.  I ask the Minister to clarify this point.</P>
    <P>Under section 8 the obligation to advise the applicant of his rights in a language which he understands and to conduct the interview with the assistance of an interpreter arises only &ldquo;where possible&rdquo;.  This provision may not be strong enough.  What is more worrying is that section 11 which deals with the investigation of an applicant's <Col N="739" /> claim does not give the asylum seeker any right to the assistance of an interpreter during the interview.  There is no reason he should be deprived of this crucial assistance at such an important stage of the process.</P>
    <P>Sections 9 and 5 require various kinds of notices in writing to be sent to the applicant which have extremely important legal consequences for him. There is no requirement on the State to ensure that these notices are in a language which the applicant understands. This is a serious flaw in the Bill.  Comprehensive facilities to address the needs of asylum seekers for legal aid and translation facilities at all stages of the application and appeal process need to be provided.</P>
    <P>The Minister has discretion to revoke a successful application on a number of grounds, including public policy. However, this is a residual executive power which should not be unfettered. The Minister's heart might be in the right place but we have to be very careful that the discretionary power which has the capacity to unravel a successful application is not unfettered.  The purpose of the Bill is to ensure the highest possible standards of human rights in deciding applications for asylum.  The discretionary power of the Minister to revoke a successful application on the grounds of public policy etc., is too loose.  I have a natural fear of giving unfettered discretionary powers to Ministers and this point needs to be addressed further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome this good Bill which can be improved further on Committee Stage.  I also welcome the generous tone of the Minister's speech. When these measures are put in place we can feel proud that we have adhered to the highest possible international standards for dealing with asylum seekers.</P>

      <P>Having listened to the contributions of other speakers, I have a sense of <i>déjà vu</i> about this <Col N="740" /> debate as there is very little I could disagree with.  In many ways Ireland will never become a favourite destination for refugees in that we always appear to talk ourselves down.  There has been reference to the poor performance of our economy and inclement weather. When the Bill is finally enacted&mdash;it is reasonable to assume the Minister of State will accept some amendments&mdash; we should have something of which we can feel justifiably proud.  It looks as if it will be a landmark in terms of the way we treat refugees.  I hope that instead of following the example of other countries they will follow ours.</P>
      <P>In the 1930s Jewish refugees fleeing from Hitler's Germany were turned away from this country by the Department of Justice on the grounds that they did not assimilate easily and posed a threat to public order.  In more recent times refugees were regularly incarcerated in Mountjoy Prison.  Deputy O'Donnell indicated that she has a difficulty with the granting of discretionary power.  That is an indication of the way in which it can be used.  While the Minister has shown goodwill her successors may not do the same.  There is, therefore, a need for us to proceed with care in providing for such a power in legislation.</P>
      <P>Historically, the land of a hundred thousand welcomes has been anything but for refugees fleeing oppression and persecution.  I have highlighted two instances where the refugees concerned must have been completely puzzled, having been assured by the people they had met that they would receive a warm welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reluctance to provide proper asylum procedures could perhaps be understood, but not condoned if Ireland was faced with a refugee crisis such as that which confronted Germany some years ago.  Ireland has never been and is never likely to be a favourite destination for refugees.  Currently, there are 564 applications awaiting determination.  When we consider the problems faced in other <Col N="741" /> countries we need have no fears in enacting this legislation.</P>
    <P>For many years the average number of applications was less than 100.  This scarcely constituted an avalanche; it was little more than a trickle.  Yet, for years those calling for the introduction of comprehensive asylum legislation were greeted with the persistent cry &ldquo;the Bill is in the post&rdquo;.  The 1994 Refugee Bill introduced by the previous Administration was deeply flawed.  I have made the point repeatedly that sometimes delays can work to our advantage and that we should take our time in considering legislation.  That is the case in this instance.</P>
    <P>In view of the concerns expressed by non-governmental organisations and the large number of amendments tabled during the course of the debate on Committee Stage it was decided to withdraw the 1994 Bill and introduce new legislation. This Bill is a vast improvement. The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, is to be congratulated for the efforts she has made to ensure that the procudures will be fair and transparent.  I do, however, have some concerns which I hope she will allay on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In recent years national initatives have been increasingly contrained by the parameters set down by the European Union.  In many cases this has been a force for social progress.  I am extremely concerned, however, that national human rights initiatives, such as asylum legislation, should be forced by instruments, such as the Dublin Convention, to conform to the lowest common denominator.  The Bill contains a provision whereby the Dublin Convention can be introduced by ministerial order and draws on so-called third country provisions throughout.</P>
    <P>Asylum laws very greatly throughout the European Union.  With total unemployment approaching 20 million, racism and xenophobia are on the increase with the result that many countries are pulling up the drawbridge and excluding refugees.  I share the concerns expressed by Deputy O'Donnell in this respect.  If the Dublin Convention is <Col N="742" /> enforced here, in some cases refugees will be returned to countries far less welcoming which will insist on their return to their country of origin.  That is a source of concern.</P>
    <P>Asylum laws in jurisdictions such as Germany and France are extremely restrictive and it is highly likely that a person who would be granted refugee status under the proposed Irish legislation could be refused when they applied in some other European jurisdiction. Under the Dublin Convention Ireland would be bound to return an asylum seeker who arrived from another member state to that jurisdiction, from where they might well be returned to their country of origin. While I recognise the constraints within which the Minister of State has to operate I hope she will include a provision to the effect that no asylum seeker will be returned to a jurisdiction from which they may be returned to a country where they may face persecution.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the provisions dealing with &ldquo;manifestly unfounded applications&rdquo;.  In particular, I am concerned that the applications of persons travelling with false, forged or stolen identity documents may be treated as manifestly unfounded.  Refugees, by definition, do not queue up in the passport office in their country of origin to obtain travel documents.  In many cases they flee with little more than the clothes on their back having given all they possess in return for forged or stolen documents, the means by which they can escape.  That is the reality for asylum seekers.  This is not recognised fully in the Bill and I hope it will be rectified on Committee Stage.  In her speech the Minister of State was generous and allayed some of my fears.</P>
    <P>I accept that the provisions in the Bill are an improvement on those included in the 1994 Bill in that an element of reasonable cause has been introduced. All the evidence shows, however, that a large percentage of refugees travel with irregular documentation.  The onus should, therefore, be on the State to prove that it did not have reasonable <Col N="743" /> cause for doing so.  In general, the conditions which may cause an application to be regarded as manifestly unfounded are too broad and may well lead to a genuine refugee being refused.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that a declaration once granted may be revoked if, for example, conditions change in the refugee's country.  We, more than anyone else, should know that a week is a long time in politics.  In countries where persecution is rife political change may be short lived.  A refugee whose declaration is revoked may be forced to return to his or her country on the basis that the political position has changed only to find he or she is the victim of persecution some months down the road.  It is unreasonable to expect a refugee who makes his or her life here, establishes a career and forms a new family to take up their roots and return to a country where they may not have lived for ten or 20 years.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the provision whereby asylum seekers are to be detained pending determination of their application.  This Bill is a major improvement on the 1994 Bill which provided for indefinite, repeatable 21 day detention orders.  Nevertheless if these provisions are applied in their most stringent form an applicant could be detained from the moment of arrival until the application is determined at a future date.  In effect a person who is neither charged nor convicted of a crime may be imprisoned indefinitely.  I urge the Minister to look at this section with a view to further limiting the circumstances under which an asylum seeker may be detained.</P>
    <P>The issue of interpretation has given rise to considerable concern and I am sure the Minister considered representations from various groups.  They make compelling reading.  It is important to make our concerns known to the Minister. In some cases asylum seekers will speak a European language probably English, French or Portuguese but in many cases they will only speak their <Col N="744" /> native tongue or have insufficient command of another language to enable them put their case effectively.  I know from experience that you need not be fluent in the language of another country to go shopping, etc. but it would be extremely difficult to explain a complicated matter to immigration officials or to the police.  We can imagine how it must be for refugees who arrive here, distressed and not certain of their rights. Their application may depend on their explanation and how it is received.  We can understand the necessity for interpreters and while I appreciate it is not possible to have interpreters for all languages every effort must be made to ensure a refugee's case is put properly. The provisions governing interpreters should be strengthened in the Bill and any information conveyed to an asylum seeker either orally or in writing should be in a language and form he or she understands.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provisions on the family the Bill is a considerable improvement on the 1994 Bill.  The inclusion of family members in any refugee legislation is important.  Persecution may be extended to include all those associated with the victim and this is particularly true in the case of family members.  That is why I am concerned that the definition of family appears to exclude a married child under the age of 18.  That is probably an oversight but when we consider the cultural differences there is every possibility that such children may still be a member of the family.  In many countries a child may contract a form of marriage at a very young age but still remain under the protection of his or her parents.  I would welcome an assurance that in such circumstances a married child will be included in the definition of family.</P>
    <P>An asylum seeker is entitled to legal assistance throughout the process and I welcome that.  Negotiations are ongoing with UNHCR with a view to providing such assistance.  However, refugees should be entitled to free legal aid and I hope that issue will be addressed.</P>
    <P>In finalising this legislation we have <Col N="745" /> an opportunity to put down a clear marker not only nationally but within the context of the EU which will ensure that Ireland is not part of the fortress Europe which we see rising around us. We can ensure that those who have been denied the most basic rights in another jurisdiction may find a safe haven here.  This Bill goes a long way towards achieving that objective.  Many of its provisions such as the absolute right to social welfare and other entitlements are unique and set new standards in international human rights practice.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as a perfect refugee Bill.  Those working with asylum seekers and refugees will always be concerned that there may be a loophole which may not cover some circumstances that may arise.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's efforts to cover all eventualities but I hope on Committee Stage she will take on board the concerns expressed by organisations such as Amnesty International, Refugee Council and Rescue Trust.</P>
    <P>We will not be the first port of call for refugees looking for a safe haven.  The majority of those who arrive here do so by default.  Either they want to go somewhere else or are under the mistaken belief that they will be warmly welcomed and treated well here.  This Bill ensures that in future we will be a land of a thousand welcomes.  If the Minister accepts amendments on Committee Stage we will have fine legislation which we can hold up as an example to the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in welcoming the Bill and congratulate the Minister of State on the fair and impartial way she introduced it.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs discussed many issues relating to refugees.  Yesterday we were privileged to have a delegation from Kuwait and discussed the plight of refugees in Iraq.  The Ambassador and Ambassador Designate from Croatia and Bosnia also spoke about the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly appropriate when commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Great Famine to remember the <Col N="746" /> huge numbers of Irish people who had to flee this country and became refugees. Many countries experience war and famine, often the result of human action or inaction, and people are displaced as a result.</P>
    <P>I hope some of the points highlighted by our spokesman, Deputy O'Donoghue, and others, will be taken on board by the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs at which a submission was made by an organisation known as Rescue Trust. That meeting heard horrific and courageous accounts by victims of torture who had to flee their own countries.  The Minister received correspondence from Rescue Trust in which it suggests that a specialist centre be made available in Ireland to provide therapy to help refugees cope with the torture and trauma they experienced.  The Minister of State was unable to respond positively on that matter but correspondence from the Tánaiste states that the Government does not envisage establishing such a centre.  The major concern of the Government is how to deal with refugees within existing resources.  This matter must be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear at the meeting the views of Senator O'Kennedy who referred to the Vietnamese refugees who came to this country when he was Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1979.  At that time the main concern of the Government was to provide accommodation for these people.  We must now do much more than that because we are dealing not simply with a question of accommodation but also health care, which in the case of refugees is not available under the general medical service, and special centres to help the victims of torture and trauma.  The meeting heard a particularly horrific account of the personal trauma of Mohammad Al Sadar, a torture victim from Iraq.</P>
    <P>It is most important that the points made by Rescue Trust are taken on board by the Government.  There is no assistance available under the medical <Col N="747" /> service for refugees living in Ireland &mdash; Amnesty International has also referred to this issue.  Rescue Trust is not requesting Barrettstown Castle-type accommodation but a compact building which, with the sanction of the Minister, could be made available by the Office of Public Works.  International donations and other assistance could be provided which would mean the State would not have to pay for the provision of such accommodation.  I support the proposal that we take in 1,000 extra Bosnian refugees, but we must provide the resources for them.  I hope the Government will respond in a positive way to the points made by Rescue Trust.</P>
    <P>At the meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs a submission was made by the Vietnamese Council in Ireland in which it outlined the problems experienced by Vietnamese people living here, particularly the question of families being split up.  That council is anxious that measures are taken to help unite families which have been split up. It is concerned about education standards and believes that with the proper education these people, who also experience difficulties with the English language, would be able to help themselves. Other suggestions made include the provision of information leaflets from Departments on health care and so on and a translation service, which would be of great benefit.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposals on interpretation services.  This Bill goes further than the previous legislation in that regard.  Regardless of the size of a community &mdash; the Vietnamese community comprises about 600 people &mdash; services and opportunities should be provided for it.  Every community wishes to have its own voice and culture and we should support them in that regard.  The question of therapy for victims of torture who had to flee their own country must be addressed and I hope the Minister will comment on that matter.</P>
    <P>The Harvard programme based in <Col N="748" /> Boston is an example of a measure that should be taken in this area.  The Government should consider correspondence issued to Rescue Trust by that organisation which works to help people who suffer trauma as such programmes are of great benefit.</P>
    <P>A committee of the Council of Europe which deals with migration, refugees and demography and which has published a number of reports defines &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; as a person or persons who have had to cross the borders of their territory of origin because they were hunted or threatened by the authorities there.  That is a very good definition with which we agree.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 1 and 33 together.  As the Deputies will be aware, the end-September Exchequer returns showed that non-capital supply expenditure to end-September is running somewhat below the expected trend.  This is due mainly to timing factors and it is anticipated that the outturn will be broadly in line with the Revised Estimates allocation.  My Department is continuously monitoring <Col N="749" /> the expenditure position in consultation with the various Government Departments.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that public spending in 1995 is on target.  While some additional spending pressures have emerged, such as the additional costs associated with higher than anticipated average numbers on the live register, I anticipate that sufficient savings will be available elsewhere to offset these extra costs.  I assure the House that very tight control is being maintained on the level of day-to-day Government expenditure.  I am satisfied that gross current supply spending in 1995 will be kept within the 6.9 per cent nominal increase provided for in the Revised Estimates for Public Services.  I do not intend, therefore, to take any specific corrective action to curtail expenditure in 1995.</P>
      <P>I remind Deputies that the decisions which the Government took last July on public expenditure are aimed at containing the growth in gross current supply services expenditure in 1996 within the 2 per cent real increase figure to which we committed ourselves in our programme, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> The decisions which the Government took on restricting the numbers employed in the public sector will achieve some savings in 1995 but the main impact of the decision will be felt on 1996 spending.</P>
      <P>Decisions about Supplementary Estimates can only be taken when it is clear that additional expenditure is unavoidable and that no savings are available elsewhere in the Vote.  In general, the position on most Votes in this regard is still unclear at this stage.  However, I am aware of some instances where supplementaries will be required.  I have approved to date Supplementary Estimates in respect of Vote 19 &mdash; Office of the Minister for Justice and Vote 13 &mdash; Office of the Attorney General.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 69 together.  Options for restructuring the State banking sector have been reviewed by my Department and are currently being examined by myself and a number of my Government colleagues. The role of An Post and of the credit unions is one of the many issues which have arisen during the review process. This is, of course, a matter which will be put to Government for decision.  It would be wrong of me to make detailed statements about what may happen until the matter has been resolved by Government.  However, I recognise that this process has been going on for some time.  I am very keenly aware of the <Col N="752" /> need to ensure that employees and management in the institutions which have been publicly linked with the restructuring process should not be adversely affected by uncertainty regarding the eventual outcome.  This also applies to the institution itself.  This is why I have been at all times available to those most closely involved and have had very numerous meetings with all the participants. My door has always been and still remains open to them.</P>

I have been patient because of the Minister's predicament of having had to find a new bedfellow.  However, I think this idea of &ldquo;hasten slowly&rdquo; has gone too far.  I could produce myriad quotes from briefings to journalists last February stating &ldquo;it is imminent and the work will be carried out next week or the week after&rdquo;.  Nothing happened. This has turned into a farce.  I suggested some time ago in a spirit of co-operation that it would be a decision to say we are not going ahead with this idea.  The likelihood is that with all the different items in the pot there will be a &ldquo;mixum gatherum&rdquo; decision bad for all the institutions concerned.

I think a hasty decision, simply to bring this matter to a close to avoid the problems to which the Deputy referred, would not necessarily be the best way to do business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> I regret that more work was not done on this matter prior to my having responsibility for the portfolio.  The sum of the considerations, particularly the consideration relating to the role of the credit unions, now a major player in the Irish financial sector for a vast number of our citizens, and the ongoing role of An Post which reaches out to an enormous number of people who otherwise would have no contact with the banking sector, was not in any way seriously addressed in the initial investigations which took place in the Department of Finance.  I assure the Deputy that I share his concern and that we will arrive at a decision as soon as is practically possible, but we will arrive at the best possible decision rather than the most obvious one.</P>

      <P>The idea of hastening slowly before making an overall decision is indeed a commendable one that should give great sustenance to politicians and business people throughout the country.  However, in this regard there are only so many options on the table, and they have been discussed <i>ad nauseam.</i> A very worthwhile article was written by a journalist in <i>The Irish Times</i> some time ago which read like a comedy in the Gaiety Theatre &mdash; Democratic Left were for one thing; the Labour Party were for something else.  All the options have been teased out and it is time to come to a decision, one way or the other.  Is it likely that this decision will be made before the end of the year, given that a spokesperson from the Minister's Department said on the radio programme &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; that the Minister was not going to factor in any sums relating to the sale of the TSB in his 1996 budget calculations?  This leads me to believe that the Minister does not expect anything to happen in the lifetime of this Government.  He should be honest enough to admit that he cannot reach a conclusion, that he is giving up on the idea and will leave it to a new administration.</P>

      <P>I would like to address <Col N="754" /> the last part of the Deputy's supplementary question.  It would be wrong to infer from that report that the 1996 budget was critically dependent on the proceeds of the sale of State assests.  The fact that this has not been factored in at this point in no way indicates that we are not making satisfactory progress in this complex area.  This is an area where public trust in the institutions is required, and nothing is more fundamental to public trust than their trust in the banking sector.  It is for that reason that I am endeavouring to ensure we come up with the right answer in the present climate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 57 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The White Paper on Education entitled &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo; was published by the Minister for Education following consideration by the Government, which included <Col N="756" /> consideration of its possible cost implications. My Department prepared observations on the White Paper in accordance with the normal procedure for submissions to Government.</P>
    <P>As already indicated in reply to previous questions from Deputy O'Donnell and Deputy Martin, the cost of implementing the White Paper is contingent on a number of factors including the time scale in which proposals contained in the White Paper are to be introduced, the outcome of discussions/negotiations with concerned interests and notably pay costs which in turn reflect numbers employed in the sector.  Because of these factors any costing of the White Paper is extremely tentative.</P>
    <P>The Government's position in regard to funding is set out in the foreword to the White Paper as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government will aim to provide, during its period of office, the resources for the development needs identified in the White Paper, within the framework of the budgetary parameters set out in the Government of Renewal policy document, including the acceptance of the Maastricht Treaty convergence conditions.  The amount which can be made available in any given year will have to be decided by the Government in the context of its financial position and its other expenditure priorities at that time.  In this context, the Government will have the opportunity to consider any potential which may exist to reallocate resources within the education sector in the light of demographic changes.</P>
    <P>Some of the changes proposed may involve discussions and negotiations with concerned interests.  In those circumstances I hope the Deputy will understand that it would be inappropriate to publish costings in advance of such negotiations.</P>
    <P>A very important aspect of the White Paper is the creation of a framework for <Col N="757" /> the management of the education system for which the Minister for Education intends to bring forward the necessary legislation.  Some of the important changes in this regard will involve the establishment of roles and functions which will not have significant resource implications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I regard it as unacceptable that, in a major expenditure Department for which a White Paper is produced involving nothing short of a revolution in the way in which education in Ireland is to be delivered, no figures of any kind were ever tendered to the public by reference to which they could make judgments as to whether they were going to get good value for money from any of the policy options outlined.</P>
      <P>Accepting the Minister's caveat that any costings must be tentative, would the Minister indicate the substance of the advice given to him by his Department on the cost implications of some of the proposals, such as the establishment of local enterprise boards, early retirement for teachers, etc?  Can the Minister give the House any indication whether we are dealing with tens of millions, hundreds of millions or close to a billion pounds between now and the year 2000?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is confusing two different Government procedures.  A Government White Paper sets forward a set of policy proposals to be implemented over an unspecified period of time.  A specific Government memorandum proposing to introduce a particular measure must, as Cabinet regulations require, come with costing and staffing implications.  Regarding this revolutionary White Paper&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; is not complimentary in my lexicon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy used the phrase.  Another one of the Deputy's favourite words is &ldquo;radical&rdquo;.  I am glad <Col N="758" /> that, revolutionary or radical, the Deputy recognises it is a major change. For its implementation in whole or in part over a specified time period it involves substantial negotiations with specific interests.  Staff interests currently within the Department of Education represent of the order of 80 per cent of overall costs.  It would not, therefore, be constructive or necessarily accurate to give a costing that would reflect the real costs at the point when such proposals are implemented. However, if the Deputy wants approximate costings on specific areas contained in the White Paper, I invite him to table questions in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Accepting that there is no rigid timeframe on the proposals, would the Minister accept that in essence the White Paper envisages a pattern of expenditure which, if implemented between now and the year 2000, would involve an extra £1 billion in spending by the Exchequer?  Would he agree that that does not conform with the material set out in the foreword to the White Paper and, in particular, with the restatement of the Government's commitment to the Maastricht Treaty convergence criteria?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's Programme of Renewal sets expenditure parameters between now and the end of its term of office, which is approximately two years from now.  It would not be possible, given the extent of the commitments in the White Paper to start to address the kind of question the Deputy has put by way of supplementary question.  The White Paper sets out a range of desirable things that should be done and, it is hoped, will be done in the course of time.  It is impossible to say at this stage when, in what context or against what cost background, they will be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that to evaluate whether we should make particular policy commitments that will entail expenditure in one <Col N="759" /> area rather than another &mdash; money is never freely available &mdash; and to afford the public an opportunity to evaluate the White Paper as a genuine proposal in the education field, it is essential that at some stage a member of the Cabinet should tell the people the approximate cost of implementing its provisions? Does the Minister also agree that proposals for the establishment of ten local education boards, with their inherent bureaucracies, may be revolutionary but in the wrong direction?  They are wasteful. Does he accept, therefore, that people are entitiled to know the cost implications of such increased bureaucracy in the control of education so that they may decide whether they wish to leave matters as they stand or proceed down the revolutionary path mapped out by the Minister, Deputy Bhreathnach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where the Deputy has been for the past few years. My colleague and friend, the Minister Deputy Bhreathnach, has engaged in one of the most open and democratic consultative processes ever undertaken in education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is unprecedented in terms of engaging not only the sectoral interests involved in education, but parents and the social partners, including farmers, employers and the trade unions.  As a result of that unprecedented process, a proposal published in the form of a White Paper was debated in the House.  It is now up to the Minister for Education to introduce specific proposals and, similar to other proposals introduced by a Minister in the present Administration, they must be introduced within the expenditure parameters to which the Government is committed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent informal meeting of the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers held in Valencia on 29-30 September provided Ministers with an opportunity to review preparations for Economic and Monetary Union.  As it was an informal meeting, no decisions were taken.  Nevertheless, the discussions which took place were positive for European Monetary Union.</P>
      <P>In particular, Ministers reaffirmed the commitment to the treaty provisions on European Monetary Union and specifically to the strict application of the treaty convergence criteria and the treaty timetable.</P>
      <P>There was also general agreement that the Council decision on which member states are to qualify for European Monetary Union will be taken on the basis of 1997 budget outturns rather than on the basis of the 1996 outurns or the 1997 forecasts.  These 1997 outturns, obviously, will not be available until early in 1998 and it is then that the decision will be made.  This will leave us with the remainder of 1998 to prepare for the irrevocable locking of exchange rates against the single currency which will take place from 1 January 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We also reviewed progress on the preparatory work for the reference scenario to be presented to the European Council in Madrid next December. The background to this reference scenario is that the Cannes European Council called for a plan of the main steps needed for the introduction of the single currency.  Work is proceeding at EU level and Ireland is participating fully in it.  In addition, the European Monetary Institute, the forerunner of the European Central Bank, is preparing its contribution to the reference scenario and <Col N="761" /> expects to finalise it by mid-November. Adoption of the reference scenario by the Madrid European Council will be a significant step on the road to European Monetary Union and the single currency.</P>
    <P>Finally, at Valencia, we made progress on the choice of a name for the single currency&mdash;a sensitive issue which is of considerable interest to the public in every member state.  While a final decision has not been made, we have significantly narrowed the differences of views on this question.  A recommendation will be made to the Madrid Council meeting on this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>As recent statements by German Ministers and the President of the Bundesbank indicate a hardened attitude by Germany on strict adherence to the criteria laid down for European Monetary Union, and as a difficult decision will have to the made by whatever Government is in office when the question of joining European Monetary Union arises at the end of the century, does the Minister agree it would be preferable for the Government to publish a White Paper spelling out all the options?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's constructive interest in this matter and I will reply in the same spirit.  However, we do not have the options to which he referred.  When the people voted for the Maastricht Treaty by way of referendum, they voted for us to join the single currency if we qualify on the day. Government policy since then has been directed towards ensuring that we will qualify.  As judged by the European Commission, who will make the final decisions in this regard, Germany, Luxembourg and Ireland are currently the only three member states who qualify. We have not negotiated, nor did we seek to negotiate, an opt-out clause as did the United Kingdom and Danish Governments, subsequent to their second referendums.  The Deputy's suggestion that there is a range of options is not in accordance with the <Col N="762" /> commitments we entered into under international treaty law.  However, there is considerable merit in his suggestion that we should publish a White Paper on the implications of European Monetary Union and the difficulties we will face if we join and others do not.  I would welcome such a debate and will give serious consideration to the publication of a discussion document, but not necesarily a White Paper, following the European Council meeting in Madrid at which stage the picture will be much clearer. I welcome the Deputy's constructive interest and I know there is great interest among the social partners in having such a debate.</P>
      <P>The Germans have not hardened their attitude on convergence criteria. They merely restated their position in an impeccably logical manner, namely, that there is no point in economies qualifying to converge on the day in question and shortly afterwards being relegated to the second division.  That would not be in the interest of anybody. It was stated at Valencia that if European Monetary Union is to be maintained with any degree of success, convergence would have to be consistent and sustained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's response in regard to a White Paper.  I do not care what colour it is, but there should be adequate discussion on all the options.  I am aware that following the referendum on Maastricht, which took place when Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were in Government, we do not have an opt-out clause, but surely the Minister is not suggesting that if at the end of the decade it was not in our best interest to join European Monetary Union we would be compelled to do so.  If Germany maintain that stricter interpretation of the criteria is the only way countries will be allowed join, the Government must impose severe financial restraint, and given its record in the 1995 budget Estimates, I do not look forward to that.  I am pleased the Minister considers that all sectors of the economy should be <Col N="763" /> aware of the implications of European Monetary Union well in advance of our joining.</P>

      <Quest>if he has advanced his proposals for a national forum to discuss plans for the European Monetary Union; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to my response to a parliamentary question from Deputy Cullen on the setting up of a national forum to prepare for economic and monetary union on 28 June 1995, in which I stated that it would be premature to publish a policy paper on Ireland's approach to European Monetary Union, or to set up a national forum on the issue.</P>
      <P>The present position is that practical planning for European Monetary Union continues at both EU and national level.  The main focus of our attention remains for the moment on the work at EU level.  Following the Cannes European Council meeting in June, two working groups were established at EU level under the auspices of the monetary committee to further practical preparations for the single currency.  These groups have met a number of times and Ireland has been fully represented. Their work will provide key input to the reference scenario or plan of action being prepared for consideration by Heads of State and Government before the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are continuing our preliminary practical preparations in Ireland.  Discussions have taken place with the key <Col N="764" /> players in the initial moves towards a single currency &mdash; the financial institutions and the central public administration &mdash; since the publication of the European Commission's Green Paper, on the practical arrangements for the Introduction of the Single Currency, in May of this year.  I will be developing our process of consultation further after the reference scenario is agreed and at the Madrid Council meeting.  I can again assure Deputies that timely and wide-ranging consultation will take place with the relevant interests on the practicalities of the changeover to the single currency, which is obviously a matter of vital public importance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe, as Deputy McCreevy said earlier, that it is important that we have public discussion and establish a public forum on this issue.  European monetary union will have a severe impact on our economy, especially taking into consideration that certain factors are unique to Ireland and do not apply to France, Germany, Luxembourg or some of the other large countries in the European Union.  To say that we will have discussion six or twelve months down the line is evading the issue.  It is important that every sector in our society is advised of the benefits and down sides of European Monetary Union.  The Minister should produce a White Paper and set up discussion groups and arrange advisory meetings throughout the country at an early date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is not in a unique position in respect of the possible implications of European Monetary Union.  If the Deputy is, by inference, suggesting that because of our present currency relationship with the United Kingdom and the possibility that Britain may not choose to exercise her right to participate in 1999, we would be uniquely adversely affected, I have to tell him that at the Cannes summit, President Chirac berated the Italians for what he described as competitive devaluation <i>vis-á-vis</i> French interests.  Likewise, <Col N="765" /> French interests are complaining about competitive devaluation in reality, which the Spanish authorities, through the peseta, are engaging in against agriculture and food producers in southern France.  The Belgians have complained rather bitterly, as have the Austrians, about their difficulties with competition coming from other member states within the internal market of the European Union.</P>
      <P>Ireland is not unique, although special factors put us in the category of countries, like many others, who have asked the monetary committee in the European Union to look at what is described, following the French Presidency, as the problem of cohabitation between the currencies of founding members of the eurocurrency, on the one hand, and the currencies of states which are unable or unwilling to participate on the founding day.  This is a problem for the whole European Union and for the integrity of the internal market.</P>
      <P>With regard to waiting six months to a year, that is not what I indicated.  I suggested to the Deputy, in my response to the first question and to a supplementary question from Deputy McCreevy, that as soon as the reference scenarios are published, debated and discussed in Madrid, we will have a much clearer picture of the plan of action and the steps involved in moving from 1 January 1998, to 1 January 1999.  It would be incumbent upon any Minister for Finance to ensure that there is a full and open discussion with all interested sectors on how this system will impact on the Irish institutions, economy and consumers. I undertake, without reservation, to engage in and facilitate such debate, but it would be more productive and focused when we have a clearer picture of the steps that need to be taken, which we will hopefully have after the Madrid meeting.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister brought home to his EU counterparts the problems that will arise if a number of countries join the European Monetary Union on the founding date and <Col N="766" /> other member states do not?  If that occurs not alone will we have the difficulties to do with the currency but, since the expansion of the internal market, we will have countries able to trade in the internal market for whom, all the barriers have been broken down being able to retain a key instrument of economic policy&mdash;an exchange rate <i>vis-à-vis</i> other currencies&mdash;which will give them the enormous flexibility of being in the club yet outside the club.</P>
      <P>Given that the UK has specifically obtained an opt out clause and, as far as we can see, will not be joining European Monetary Union on the founding date, that will create enormous problems for Ireland.  It will create problems for other member states of the EU as well, and for the extension of the EU also, but for Ireland the problems will be enormous.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has put his finger on an important aspect of this debate.  The British refused to join the European Monetary Union if it were to start in 1997.  We know that is not going to be the case and they have not indicated what their position is in respect of 1 January 1999.  The last time there was an authoritative statement &mdash; it was made by the British Prime Minister prior to the summer recess in the House of Commons &mdash; Mr. Major was clear about keeping open his options in this regard.  We cannot presume what the British position is and we certainly cannot presume what it will be prior to their next general election.  If the British authorities decide in 1999 to refuse to participate in European Monetary Union, even though their currency and their economy are deemed to be qualified, they will be saying to the rest of the world that they want to reserve for themselves the right to continue to devalue sterling.</P>

The Irish problems will be compounded to an inordinate degree &mdash; possibly to an impossible degree &mdash; if the rules of the club were so changed that everyone would be a member of the internal market with free access to all of the European Union, yet the United Kingdom would have access to that market and have the right to devalue its own currency. The same applies to other countries that would be outside the European Monetary Union, but in our situation, given that at least 30 per cent of our exports go to the United Kingdom and a greater percentage of our imports come from the United Kingdom, it would put huge strains on the Irish economy and would be impossible to live with.  I advise the Minister to make those points clear in any discussiuons leading up to European Monetary Union.</P>

      <P>To respond to the direct question put to me by Deputy McCreevy, the debate in Valencia, the previous debate in Brussels and the debate we will have next week in Luxembourg were and will be precisely on the issue of cohabitation.  That is not unique to Ireland and Britain; it runs right through the entire European Union.  It has been given the title, by way of jargon shorthand, the problem of cohabitation, and it reflects, in even greater measure, the Austrian economy at present <i>vis-à-vis</i> northern Italy and aspects of the French economy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the devalued role of the Spanish peseta.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that there is a unique aspect to Ireland's situation and that is that, whereas all the other countries may not qualify for European Monetary Union in 1999, all of them are obliged, in the manner the Minister has suggested, to strive towards that end, with the exception of the United Kingdom?  Consequently, Ireland is in a unique position, because it is closely bound up economically with an economy that is not even required as a matter of EU obligation to comply with Maastricht convergence criteria.  Will the Minister agree that Ireland should not adopt the position internationally and at EU conferences on cohabitation that our problem is <i>jusdem generis</i> with all regional problems in the EU.  We have an economy which is much more closely bound up with sterling than the france is with the peseta or the Austrian mark is with the Italian lira.  We must, therefore, view any possibility that the United Kingdom will not join European Monetary Union as a much more fundamental problem from our economy's point of view that it is for virtually any other economy in the EU.</P>

It is essential that we focus our concern on improving our competitive position now so that in 1999, irrespective of who is in Government, the economy will perform effectively in competitive terms.  We can thus avail both of the opportunities the single currency will provide for us as well as warding off any dangers or threats implicit in other currencies not participating from the founding day.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to recent major drug finds off the south east coast; and if he will impress on the Revenue Commissioners the need to relocate a fully equipped seagoing Anti-drugs Unit in Waterford.</Quest>
      <QRef>[15239/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that between 29 August and 15 October 1995, ten bales of cannabis resin with a street value of some £3 million were recovered from the seabed off the south-east coast. Local trawler men have been assisting Customs in the continuing search and the Naval Service is also providing assistance.  In addition to this major drugs find, Customs also seized 30 kilogrammes of cannabis resin with an estimated value of £300,000 from two passengers who arrived by ferry at Rosslare Harbour on 1 October 1995.</P>
      <P>As the House was informed during the Adjournment debate on 7 June 1995, the Revenue Commissioners decided, for operational reasons, to relocate a customs maritime unit from Waterford to Cork.  This decision was influenced by the level of drug smuggling which had been encountered along the south west coast, and the fact that staff training for maritime duties is carried out in Cork.</P>
      <P>All maritime units are mobile and capable of being rapidly re-deployed overland to meet operational requirements. In fact, the craft located in Cork have operated in the Waterford region as and when required.</P>
      <P>The semi-rigid inflatable craft used by maritime units are suitable only for inshore use or for use close to the shoreline. A maritime unit would have no operational role to play in a recovery operation from the sea bed of the kind taking place off the south east coast or in seizures from ferry passengers.  The Revenue Commissioners keep the deployment of Customs resources under review.</P>

There was such a boat until an industrial dispute earlier this year when it was removed to Cork where two such boats are now <Col N="771" /> based.  The result is that cannabis smugglers have recognised a major gap in surveillance along our coast.  The Wexford/Waterford coast is now the main point of entry for drug smuggling. Cannabis finds of £3 million, to which the Minister referred in his reply, are clearly indicative of that fact.  The Minister should be reasonable and relocate the boat which was removed from Waterford into that port.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern about this matter which he also raised on 7 June by way of an Adjournment debate.  I am informed that since he raised that matter it has been looked at again.  In the judgment of those directly responsible for this operation, Cork is the optimum location at present for the location of two boats, having regard to the fact that the training unit is there, as well as the substantial amount of smuggling that has been going on along the south-west coast. However, in view of the information the Deputy has given to the House, I will bring this matter to the attention of the relevant authorities again to see if they are of a mind to change their position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Initially the boat was removed from Waterford to Cork because of an inter-union dispute which has been solved for several months past. In view of that, I would ask the Minister to relocate the boat to Waterford.  It is no coincidence that in Waterford District Court last week, according to the <i>Waterford News and Star,</i> there were 11 separate cases of people being charged with possession of cannabis.  The south-east region now seems to be the major area for smuggling cannabis into this <Col N="772" /> island.  In view of that, would the Minister review the strategy which, in my opinion, has gone badly astray?</P>

To avoid conveying the wrong impression, I assure the House that I have no function in the operational management arrangements of the Revenue Commissioners.

From what the Minister is saying it seems that these cannabis seizures could not have been made by Customs and Excise without the intervention of the Naval Service.

The Taoiseach has on a number of occasions raised this <Col N="773" /> matter with European heads of Government on the basis that it is a European problem and that Ireland appears to be a possible port of entry for drugs to the European mainland.  Our coastline is enormous compared to other countries and since this is a European problem, perhaps it requires a European response.  However, other member states, for reasons to which they are entitled, feel that the establishment of a European coastal service would be a further step towards a loss of sovereignty. I hesitate to think what the hysterical outbursts of Mr. Michael Portillo might be if such a measure was proposed.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer the Deputy's second question first.  I have had no such complaints.  The Revenue Commissioners have indicated, during the course of regular discussions which I have with the Commissioner and Deputy Commissioners, that there is an increasing level of compliance in the taxation system.  Part of that is related to the effectiveness of the audits.  If the Deputy has a particular concern, he should bring it directly to the attention of the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

As the Revenue Commissioners said, the level <Col N="775" /> of compliance since 1989 has been increasingly evident in the returns. Deputy Killeen may mean that in certain parts of the country there is no uniformity between inspectors of taxes who carry out audits.  Some people may believe that targets are set for different units of the tax system and that certain inspectors of taxes may be over zealous in trying to ensure they get their yield by the end of the month or the quarterly period.  Some inspectors may have the attitude that people must pay whether they owe it or not because they must get a certain amount of money by the end of their target period.  However, in general, revenue officers are very helpful and the system has worked well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not clear from the Deputy's question to which published criticisms she is referring.  As the <Col N="776" /> Deputy will be aware, both in 1994 and this year, the European Commission adjudged Ireland to be among the very small number of member states not to have an excessive deficit as defined in the Treaty on European Union.  The Government is committed to ensuring that Ireland continues to meet the Treaty convergence criteria for movement to Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
      <P>The excessive deficit procedure is set out in Article 104c of the Treaty. Briefly, it provides that the European Commission will prepare an opinion where a member state does not fulfil one or both of the following requirements, namely that</P>
      <P>&mdash; the ratio of the general Government deficit to gross domestic product, GDP, should not exceed 3 per cent or, if it does, that the ratio has declined substantially and continuously and reached a level close to 3 per cent, or the excess over 3 per cent is small, exceptional and temporary;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the ratio of general government debt to GDP should not exceed 60 per cent unless the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching 60 per cent at a satisfactory pace. </P>
      <P>Ireland's general Government deficit has been below 3 per cent of GDP every year since, and including, 1989.  In addition, our debt-to-GDP ratio has been reduced from over 116 per cent in 1986 to under 92 per cent in 1994 and will decline significantly again in 1995. In view of these factors, the European Commission did not prepare an opinion on Ireland under the 1995 excessive deficit procedure because, as in 1994, the Commission rightly considered that Ireland does not have an excessive deficit.</P>
      <P>Ireland also comfortably meets the other convergence criteria which require member states to maintain low inflation, low long-term interest rates and exchange-rate stability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="777" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I imagine Deputy Quill is referring to German question marks over Ireland's likely eligibility for Economic and Monetary Union membership.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister happy that these convergence criteria are a fair reflection of Ireland's eligibility, having regard to the fact that there is a significant difference between GNP and GDP in Ireland and that while GDP has been chosen, much of the difference in GDP and GNP in Ireland is volatile and mobile money which might not be there in the long run?</P>
      <P>Second, would the Minister indicate whether the reasoning behind the convergence criteria would not also require us to take into account the extent to which transfer payments from the European Union improve our figures artificially and cannot be relied on to persist after 1999?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Those criteria were selected by all the member states in the run up to the formulation of the text of the draft treaty, subsequently ratified by them.  One could dissect the criteria and contend, within the Irish context, there is a gap between our GNP and GDP, but I am informed, in so far as this can be measured in percentage terms and attributing part thereof to transfer pricing, the gap would be less than 1 per cent.  Whether one takes GNP or GDP, our gross figure is very satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of transfers &mdash; I presume Deputy McDowell is referring to Cohesion Funds, from which all other member states receive substantial transfers &mdash; the bulk of the European Union federal budget, if I might describe it as such, is confined to expenditure on the common agricultural policy, of which Ireland receives a substantial amount, but in volume terms not anything like other member states.  If one takes the debt ratio criterion incorporated in the Maastricht Treaty and compares Ireland's total obligations with those of, say, Luxembourg, on paper Luxembourg would appear to have little or no debt.  However, if one then includes the <Col N="778" /> debt exposure of the Luxembourg Treasury to its unfunded pension sector &mdash; as the National Treasury Management Agency did in its most recent annual report &mdash; one discovers that that single figure debt in Luxembourg soars to somewhere between 60 per cent and 70 per cent.  I should say I am speaking here from memory.  We can all go behind the criteria and begin to interpret what it really means for individual member states but, in terms of savings and pensions provision for the future, Ireland's real exposed debt is very much more favourable than the stated figure and brings us comfortably onto centre ground.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat polemical and adversarial to pick those less favourable and ignore those more favourable factors than the external figures would suggest. At the end of the day, we must remember these are provisions of the Maastricht Treaty and it was agreed categorically, albeit at an informal meeting held in Valencia, there would be no revisiting them.  These are the criteria of the Treaty which will be enforced rigorously and adjudicated on fairly in all cases.</P>
    <P>Finally, the people who adjudicate on those criteria are not the Germans, the Italians or <i>The Financial Times</i> but the members of the Commission itself.  Subjected to that rigorous examination, we have been found to be compliant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to one of the measurement units deployed in this matter &mdash; the general Government deficit &mdash; in what sense does that differ from the public sector borrowing requirement?  For instance, with regard to the proposal to sell off local authority loans, are we not skating on thin ice? For example, if these were sold to a semi-State agency such as the National Treasury Management Agency or a semi-State bank, would that not involve an increase in the public sector borrowing? In what sense are we taking advantage of very narrow terminological escape routes in order to prove compliance with the 3 per cent limit this year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As he always does, Deputy McDowell has raised a very pertinent question.  An excessive Government deficit, as distinct from the Exchequer borrowing requirement, does necessitate our excluding the proceeds of the sale of assets.  This means that, in the current and preceding years, our Exchequer borrowing requirement has been assisted by the sale of different assets.  This year our Exchequer borrowing requirement is on target to be 2.4 per cent but, if one were to include the proceeds from sales of assets &mdash; as the Commission has done in this and previous years &mdash; the figure would be approximately 2.7 per cent.  I say that subject to the receipt of the final figures. However, it will be closer to 2.7 per cent than 2.4 per cent.  Self-evidently, that is more than the Exchequer borrowing requirement, but remains below the 3 per cent figure evaluated and adjudicated on by Brussels.</P>

Would the Minister agree that all evidence appears to indicate it is possible that a stricter interpretation of all the criteria laid down in 1993 will be applied?

There is always a question mark over whether Ireland will be a participant in Economic and Monetary Union, yet nobody asks whether Belgium will be a participant, the automatic presumption being that Belgium will be one of the core funding group even though its debt is over 100 per cent of its GDP.  I am speaking now from memory, subject to verification, but I think I am correct in stating that at present most countries' debt ratio is rising whereas ours is falling.  It is 92 per cent of the 1994 outturn figures and, subject to the final outturn for the current year, is anticipated to fall again by between 4 per cent and 5 per cent.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he proposes to take regarding the level of pension fund investment in the economy if the pension industry itself does not address the problems he perceives within the industry.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware of my recent call on the pension industry to increase its overall level of investment in the Irish economy.  Pension funds represent one of the largest segments of household savings in the country and, at the end of 1994, total assets held by pension funds amounted to nearly £14 billion.  However, over £5 billion or 36 per cent of these funds was invested abroad.  From the point of view of the Irish economy, I regard this as unsatisfactory for such a major supplier of capital whose position as such stems in part from favourable tax treatment. This state of affairs may not be in the best financial or economic interests of employee members of those pension funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no wish to intervene in the prudential management and investment policies of pension trustees who, after all, are required first and foremost to serve the interests of pension holders. Nevertheless, with the economy performing so well on all fronts and with many new commercially attractive investment opportunities likely to arise here in the short and medium term, I believe there is scope to increase the level of pension fund investment in the Irish economy.  I want to bring about a situation where there are much greater opportunites to invest securely the long-term savings of Irish employees in the high growth Irish economy, as a consequence of which, the best possible financial returns can be achieved.  We have had some success with the venture capital initiative under which nearly £50 million has been committed by the pension funds for venture capital projects over a five-year period.  It is now necessary to build on this development.  In coming weeks I will be holding discussions with representatives of the pension sector with a view to exploring how <Col N="782" /> further progress can be made in this area.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that employee members of pension funds have economic interests that are wider than a narrowly-defined financial interest of investment returns.  Tens of thousands of employees have been made redundant and as a consequence have lost their entitlement to all future investment returns from their pension funds and in many cases past investment returns as well.  Additional job creation is of vital personal interest to all private sector employees, not just for themselves, but also for their children.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the pension sector for its part has expressed a willingness to participate in this endeavour which is in all our interests.</P>

      <P>The question tabled by Deputy Nolan refers to the Minister's recent comments and, if I remember correctly, the same comments were made by the Minister's predecessors.  Is it not the basic problem that the trustees of pension funds are obliged to protect the industry's funds and it behoves them to make the safest possible investment, whereas it is the job of the Minister for Finance or any other Minister to encourage them to invest in a manner which is most beneficial to the economy, but the Minister cannot comple the pension industry to do as he and we all might wish?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not compelling fund managers to pursue a course of action which they would normally not pursue. I stated that clearly during a speech at the seminar to which the Deputy refers. I said I recognised that first and foremost fund managers have a duty to the pension fund and investors who expect to receive the optimum pension return on retirement.  However, we must explore with the pension industry what forms of new investment opportunity that meet its criteria can be established to meet their legitimate and paramount needs and the wider needs of the economy, including the broader economic <Col N="783" /> interests of pension holders, who should be able to retire in a vibrant full employment economy.</P>

      <P>Without wanting to be unduly sceptical, I sound a note of caution.  The staff of any individual firm are not concerned with the vibrancy or otherwise of our economy when they retire, when they consider the duties of their pension trustees.  They want the pension trustees to be cautious but to obtain the best return for the fund.  We should be slow to make noises&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that we should be slow to make noises which suggest that pension fund trustees can do anything other than choose what in their judgment is the safest and best investment for a fund? Would it not be more to the point if the Department of Finance applied its energies to identifying suitable investment opportunities and to stripping them of the current tax disincentives for such funds?  Will the Minister reassure me that there was no sense in his remarks concerning a threat that if he did not see an improved co-operative attitude from pension fund managers, their present tax status might be called into question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with much of what the Deputy said.  People who invest in pension funds do so on the basis that they want to secure their future in the most effective way possible. There was a time when we thought high nominal wage increases were equivalent to maximising a person's position even though those wage increases were associated with high levels of inflation.  We have all learned that bitter lesson.  Those who were not able to argue for high nominal wage increases were still subject to the high inflation rate brought about at the same time.  I have invited the pension fund <Col N="784" /> managers who have a primary duty which I respect, to tell us how we can address their needs which are paramount and those of their investors and customers for whom, ultimately, also I have some responsibility.  The level of investment of Irish pension funds outside the Irish economy is in excess of the UK level which is far in excess of any other investment profile in the rest of the European Union.  Regardless of the reasons for it, it is not in the overall interests of our economy.  If we can realign the interests of our economy with the legitimate ones of pension fund managers, we will have made progress. It was on that basis I made that speech at a pension fund seminar.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners are already alert to the need to tax profits from illegal activities such as dealing in drugs wherever it is possible to do so. As Deputies are aware, persons such as drug traffickers whose wealth has been derived from illegal activities do not advertise that fact and tend to distance themselves from the ownership of traceable assets, making it difficult to identify them and successfully establish a tax charge.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Revenue Commissioners, however, that in those cases where hard information becomes available to Revenue from the Garda, or otherwise, indicating the existence of significant wealth, investigations are undertaken with a view to establishing and collecting tax liability.  Even if it is not possible to identify the precise sources of the income, Revenue have powers under the Finance Act, 1983 to tax profits or gains from unlawful or unknown sources as miscellaneous income.</P>
      <P>It is open to Revenue, having established a previously undisclosed tax charge, to report the case to the DPP if sufficient evidence of evasion is available to sustain criminal charges. However, the burden of proof to secure a conviction in such cases would be just as onerous as that required for any criminal case undertaken by the gardaí against drug dealers.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that, within their remit of collection and enforcement of tax liabilities, the Revenue Commissioners are taking appropriate steps in relation to the activities to which the Deputies refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 19 July 1995, following proposals made by the Minister for Justice, the Government decided that a joint review be carried out by the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda authorities of certain recommendations made by the Law Reform commission as regards co-operation between the two bodies.  The Law Reform Commission's report in <Col N="786" /> question was concerned with the confiscation of the proceeds of crime and in particular with the proceeds of drug trafficking.  The two recommendations of the Law Reform Commission to be dealth with are to the effect that the tax laws should be enforced with vigour against drug dealers so as to tax their illegal earnings and there should be greater mutual exchange of information between Revenue and the garda.</P>
    <P>It was further decided by Government that the report of this review be submitted to the Government within four months.  Preparation of the report is well advanced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply but he did not address the kernel of the question posed.  I am sure the Minister is aware there is a joint investigation unit comprising officals of the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners, but a unit comprising officials of the Revenue Commissioners and members of the Garda does not exist.  Do crime reports in Sunday and daily newspapers make the Minister unhappy?  The Revenue Commissioners seem to be intent on only bringing drug criminals into the tax net but not on inquiring into the source of their income.  Will he agree that the Revenue Commissioners have power to prosecute criminals for tax evasion and money laundering?  Will he agree that the negative image of thugs and gangsters involved in drug trafficking, growing rich in his and my constituencies and the obvious obsene display of wealth in property and cars adds glamour to criminal activity and attracts more people to it?  Will he agree on the need for a crucifying blow to dealers, the pushers and the godfathers of crime by publicly humilating them and dragging them from their ill-gotten ivory towers of wealth, their big houses and high powered cars and that the best way to do that is by establishing a task force comprising members of the Garda Síochána and officials of the Revenue Commissioners to speedily de-glamourise criminal activity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>A top level meeting took place between Government Ministers, the Revenue authorities and the Garda Commissioners in July.  It would be absolutely erroneous to suggest, as the Deputy has done, that the Revenue Commissioners were blind to and were not concerned with the criminality associated with drug trafficking.  I want to restate that it is open to Revenue, having established a previously undisclosed tax charge, to report the case to the Director of Public Prosecutions if sufficient evidence of evasion is available to sustain criminal charges.  It must be stated, however, that the burden of proof to secure a conviction in such cases would be just as onerous as that required for any criminal case undertaken by the Garda against drug dealers.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy has said, both his and my constituency share the crucifixion of drug trafficking, drug abuse and drug dealing.  The Deputy will also be aware that getting evidence that would stand up under rigorous cross-examination from a criminal defence lawyer is different from anecdotal evidence that people are living in their rich ivory towers.  If the Deputy has evidence of the kind to which his rhetorical question refers, I invite him to give such evidence, however anecdotal it might be, to the relevant authorities.  I am satisfied that the Revenue are working effectively with the Garda on this matter.  If the Deputy has evidence to the contrary, I assure him the Revenue would be anxious to be informed of such evidence so that they can move.</P>

Will he comment on newspaper reports that the Garda Síochána has dismissed claims by the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners of a good working liaison between both forces?  Will he comment on the claim that evidence is rarely passed to the Revenue Commissioners by the Garda?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the drug problem has been with us in Ireland for 15 years and that huge wealth has been accumulated by known individuals?  We have only to read about their lifestyles in our Sunday newspapers virtually to identify them.  Let us not ask if Deputies have got information. The Garda has all the information required.  Sunday newspapers columnisits have it, the dogs on the street have it.  Is it not unusual in 15 years of drug dealing that not one major drug dealer has been brought to book by the Revenue Commissioners?  This is not a new problem.  Is there any initiative at Government, Garda management or Revenue Commissioner level &mdash; there are dangers for the people concerned &mdash; to set up a joint Garda-Revenue unit that can target known individuals whose investments and properties are also known?  One of the main reasons for the spiralling drug problem is the huge profits that individuals are making and are getting away with.  I ask the Minister to disregard his prepared reply, to get in touch with the Revenue Commissioners, to raise the matter at Cabinet and to set up a joint unit.</P>

My experience outside the House as an accountant is that if compliant taxpayers had <Col N="789" /> additional assests which appeared out of nowhere they would be investigated inside and out, as Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, who is beside the Minister, can testify.  The Minister will be aware from our previous association that I have advocated a joint force as mentioned by Deputy Gregory.  It is strange that people who have extraordinary amounts of valuable assets can get away with it.  The Minister said criminal proceedings can be brought.  Regardless of whether criminal proceedings can be brought, surely our ordinary financial strictures can be imposed on those people as they would be imposed, and judgment sought by the Revenue Commissioners, on compliant taxpayers. Why is the same procedure not applied against people who are outside the tax net?  The view of many people, including fellow practioners, is that people who are not in the PAYE system get away with it.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I complimented the Minister on the Bill, which tries to deal fairly and impartially with refugees.  The legislation we are putting in place will be better than that of any other EU member state.  A report, drawn up by a committee of the Council of Europe, dealing with migration, refugees and demography, made the point that not all asylum seekers whose applications are rejected are automatically deported.  Different procedures apply in different countries. They may be granted refugee status, which I understand happens in the Scandinavian countries.</P>
      <P>In the United Kingdom, for example, there is a status known as the exceptional right to remain and in Germany one can get a temporary residence permit. Obviously these rights are substantially more limited than those granted under the Geneva Convention.  In the United Kingdom, refugees granted exceptional permission to remain in the country cannot be joined by their families for four years whereas those who have obtained their status under the Geneva Convention are immediately entitled to family regrouping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to <i>de facto</i> refugees &mdash; people not recognised as refugees such as migrant workers and students &mdash; they are in a similar position in that they are unable to return to their country of origin. Asylum seekers whose applications <Col N="882" /> have been rejected may also find themselves in a similar position.</P>
    <P>As far as the protection of refugees is concerned, the Geneva Convention and its Protocol are the cornerstone.  It is important to point out, however, that the European Convention on Human Rights helps to protect refugees also. Although that convention does not lay down any provisions on the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers, the European Commission and the Court of Human Rights have applied Article 3 of the convention which prohibits inhuman and degrading treatment of persons claiming they are likely to suffer persecution if they are returned to their countries of origin.  The court has repeatedly asserted that even if the right of asylum is not secured in the convention, these removal measures are likely to pose problems under Article 3 and also under Article 13 which secures the right to an effective remedy.</P>
    <P>The European Court has also reasserted the principle of family unity &mdash; I referred to that when I spoke about the Vietnamese refugees earlier &mdash; as laid down in Article 8 of the convention, which may protect migrant workers if they are deported or refused permission to enter a European state to join their families.</P>
    <P>In 1991 the Council of Europe received a delegation of asylum seekers whose asylum applications had been rejected in France.  They described the circumstances of approximately 100,000 African, Asian, Kurdish and Latin American people who had struggled to get the government to legalise their status.  On that occasion it was pointed out that under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights it was prohibited to return asylum seekers whose applications had been rejected to their countries of origin if it were likely to expose them to inhuman or degrading treatment.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to two particular international instruments, one of which was referred to by the Minister of State, the Dublin Convention and the Schengen Agreement.  The Dublin Convention, <Col N="883" /> often referred to as the asylum convention, lays down criteria for the consideration of applications and also provides for the exchange of information on asylum seekers between national authorities. Some doubts have been expressed about this because a number of provisions do not comply with the relevant international treaties, including the 1991 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals, with regard to automatic processing of personal data.</P>
    <P>The 1990 Schengen Agreement concerning the gradual abolition of border controls between member states deals more specifically with the free movement of persons.  Under these agreements, applications may no longer be considered by more than one signatory state.  That is an important provision and the Government must now outline its proposals in relation to the Schengen Agreement.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out also that we have asylum seekers here whose applications have been rejected but who do not wish to return to their countries of origin, as well as those whose applications have been rejected but who wish to return to their own countries.  We must examine how we can help people wishing to return to their countries of origin.  I am aware this question was addressed by the Council of Ministers on a number of occasions and in February 1993 the Council adopted measures providing economic assistance to countries which, because of their poverty, are major sources of illegal emigration.  The Council also drew attention to the need to help migrants who wanted to return voluntarily to their countries of origin. That might involve targeting refugees who are in a position to return and who will help build a democratic society in their own countries.</P>
    <P>Returning migrants must be given a foothold in society and an opportunity to re-enter the labour market.  That can be difficult because close co-operation with the country of origin is required, particularly those with high levels of <Col N="884" /> unemployment.  The host country, for example, might consider setting up a training body to help returning migrants.  It is important that these people have confidence in democracy and making jobs available to them will be crucial in that regard.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed here recently about Irish people who obtain employment in other European countries. The growing levels of unemployment in Europe afford ruthless employers the opportunity of exploiting illegal immigrants.  In many instances, a network of crime is established and it is important that we address that problem at EU level because we are really talking about disguised slavery.  Illegal immigrants cannot contest the wages they are offered and people are forced to work long, irregular hours.  There is wholesale exploitation of those workers and in many cases that can lead to organised crime, racism and xenophobia. The EU should set penalties for dealing with employers of illegal immigrants as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Bill has been placed on a statutory footing.  There have been many well publicised incidents of refugees arriving in this country, particularly at Shannon Airport, which were difficult and traumatic for those concerned.  I wish to pay tribute to the Red Cross which has carried out excellent work in that region to solve the problems of refugees, which are not always concerned with accommodation but with other factors such as health, education and the trauma endured by torture victims.</P>
    <P>Ireland has always been willing to help refugees.  Deputy Lynch said we were not the country of a thousand welcomes. She should have said we were the country of 100,000 welcomes; we may not be the best in that regard but we are certainly not the worst.  This legislation will help refugees and I compliment the Minister on bringing it forward. I hope some of the technical points we have raised will be dealt with on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation. We have put down in statutory form the best international practice and enhanced it with some developments of our own.  I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Burton, on bringing forward the Bill in its present format.</P>
      <P>This Bill has been a long time in gestation. When I was a member of Amnesty International in the 1970s and 1980s, much emphasis was put on getting arrangements between the Department of Justice and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees placed on a statutory footing.  Thankfully this is now being done.  I wish to congratulate Amnesty International on the high profile it gave this issue for many years and the Irish Refugee Council for doing likewise in later years.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a major step forward from previous measures in this area.  For example, Deputy Shatter's 1993 Private Members' Bill on refugee protection and the refugee Bill introduced by the previous Government in 1994 had many shortcomings.  The Government has at last achieved the proper balance in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I wish to give an example of how the procedures under the 1985 arrangement between the Department of Justice and the UNHCR did not operate effectively. A citizen of the People's Republic of China, Ji Yao Lau, was involved in the protest in Tiananmen Square and subsequently went on the run.  However, he was captured and put in prison where he was tortured.  When he was eventually released he again went on the run and managed to escape from China.  He attempted to join his sisters in the United Kingdom but unfortunately, arrived at Dublin Airport where he was detained by immigration officers who correctly suspected that his passport was forged.  While his nationality was being established he was detained in one of the two cells specifically allocated for the detention of aliens in the Garda station in Fitzgibbon Street.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While arrangements were being made <Col N="886" /> without his knowledge for his deportation to Thailand his sisters, on the advice of the gardaí, contacted his solicitor who helped him apply for refugee status.  He was imprisoned in Mountjoy from October 1990 until May 1991 at which stage the High Court ordered his release.  When I met him in prison he told me he thought Ireland was part of the United Kingdom and he had disembarked from the aeroplane at Dublin Airport so that he could catch a train Birmingham.</P>
    <P>Nobody told this man about his right to contact his lawyer and nobody contacted the United Nations High Commission for Refugees.  Why should a person who has applied for asylum be held in a cell for eight months?  I welcome the decision to put the procedures in this area on a statutory basis.  As far back as 1982 when I was a Senator I raised this matter and requested the Minister to introduce legislation along these lines.  It is extremely important that we are seen to adhere to international human rights and that we put in place procedures which ensure that natural justice is upheld, refugees are treated humanely and all applications are given proper consideration.  The section on refugees and asylum seekers in the Programme for Government states:</P>
    <P>Our policy towards the treatment of refugees, asylum seekers and immigrants will meet the highest international standards.  Procedures will be introduced to guarantee rights of hearing, appeal, access to legal advice and access to the courts.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Bill provides for all these measures.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that this legislation is being introduced in 1995 which marks the 150th anniverary of the Famine. Many of the people who seek asylum are fleeing from persecution and famine in their countries.  One hundred and fifty years ago many Irish people sought refuge in other countries to escape what was happening here.  It would have been terrible if they had been turned back at <Col N="887" /> Ellis Island or did not get beyond the Statue of Liberty in New York bay.</P>
    <P>It is important that applications for asylum are considered in a humane manner.  Our generosity should not simply extend to giving money to GOAL, Gorta and Concern to help them in assisting people in other countries who are being persecuted or suffering from famine.  It is important that we extend a welcome on Irish soil to the small number of people who seek asylum here.  It should be remembered that these are not economic refugees.  It is estimated that one million people are seeking refugees status in Europe on an economic basis.  We should adopt a Christian response to people who seek asylum here.  We are obliged to implement the 1951 United Nations Geneva Convention and the 1967 New York Protocol. It is important to look at the definition section of the convention to ascertain the progress being made in the legislation. It states:</P>
    <P>A refugee is a person who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside of the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to extend the definition of a &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; in the Bill beyond that required in the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol by including &ldquo;gender, sexual orientation or membership of a trade union&rdquo;.  This puts us ahead of other countries in terms of the definition of a refugee.</P>
    <P>Another key section deals with the way refugee status is determined under statutory procedures.  The two important aspects in this regard are the establishment of an independent authority to examine applications and the establishment of an independent board to hear appeals.  In 1991 only one of the 66 applications for refugee status was successful.  In many cases people were <Col N="888" /> not given a proper hearing before being sent back on a plane to their own counties. Given the lack of success in this area in the past it is critical that the procedures are correct.  In future each applicant will have a right to be heard. This is in contrast with the previous practice whereby peremptory hearings were held.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International states in its documentation:</P>
    <P>In Ireland, asylum seekers who make a claim upon arrival at a port of entry are interviewed, often on the same day they arrive, by an immigration officer who receives no special training in international refugee law or the special situation of asylum seekers.  Asylum seekers at a port of entry are not usually told of their right to legal counsel or their right to contact the UNHCR.  Moreover, the decision on their case is usually made by officials in the Department of Justice on the basis of the immigration officer's notes of the interview.  These officials, too, have no special knowledge of international refugee law or of conditions in the asylum seeker's country of origin.</P>
    <P>These matters are now being rectified. It is important that a proper applications procedure is provided for and underpinned by statutory provisions.</P>
    <P>It was proposed under the 1994 Bill to establish a one person appeals board, but under this Bill a five person board will be set up.  I am delighted that it also makes provision for oral hearings.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for the reunification of refugees with their families who will be granted the same status.  This is an important development.  This means that they will be treated as if they were Irish citizens and entitled to receive social welfare allowances and to be housed.  This should ensure a humanitarian approach is adopted in dealing with applications.  I hope problems will not be encountered when it comes to taking up employment.  In Britain a person with refugee status can apply for a <Col N="889" /> work permit after a period of six months.</P>
    <P>On the question of detention, it is expected that persons will not be detained for long periods and only where they are wanted in connection with serious offences, such as murder and rape, in their country of origin.  The period of detention will be reviewed after ten days.  The previous practice, whereby applicants for asylum were held for long periods in the holding cells of Cork, Limerick and Mountjoy Prisons pending a decision in their case, was totally unacceptable.  They were isolated and shunned and treated as if they were criminals rather than in a congenial or humanitarian fashion.</P>
    <P>Although I do not have the statistics, judging from newspaper reports and information supplied by Amnesty International deportation was practically the norm and the person concerned was sent home on the next plane.  That was a simple but crude and inhumane way of dealing with them.  It was a case of out of sight, out of mind.  That rarely happens now.</P>
    <P>The Irish Refugee Council and Amnesty International have voiced concern about the lack of translation facilities. This presents a major problem for refugees who, in the main, come from non-English speaking countries.  In the past there were no proper procedures to ensure interpreters were present at interviews.  I am satisfied that there will be an obligation under this legisation to provide such facilities to ensure applications are dealt with properly <i>ab initio.</i></P>
    <P>Today on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; the Minister responded to Amnesty International's queries about legal aid.  The Bill allows for the introduction of such a scheme to meet the needs of those who wish to apply for refugee status. This is a welcome development because, by and large, refugees are unlikely to have any money in their pockets.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the Dublin Convention under which refugees may be sent back to the member state from which they arrived and from where they may be sent back to their country <Col N="890" /> of origin.  In this regard the State should first show reasonable cause.  I will quote the Irish Refugee Council's description of the Bill:</P>
    <P>The Irish Refugee Council regards the introduction of the Refugee Bill 1995 as placing Ireland to the forefront of progressive international law and practive on asylum.</P>
    <P>That is what the Bill achieves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>In introducing the Bill the Government recognises the level of abuse, torture and ill treatment of people which is a fact of life in many countries.  In some instances people escape from these regimes.  Many flee from one state to another over land borders. There is access to Ireland from some of the former USSR states, the Balkans, Cuba and so on and a considerable number of refugees arrive here.</P>
      <P>I am glad this and the 1994 Bill seek to put the treatment of refugees on a statutory basis.  Most Members agree that no one should be sent back to their own country if the regime poses a real threat to them.  We must recognise the excellent work done by Amnesty International, the International Red Cross and the Refugee Council, sometimes in difficult circumstances with little support. They bring problem cases to the attention of many Members and go to enormous trouble on behalf of people they do not know.  In County Clare voluntary members of those organisations took people into their homes and looked after them at great inconvenience and expense.  They lobbied on their behalf for the introduction of legislation and this Bill is a great tribute to their work and persistence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many Deputies said we stand indicted for our tardiness in adopting the highest international standards and ideas and legislating for them, but in many respects we have a better record than some of our wealthier neighbours.  It is only right that this should be so.  Famine victims left this country.  Some would say they were economic refugees but in <Col N="891" /> many cases they would fall into a different category.  They were reasonably well received in other countries but this was not universally so.  Some of them suffered degrading and inhumane treatment and others managed to be successful in their adopted countries.  Against that background, it is incumbent on us to play our part and be seen to do so internationally.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to people who seek to escape economic hardship rather than persecution and the clear distinction that needs to be made between those two categories.  We encountered that in County Clare a little over a year ago when a substantial number of people from Cuba arrived here. The evidence seemed to support the view that they were economic refugees but I spoke to many of them and was not absolutely convinced that was universally so.  Some of them may have had genuine reason to fear returning to their own country.  They may not have feared execution but they feared persecution. It would be unfair to automatically treat people from a particular state as economic refugees.</P>
    <P>The procedures set out in the Bill should be applied as fairly as possible. The Commissioner has the right to bring consideration of a particular application to an end and that is important.</P>
    <P>It is rightly said that this and successive Governments should have exerted more pressure on American Governments to lift the blockade on Cuba which is why people leave their own country as economic refugees.  As well as bringing in a Bill to deal with the problem there is an onus on the Government to bring pressure to bear at international and UN level on Governments who contribute to the problem.  It is important that the integrity of the process be protected.  Section 22 provides for that.</P>
    <P>Despite this country's accession to the 1951 UN convention in 1956 and to the 1967 Protocol there was considerable disquiet about the workings of the procedures in this country.  People who <Col N="892" /> were close to refugees expressed grave concern about the manner in which they were dealt with.  The High Court case in 1992 was a major breakthrough and, in some respects, effectively established the Protocol and convention in this country.</P>
    <P>There is a weakness in the Geneva Convention in that while it defines the term &ldquo;refugee&rdquo; it does not set out the procedures to be adopted to determine who is entitled to be recognised as such. This Bill addresses that successfully.  It is interesting that the Bill benefited enormously from the debate on the 1994 Bill.  It is encouraging that so many Deputies took the time and trouble on that occasion to express their concerns and made a genuine input to the Bill. While there is pressure on the Oireachtas to enact legislation there is also need to ensure Members have an input to it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an excellent example of legislation which has wide all-party support. I forget the exact wording of the previous Bill but I was among those who expressed a reservation about the provision relating to an interpreter. Although the provision was strengthened in this Bill the Minister of State has explained why it is not absolute and I accept that.</P>
    <P>Another matter of extreme importance and of which we have some experience is the training of people dealing with refugees.  The role of the immigration officer and the commissioner is set out clearly in the Bill.  There is an important role to be played by people dealing with applicants.  Members of the House who have had experience of meeting refugees will understand the fears and difficulties experienced by them when they arrive in a foreign country, particularly when they cannot speak English.  Those whom I have met tended to have no more than a few words of English.  These people must be dealt with in a specialist and specialised way.</P>
    <P>The question of forged documents is well covered in the Bill.  Some people who seek asylum have gained access to <Col N="893" /> the country by using forged documents. It is important that possession of a forged passport or other document is not used as a reason to debar a person from applying for refugee status.  It may be difficult to deal with this matter but it should be considered on Committee Stage.  The Minister pointed out that in the past criminals have tried to get refugee status here by using forged documents. There is need for vigilance in that respect but there is also need to recognise that sometimes access can be gained only by using such documents.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the independent refugee commissioner is welcome.  It provides for accessibility and transparency. It is extraordinary that the appeals procedure, which is manifestly required in many instances, is frequently excluded from provisions. There is an absolute right for an applicant to be heard.  In that respect we are setting an excellent example for other states.  On the enactment of this Bill our provisions dealing with refugees will be among the best internationally.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deals with refugees' rights. Section 18, a very important section, deals with the rights of family members and the rights of families to be reunited. Section 3 does not lay down an exhaustive list of rights but I presume it is intended that the normal rights extended to citizens will apply to successful applicants.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with an area that needed urgent attention, that is the immediate problems encountered when a person first arrives at a seaport or airport. There was reason to be dissatisfied with this measure in the past.  It is now being put on a statutory footing which is welcome.  A person must be informed of his right to apply for refugee status and that he may consult a solicitor.  The UNHCR must also be informed.  People already in the State must apply directly to the Minister for Justice and there is an excellent reason for that.</P>
    <P>Section 9 deals with an area that poses considerable difficulties, that is the rights of persons awaiting determination of their application.  It sets out <Col N="894" /> their right to remain here during processing of the application and also who will deal with their needs during that period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this issue with the Minister for Health.  It is with depressing regularity that I raise issues relating to the reporting and investigation of allegations of child sexual abuse.  This matter is dealt with not only by the Minister's Department but also by the Department of Justice.  In the recent past church authorities have had to confront this problem in a most painful and public fashion.  Despite the recommendations of the Kilkenny incest inquiry report and a seemingly endless litany of revelations which highlight inadequate State procedures to deal with this criminal activity, there is much unfinished business in terms of the responsibility of civil authorities in this whole affair.</P>
      <P>This evening I specifically ask the Minister to give whatever information he has about the manner in which Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda dealt with allegations of sexual abuse of a patient by a hospital consultant.  Local general practitioners have stated that they are still in the dark, as are many people, about procedures used in the course of an internal inquiry by the hospital into the allegations of sexual abuse.  There have been reports that the hospital board closed the file following a four month internal inquiry without having interviewed the original complainant. What kind of inquiry would do such a thing?  Is it proper that the hospital board be charged with carrying out such an inquiry given the gravity of the allegations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is stated that the board relied on a contractual technicality which requires an allegation to be reported within six weeks of its occurrence.  That is an <Col N="895" /> absurdity when dealing with such a fundamental breach of the doctor-patient relationship.  Will the Minister confirm that it was only because of the intervention of the health board that the consultant in question retired?  I need many answers to this matter which do not all relate to the Minister's portfolio.</P>
    <P>When was the health board first made aware of these allegations?  Was it in April 1995 when the victim informed the director of community care of the North-Eastern Health Board that he had been abused in 1975 by the consultant? Did the health board alert the Medical Council, the Garda and the hospital on hearing of the allegation?  Is the Minister aware that a formal complaint was made to the Garda in this matter almost a year previously, on 16 June 1994?  Did the Garda report the allegation to the health board given that the complaints related to assaults allegedly occurring in the course of the consultant's professional duties in the hospital?  Is it the case that ten months elapsed, with a Garda investigation ongoing, without any formal contact between the Garda and the health board in this matter?  When was the Minister informed of these matters and what action did he take?  Has he made contact with the Medical Council?  Has he requested a full report from the health board?  Is the health board aware of other such allegations of abuse in the hospital?  Were other inquiries, internal or otherwise, initiated against this consultant in the past?</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister clarifies in so far as he can what he proposes to do to ensure procedures are in place in each hospital to deal expeditiously and in a uniform way with allegations by patients against hospital staff.  Such clearly understood procedures are important for staff as well as patients. Does the Minister agree that to treat such a criminal allegation in the same way as would be appropriate for a disciplinary or personnel matter is highly unsatisfactory?  It appears the hospital <Col N="896" /> in question dealt with this entire matter by way of the disciplinary and complaints procedures under the consultant's contract.  Is it fair to assume that this is the only procedure currently available to hospital boards faced with similar circumstances?  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I have been aware for some time of serious allegations against a staff member in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  The North-Eastern Health Board, which has statutory responsibility for child care, kept my Department informed about the allegations from an early date.  It also maintained close contact with the hospital on this sensitive issue and offered expert assistance to them in dealing with the allegations which had been raised.</P>
      <P>The health board's primary concern at all times was to ensure that no possible risk to the safety of children remained.  Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda is not a health board hospital, however, and it was a matter for the hospital management and owners to deal with the issues which had arisen in respect of one of their employees.  I understand that the health board was not happy with the investigative process being followed by the hospital nor did it feel that they were drawing on the full range of available outside expertise which was on offer.</P>
      <P>The position now is that the person against whom the allegations were made has retired.  The health board recognises that any possible risk relating to the circumstances around the original allegations has been dealt with by this retirement.  However, the hospital is currently engaged in a comprehensive review of all its procedures regarding patient contact.  The first phase of this review &mdash; dealing with the hospital's own procedures and examining best practice elsewhere &mdash; is almost complete and I expect it to be considered by the hospital board before the end of this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="897" /> In addition to the hospital's investigation, I understand the Garda are pursuing inquiries into a number of further allegations and have yet to decide whether they warrant referral to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The North-Eastern Health Board has also referred all formal allegations received by them to the Medical Council.  The procedures to be followed in cases of suspected child abuse are clearly laid down in the Child Abuse Guidelines circulated by my Department in 1989 and updated in April of this year.</P>
    <P>These allegations are extremely grave.  They touch at the heart of the privileged relationship of trust which exists between a doctor and his patient. I would not want there to be any doubt that I intend to pursue this matter rigorously and, once I have received the result of the hospital's own investigation and the North-Eastern Health Board's views on it, I will be insisting that the hospital take all necessary steps to ensure that this situation is dealt with satisfactorily and that no possibility exists of similar circumstances arising in the future.</P>
    <P>I will confirm the points raised by Deputy O'Donnell.  The Deputy mentioned a date on which the information was supplied in the first instance and I understand this is correct.  As I stated, a complaint was made to the Garda Síochána which was followed up by a full Garda investigation which I understand is ongoing.  The North-Eastern Health Board notified the Garda Síochána and the Medical Council of the complaints received and my official has informed me that the Department of Health was informed of the allegations in late June.</P>

      <P>Allegations have been made against a Cork city nursing home and in my view they require immediate investigation.  I have a signed statement in my possession but I have received two other detailed accounts of <Col N="898" /> conditions from two persons who are willing to provide signed statements.  I am pleased that the person who runs the nursing home in question, Woborn House, rang a radio programme in Cork confirming that she is happy that I am raising the issues surrounding the case in the Dáil.  I am doing so in the long-term interests of the patients and the nursing home.  Obviously, I have to be extremely careful even though I am speaking under privilege not to list the complaints.  Some of the complaints made are extremely serious and I am sure the Minister would like to have them investigated.  The allegations related to patient care and other issues in the home and I intend to furnish the details to the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Given that we are not certain of the sources of the allegation and that the sources may have their own agenda it is in the interests of the owner that she be given an opportunity to state her case.</P>
      <P>It is opportune to make a number of suggestions on nursing homes.  The patients' charter applies generally to hospitals and I suggest that it should be extended to nursing homes, convalescent homes, retirement homes and residential homes.  It is important that the monitoring of homes be rigorous.  I am aware the Minister has issued guidelines for nursing homes but the general view is that the examination is carried out at the early stages to see if it complies with the Health (Nursing Homes) Act and that if subventions are to be paid they are paid to a home that can give the necessary care and attention to vulnerable elderly persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister consider the possibility of setting up an independent visiting committee similar to that operating in the prison service as this would mean that a totally independent monitoring group would call intermittently?  We all share a common purpose that nursing <Col N="899" /> homes and convalescent homes should give the best possible care and treat the elderly with the respect and dignity they deserve.  I am sure the owners of such homes would agree with that.  They face the difficulty that allegations may be made against them from time to time and they would be happy in the knowledge that the levels of monitoring were such that there would be no questions to answer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for raising this important issue.  I will set out the legal position which enshrines the policy.  The Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990 which came into operation on 1 September 1993 has two principal objectives. First, to ensure high standards of accommodation and care in all nursing homes registered by health boards under the Act, and second to provide a new system of nursing home subvention so that dependent persons most in need of nursing home care would have access to such care.  The Act is a major step forward in ensuring that dependent elderly persons here will be well cared for. The Act provides the health boards with another option in meeting the needs of the dependent elderly locally and with flexibility.</P>
      <P>Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act all nursing homes which are for dependent persons are obliged to register with a health board.  Before placing a nursing home on the register the health board will inspect the home to ensure that it conforms with the required standards of staffing, accommodation and design.  Registration will help to ensure that high standards of nursing care will be the norm in every nursing home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Only officers designated by the chief executive officer or the deputy chief executive officer of a health board may inspect nursing homes.  The regulations require the health boards to inspect all homes at least once every six months. The boards may visit at more frequent intervals where this is felt necessary.  It is for the board to determine the timing <Col N="900" /> of the inspection, whether it should be during or outside normal working hours.  In most cases, good relations with homes should enable inspections to be carried out with respect for the operations of the home and the residents' welfare but to guard against any possible misunderstanding, officers carrying out inspections should carry written authorisation.  Any member of staff of a nursing home is entitled to ask to see evidence that the inspector is a designated officer.</P>
    <P>After each inspection a comprehensive report is prepared.  The registered proprietor should be informed in writing as soon as possible of the outcome of the inspection.  If a designated officer has found evidence of non-compliance with the Act or regulations, each instance of non-compliance and the date by which compliance is required should be given.  The consequences of continuing non-compliance, such as prosecution for breach of the regulations and/or a recommendation to the health board to refuse registration or to attach a condition to registration or the removal of the home from the register should be referred to.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the possibility of extending the charter of rights for patients in hospitals to nursing homes. The Deputy is probably aware of the code of practice for nursing homes which I launched recently and which was circulated to all members of the Southern Health Board.  &ldquo;The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly&rdquo; recommended that the Department, in consultation with the health boards and representatives of nursing home proprietors, should draw up a code of practice for nursing homes.  Work on the code took place in parallel with the preparation of the regulations to implement the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  The code was prepared by a working party set up for the purpose, comprising members of the health boards, the Irish Registered Nursing Homes Association, the Federation of Catholic Nursing Homes, An Bord <Col N="901" /> Altranais, the Council of Homes, the Department of Health, the Alzheimer Society of Ireland and the Carers' Association.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the code is to assist nursing home proprietors and staff, officers of the health boards and the general public to a better understanding of what is involved in providing high quality care to residents of nursing homes.  The code attempts to define what is currently considered to be good quality nursing home care.  It builds on the best practice in nursing homes at present.  While it is not explicitly directed at health boards, hospitals and homes providing long-term nursing care, it is hoped that it will be adopted by health boards and influence standards of care in their services.</P>
    <P>On Monday last, 16 October 1995, the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board received the first formal written complaint concerning the alleged lack of standards of care in this nursing home.  The chief executive officer undertook to investigate this claim and an investigation team has been established to examine the issue.  I will inform the Deputy of the investigation team's finding on this matter as soon as their report becomes available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the question of the failure of the Minister, despite his stated objective last July, to introduce a rescue package to help the vulnerable areas of the food sector which have been very much affected by the sterling exchange rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The food sector has struggled against the tide of international currency markets since the beginning of the year.  The Minister for Agriculture, Foof and Forestry, Deputy Yates, recognised the threat to jobs in the food sector, as did the industry itself, because of the rather uncompetitive rates we have <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling at the moment.  He particularly singled out our convenience food sector <Col N="902" /> as being at a severe disadvantage in the UK, and he stated that he was negotiating at Government level for a special package to help the sector.</P>
    <P>These truths still hold, but the Minister's promise has not.  A report issued this week by the Food, Drink and Tobacco Federation highlights the very serious consequences of the Minister's broken promises in this respect.  It states that in the UK market, worth £2 billion, five times more valuable than Germany, our next largest market, we face immediate and acute competitiveness problems.  Employment in both the processing and grocery sectors has been threatened, and if our UK market share is lost, the development plans of An Bord Bia and Forbairt will be largely undermined.  Existing jobs will disappear and future development of the industry will be very much at risk.</P>
    <P>We know from previous currency crises that sectors like the poultry and mushroom sectors can be very badly affected because of their almost total reliance on the UK market.  In the mushroom sector, for example, Monaghan Mushrooms has about 50 per cent of the market with sales in the UK of £1 million a week.  In January 1994 this company was selling into the UK at a rate of 95p to the £1 sterling.  Today they are trying to compete at a rate of 102p to sterling.  At a time when our inflation rate is 2.4 per cent Irish companies have endured a 7 per cent decline in competitiveness in 20 months.</P>
    <P>Last July the Minister identified the problem, at which he was very adept, but he has not delivered on his promises. This week's report from the Food, Drink and Tobacco Federation is all the confirmation required of the Minister's inaction.  The Minister has shown bad faith with thousands of workers whose jobs depend on selling into this market. This Minister can spent £1 million on many consultants in ten months in office but cannot or will not deliver on the basics.  He has undermined the development of the food processing industry and is jeopardising thousands of jobs.</P>
    <P>It is time we found out whether or not <Col N="903" /> the Minister will deliver on the promises he made last July.  Many sectors in the industry have been awaiting with interest the outcome of the Minister's deliberations.  His promises were unqualified and definite.  On a number of occasions since he came into office &mdash; it has become almost a signal of how he operates &mdash; the Minister identified problems and, having looked at the options suggested solutions quickly and expeditiously but then forgot about the problem.  He certainly does not deliver on the expectations he raises in order to assuage the various lobbies.  It is time we heard from the Department regarding what substance if any there is in the unqualified promises given by the Minister in the last couple of months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not make or break any promises.  I note also that the Deputy made no suggestions for solving this problem.  The only undertaking the Minister gave was to do whatever was within his capacity to improve the competitiveness and marketing capability of the Irish food industry.</P>
      <P>As already indicated in response to two recent parliamentary questions, improved competitiveness and intensified marketing are the appropriate responses to the rise in the value of the punt <i>vis-à-vis</i> sterling.  Generous financial assistance is available to the food industry for these purposes under the Structural Fund food sub-programme.</P>
      <P>The food sub-programme provides for a total expenditure of £640 million of which £284 million will come from public funds, both EU and national. This is a clear recognition of the importance of the industry and the measures set out in the sub-programme are those needed for its development.  These measures cover capital investment, research and development, marketing and promotion, and development of human resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> All the measures under the food sub-programme will contribute to increased competitiveness.  In the context of intensified marketing &mdash; the other essential element to which I referred &mdash; the annual funding under the marketing and promotion measure substantially exceeds that previously available.  An Bord Bia is responsible for the implementation of that measure and has in place a market development strategy that provides support for individual companies and for the development of the food industry as a whole.  In the case of individual companies, the aim is to enhance their marketing capability and performance and grant aid is available under two separate but complementary programmes.  The first of these is the marketing improvement assistance programme under which grants are available for promotions and image development, market research studies, market development plans, recruitment and placement of marketing graduates, attainment of quality standards and development of marketing skills.  The second programme is the strategic marketing development programme.  This applies to companies establishing a three-year market development strategy and provides financial assistance for test marketing, improved product presentation, product launch and promotion and staff development.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the measures I have outlined are the correct ones and will allow the industry to meet the challenges both in the United Kingdom and in other markets.  The resources provided under the different headings of the food sub-programme will be kept under review and appropriate changes will be considered if the need arises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to draw attention to the effective suspension of all schemes under the farm development service in County <Col N="905" /> Clare and the need for the Minister to provide additional allocation to enable staff resume farm inspections.  As the budget for such inspections has been spent none is currently being undertaken. This is creating genuine hardship for applicants awaiting final approval under the control of farmyard pollution, dairy hygiene and other schemes and, more importantly, for farmers who have completed their works and are awaiting sanction and grant payment.  Substantial sums of money are involved for some of those people.  Farmers now operate a business and must meet their borrowing targets.  This also affects the contractors employed to carry out the works.</P>
      <P>The control of farmyard pollution scheme has been dogged by financial difficulties.  Is this a delaying tactic to save the paltry amounts involved in paying expenses to officers or the relatively large amounts, plus interest, accruing to mainly European funds?  Having regard to their additional workload, I am surprised the officers have not sought to have their salaries subject to productivity assessment and substantial increase.</P>
      <P>As farmers have shown commendable commitment to improving environmental and hygiene standards under those schemes they must be supported and encouraged.  They must have confidence in the operation of the schemes.  A charter of rights for farmers must not be a meaningless document.  It must under-pin fair play and co-operation between the Department and farmers.  In response to a parliamentary question I tabled last week, the Minister promised to speed up the processing of applications under the schemes, but this is not happening.  The schemes have effectively collapsed in County Clare.  The matter was brought to the Minister's attention during his recent visit to the county and it has also been brought to his attention by the farming organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Minister to restore the schemes immediately by providing <Col N="906" /> additional finance to allow officers resume work and pay farmers what they are owed.  I am pleased the Minister of State is present because, as a man from the west, he should understand the impact of such schemes on farmers in counties Clare, Kerry and elsewhere.  I am sure he is also aware of the difficulties farmers experience as a result of such delays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy's party had its way I would not be in a position to answer his question.</P>
      <P>I reject the Deputy's suggestion that Clare is being singled out for harsh treatment under any Department scheme.  Indeed as far as the control of farmyard pollution scheme is concerned, the Deputy will be aware that I inherited an inadequately financed scheme.  Therefore, the scheme had to be refinanced and the Minister recently announced a new package of financial arrangements.  This will result in an increase in the funds previously earmarked for the scheme for 1996 and 1997 from £20 million to almost £60 million.  Nevertheless, the performance in relation to all schemes has to be viewed against the need to keep administration costs to the minimum.</P>
      <P>The administrative budget system was introduced a few years ago and aims at improving efficiency by making departmental management more accountable for living within total administrative allocations decided by Government, and giving accounting officers and line managers the authority to determine priorities in regard to administrative expenditure without requiring Department of Finance approval at every turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am determined to ensure that my Department will meet its responsibilities to adhere to budgets unless there are significant reasons for allowing an excess on the budget.  Each officer in the FDS is given an annual budget for travel <Col N="907" /> and subsistence and in practice this system has worked satisfactorily.  Nevertheless, there are occasions when additional work arises and the need for some additional funding may be justified. My Department has examined the position in a number of areas, including County Clare, and it has been decided to allow for a limited increase in the allocations for these areas.  This should allow necessary work related to FDS schemes to proceed.  I emphasise that <Col N="908" /> the overall need to keep costs to the minimum necessary will remain a priority.</P>

      <P>It <Col N="791" /> is Government policy that civil servants retire on reaching the age limit for their particular grade&mdash;in most cases 65&mdash;and are not subsequently re-employed.</P>
      <P>Legislation on the Civil Service does, however, provide for the retention of civil servants after that age in very specific and limited situations.  In such instances the Pensions Abatement Act, 1965, which limits the total remuneration, including pension to that previously received, applies.  That Act also allows its provisions to be waived in exceptional circumstances where the Minister for Finance considers it to be in the public interest to do so.</P>
      <P>The number of persons so retained has always been small but in recent years I and my predecessors have reduced it further and since I came to office I have sanctioned no new waivers of the abatement provision.</P>
      <P>Some Departments employ people, including some retired civil servants, on a fee basis to perform specific tasks where the resources or skills are not readily available internally.  In general, the fees paid to the retired civil servants are calculated to produce the same effect as the Pensions Abatement legislation.</P>
      <P>There are two areas where these arrangements have been departed from.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General's Office which regularly engages barristers to provide advice or act on behalf of the State, has a delegated authority to pay fees at approved rates to barristers.  This provision has been availed of over a period to obtain the post retirement service of barristers previously employed as full time civil servants in connection with the drafting of legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has long had similar authority to employ qualified veterinary practitioners as temporary veterinary inspectors to carry out certain regulatory tasks in meat factories as and when required and remunerate them on a fixed fee per session.  I understand that 24 retired members of the Department's own veterinary inspectorate have been <Col N="792" /> so engaged in recent times on the basis of the same fee as is paid to practitioners generally and I have arranged that all future such engagements will involve a reduction in fees to take account of pension payments.</P>
    <P>Excluding the Civil Service Commission, which can engage in the region of 40 retired civil servants as chairpersons of interview boards in a period of a year and the temporary veterinary inspectors, the number involved is relatively low and would not normally exceed 30 at any one time.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies are aware, earlier this year I established a committee, which is made up of officials from my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, to look into the various issues involved with regard to the taxation of cross-Border workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee has met on a number <Col N="793" /> of occasions and has received submissions from various parties involved. As part of its work, it has examined the application of the relevant provisions of the 1976 Irish British Double Taxation Agreement.  In July, the committee met a number of Border county TDs and Senators, and earlier this week the Irish National Teacher's Organisation made a presentation to this committee.  In addition to this, I understand that a delegation from the Cross-Border Workers Association is making a presentation to the committee today.</P>
    <P>Once the committee has assessed all the relevant representations and submissions, it will then submit its findings and recommendations to me.  I expect that the committee will have completed its work before Christmas.</P>
    <P>However, as I have said many times before, the issues involved are complex, involving two jurisdictions, and the examination of the issues would take some time.  I would also emphasise that there may be no easy solution, since it may be impossible to come up with a solution which caters directly for the individuals affected and which is fair to all the taxpayers involved, that is, both the cross-Border workers and all other Irish resident taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The Deputy can be assured that as regards collection of tax the Revenue Commissioners have taken into account the fact that the committee is at present examining the issue.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 39 together.  A joint working group, representative of my Department and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, put forward recommendations last year proposing changes in the annual accounts of Government Departments.  These accounts &mdash; the Appropriation Accounts &mdash; are presented to the Dáil annually and examined by the Committee of Public <Col N="796" /> Accounts.  The working group's report was referred to the committee, because of their interest in the matter and the committee, having considered it, accepted the recommendations.  These are to be implemented on a phased basis over a three-year period, starting with the 1994 accounts.  The 1994 accounts, which were published in conjunction with the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, are now available in the Library.  Paragraph 1 of the report sets out the main revisions which have been made, while a statement of the accounting policies and principles followed in the preparation and audit of the accounts is also included.</P>
      <P>Since the joint working group reported, the Strategic Management Initiative has been launched and, in that context, further consideration is being given to financial management systems in Government Departments.  In particular, at the request of the Government, the Co-ordinating Group of Secretaries set up to oversee the Strategic Management Initiative is preparing proposals on public service reform generally, including proposals for reform of our financial management systems.  It is expected that these proposals will be submitted by the end of October to the Government for its consideration.  In addition, a pilot project on accrual accounting is under way, with the assistance of a commercial accountancy firm, in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  It is expected that the results of this project will be available early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing statutory requirements specify that Government accounting shall be on a cash basis.  The changes already introduced and any further changes at present contemplated will enhance the cash information rather than replace it. Accordingly, amending legislation is not necessary at this stage.  If, in the future, amending legislation is being proposed, the question of publishing a White Paper can then be given consideration. In the meantime, my Department will keep the House informed, through the <Col N="797" /> Committee of Public Accounts, of any further significant changes that may be under consideration.</P>

      <P>There have been no discussion with the President of the European Commission, or with any other Commissioners, on the question of financing the Union's budget after 1999.  Such discussions, when they take place, would extend to all areas of the budget, not just to Structural Funds, and in the first place, would be based on a set of Commission proposals for a new budgetary framework. However, the Government is considering all aspects of future financing with a view to influencing Commission thinking in the matter.  Going on previous experience, I would not envisage the next round of negotiations commencing before 1998.</P>
      <P>In regard to enlargement, the European Council in Essen last December requested the Commission to submit, as quickly as possible, a detailed analysis of the effects of enlargement in the context of the Union's current policies and their future development.  This analysis is awaited.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The current position is that the terms of reference of various Oireachtas committees empower them &ldquo;to send for persons and papers&rdquo; but there is no legal compulsion on any person requested to attend or supply papers to comply with such a request.</P>
      <P>It is also the case that the level of privilege available to witnesses giving evidence to such committees or supplying documentation to them is limited and may, at times, inhibit the fullest provision of information.</P>
      <P>A scheme of a Bill to overcome these problems has been prepared in my Department and arrangements made to have it drafted in the normal way by the Attorney General's Office.  The final draft text of that Bill has become available in recent days and I expect to have that text and its introduction to this House approved by Government shortly.</P>

      <P>In 1987 Government decided that procurement functions, including the Stationery Office, should be combined in one <Col N="799" /> Agency for the Central Management of Government procurement under the Office of Public Works.  The Government Supplies Agency which came into being on 1 January 1988 controlled the funding for printing and publishing for all Government Departments up to the end of 1989.  From 1 January 1990 funding for publications was assigned to individual Departments and Offices and with it accountability for the proper expenditure of such funding.  The GSA retains responsibility for the negotiation and placing of all contracts for printing Government publications.</P>
      <P>The Department of Finance has overall responsibility for all Government procurement and in relation to printing and allied areas has issued instructions from time to time to all Departments to ensure the most stringent economies in printing costs.  The most recent reminder was issued in March of this year.</P>
      <P>As an aid to Departments the GSA issues general guidelines on how economies may be achieved.  When consulted the GSA will also advise Departments about particular possibilities for economy (paper size and quality and printing system).  It must be remembered that Government publications must be of a high standard of quality and attractiveness given their use as a means of dissemination of information on the workings of Government.  Many Government publications are of long-term interest and are used regularly for many years so there is also a requirement that they be of a durable quality.  Expenditure incurred in making a publication attractive can often be recouped by increased sales through outlets which might not be interested if the appearance of the publication was unattractive.</P>
      <P>In placing contracts the GSA seeks competitive tenders and selects suppliers on the principle of obtaining the best value for money for the individual Department in line with meeting their particular production requirements.</P>

      <P>It is incorrect to suggest that Ireland's employment performance is disappointing. The latest Labour Force Survery data indicate that in the year to April 1994 employment grew by 30,000. My Department estimates that employment will have grown by about 70,000, over the period 1993 to 1995.</P>
      <P>This is a very strong employment performance indeed, especially when compared with employment growth in the main OECD economies.  According to the latest published OECD forecasts, (June 1995), employment in Ireland will grow by an average of 2.3 per cent from 1994 to 1996, while the EU and OECD averages will be less than half of one per cent.</P>
      <P>According to the latest data, manufacturing employment increased by 10,300 in the twelve month period to March 1995.  Furthermore, the latest ESRI/IBEC surveys show that manufacturers are optimistic about future employment prospects.</P>
      <P>However, the Government is committed to increasing the rate of job growth as far as possible and has already introduced a wide range of measures for this purpose.  In particular, the main thrust of the 1995 budget was towards employment creation through reducing taxes and PRSI on employers and employees.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the allocation of £165 million ECU under the INTERREG programme for flood relief measures to promote international co-operation along catchment basins of rivers like the Rhine or Maas.</P>
      <P>It does not appear at this stage that any Irish schemes will be able to benefit from this allocation.  However, the possibility that some of this funding might be available to Ireland is still being examined.  The Deputy can be assured that in the course of the EU budget procedures my Department will seek to maximise the funding for Ireland under every possible heading, including funding to combat flooding if such funds are available.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 35 and 37 together.  The Maastricht Treaty specifies that GDP is the basis on which eligibility for the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union is to be assessed under the deficit and debt criteria. I am satisfied with this provision of the Treaty, and I wish to point out that the Treaty contains no scope for the use of any measure other than GDP in this context.  I am also satisfied with the quality of Ireland's statistics on GDP and GNP.</P>
      <P>The relatively large difference between Ireland's GDP and GNP referred to in the Deputies' question reflects the structure of this country's economy.  In particular, it reflects the level of profit repatriations from our large foreign-owned manufacturing sector along with the requirement to service overseas debt.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Note:</i> The &ldquo;other&rdquo; category includes changes in numbers employed.  It also includes variations due to, for example, variations in the timing of European Social Fund and other receipts, variations in the number of paydays in the calendar year, and the introduction of the Mayday public holiday in 1994.</P>
    <P>As regards the increase on average industrial earnings over the period, the hypothetical exercise which the Deputy wishes carried out would not show a true picture of pay movements between the public and private sectors.  Average industrial earnings relate to alimited range of private sector employment comprising operatives, maintenance workers, storekeepers, packers, cleaners and basic supervisory staff and apprentices in industry.  It does not relate to managerial pay or to pay in other parts of the private sector, such as the services sector.  In contrast, the public service pay figures include staff at all levels in the civil service, health services, the education sector, the Garda and the Defence Forces as well as in the non-commercial State bodies.  The use of such a limited measure of private sector pay as average industrial earnings would clearly form an inadequate basis for quantifying movements in total private sector pay and for making comparisons with movements in the Exchequer pay and pensions bill.</P>
    <P>It should also be noted that, in the period concerned, special pay awards which had been deferred under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> fell to be implemented.  To a large extent these awards represented &ldquo;catching up&rdquo; with pay movements in the private sector in the early to mid-1980s.  During the period, reports of independent review bodies on the pay of hospital consultants, the Defence Forces and the higher public service were also implemented.  The question of comparability of public service and private sector pay trends was considered by the National Economic and Social Council in its Report 96 <i>A Strategy for Competitiveness, Growth and Employment.</i> It recognised that &ldquo;the evaluation of trends in public service pay is sensitive to the time period <Col N="805" /> examined&rdquo; and, following an examination of pay trends in the economy since 1975, that &ldquo;wage determination mechanisms produce broadly comparable pay movements across public and private sector employment&rdquo;.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to implement the ESRI recommendations in the report entitled The Economic Effects of Carbon Taxes, 1992, namely that if a carbon tax along the lines of that proposed by the European Commission were introduced unilaterally in Ireland and the revenue used to reduce PRSI and compensate the less well off, then approximately 9,000 jobs would be created.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 42 and 60 together.  I presume that the paper that Deputy Byrne is referring to is the one which was presented at the Foundation for Fiscal Studies by the Deputy Director General of the European Commission Environment Directorate. I am aware of the substance of that paper and of IBEC's position on carbon-energy taxes.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of the Deputy Director General's paper is that taxes should be shifted from labour to energy.  IBEC, however, while supporting efforts to increase energy efficiency, considers that carbon energy tax would increase unemployment.</P>
      <P>The policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> states that, in the context of protecting the environment, a National Sustainable Development strategy would be prepared.  It will address all areas of Government policy which impact on the environment.  The same policy document also indicated that the Government will contribute to the preparation of a pan-European taxation policy on carbon and fossil fuel inputs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the benefits of shifting taxation from labour can be endorsed in principle, we would need to be assured about the full implications of additional taxation on energy products.  While the former would reduce the direct cost of employment, additional tax on non-renewable resources would inevitably cause an increase in inflation.  If, in turn, this were to lead to demands for higher wages in compensation, the benefits of reduced labour taxes could be quickly offset.  In addition, unilateral action by <Col N="807" /> either Ireland or the EU as a whole in this area could very likely result in some industries moving to locations which would not be as concerned about the environment, leading to loss of employment here.  This potential effect would need to be borne in mind in examining the overall effect on employment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the estimates of increased employment by the ESRI, I would refer to the reply given by my predecessor to a similar question of 1 December 1993 on this issue and to my reply of 25 January 1995 in which I explained that the ESRI's estimate of 9,000 jobs, in a study published in 1992, emerged from an illustrative exercise which envisaged unilateral adoption by Ireland of a carbon-energy tax applied at the rate $10 per barrel of oil equivalent for a period of ten years up to the year 2,000.  It assumed that all the proceeds of the tax would be applied to reducing PRSI contributions.  Because of the nature of the study, it could not address sector specific effects such as closure or relocation of plants in certain industries &mdash; effects which would diminish the positive employment impact found by the ESRI.</P>
    <P>As regards carbon-energy taxation proposals, the Government decided in June 1993 that Ireland should not oppose the principle of the introduction of an EU carbon-energy tax, provided that, inter alia, our concerns regarding the competitiveness of EC industry generally and of energy intensive firms that face competition from non-EC firms that are not subject to similar charges were satisfactorily addressed.  The European Council, meeting in Essen last December, noted the Commission's intention of submitting guidelines to enable each member state to apply a carbon-energy tax on the basis of common parameters if it so desires; the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers was instructed to consider appropriate parameters.  This approach is in contrast to previous efforts to establish a mandatory EU wide regime in this area.  The Commission has now <Col N="808" /> presented proposals in the matter.  They propose that a framework would be put in place to allow member states who wish to have such tax the opportunity to do so but no member state would have to actually charge the tax during a transition period up to 2,000.  However, at the end of the transition period, the Commission proposals envisage the tax being applied by all member states. These proposals are now being examined by Ireland, along with the other EU member states.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that with the abolition of systematic checks at internal frontiers on the introduction of the Single Market on 1 January 1993, there was a general redeployment of Customs and Excise personnel from border related duties. Accordingly, the cessation of violence announced by the paramilitary organisations last year did not give rise to any further deployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, as I have indicated to the House previously, a Customs National Drugs Team (CNDT) was set up by the Revenue Commissioners with the advent of the Single Market and in view of the increased role which Ireland is now required to play in protecting our own coastline as well as that of the European Union, in the battle against the illegal importation of drugs.  The CNDT, comprising over 70 staff, consists of intelligence units, operational units, maritime units and sniffer-dog units which are strategically placed throughout the country.  All units are mobile and employ the most modern means of communication and have <Col N="809" /> access to aerial and sea surveillance. These specialist officials supplement the general body of Customs and Excise staff who are also responsible for the detection and prevention of drug smuggling as part of their normal duties.</P>
    <P>Because of the vital role played by intelligence in combating drug smuggling, the Customs Service has devoted considerable attention to ways of enhancing intelligence gathering. Twenty eight staff of the CNDT are specially dedicated to this work.  The co-operation and assistance of trade associations as well as individual companies involved in the movement of goods and persons has been enlisted through the conclusion of Memoranda of Understanding. These are aimed at heightening the awareness of employees of airlines, shipping companies, freight forwarders, ferry companies etc. to the dangers of drugs smuggling and provide them with ready channels of communication with Customs.  There is also close international co-operation in the area of intelligence exchange.</P>
    <P>The deployment of resources is of course kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In this years Finance Act I provided for a number of changes in the operation of the residential property tax scheme which removed a significant number from the RPT net: the property value exemption limit was increased from £75,000 to £94,000; the income exemption threshold was increased from £25,000 to £29,500; the new thresholds will be index linked in future years, and the single 1½ per cent rate was restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also retained all of the reliefs <Col N="810" /> designed to meet concerns over the impact of the tax on certain households which had been introduced in 1994. These include: concessions for over 65s; concessions for widowed persons; concessions for incapacitated persons; a provision to deal with hardship cases; an easy payments scheme, and increases in the limits for marginal relief.</P>
    <P>These provisions were designed to ease the burden on certain households who might otherwise have experienced a degree of hardship.  However, it was recognised when these reliefs were introduced in 1994 that they could not cater for all situations of home ownership and that in removing one anomaly, other may have been created.  With the best will in the world, tax legislation will find it difficult to cater for all situations.</P>
    <P>All aspects of residential property tax, including the impact of the various exemptions and deductions allowed, together with any anomalies arising are regularly reviewed and I can assure the Deputy that his concerns will be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I would also like to point out that the <i>Programme of Renewal</i> indicated that the future of residential property tax would be considered in the context of the review of local Government financing which is at present being undertaken by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, the Minister for Environment.</P>

      <P>To address the issue of rising public service pay costs, the Government decided to review the whole system of public service pay determination, to make the system more transparent and to include assessment criteria which strike a balance between the needs of staff, the Government and taxpayers alike.  The <Col N="811" /> first step in implementing this new pay determination process was taken last year when a revised scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service was introduced.  The new features of the scheme included a three-person arbitration board and the introduction of agreed criteria, including the state of the public finances, to be taken into account at all stages of the process. There are new measures to ensure peaceful resolution of disputes and limitations on industrial action in the case of senior staff, those with personnel/management responsibilities and those involved in essential services. Arrangements are in train as regards the appointment of the members of the arbitration board.  The amended scheme for the civil service provides a model for the negotiations in other areas of the public service.  Negotiations are still in progress in the wider public service, and it is expected that revised systems of pay determination will be finalised in the coming months.</P>

      <P>The joint annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which took place in Washington DC from 10 to 12 October last, considered the major issues facing their member states and, in particular, the poorer and more heavily-indebted countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of debt was discussed at the Development and Interim Committee meetings immediately preceding the annual meetings and was also raised in <Col N="812" /> the addresses of governors in the course of the annual meetings.</P>
    <P>There was a broad consensus in the Development Committee, the Joint Ministerial Committee of the Boards of Governors of both organisations, that, while existing arrangements should be sufficient to bring debt and debt service for the majority of heavily-indebted countries down to manageable levels, the debt position of certain poorer countries may be unsustainable and that accordingly further measures should be explored to address their situation.</P>
    <P>Likewise the Interim Committee of the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund expressed deep concern about the plight of a number of low-income countries.  It called for the full and constructive implementation of the concessional &ldquo;Naples&rdquo; terms by the bilateral creditor countries and emphasised also the need to maintain sufficient flows of concessional assistance to low-income countries implementing strong adjustment and reform programmes.</P>
    <P>The question of trade relationships between the developed and developing countries was not directly addressed at the annual meetings.</P>
    <P>As Governor for Ireland, I welcomed the growing acceptance that the burden of debt may be a crippling constraint on the economic and social development of a number of very poor countries.  I welcomed also the work in hand within the organsations with a view to finding ways to help pay part of the obligations owed to multilateral creditors by those countries where action by commercial and bilateral creditors is not sufficient to restore debt sustainability.</P>
    <P>As I have no wish to see this problem &ldquo;studied to death&rdquo;, I also called for matters to be advanced, at least by the next meetings of the committees to be held next spring, when I would hope that concrete proposals could be put forward on an agreed basis by both the institutions to deal effectively with the debt problem.</P>
    <P>I also drew attention in my address to <Col N="813" /> the institutions to the need to bear in mind that economic development is not an end in itself: the object of the institutions' efforts in this area must be to improve the well-being of the people affected by the programmes and projects concerned.  The satisfaction of people's basic needs such as adequate food, education, and health care, must be a fundamental aspect of development initiatives and of macroeconomic adjustment programmes.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 55, 62 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputies have in mind measures to simplify customs export documentation.  In this regard, the documentation required to be presented to customs for exports to non-EU states is governed by EU rules.  The normal EU requirement is that these exports must be covered by a declaration on a document known as the single administration document, SAD, and be accompanied by a commercial invoice.  Further documentation such as export licences are required in particular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU legislation provides for simplified declarations to be made in certain situations. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they have availed <Col N="814" /> of this provision to allow export consignments up to £500 in value to be exported under cover of a commercial document, such as airline manifests, in lieu of the SAD declaration.  The facility is limited to consignments not exceeding £500 in value due to national statistical requirements.</P>
    <P>I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they have advised traders that EU rules would also permit the acceptance of simplified declarations for individual export consignments, irrespective of value, subject to the lodgement of a monthly supplementary declaration covering all exports in a particular month.  The Commissioners have advised me that so far, there has been no trade demand for this arrangement.</P>
    <P>The movement of certain exports to non EU countries via other member states involves the use of documentary control under the Community Transit Procedure.  This documentation consists of further copies of the SAD documentation. The transit procedure requires customs in other member states to certify the eventual exportation of the goods from the Union.  In order to simplify and improve the workings of the transit system there are plans at EU level to computerise the procedures involved.  Ireland had given full support to this initiative and is actively participating in the preparatory work to introduce a computerised system.</P>
    <P>In general, I can say that the Revenue Commissioners are keeping the scope for further simplification of trade documents under review in consultation with the Customs Consultative Committee which brings together representatives of Revenue and the trade.</P>

      <P>The Government established an inter-departmental committee in February 1995 which is chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, with special responsibility in the Office of Public Works, to co-ordinate its response to the effects of bad weather.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee has been considering the establishment of a National Response Plan to deal specifically with emergencies arising from flooding.  In the course of its consideration of the problem, the committee has become aware of the existence of a number of <Col N="819" /> plans to deal with different types of emergencies.</P>
    <P>These include a major emergency plan drawn up on a county by county basis, which can be activated whenever necessary by the local authority, the Garda or the health board.</P>
    <P>Major emergency plans are reviewed on a regular basis by a monitoring group comprised of representatives of the Departments of Environment, Health, Justice and Defence.</P>
    <P>The committee will, of course, be anxious to ensure that experience gained as a result of the flooding which occurred in South Galway and other areas is taken into account to ensure the most effective utilisation of the emergency procedures in the event of similar occurrences in the future.  While the inter-departmental committee has not yet reached a formal decision in the matter it hopes to be in a position to report to Government in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Finance Act, 1995, the non-member turnover of member owned golf clubs will become liable to VAT at the 12.5 per cent rate with effect from 1 January 1996 if a club's turnover from such <Col N="820" /> sources exceeds, or is likely to exceed, £20,000 in any period of 12 months.</P>
      <P>This initiative is being taken to ensure that the current exemption afforded to member-owned golf clubs does not give rise to distortions of competition to the detriment of commercial golf facilities. EU law requires that the exemption of non-profit making organisations from VAT cannot apply if the basic purpose of the service being supplied is to obtain additional income for the organisation by carrying out transactions which are in direct competition with those of commercial enterprises which are liable to VAT.</P>
      <P>Green fees constitute an important source of income for many clubs; indeed, many of the representations which I have received from golf clubs in recent months have pointed out that the development and expansion of their club facilities has been funded primarily by green fees.  The leading role taken by many of our long established member-owned clubs in promoting Ireland abroad as a holiday destination for international golfing tourists is also well known and a matter of pride for the organisations concerned.</P>
      <P>At the same time, it must be acknowledged that there has been a marked development of commercial golf facilities in recent years.  Many of these commercial enterprises have complained to me that the present situation whereby they had to charge VAT on their facilities, but the traditional golf clubs did not, was putting them at a competitive disadvantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While extending the application of VAT to member-owned golf clubs, I took pains to ensure that the Finance Act requirement is carefully targeted at the area of distortion: turnover from club members will remain exempt from VAT and such turnover is not taken into account in calculating the £20,000 VAT registration threshold.  As regards the possible effect of the initiative on prices, in many instances this should be significantly less than 12.5 per cent, given that the organisations concerned will be able to recover the VAT borne <Col N="821" /> on their inputs such as machinery, greens maintenance, etc, in respect of the taxable part of their activities.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have to make clear that the situation regarding unfair competition could not have been resolved by exempting the commercial facilities from VAT: as they are clearly engaged in the course of furtherance of business, EU law requires that they be liable to VAT.</P>

      <P>When a foreign divorce is recognised here, then property passing between the couple by way of inheritance on foot of an approved settlement by an Irish Court is untaxed as a result of the provisions of the Family Law Act, 1995. The Government envisages that this situation would also apply to civil divorces in this State were the referendum on divorce to be passed.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to page 26 of the Government Information Paper on the Divorce Referendum, published this September and titled <i>The Right to</i><i>Remarry</i>, which outlines the position that will apply from a general capital taxation viewpoint if the divorce referendum is passed, as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the capital taxes side it is proposed that the provisions which are being applied to foreign divorces recognised here by the Family Law Bill (now Act) will be extended to cover couples divorced in this State. This means that property transfers between former spouses on foot of a court order governing a divorce <Col N="823" /> settlement will be exempted from all capital taxes but, in relation to any subsequent property transfers not consequent on the divorce, they will be treated as strangers for Capital Gains Tax, Capital Acquisitions Tax, Probate Tax and Stamp Duty purposes. To put it more clearly, any property transfers related to the divorce will be exempted from all capital taxes, no matter at what point in time they occur.  Property transfers which are not related will result in the couple involved being treated as strangers for the purposes of these taxes.</P>

      <P>Funds totalling £1.148 million have been made available for humanitarian aid to the victims of the exceptional flooding which occurred earlier this year.  Some £398,000 of this amount was received <Col N="826" /> from the European Union.  This was distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society on behalf of the EU.</P>
      <P>An additional sum of £750,000 was provided by the Government for humanitarian relief.  This is being distributed by the Irish Red Cross Society on behalf of the Government.  Most of these funds, amounts of which are strictly confidential between the Irish Red Cross Society and the applicants, have already been paid out. The society has retained a small amount to deal with a number of claims from victims which are still under examination.  These claims will be finalised as soon as the Irish Red Cross Society is in possession of all the information it requires.</P>
      <P>The Government has also allocated a sum not exceeding £750,000 to assist people who must relocate from their existing houses as a result of the flooding. The Commissioners of Public Works have initiated contacts with all the people in the south Galway area who have applied to them to be considered for relocation under the Government's relocation package for flood victims. Information collected on these visits is being evaluated and will lead to further discussions with each applicant regarding the particular circumstances of their case.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made to ensure that formal offers of assistance will be made to qualified applicants at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I wish to advise the Deputy that there are no plans in this regard.  In a situation where a company has arrears of tax and is seeking an (instalment) arrangement in order to pay off those arrears the Revenue Commissioners have to form an opinion as to the viability of the company. This view would obviously take account of any restructuring plans that the company may have.  However the primary obligation of the Revenue Commissioners in such a situation is to ensure the collection of the taxes which are legally due.  A potential conflict of interest would arise if the Revenue role was extended to advising companies as to possible restructuring, investment requirements etc. in order to ensure the future of the company.  In practice the <Col N="830" /> corporate recovery advisory role more appropriately falls within the ambit of other State agencies such as the Department of Enterprise and Employment or Forbairt or Forfás.  Revenue's standing advice to companies experiencing difficulties is to approach Revenue at an early stage in relation to their tax liabilities.</P>

      <P>There are five national parks designated to date in Ireland:&mdash; Killarney National Park, County Kerry; Glenveagh National park, County Donegal, Connemara National Park, County Galway, Wicklow Mountains National Park, County Wicklow and the Burren National Park, County Clare.  These parks were established in accordance with international criteria for national parks which are set down by the World Conservation Union (IUCN).  The IUCN maintain, at the request of the United Nations, a list of national parks which comply with the <Col N="835" /> international criteria; Ireland's five national parks are included on the list.</P>
      <P>The IUCN criteria for national parks require that the area to be designated is a national area containing one or more ecosystems of national importance. Exploitation or occupation inimical to the purposes of conserving the ecosystems are not permitted and the State should either own or control the lands to be designated.</P>
      <P>The &ldquo;national park&rdquo; designation is primarily concerned with conserving the ecological intergrity of a site rather than with preserving its amenity value, although public access which is compatible with the conservation of the site is facilitated.</P>
      <P>The Howth Peninsula and Baldoyle Estuary-Racecourse do not meet the criteria for national parks and it would be inappropriate, therefore, to consider such a designation for these areas.  I should point out, however, that Baldoyle Estuary is protected under the Wildlife Act, 1976, having been designated a nature reserve under section 15 of the Act in 1988.</P>

      <P>STATCOM was established under section 16 of the Irish Film Board Act, 1980, and is charged with the task of removing all remaining obstacles to the full development of the Irish film industry over time.  STATCOM is chaired by the Chairperson of Bord Scannán na hÉireann and comprises representatives of my own Department, RTE, FÁS, <Col N="836" /> Forbairt, the IDA, Údarás na Gaeltachta, An Bord Tráchtála, Bord Fáilte and An Chomhairle Ealaíon.</P>
      <P>One of the prority activities of STATCOM was to commission research from FÁS on the training requirements of the independent film and television production sector in Ireland, entitled &ldquo;Training Needs to 2000&rdquo; which I launched on 21 June last.  This research has prompted the establishment of a National Training Committee for Film and Television under the auspices of FÁS.  I am pleased to inform the Deputy that this Committee will have at its disposal the services of a full-time industry training specialist as well as a dedicated training fund.  This fund comprises some £2.58 million which I have secured for film training under the Operational Programme for Industrial Development in the period up to 1999, together with FÁS mainstream funding of £250,000 per annum, subject to demand.</P>
      <P>I am not in a position at this stage to indicate the membership of the national training committee, as FÁS is still awaiting some nominations to the committee. I can, however, inform the Deputy that the committee will have an independent chairperson as well as nominations from IBEC, ICTU, FÁS, RTÉ, Bord Scannán na hÉireann, Teilifís na Gaeilge, Udarás na Gaeltachta, my own Department and the Department of Education.</P>
      <P>I expect FÁS to be in a position to announce the full membership of the national training committee within weeks, after which the committee will commence its deliberations.  Only then will the committee commence a drawdown from its training fund.  I see the committee's deliberations as being crucial to the achievement of my objective that the significant range of incentives which I have put in place for the development of the Irish film industry will result in the maximum use of Irish personnel at the very highest levels of the film and television production functions over time.</P>

    <P>With regard to the cost of all travel undertaken by me and the Ministers of State in 1995, I refer the Deputy to my reply of Wednesday, 18 October 1995 to Deputy Ivor Callely concerning all visits made abroad.  The figures requested in relation to domestic travel are not readily available.</P>
    <P>The total expenditure on professional fees in respect of services rendered by 19 consultancy firms hired by my Department from January 1995 to date, in relation to prison works or specific building projects amounted to £446,012. In relation to the Probation and Welfare Service the total sum expended in respect of consultancy fees was £26,269. It would not, however be appropriate for me to break these figures down to reveal the cost of each consultancy because of the market sensitive nature of this information.  Furthermore, in the <Col N="849" /> interests of security of the prisons, it would not be appropriate for me to identify consultancy firms or individual consultants involved in those prisons works or specific building projects.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="850" /> The cost and names of the other consultancy services to my Department and to the other organisations under the aegis of my Department in 1995 to date are set out in tabular form as follows:</P>

      <P>The regulations referred to by the Deputy make provisions for the terms and conditions under which qualified PRSI contributions and their dependent spouses are entitled to receive dental, optical and aural benefits under the Treatment Benefits Scheme administered by my Department.  In the case of serving members of the Defence Forces, entitlement to those benefits is limited to the provision or repair of dentures and optical applicances.  It does not include eye examinations, routine <Col N="851" /> dental treatment or assistance towards the cost of hearing aids.</P>
      <P>The limitation of benefit in the case of serving members of the Defence Forces reflects the fact that the Department of Defence operates a health scheme for those members which includes primary dental and optical care.  This can, where necessary, involve treatment by dentists or optometrists in private practice. However, the provision or repair of dentures and optical applicances is not covered under that scheme and, consequently, serving members of the Defence Forces may qualify for assistance in that respect under my Department's treatment benefit scheme subject to satisfying the relevant conditions.</P>
      <P>The limitation referred to above applies only for the duration of the member's period of service and entitlement to the full range of dental and optical benefits is restored on discharge from the Defence Forces.  In addition, the limitation does not apply at any time to the dependent spouses of serving members of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, in the circumstances outlined, I have no plans to amend the regulations in question at the present time.</P>

      <Quest>the result of the review of the appeal for deserted wife's allowance by a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath.</Quest>

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of unemployment assistance at the maximum weekly rate of £62.50 per week.</P>
      <P>She applied for deserted wife's benefit in December 1993.  The crucial issues affecting her possible entitlement to this benefit are the circumstances leading to the separation and whether she is cohabiting with another person as man and wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the first of these issues, <Col N="852" /> the person concerned left her husband in 1978.  To satisfy the desertion condition it needs to be established that constructive desertion occurred.  To this end she must establish that her husband's behaviour was so unreasonable that she could not be expected to continue living with him.  The deciding officer also needs information on a deed of transfer in relation to a residence in order to clear-up the issue of cohabitation.</P>
    <P>Her application was disallowed as the deciding officer was not satisfied that she was deserted within the meaning of the Social Welfare Acts.  She did not appeal against this decision.</P>
    <P>In response to representations from the Deputy, a review of her entitlement was undertaken in February 1995.  Evidence to substantiate constructive desertion was not produced, nor was information on the deed of transfer.  In the course of the inquiries, she admitted that the separation was mutual.  She was advised in August 1995 that her claim could not be allowed on the grounds that she was not deserted within the meaning of the Acts and that it was considered that she was cohabiting with another person as man and wife.</P>
    <P>The claim is under review again in the light of information received on the cohabitation issue.  A local inspector called to both addresses used by the person concerned on 7 October but got no reply.  Further efforts to contact her will be made.  The inspector will be seeking evidence on both the desertion and cohabitation issue &mdash; in the case of the former, independent third party evidence to substantiate the claim of constructive desertion.  When these further inquiries are completed her entitlement will be reviewed once more and she will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>There are 14 Civil Service staff assigned to my offices at a total cost of £248,379 per annum.  This includes the cost of the programme manager who is a career civil servant. There are nine Civil Service staff assigned to the offices of the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Durkan, at a total cost of £128,039 per annum.</P>
      <P>There are three non-Civil Service staff employed in my office on contract on a full-time basis at an annual cost of £90,443 and four non-Civil Service staff, including two civilian drivers, are employed on contract in the Minister of State's office, at an annual cost of £57,952.</P>
      <P>Most of the official travel which I have undertaken within the State since taking office has been by official car.  I do not have the cost of this travel, as the expenses arising from the use of my official car are borne by the Department of Justice.  However, I have incurred travel and subsistence expenses amounting to £4,435 in relation to travel within this State.  The cost of official travel within the State incurred by the Minister of State, who does not have access to an official car, amounts to £14,330.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the destinations, dates, duration and purpose of all trips undertaken by myself and the Minister of State, this information is not readily available and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of <Col N="854" /> time and work.  However, details of foreign travel undertaken by myself and the Minister of State are given in the reply to Deputy Ivor Callely on Wednesday, 18 October 1995 (Question No. 108).</P>
    <P>The total cost of other expenses incurred by me and the Minister of State since taking office amounts to £3,512 and £2,147, respectively.</P>
    <P>In relation to consultancy services, I wish to state that there are no consultants attached to my office or that of the Minister of State.  As part of its ongoing business the Department engages a number of different companies and organisations to provide consultancy assistance.  Most consultancies relate to technical and or management support with projects that are designed to improve the delivery of the services of the Department.  The Department's current consultancy requirement is heavily influenced by the development and implementation of a major strategic project to integrate all short-term social welfare schemes.  The total expenditure on these services by the Department to-date in 1995 is £2.6 million.  A list of the principal companies which provided the services as follows.</P>
    <P>There are three State bodies under the aegis of my Department.  In relation to the Pensions Board, expenditure on consultancy services this year amounted to £58,328.  The companies involved were A. &amp; L. Goodbody (legal advice) and Mercer Ltd. (actuarial advice).  The Combat Poverty Agency has used consultancy assistance in 1995 and I am awaiting details of the cost and services involved.  I will let the Deputy have this information as soon as it is available. The National Social Services Board has not employed consultancy services in the current year.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, credit unions in Ireland are a particular form of Industrial and Provident Society which are registered and regulated by the Registrar of Friendly Societies in accordance with the terms of the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, 1893 to 1978, with particular emphasis on the Credit Union Act, 1966.  Most of these mutual societies are also affiliated with the Irish League of Credit Unions, which has standard rules to be adopted by its member unions and provides various support services for them.  It is unclear from the Deputy's question whether he is referring to services envisaged under new legislation currently being drafted by the Parliamentary Draftsman. Should this be the case, it would not be in order to formally anticipate the terms of a Bill not yet introduced to the Oireachtas.  Should the Deputy be adverting to services being introduced by a particular credit union or group of credit unions, it would be helpful if he would elaborate and communicate the perceived difficulties to the Registrar of <Col N="858" /> Friendly Societies who could look into the matter as appropriate.</P>

      <P>I propose to take <Col N="867" /> Questions Nos. 103, 104, 106 and 107 together.</P>
      <P>The plan for the future of Dublin Zoo, including the question of planning permission, is a matter for the Commissioners of Public Works.  Under the plan the Government assigned responsibility to my Department for monitoring animal welfare at the Zoo and I have put a system of inspections in place with a view to ensuring satisfactory welfare standards.  These inspections &mdash; announced and unannounced &mdash; are conducted by veterinary inspectors of my Department with the assistance of an external consultant, Dr. Greenwood, and are designed to ensure that the wellbeing of the animals is kept regularly and carefully under review.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific welfare issues raised by the Deputy, I would mention the following points: (a) three of the four animals that died were euthanised on welfare grounds, and the ageing snow leopard will be considered for euthanisation if it does not respond to treatment being administered at present; (b) the fourth animal died owing to failure to respond to treatment for an ovarian tract infection; (c) the problem with the sea-lions is currently the subject of investigation; and (d) the behaviour of the polar bears is not considered acute and is being addressed through the provision of a new enclosure.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the views expressed by Mr. Mugford, Ms Lindley and Mr. Adams on the Zoo and I shall give them due consideration in so far as they relate to animal welfare.  In this regard, I am most anxious to ensure that all animals including those in the Zoo are treated in a welfare friendly manner.</P>
      <P>The veternary surgeon employed by the Zoo is not engaged in any capacity in relation to the Zoo by my Department. The external consultant retained for welfare purposes has, since his retention, also been consulted by the Zoo on specific animal health problems. No conflict of interest is involved.</P>

      <P>As part of the strategic management initiative in the Civil Service, my Department is undertaking a pilot project for the introduction of an accruals based accounting system for the Department's accounts. This represents the first occasion on which a Government Department has proposed to introduce accruals accounting for its core activities.  The accrual accounts will not take the place of the cash based system, that is statutorily required, but it will involve the maintenance of &ldquo;shadow&rdquo; accounts produced on an accruals basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="869" /> Given the complexities of the issues involved and the importance of the project, consultants have been engaged to assist with the process.  However, as the long-term viability of the project depends on the Department developing its own competence and skills, the consultants are engaged in a facilitatory role only.</P>
    <P>The tendering procedures outlined in the Government publication, Public Procurement 1994, were fully complied with in the appointment of the consultants. Following public advertising in the national newspapers by my Department, a number of tenders were received.  Although the company chosen, KPMG &mdash; Stokes Kennedy Crowley, did not submit the lowest tender, their proposal was considered the most suitable from the Department's point of view.</P>
    <P>The project commenced in April, 1995 and is likely to be of 12 months duration.</P>

      <P>Four <Col N="870" /> candidates have been appointed as meteorological officers following the competition held earlier this year.  It is expected that others will be appointed over time depending on vacancies arising and with due regard to administrative budget limitations.  Details on medical clearance and offers of appointment are a matter for the Civil Service Commission, but until a written offer of appointment is received no offer of employment exists.  It would be unusual for a candidate to give up employment until such an offer had been received.</P>
