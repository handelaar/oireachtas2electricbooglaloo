      <P>I wish to seek leave to move the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to discuss the following matter of public importance requiring urgent attention: the projected closure of Silverlea in Athlone and Athy with the loss of 220 jobs.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone is aware of the matter to which the Deputy refers.  The Government has not had an opportunity to consider a review of legislation in relation to sentencing.  I remind the Deputy that under the present law the maximum sentence for rape under common law is life and the maximum sentence for unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under 15, under section 1 of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1935, is also life.  Having had discussions with the Minister for Justice we will consider the implications of yesterday's case.  The maximum sentence permissible for various offences is life and this is a matter for which existing law provides.  We will consider the implications of yesterday's decision on sentencing policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I had been talking about the necessity for enacting legislation allowing public access to parks, lands, community schools, sports halls, swimming pools and so on, rendering them more amenable to the public so that the process of litigation which has been part and parcel of our life in recent years would be alleviated.</P>
      <P>This Bill is welcome.  Nonetheless, I should refer to a number of difficulties and anomalies I perceive within it as drafted.  While the reason for the inclusion of &ldquo;recreational user&rdquo; is clear, it introduces a difficult concept into law, the definition of &ldquo;recreational activity&rdquo; being broad although limited to open air activities.  Even temporarily, persons may find themselves falling within that definition by taking a recreational stroll.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand why a distinction has been drawn between the types of persons who enter premises with the permission of the occupier, each person having different motives, or the distinction being drawn between those with a &ldquo;recreational activity&rdquo; motive and those with any other motive. A further distinction has been drawn between an ordinary &ldquo;recreational user&rdquo;, meaning one invited by the occupier, an ordinarily resident, family member, or one with the permission of such persons for social reasons.  A milkman going about his ordinary duty might for some reason go away from the normal course of his morning rounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the enactment of this Bill these distinctions may appear unfair because a person entering lands with the permission of the occupier subsequently may be placed in a different position, due to the possible changed motive of the visit, or even on the basis of the initial permission he or she had received <Col N="1401" /> from the owner.  In addition, it would appear that a person can be deemed to have a different status dependent on the joint occupiers against whom this action may rest.</P>
    <P>Given that the entrants status depends on the lawfulness of his presence, his motive for entry and the permission he receives it is difficult to understand how that status can vary, but according to the Bill it can.  If he has permission to enter land from any one occupier and his motive is not that of recreational activity, he may be a trespasser in the opinion of one of the occupiers. Where a farm is in joint ownership, a husband may invite a person onto that land, but such permission may not be granted by another joint owner. If a case were taken, this introduces a degree of uncertainty into the legal position of the entrant, which is difficult to equate with the desired aim of the Bill to rationalise the law.</P>
    <P>Regarding the duty of care owed to trespassers and recreational users, in respect of any danger existing on premises an occupier must not injure the person or damage the property of such a person either intentionally or by acting with reckless disregard.  That provision is a major change because the Law Reform Commission suggested a higher standard of gross negligence rather than reckless disregard.</P>
    <P>The definition of danger in section 1 is that caused by the state of a premises. That is an extremely broad definition and I ask the Minister to clarify if that includes only the static condition of the premises, the state of disrepair in which the person finds the premises or if it pertains also to the use to which the premises is put.  Despite the stated standard of care owed to trespassers and recreational users, the criteria given in the Bill to assist a court in determining whether there has been reckless disregard appear to incorporate a higher standard than that of reasonableness, and the Minister should consider that. A further standard of care exists with regard to any structure for use primarily by recreational users provided by an <Col N="1402" /> occupier who must take reasonable care to maintain it in safe condition.  That is a different and probably a higher standard than owed to visitors under section 3.  An occupier must ensure only that a visitor does not suffer injury or damage by reason of any danger existing in respect of premises provided for recreational users.</P>
    <P>On open access to premises, among the circumstances a court must take into account in determining the reckless disregard of an occupier's duty towards trespassers and recreational users is the character of the premises, including the desirability of maintaining any tradition of open access to such premises.  That is a general policy decision that will be extremely difficult for a court to evaluate in the circumstances of a case.  Any plaintiff will find it difficult to argue against such a vargue concept and the provision may have to fall into disuse or serve to defeat a plaintiff, perhaps unfairly, on occasions.</P>
    <P>On supervisors of minors, special provision is made for trespassers and recreational users who are minors or have a mental handicap.  One circumstance to which the court shall have regard is whether a minor was accompanied by another person and the extent of that person's control and supervision.  That provision may have the effect of implying a duty of care to a person on whom the liability and negligence can be fixed if that person should have had greater control or supervision of a minor or a person with a mental handicap.</P>
    <P>One section deals with the appointment of blame and contributory negligence on the part of an entrant to premises. That section does not allow an entrant to be found wholly to blame, even where a court finds the person to be 100 per cent at fault.  Will the Minister have regard to the Civil Liability Act, 1961 which sets out the difference between blame and fault?  Under that Act a person can be held to be 100 per cent to blame and there does not appear to be a proper marriage between that Act and what is proposed in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connor</NameTxt>
      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the Bill as this area has remained undefined in law for a long time.  That unfortunate position gave rise in recent years to many occupiers and landowners restricting access to their lands because of fear of civil liability claims arising from accidents that might occur on their premises, whether on lands or buildings. It is particularly unfortunate that many historical and archaeological sites have been inaccessible to visitors in recent years because of the understandable actions of landowners.  Once the Bill is enacted we will have a firm statute and will no longer have to rely on common law provisions.  I welcome the general thrust of the Bill which is exactly right in that it defines categories of people who enter property and the duty of care that devolves upon landowners and the person who enters a property, but there is a certain amount of vagueness.</P>
      <P>I come from a constituency in which there is a great number of archaeological sites; the part of the constituency in which I live is a vast archaeological landscape.  On such a landscape there are dozens of landowners and occupiers who have custody of sites of archaeological and historic interest of high significance. Naturally those sites attract many visitors.  I am a farmer and I fortunately have a 7th-century high cross, a designated national monument, on my land to which there is a right of way.  It attracts approximately 200 visitors annually.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware the Bill goes a long way towards defining clearly the law on my, or anybody else's, responsibility who has a national monument on their land. Nevertheless, there is a certain amount of vagueness in the Bill which I would like clarified.  The category of recreational visitor is the one that is most relevant in this regard.  The duty of care is most diminished in terms of an occupier in this case.  People like myself would consider that, having regard to the number of people who enter their land to visit an archaeological site, occupiers should not carry any liability.  The State designated such sites as national <Col N="1404" /> or historic monuments and that devolves a certain amount of responsibility and care upon the State and, in doing so, it attracts people to them.  An earthworks that may seem uninteresting will naturally attract greater interest and visitors if defined as a national monument.</P>
    <P>While I accept the occupier should ensure that access to such monuments is free of hazards no other liability should devolve on him.  Visitors may not necessarily remain within the precincts of the building, site, earthworks, etc.; they may wander around in the hope of discovering something else and may be injured by agricultural equipment left in a field.  That is the usual run of things on farms.  Pieces of agricultural equipment are often left lying around, not with the intention of injuring anybody, but this is often a necessary part of farming practice.  It could be argued in court that it was negligence to leave such an implement or object in place and that the person was injured intentionally as a result.  It is important to deal with such points on Committee Stage to ensure that all ambiguity is removed.  I appeal to the Minister to take these issues on board.</P>
    <P>I am interested in some of the proposals which the ICMSA sent to Deputies in relation to this Bill.  Much of what they have said is common sense. They state that the definition of &ldquo;entrant&rdquo; on to land should be tightened up, instead of &ldquo;visitors for recreational purposes&rdquo; it should be confined to invited and uninvited entrants. Currently we have visitors, trespassers and recreational users.  They argue, rightly, that interpretation of these terms can be too broad.  Terms such as &ldquo;invited&rdquo; and &ldquo;uninvited&rdquo; can be more easily defined.  In other words, if you invite a person on to your premises naturally you may take greater care to ensure they are not injured intentionally or by accident and that every reasonable step is taken to ensure their safety.  In natural justice you have a duty to look <Col N="1405" /> after such people.  There are also uninvited people &mdash; I do not wish to use the term &ldquo;uninvited&rdquo; in an unfriendly way &mdash; who want access to the countryside. People should have access to the countryside and should be able to walk over fields and gain access to rivers and lakes, for fishing or swimming purposes, or to sites of interest but they should take responsibility.  In other words, the citizen ought to know that on private property or land, there may be objects which one can easily trip over.  In the nature of things land must have drainage and so on and one needs to be careful and to travel on such lands under good lighing conditions.  If a person is walking on long grass or undergrowth there may be hidden hazards but the person is doing this in the knowledge that these hazards may exist.  The law should be definitive in stating that.</P>
    <P>As a farmer I represent everybody who is concerned about this matter. Suddenly people may be subpoenaed or informed of an action being taken against them because somebody en route to a river, which happened to flow through their land, tripped or fell into a natural depression in the land.  The Bill provides that people must take care of themselves and these matters can be argued in court if there is any doubt about it.  It can be argued in court that the duty of care on the occupier was not properly discharged because a person who encountered a natural feature on the land, such as a tree stump, was injured.  I hope the Bill, when enacted, will be clear about this matter.</P>
    <P>I commenced by referring to the uncertainty which existed under the common law provisions.  If the matter is not finally cleared up by this Bill the restrictions which farming organisations have advised will continue and access to areas of recreation will continue to be prohibited.  At the end of the day there is not much the law can do if a farmer says: &ldquo;You must not trespass here&rdquo; or, &ldquo;You must not enter this field&rdquo;.  There are provisions for warnings in this Bill. If an occupier warns everybody not to step on property, regardless of whether <Col N="1406" /> there is a hazard, that will restrict access.  For that reason we must get these matters right.</P>
    <P>In relation to minors there is an increased responsibility and duty of care on the occupier.  Children are not as responsible for their actions as adults. Nevertheless, the duty of parents or guardians towards their children must be recognised.  It would be a pity if, as a result of a prank on private property, a child was injured and the occupier found liable.  Some would argue that a greater liability devolved on the parent or guardian to ensure the children are warned and that reasonable steps are taken to ensure they are not allowed wander on to properties where there may be hazards.  From my reading of the Bill I am not satisfied that that is clearly defined.  The Bill needs to be examined closely and I shall return to this issue on Committee Stage.  I ask the Minister to take note of my comments in this respect.  It is accepted that children are not as responsible for their general behaviour as adults.  There may be cases where the responsibility of parents and guardians can be overlooked.  The point has been made that it would be unfortunate if the duty of care devolved on the occupier in the event of a person with a physical or mental handicap, regardless of age, being injured unintentionally on private property.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I come from a constituency where a large number of my voters are owner-occupiers, mostly small farmers, where there is widespread public concern.  I am expressing here the concern of my constituents who speak to me about it.  There are signs all over my constituency stating: &ldquo;Visitors not wanted&rdquo; and &ldquo;Trespassers will be prosecuted&rdquo;.  I have also seen such notices in many areas of the archaeological landscape, which is a major part of my constituency in County Roscommon.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister finds my remarks constructive rather than critical.  Hopefully after the enactment of the legislation these signs will be a thing of the <Col N="1407" /> past and visitors, trespassers, recreational users, etc., whether invited or uninvited, will be confident that their interests are protected to the maximum extent possible.</P>

      <P>Occupiers' liability has been a thorny issue for many years. Shortly after I was elected to my county council ten years ago I raised this issue. If I remember correctly, the relevant Department said that the matter was being examined by the Law Reform Commission and that legislation would be introduced fairly soon.  I commend the Minister for introducing this legislation and pursuing the reports which underlined the difficulty in formulating legislation which met the constitutional and other requirements in this regard.  I also commend him for being so accessible to Deputies who had queries about the Bill.  On occasion I may have pestered him too much.</P>
      <P>Occupiers' liability is a major issue in areas which depend on the tourism industry and it is one which needs to be dealt with urgently.  I said recently at a meeting that I welcomed the Bill because it addressed some of the major problems in this area and clarified some of the grey areas.  It was pointed out to me by some of the people present at the meeting that the Bill would make things worse.  I do not think the Bill will have this effect.  Rather it will establish a framework within which the problem can be adequately addressed.  Nevertheless there is a need for some amendments, and I am sure the Minister will look favourably on these.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to legislate on the role of parents and guardians who have responsibility for young people.  After 20 years experience as a teacher, I am aware of the conflicts and difficulties which can arise for parents and guardians. Nevertheless the State must put the greatest onus possible on the parent or guardian to look after the young person, even if they are not with them. They should know where the young person is and ensure that they do not get <Col N="1408" /> into any trouble.  The onus on the parent or guardian should be much greater than the onus on the farmer or landowner who would have no reason to know where the young person was and could not reasonably be expected to know that he or she was on his property.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the main aims of the Bill was to increase the protection for occupiers, which everyone would like to see, and to ensure the use of land for recreational purposes.  This is very important as many people depend on access to land for their livelihoods.  In this context it is appropriate to pay tribute to farmers, occupiers and landowners for the level of access they gave recreational users to their land at a time when they were open to claims being made against them.  This tradition needs to be preserved and protected under the legislation.  I would go so far as to say that the legislation will ultimately decide the extent to which that very good tradition survives.</P>
    <P>The entrants allowed access to land and the duty of care owed to them is a very vexed question.  This basically comes down to legal definitions.  While the Minister has a substantial advantage in that he has legal training in this area, many eminent legal people have offered differing opinions on the effects of the legislation.  This gives rise to concerns by farmers and landowners and undermines the usefulness of the legislation, particularly in terms of encouraging occupiers to allow the use of their land for recreational purposes.  Difficulties may well arise about the interpretation of terms such as &ldquo;damage&rdquo;, &ldquo;danger&rdquo; and &ldquo;the level of injury&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned about section 7 which deals with agricultural contractors and agricultural machinery in temporary storage.  It seems grossly unreasonable to expect a farmer to make provision for people who may be on his land without his knowledge when putting farm machinery into temporary storage.  Hopefully the negative provision which proposes to make hired equipment and hire contractors his responsibility will be amended.  The <Col N="1409" /> Minister should look favourably on any amendments to this section which places an added onus on an occupier.  Contractors should have the primary responsibility for their machinery.</P>
    <P>On the duty owed to trespassers, the Bill imposes an undue obligation on the landowner.  People to whom I have spoken have said that the only duty owed to the trespasser is to ensure that he is not attacked or intentionally put in danger, that if he gets himself into difficulties it should not be the responsibility of the landowner.  It has also been said that claims for minor injuries will place a very substantial financial burden on the farmer or landowner who will have to pay not only the amount awarded but also the legal costs.  Some means should be devised as to ensure that these claims are not made.</P>
    <P>The ICMSA has written to me regarding its concerns about the Bill which, it states, has created even more confusion and uncertainty for landowners. That was not the Minister's intention and I am sure that will not be the outcome.  The association added that under the Bill a landowner has a duty towards two categories of entrant, the visitor and the trespasser, including recreational users &mdash; the duty of visitors is a duty of carefulness while the duty to trespassers is not to injure intentionally. It says it has no problem with either of these categories and that the difficulty has to do with the various types of entrants who can claim visitor status under the Bill.  Regardless of what the Minister does, it is likely that claims will be made and it will be very difficult to know in advance of a court hearing exactly where people stand under the Bill.  It is important that every attempt is made to roll the dice in favour of the occupiers so as to encourage them to let people use their land.</P>
    <P>The ICMSA stated that the definition of an entrant whose presence on premises becomes unlawful after entry and who is taking reasonable steps to leave suggests that visitor status, and the accompanying special duty of care, can <Col N="1410" /> apply to people who are uninvited.  This would create great difficulties for landowners. This ambiguity must be addressed and, if possible, removed.</P>
    <P>My area of north Clare was renowned for the way in which people allowed access to their lands.  The Burren landscape of clints and grykes, because of its physical nature, and not because of any fault on the part of the occupiers of the lands, presents some risks for visitors. Because people are now inclined to claim damages which would not have been heard of 20 or even ten years ago, there is a great deal of concern among landowners in the area.  The Burren is a popular tourist destination and it is important that people have access to it. Unfortunately, because of a difficulty regarding the Burren National Park &mdash; where the State owns approximately 3,000 acres on which it is proposed to build a visitors centre &mdash; local landowners have decided not to allow access to their property.  That is a contentious and separate issue and, regardless of the success of this Bill, is one which must be addressed under a separate heading.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to carefully consider the amendments which Deputy Woods will put down.  I commend the Minister on introducing the Bill and hope the finished article meets the needs and requirements on all sides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation will require amendment.  There are many national monuments in my constituency which attract tourists and visitors during the summer season.  We must include a provision in the legislation that will exempt the owners of property on which such artefacts are located from claims for damages from people who enter the property, without invitation, and injure themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of duty to owners and occupiers of land and property is not dealt with in the Bill.  If anybody has a right to safeguard his or her property, surely it must be the registered owner and occupier.  In no circumstances could I support legislation that would not copperfasten a safety clause for such <Col N="1411" /> people.  We all know it is easy for uninvited guests to gain access to property and injure themselves &mdash; perhaps even pretend to injure themselves &mdash; and for the property owner to be presented with an exorbitant claim for damages.  We are codding ourselves if we do not safeguard property owners and landowners &mdash; the backbone of society &mdash; against such claims.  Have they any right to exemption from claims for damages &mdash; in many cases superfluous damages &mdash; from uninvited guests who gain access to their property?</P>
    <P>If people enter property uninvited they should do so at their own risk and minors should be under the control of parents or guardians.  Many of the castles in my constituency are in poor repair with jagged walls and so on and regardless of how careful the owners or occupiers of the lands surrounding such castles are, they cannot guarantee safety to those who enter their lands to visit such sites.  This Bill must provide a safety valve for land and property owners so that irresponsible people entering their lands cannot claim damages against them.  If people enter property in the middle of the night without invitation and are injured, can they claim damages against the owner?  The Minister must address this question before passing the Bill.  Entrants to land should be classified as &ldquo;invited&rdquo; or &ldquo;non-invited&rdquo;.  The present definition of entrants as visitors, trespassers and recreational users is too broad and could be subject to abuse and confusion. Invited entrants should be classified as those invited by the occupier or a person acting on his or her behalf.  All other entrants should be classified as &ldquo;non-invited&rdquo;. Surely uninvited guests should not be permitted to enter a property unless the owner invites them.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill registered owners and occupiers of property should be guaranteed exemption from injuries sustained by people who illegally enter their property or lands.  Also, the occupier should be defined as the registered beneficiary exercising control over the property. <Col N="1412" /> The Bill states that minors can enter property <i>ad lib</i> and that the owner is responsible for them even though he or she may be miles away on the day they enter the property.  For example, there are many national monuments in the Goleen area, such as Dunmanus Castle, the Three Castle Head, Marconi Tower in Crookhaven and the Mizen Head signal station.  There are castles and monuments all over the south-western seaboard and the occupiers of the lands surrounding them could be in Cork, approximately 80 miles away, when a person enters the property.  Although the landowner does not own the national monument, he will be held responsible if somebody is injured while traversing his land to visit it.  This legislation will be fraught with danger for owners and occupiers of property if it does not contain a clause exempting them from responsibility for people who enter their lands in order to visit national monuments.</P>
    <P>I accept that persons of an immature age cannot be treated in the same way as mature adults.  However, the responsibility for them should rest with their parents or guardians.  The same should apply to a person with a mental handicap.  If the guardians or parents of children do not keep them under control and know where they are going, surely it should not be the responsibility of an owner or occupier of land to do so.  We must cut our cloth according to our measure and insist on fair play for everybody.  When an uninvited guest enters a property that guest, no matter what age, should not be the responsibility of the owner or legal occupier of that property.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill certain entrants to a property are given visitor status as of right.  Such entrants include members of the Garda, certain officers of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, members of the Defence Forces and, in certain circumstances, officials of the ESB, an Bord Gáis, persons with a right of way etc.  All such persons should be regarded as uninvited with the occupier having a duty not to <Col N="1413" /> injure them intentionally.  However, if they are injured on his property they should be covered by the State's public liability policies.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to amend and extend the law on the liability of occupiers of premises, including land.  The word &ldquo;extend&rdquo; should be deleted or defined to avoid the impression of increasing occupiers liability under the law.  I hope the Minister will do this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Farmers and all land owners are open to be sued for damages resulting from accidents occurring to any person on their property.  The legal liabilities of land owners are so great that in 1991 farmers were advised by the farm organisation to suspend public access to their lands in so far as was practicable until satisfactory changes were made to the legislation governing occupiers' liability. The intention is not to have legislation which prevents entry on to farmland but to lessen the liability of land owners.  We must insist that the minimum liability apply to land and property owners when uninvited guests enter their property.</P>
    <P>A commitment was obtained in January 1992 from the Taoiseach at the time. Mr. Charles Haughey, that the occupiers' liability legislation would be reformed.  This commitment was repeated by Deputy Reynolds when he was Taoiseach.  However, the present legislation does not meet the needs of the farm organisations.  I advise the Minister to take steps to meet the majority of the demands of the farm organisations because they will be held largely responsible following the passing of this Bill.  As the owner of a small holding in the constituency of Cork South-West I know too well the dangers of visitors entering property and turning an ankle, breaking a leg, falling over a fence, injuring a hand, etc. and subsequently claiming damages such that the unfortunate farmer has to sell his place in order to pay.</P>
    <P>The Minister inherited this legislation from his predecessors.  However, I hope he will streamline it to ensure that all <Col N="1414" /> sections of the community are safeguarded, particularly land and property owners.   The report of the Law Reform Commission is, as far as I can judge, unsatisfactory in that it proposes a very broad definition of visitors &mdash; virtually everyone would qualify.  The subsequent publication of the Bill on occupiers' liability last November was a further disappointment because it also failed to clearly define the word &ldquo;visitor&rdquo;.  Since its publication, a new Government has been formed and has committed itself to a limited review of the Bill.  This is not adequate to safeguard the rights of the people concerned.  It would be a major mistake to pass this legislation without significant amendment to guarantee immunity for occupiers of property against claims by irresponsible people who enter their lands without permission.</P>
    <P>The issue of occupiers' liability is of great concern not only to farmers but to all who enjoy outdoor life.  We must act sensibly and decisively on this sensitive issue by making the necessary modifications to the Bill.  Under this Bill a land owner will have a duty to two categories of entrant, the visitor, including a recreational user, and trespasser.  The duty to visitors will be one of care and to trespassers not to injure them intentionally. We must give a guarantee that no responsibility will be placed on those who are doing their best to maintain their holdings and property but who will be wide open to claims by intruders who are uninvited guests.</P>
    <P>The definitions of &ldquo;recreational activity&rdquo; and &ldquo;recreational user&rdquo; which include a reference to the National Monuments Act, 1930 establish the right to enter land without the owner's permission to engage in pursuits which may not be condoned by the owner.  They also relieve the Government of all responsibility for the upkeep and repair of any property which has been declared a national monument and which may be in a dangerous condition and place it instead on the land owner, who will also be held responsible for any incidents which may occur.  It is the duty of the <Col N="1415" /> Government to accept responsibility if any visitor is injured while visiting a national monument; farmers and land owners should not be left wide open to claims by uninvited guests.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will rectify the anomalies in this legislation.  I have great faith in him and know that he will do this, if at all possible, and will ensure that nothing drastic is done without first meeting the requirements and the desires of the farming organisations which speak on behalf of landowners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFoxe" hpid="Mr. T. Foxe Mr. T. Foxe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to voice an opinion on this Bill, which I welcome.  It has many admirable aspects and some not so admirable.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill is to clarify the law on occupiers' liability and facilitate the use of land for recreational activities.  I do not intend to engage in repetition as the various categories of entrant have been outlined.  It has been mentioned that landowners have a duty of care to entrants.  In this respect I am not sure if the definition of a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; is in line with the GAA's interpretation, which is a person under 18 years of age, or whether it means a person aged 13 or 14.  If a minor is injured responsibility will be placed on the occupier, even though in most cases the minor is not invited onto the property.  More responsibility should be placed on the parents or guardians.  I fail to understand how, if a minor or anyone else enters land uninvited, the owner should be held responsible for their welfare.</P>
      <P>Section 5 states that an occupier may by agreement or notice restrict, modify or exclude his or her duty of care to entrants.  It also states that where an occupier gives a warning this may be sufficient to absolve him from liability. This matter needs to be clarified and the Bill should state specifically that the occupier will not be held liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 also states that any restriction, modification or exclusion of an occupier's duty shall not be binding on the entrant unless certain conditions are <Col N="1416" /> met.  These two provisions show that the Bill is weighted against the occupier.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will apply to contracts entered into before the commencement of this Bill as well as to those entered into after such commencement.  Which contracts entered into before the commencement of this Bill will be covered? What is the relevant date?</P>
    <P>Section 9 states that where an occupier fails, refuses or neglects to carry out a certain duty and an entrant or property of the entrant suffers an injury or damage, that injury or damage will be deemed in the eyes of the law to be attributable to a wrong and the occupier will be held responsible.  If, for instance, in the autumn a farmer leaves his combine harvester in the fields at night and entrants, be they minors or otherwise, are seriously injured while interfering with it, under this section the farmer will be held responsible for their welfare. This is most regrettable and unfair.</P>
    <P>Similarly, anyone familiar with farms will know that gateways are not always wide enough for the passage of modern machinery.  When many gateways were being built, the horse and cart was possibly the widest mode of transport going through those gateways.  To widen openings a few inches gates are often removed by farmers and left against a nearby wall or ditch.  If children on the way home from school &mdash; I am thinking of 12 and 13 years olds &mdash; play around a gate left against a wall or ditch and it falls on them causing injuries, by my interpretation of this section of the Bill the occupier would be liable because he or she did not take due care.  In normal circumstances, however, the gate would not be resting against a wall or ditch but would be in its rightful position.  That is another example of how this Bill appears to be weighted against the occupier.</P>
    <P>Under section 9 (2), if an entrant to property or lands fails to take due care and, as a result, is injured, in certain circumstances the responsibility will be jointly shared by the entrant and the occupier.  That does not make much <Col N="1417" /> sense but perhaps the Minister will clarify that when he concludes the debate. An uninvited entrant to a property should not be covered in regard to liability. The occupier should not have to foot the bill if an uninvited entrant is injured on his or her property, or lands.</P>
    <P>On many farms, boundary and other fences are not always impregnable.  If a young bull breaks into a field with heifers &mdash; we all know that a few strands of barbed wire would not prevent that happening &mdash; and gores an entrant, the occupier is responsible, despite the fact that he or she is not even aware of the incident.  That is my interpretation of the Bill.  In such cases the occupier should be afforded more protection against such claims.</P>
    <P>People using lands for recreational purposes are entitled to be on the property whether they are invited or otherwise but they have an obligation to take reasonable care for their own safety. The occupier should not be held responsible for any injury suffered by them.  I ask the Minister to take note of some of the points I made.  I would like to see certain changes in the Bill which would provide that greater protection.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies who participated in the debate on this Bill.  I had every expectation that the debate would be stimulating and that there would be some robust interventions. In that, at least, I was not disappointed.</P>
      <P>The Bill does not run to an enormous number of pages but shortness of length is not always to be equated with simplicity of content.  Some of the elements in the Bill are quite complex and this debate, in teasing out some of the implications of its provisions, did justice to that complexity.  I welcome the fact that the principle underlying the Bill was generally endorsed by Members on all sides although I appreciate that the endorsement was not unqualified and that various points of difficulty will be raised on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not need to remind Deputies that <Col N="1418" /> the Bill had its genesis in the growing perception, particularly among the farming community, that in an increasingly litigious culture, traditional access to land for recreational purposes could not longer be tolerated as heretofore. The uncertainty surrounding legal liability in the event of accidents befalling entrants to land has been, in large part, responsible for much of the fear which this issue generates.  I am not aware, however, of any case, in so far as farmers are concerned, where they have been sued successfully by trespassers for injuries received on their lands.  Indeed, the fact that Deputy Keogh had to reach back to the case of Purtill in the 1960s and the case of McNamara in the 1970s to provide the appropriate illustration for her point in relation to child trespassers is in itself very telling.  This lack of success in so far as trespassers are concerned is under a regime which can be seen as more favourable to this category of entrant than the one which I am now introducing.  There is every reason, therefore, to be confident that farmers, and other occupiers, will continue to be safe from vexatious claims.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted that the interpretation of the legislation now being discussed will ultimately fall to the courts, and I am happy that the principles it contains will safeguard occupiers against unmeritorious claims.  However, at the end of the day, it will be one or two cases, tested before the courts, which will validate that opinion.  I strongly urge occupiers to use the legislation as a protection and not to be afraid to rely on its provisions if they find themselves the subject of a claim for which they deny liability.  Deputy Treacy and other Deputies appeared to argue that the occupiers of certain facilities should effectively be granted immunity from suit in relation to personal injuries caused to entrants who were making use of those facilities. Deputy Boylan also touched upon this point.  However, while it may not be within the scope of any legislation to say that particular actions cannot be brought before the courts, it is within <Col N="1419" /> the remit of legislation to provide the safeguards which will protect innocent parties to a dispute and I am satisfied that the Bill contains these safeguards.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of Deputies to the fact that, both in Scotland and in Northern Ireland, which in many ways have community structures similar to our own, legislation is in place which, on the face of it, would appear to be more liberal than what is proposed here in relation to trespassers.  In Scotland, occupiers have a duty to take such care as is reasonable in the circumstances of the case to see that entrants do not suffer injury or damage by reason of any dangers.  In Northern Ireland, although there are some differences of emphasis, the duty is broadly similar.  In the Bill, the emphasis is on not acting with reckless disregard and that is a much more limited duty.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods rightly acknowledged that the Bill is far-reaching in that it has implications not only for landowners but for the community as a whole. Deputy Kirk also emphasised this point. These acknowledgments are useful and timely because, very often, these implications can be lost sight of and the focus tends to be on the very narrow one of access to land.  While the considerations which such access raise are important, they are not the whole story and we need to be aware of the wider dimension.</P>
    <P>I regret that I cannot satisfy Deputy Woods's request for a clear and simple list of examples where under the old law liability would be imposed on an occupier, but under the new will not. The issue of liability is one for the courts to determine and it might be misleading if I were to attempt to play judge in the way in which Deputy Woods invited me.  However under the new regime, occupiers will no longer owe a duty of care, which is based on negligence, to trespassers.  The duty they may have had to some recreational users in the past has gone.  That is the <Col N="1420" /> real improvement which the Bill introduces and one which should attract general support.  Deputy Kitt was one of the Deputies who inquired as to the difference this legislation will make in regard to liability and the clear distinction which is drawn in the Bill between trespassers, on the one hand, and visitors on the other is an example of just such a difference from the existing regime.</P>
    <P>I am not sure what the Deputy has in mind when he claims that the Bill imposes a level of liability on the Office of Public Works which is more onerous than at present.  In many cases, the effect of the Bill will be quite the contrary, and it is only where the entrant is a paying visitor that a duty of care will arise.  Otherwise, visitors to national monuments will be classed as recreational users and will be owed the lesser duty appropriate to such entrants. Deputies de Valera and Leonard also adverted to the situation where these monuments are in private ownership. Again, provided no charge is imposed for viewing these monuments, the lesser duty will apply.  This is a step in the direction of achieving the necessary balance between the rights of land owners and of the wider public in terms of our national heritage.</P>
    <P>In this context, Deputy Ó Cuív and other Deputies, including Deputy Browne, inquired about the position where a national monument on private land is in a state of disrepair.  It will be open to the occupier in this instance to discharge the duty not to act with reckless disregard by putting up a warning notice in the appropriate location. Where a building is involved, a sign proximate to that building could be just such a location.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies, including Deputies Crawford, Finucane and Penrose alluded to the role which tourism plays in our economy.  Deputy Noel Treacy referred to its importance in underpinning the buoyancy of economic growth here.  There is no doubt that cultural tourism, in particular, is assuming <Col N="1421" /> ever greater importance and the provisions in this Bill, especially those concerning recreational use, will facilitate developments in this area.</P>
    <P>I share Deputy Woods's concern about the rising costs of insurance and the impact this has on individuals within the community.  However, this is not an insurance Bill and the suggestions put forward for a no-fault based system of compensation, based on a levy to be imposed on insurance companies, are well beyond its scope.  Nonetheless, I would hope that by introducing clear principles into the law on occupiers' liability the Bill will have the effect of steadying, if not actually reducing, costs in this area.</P>
    <P>The Deputy expressed some anxiety about the utility of the provisions in section 5 relating to warnings and notices.  Deputy Connaughton also had a number of queries on this matter. First, not every warning need be in the form of a large sign or hoarding.  Verbal warnings by an occupier of a particular danger would be covered by section 5 (5).  Similarly, the provisions in section 5 (2) are most likely to be of relevance in a contractual situation.  We are talking here about visitors who, for the most part, will enter on premises by recognised routes.  In many cases, they will be paying customers and each time we pay for a cinema ticket, an admission fee to a visitor centre or a race-meeting we are entering into a contractual arrangement. The provision, therefore, and the protection which it offers to occupiers is wider than it may first appear.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods expressed puzzlement concerning the reference to the Bill in the Government programme.  However, the commitment in that programme is quite straightforward.  It states that, in order to ensure public access to land, the Occupiers' Liability Bill will be reviewed in the context of further careful examination of the legal and constitutional position as it relates to minors.  I should stress that there is no implication here that this Bill will be amended in any way to increase rights of access to <Col N="1422" /> private property without the landowner's permission.  The commitment simply recognises the concern to which the provisions in the Bill relating to minors have given rise.  I am giving consideration to the matter and the decisions made will take into account, as far as possible, statements made by Deputies in this debate and various representations which I have received from interest groups.  They will be carefully considered by me and I fully acknowledge the depth of feeling which they represent.  In this context, I note the comments of Deputies de Valera and Connaughton about the genuine concern of many occupiers about child trespassers, particularly where children are on premises in the absence of adult supervision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh inquired as to the relationship between section 2 and section 4 and expressed concern that the latter might undermine the former in so far as the protection of occupiers is concerned. The basic purpose of section 2 is to ensure that future actions founded upon occupiers' liability will be dealt with according to the statutory principles provided for in this Bill, not according to the common law principles which now govern this area of the law.</P>
    <P>Section 4 makes it plain that occupiers no longer have a duty to trespassers, or indeed to recreational users, which is based on negligence.  Their duty can be reduced to two simple propositions; not to injure such individuals intentionally and not to act with reckless disregard for them.  Subsection (2) itemises those factors, which are not exhaustive and which a court must take into account if an occupier is to be judged as having acted with reckless disregard.  In other words, the various factors specified are intended to provide further protection for the occupier; they are not intended to make it easy for a finding of reckless disregard to be reached.  For example, it is clear under the subsection that before any duty can be said to arise, an occupier must know, or have reasonable grounds for believing that a danger exists, and he or she will owe a duty to <Col N="1423" /> a trespasser or recreation user in respect of that danger only if the danger is one against which, in all the circumstances, that occupier might reasonably be expected to offer protection.</P>
    <P>Paragraphs (e) and (f) will have some bearing in determining this matter. Paragraph (e) aims to balance on the one hand the burden on the occupier of eliminating the danger or protecting the recreational use or trespasser and on the other the degree of the danger.  Paragraph (f) introduces a general social criterion into the equation, in that, regard must also be had to the character of the premises and, where the premises are likely to be used for recreational activity, the desirability of maintaining the tradition of open access to those premises for such activities.  I am aware from comments made both in this House and outside, that the structure of this subsection may not be as clear as it could be.  I will be focusing again on this matter and I would envisage the possibility of some amendment on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh also made the comment that the language of section 3, particularly that relating to the imposition of a duty to take reasonable care, was vague and ill-defined.  This duty, however, is a well-recognised one in tort law where it is a shorthand that implies a wide range of other connecting concepts. It is a term with which both practitioners and judges are fully conversant and I do not think that it will present any real difficulties of interpretation. Deputy Keogh highlighted a number of areas where she will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.  I do not propose to address those issues now but some of the points she raised are certainly ones which I shall be looking at with close attention.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea was somewhat unhappy with a few of the definitions contained in the Bill, notably that of visitor and trespasser.  Deputy Penrose, and others, also alluded to certain possibilities for re-definition in this area.  I will look again at this matter and it may <Col N="1424" /> be possible to make the relevant definitions a little more precise.  Deputy O'Dea was also one of the first to stress that responsibility for the welfare of minors should rest with parents.  Other Deputies also raised this matter subsequently, among them Deputies Connaughton, Ó Cuív and Browne.  It is true that parents have a primary duty to oversee the welfare of their children.  It is for this reason that the law allows liability to a child who is injured to be shared between an occupier and a parent. However, occupiers cannot be wholly absolved from responsibility in this area and, where they are at fault, it would be unjust to exempt them from liability.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes was sceptical about the utility of the recreational user definition in the Bill and seemed to think that the Law Reform Commission's recommendations were somehow being subverted by it.  The point about the definition is that many people who enter land to engage in recreational pursuits do so with the permission of the occupier, in other words, they are permitted entrants.  Unless these entrants are to be accorded visitor status &mdash; I do not think Deputy Dukes had that in mind &mdash; some specific provision had to be made in the Bill to address this matter. The Bill as introduced takes the right approach and provides the appropriate certainty for occupiers and entrants alike.</P>
    <P>Throughout the debate, there has been much talk of a &ldquo;compensation culture&rdquo; and the problems which this poses for occupiers and landowners.  Deputy Ferris was one of the very few Deputies who acknowledged that the ownership of property carries with it responsibility to take reasonable precautions for the safety of those who enter that property. While we rightly criticise those who manipulate the system to acquire compensation to which they are not entitled, we should not lose sight of the fact that acts or omissions by occupiers can give rise to serious injury and that the individual men, women and children who suffer such injury can be fully justified <Col N="1425" /> in seeking compensation.  Furthermore, it is not the State which should be liable to pay such compensation, as some Deputies on the Opposition benches seemed to want but the person responsible for the injury.  Some Deputies, who, said people have to take responsibility for their own safety &mdash; and I have no difficulty in accepting that proposition &mdash; also suggested that occupiers should be able to transfer their burden of responsibility to the State if, by their acts, they cause injury to another, I am not sure this position is very logical.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies also seemed to ignore the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, which requires every employer and self-employed person, including farmers, to prepare a safety statement which is effectively a programme for managing safety and health in the workplace, which includes the farm.  Indeed, farming has been identified as a high risk occupation and, for that reason, it has been the focus of specific attention by the Health and Safety Authority which makes available a very useful information pack designed to help reduce accidents on the farm. Particular guidance is offered on preventing accidents to children on farms.</P>
    <P>The contributions of many Deputies might be interpreted as giving a rather dangerous message, to those who have a responsibility for maintaining a safe working environment.  This House cannot, and should not, be seen to condone working practices which are negligent and slipshod and a source of danger, not just to those who happen to be on premises &mdash; in whatever capacity &mdash; but also to occupiers and to their families. People responsible for any working environment have a duty, to themselves and to others, to take whatever steps are practicable to maintain it in a safe condition. If they take such steps, not only is it likely that fewer accidents will result but, even if accidents occur, occupiers will be in a strong position to argue that no liability attaches to them.</P>
    <P>On introducing this Bill, I indicated that one of its purposes was to strike a <Col N="1426" /> balance between a wide range of competing interests.  I regret that the ensuing debate did not attempt to address the balance the Bill seeks to create.  The law exists to protect both the occupier and the entrant and provides a framework within which disputes between the two can be resolved.  However, we do not advance our reputation as legislators if we pretend that individuals can be ring-fenced so that the law does not apply to their action or inaction.</P>
    <P>I am quite happy with the balance in the Bill between the interests of occupiers, on the one hand, and entrants on the other.  However, I am not blind to the fact that the Bill may need improvement in certain areas and I look forward to discussing the matter in more detail with Deputies on Committee Stage.  As Deputy Upton said, it is important that the technical aspects of the Bill are right and I am confident that, following our deliberations, Deputies on all sides of the House will have reason to be pleased with the Bill in its final shape.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to thank the many people who were involved in the preliminary work that led to the establishment of the local employment service.  The National Economic and Social Forum produced a report in June 1994 on which the task <Col N="1427" /> force worked and produced a report about ten days ago.  That work has proved immensely valuable in achieving a consensus on proposals to try to tackle long term unemployment.  The work many people put into this is worthwhile and I hope we can make a mark with this new service.</P>
      <P>Unemployment is the major problem facing the European Union where the average unemployment rate is nearly 11 per cent.  Unemployment in Ireland is now running at over 15 per cent with only Spain showing higher unemployment rates.  What is depressing about the analysis of unemployment is that in spite of economic growth, the prospect of significantly reducing unemployment in the short term is slight.  A recent report from the European Union Commission concluded:</P>
      <P>The clear lesson of the past 20 years is that no member state has succeeded in reducing unemployment significantly and keeping it at a low level for a sustained period, except in Luxembourg.  The chances of this happening in the future without a significant change in policy or without a radically different set of circumstances are remote.</P>
      <P>That warning from the European Union is timely and it is appropriate that we take a radical look at our approach to unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland the rate of unemployment rose in each business cycle since the early 1970s, increasing after the two oil shocks but with the upturn in the business cycle there was no comparable recovery in employment numbers. Unemployment in Ireland is characterised by a very high number of people who are long term unemployed.  The recently published document, Employment in Europe shows that Ireland has the highest proportion of long term unemployment taking the total number unemployed.  In the period they reviewed, 1985-92 while other countries succeeded in reducing the proportion of long term unemployed, we did not have <Col N="1428" /> quite the same success.  Long-term unemployment has continued to grow in spite of the strong economic growth in the past two years.  The impact of recovery is not trickling down to the long term unemployed.  Ten per cent of the total labour force is long term unemployed, but as a percentage of the unemployed, 35 per cent were long term unemployed in 1980 and this has grown to nearly 49 per cent in 1994.</P>
    <P>The figures for male long term unemployment are even worse with an increase from 39 per cent in 1980 to 54 per cent in 1994.  This increase occurred despite the growth in numbers of long term unemployed persons being engaged on Government programmes. Thus long term unemployment is a major economic and social issue facing this country.  In spite of an optimistic medium-term outlook for economic development and employment the expectations for long term unemployment are that it will be no lower at the end of the decade than it is now.  That is highlighted by some of the figures produced in the National Economic and Social Forum report which showed in a survey of recruitment that of the jobs being filled only 6 per cent of vacancies were filled by persons who were long term unemployed, that the bulk of new vacancies are filled by those who are better equipped or more mobile.</P>
    <P>Clearly economic recovery will not lift the boats of the long term unemployed. It was against this background that the NESF addressed the issue of long term unemployment.  I was pleased to be a member of the forum and I believe the consensus reached, which spanned the business community, trade unions and all the political parties &mdash; the third strand as they are now called &mdash; was unique.  It was a major contribution to the formulation of Government policy.</P>
    <P>The forum produced a very good report.  It pointed out that the rate of long term unemployment in Ireland is greater than the total unemployment rate in many OECD countries; the <Col N="1429" /> longer a person is long term unemployed the more difficult it becomes to find employment and those unemployed for two years have a 74 per cent chance of being unemployed a year later.  The ESRI carried out a study which showed that at the end of the first year one has a 66 per cent chance of getting work, at the end of the second year it is 32 per cent and there is only a 20 per cent chance of getting a job after three years unemployment.  The longer a person is unemployed the less attractive they are to employers.  The forum found that the long term unemployed are concentrated in the prime age group, 25 to 44 years, and have relatively low education and skill level.  Half have no formal educational qualifications.</P>
    <P>It produced figures estimating the cost of unemployment which amounted to 7 per cent of GDP.  In other words, there was a lost opportunity equivalent to 7 per cent of our GDP compared with the rest of Europe where it is only 4 per cent.  The NESF identified the cases of long term unemployment &mdash; low levels of skills and education.  For example, 48 per cent of long term unemployed persons have no educational qualifications, that is over three times the percentage for those at work.  There are far more people with intermediate certificate or group certificate-qualification among the long term unemployed than there are with the Leaving Certificate or a third level qualification compared with the rest of the labour force.  There are barriers facing the long term unemployed in finding jobs such as recruitment practices, employer reluctance and unemployment traps.  There are persistent factors, including loss of skills and the lack of influence of the long term unemployed in the labour market. Other factors mentioned included the impact of employment protection legislation and unemployment benefit systems and the extent to which labour market policy is &ldquo;active&rdquo; or &ldquo;passive&rdquo;. These issues have an influence on the level of long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>The main recommendation put forward by the forum to address the long <Col N="1430" /> term unemployment problem was the establishment of an employment service. That service will be responsible for implementing strategies of preventing long term unemployment and reintegrating the long term unemployed into the work force.  It will provide a guidance and placement service for the unemployed and be a gateway to all employment and training programmes. The important feature of the service was that it was to change to being a client driven service, in other words, it was to start with a portfolio of so many persons who were long term unemployed and see what was the best programme to get those people back to work.  That concept is different from what we had in the past.  State agencies have concerned themselves with running courses or community employment programmes but without the persistent progression which allowed people to get a foothold in one scheme and make progress towards getting back to work ultimately. The service has turned things around and asks how it will improve the life chances of the people on their list.  Much of the criticism in the past centred on the fact that, having completed courses, many people found themselves back on the live register.</P>
    <P>The factors which were pointed out as critical to the success of the service included the active involvement and support of employers and trade unions locally and the possibility of developing different models in each locality which would be attuned to local opportunities and resources.  It is crucial that the local employment service would have autonomy to carry out its functions with the eventual transfer of budgets in respect of programmes for the unemployed.</P>
    <P>The concept advanced by the NESF was modelled largely on the &ldquo;Contact Point&rdquo; initiative developed by the north side partnership in Coolock which is in my constituency.  I brought together employers, unions and State agencies as well as community groups and allowed them develop a coherent response to unemployment.  They were able to demonstrate to local employers that if long <Col N="1431" /> term unemployed people were placed in local companies they would provide the best service and standard of work.  They have demonstrated clearly what can be done.  Since its inception in Coolock, 600 people who were long term unemployed have been successful in getting gainful employment with local employers.  We hope to learn from this model in extending the service to the partnership areas.</P>
    <P>The Government established a taskforce to examine the forum's report and make proposals for better targeted and more effective services for the long term unemployed.  The report was published last week.  The key recommendation is the establishment of a nationwide local employment service to meet the needs of the long term unemployed. It will provide a gateway or access point to the full range of options that should be available to this group.  It endorsed the recommendations of the NESF regarding the need to put in place a comprehensive guidance, counselling and placement service.  The Government has accepted the central recommendation of the taskforce and decided to assign overall responsibility for the delivery of the service to my Department and to me as Minister.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the new service is up and running as quickly as possible, I have established a new policy unit on long term unemployment in my Department.  The overall aim of the unit is to reduce the number of people who are long term unemployed.  This will not be a simple task but unless, as a society, we seriously attempt to reduce the number of those who are long term unemployed not only are we failing in our duty to these people but we are guilty of crass negligence.  All the figures show that the children of long term unemployed people tend to slide into a similar position so if we do no deal with the problem it will remain with us for many years.</P>
    <P>The immediate task of the new unit will be to oversee the putting in place of <Col N="1432" /> the local employment service as recommended by the task force.  This will be done in consultation and co-operation with the area partnership companies and with the assistance of FÁS and the other State bodies providing services to the long term unemployed.  In addition, the unit will bring forward policy proposals for dealing with long term unemployment and for the better co-ordination of the delivery of State services to the unemployed.  Already the core staff of the new unit are in place and the first moves towards establishing the new local employment service are being made.  The new unit will have the benefit of the advice of an advisory group representative of the Departments of the Taoiseach, Enterprise and Employment, Social Welfare, Education, Environment and Finance; the office of the Tánaiste, FÁS and ADM Ltd.  Not only the co-operation but the wholehearted commitment of these different agencies is crucial to the success of this local employment service.  It has been a conscious decision of all Government Ministers to give that commitment to the provision of this service.  To be a success, this local employment service must be in a position to book places and to get the requisite resources to meet their planned targets.  There is no point in setting up this service if they cannot guarantee that the programme they put in place can be delivered on the ground. The service must not lose credibility with the people it is endeavouring to help and it is crucial that we do not have bureaucratic obstacles to delivering the service.  We have secured from all Government Departments a commitment to deliver the local employment service when an agreed programme of work has been drawn up.  That is copper-fastened by this advisory group which will ensure that continuing commitment on the part of a wide range of Departments, so important in making this service a success.</P>
    <P>The local employment service will be introduced on a phased basis.  Initially the service will be set up in the Twelve established area based partnerships <Col N="1433" /> companies and in two non-partnership areas.  As suggested by the task force, the experience gained in setting up the service in these areas will inform us on the process to be adopted in other areas. The population in the Twelve partnership areas is over 500,000, with unemployment running at 26 per cent.  It is clear that the new service has a formidable challenge ahead.  The fundamental basis of the local employment service will be the local area action plan for tackling unemployment.  This will be part of the plan drawn up by the area partnerships, in areas designated as disadvantaged under the Operational Programme for Local Development.  A similar plan would be drawn up by the local management committee to be put in place in non-designated areas.  My Department has already commenced discussions with the Twelve Area Partnerships to ensure that the local area action plans are drawn up as speedily as possible.  I would like to see them in place within the next two or three months at the outside.  The availability of well thoughtout plans at an early date will demonstrate our urgency in moving to address long term unemployment.  It will also mean that immediate action can be taken to tackle the many and complex facets of the problem.</P>
    <P>The local plans will detail the objectives and strategy for the local employment service, addressing the specific needs an opportunities of the local area, together with measures to obtain maximum benefit from existing State supports and services.  This includes: target groups &mdash; including profile and numbers &mdash; for the service in the area and expected take-up of the service over time; local development context, in which the needs of these target groups are to be addressed, including planned growth in employment or self-employment in the private, community or statutory sectors; resources available to meet those needs, including resources in local community-based job centres for the unemployed, partnerships, FÁS, the Department of Social Welfare and educational centres; identifying the full <Col N="1434" /> range of outlets in the area at which the different elements of the service could be provided; detailing local available training, education and work experience places and financial supports for taking up a job or self-employment; links with employers and employment and self-employment opportunities anticipated in the area in the plan period; identifying any gaps between resources needed to provide an integrated local employment service, which will amount to identifying the personnel needs, locations, training places, contacts that need to be established with employers and, finally how the services provided by the local employment centres, the enhanced core services of FÁS and the services of the other agencies can be effectively linked operationally.</P>
    <P>This plan will be at the core of the success of this initiative, the key requirement being that they assess the people they have to help, identify gaps in the resources available and work to decide what new, strategic interventions they must bring on stream.  The detailed plan will indicate how resources, both statutory and community-based, are to be deployed within the area to provide a comprehensive, integrated service to the long term unemployed.  The emphasis in the plan will be on making maximum and most effective use of existing resources.  Where it is considered necessary to make a case for additional resources, this will have to be clearly justified by reference to the plan and demonstrably cost-effective.</P>
    <P>The new service will be established in a way that ensures access for the long-term unemployed.  Ensuring easy access will involve creating physical access so that the long-term unemployed feel welcome and compatible in the surroundings; using buildings which are compatible and user-friendly for the provision of counselling; developing outreach services to the communities being served so that they do not have to travel long distances; inserting guidance modules into employment programmes for the long-term unemployed, such as community employment scheme, to ensure <Col N="1435" /> access by bringing guidance services to participants rather than assuming they can avail of services provided outside of these programmes; drawing up directories and guides to counselling provision in each area so that clients can be easily referred or can find out for themselves exactly what is on offer, where and from whom; creating a central point in a community or town where accurate information about which counselling service is most appropriate to the individual's needs can be given; and producing and distributing clear information about what the client may expect from a counselling service.</P>
    <P>The task force recommended that funding for the service should be put on a firm footing to ensure that all participants in the delivery of the service are able to plan strategically in the interests of the unemployed.  The service should, as far as possible, draw on existing resources, including the additional funds which will flow to areas designated as disadvantaged under the local development programme.</P>
    <P>In this regard the task force recommended that additional funding for the overhead costs of delivering the local service be provided in a new subhead of the Department assigned responsibility for the local employment service. However, it would only be drawn down on foot of a local plan agreed by the management committee that clearly identifies any resource gaps arising that cannot be met from existing resources. The overall allocation of funding between different areas would be subject to prior consultation with ADM Ltd. in designated areas of disadvantage. Funding should also be provided to the local management committees for a special local training and education fund for compensatory and innovative training measures to complement mainstream provision.  An agreed amount should be set aside from the overall budget for the service for this purpose. The special contribution of centres for the unemployed and community-based services for the unemployed, that would <Col N="1436" /> be incorporated into the integrated service, should be recognised by the provision of core funding on a multi-annual basis.  This should be agreed between the local management committees and the various funders of the service.  A special unit should be established within FÁS to deal specifically with the needs of the long-term unemployed and to provide support, by way of staffing or other resources, to the integrated local employment service.</P>
    <P>The FÁS unit would set standards for quality of service, provide accreditation and provide professional training and support to the guidance, counselling and active employment placement services available through the local employment service.  The FÁS unit would also facilitate the establishment of a national profile of all unemployed clients.</P>
    <P>In relation to 1995, the task force recommended that the Government allocate an additional £5 million to cover staffing and other resource gaps likely to arise in 1995 in the delivery of the local employment service &mdash; i.e. the provision of guidance and counselling services, active placements service, overhead costs &mdash; and an additional £1 million for a special local training and education fund.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the Government has also accepted this recommendation and an additional amount of £6 million has been allocated to my Department for 1995.</P>
    <P>In conclusion let me reiterate the central elements of the proposed approach as suggested by the task force: a clear planning framework and explicit local agreement for the delivery of the service at local level, indicating the extent of need for the service, how all available resources would be mustered to meet that need and performance indicators for measuring achievements of the programme as a whole and of the different agencies contributing to the programme; a recognition of the core functions of each statutory agency and their <Col N="1437" /> responsibility for the provision of specific services within the overall programme framework; a clear and unambiguous mandate to and responsibility on statutory agencies, from the government, to support and work in and through the local partnership structure to deliver an integrated package of services to the long term unemployed; and a commitment by Government and statutory agencies to build on the resources and strengths of local community-based services for the unemployed so as to create a service which is flexible, responsive to local need and acceptable to and identified with the local community.</P>
    <P>Local employers must be actively involved in the design and delivery of the service and be encouraged to see that there are no inherent disadvantages, in social and economic terms, in employing unemployed people.  The task force views employer involvement, through appropriate structures, as being essential to the successful placement of people in employment.  Therefore effective links between the service and employers have to be established.  The Northside Partnership in Coolock, to which I have already referred, has set a clear example of the way forward.  The obvious value of the service to local employers and unemployed people must only encourage others to follow suit.</P>
    <P>Clearly the success of the new local employment service will depend on co-operation at central and local level between the relevant Government Departments, State agencies, community groups, area partnerships, trade unions and employers.</P>
    <P>The Government has directed all Ministers to ensure that their Departments and the agencies under their control work with, in and through the local management committees in accordance with the agreed local plan for the local employment service so that a coherent, co-ordinated service is provided to the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>What we are talking about is a bringing together of all interventions for the <Col N="1438" /> long term unemployed into a coherent policy of positive discrimination.  Much of the information I have given is the dusty and arid detail of how this service will work and how we will bring this concept to fruition.  In essence, what we are doing today is recognising that the issue of the long term unemployed will not be solved by conventional economic policies alone.  The rate of economic growth will not unaided lift the boats of the long term unemployed.  We must focus on the people who have become disadvantaged or are at risk of being marginalised and address their needs across a range of services.  We must consider their needs in terms of improving their education, training opportunities and chances of placement in community employment.  Essentially, our overall aim is to lift the life chances of people now on the fringe.  That is what this local employment service is all about.  It is based locally because we recognise that no one in Merrion Street or in Dáil Éireann will produce a blueprint for people in different localities.  That must be done through the combined community effort of local employers, unions and members of the community along with our State agencies putting their shoulders to the wheel.</P>
    <P>In some cases where this has been tried it has been successful.  There is now in place an additional 14 pilot areas and we intend to expand this to a national basis quickly.  Essentially, we must get results and I am determined that this effort will succeed.  We have deployed our best people in this service and we will seek the co-operation of local people to make it successful.  It is a new start to our approach to long term unemployment.  I hope it will be a model of a successful approach to dealing with that difficult and intractable problem, a problem which poses the greatest challenge to all of us on both sides of the House who seek to address our critical employment priorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister, Deputy Bruton, for his in-depth analysis of this problem.  These policies can give <Col N="1439" /> rise to much fruitful work.  The Minister congratulated those who worked on the interim report.  I congratulate Maureen Gaffney and the forum for the fine report No. 4 which was the genesis of the &ldquo;Interim Report of the Task Force on Long-term Unemployment&rdquo;.  I congratulate the Minister on securing his portfolio, on having sole responsibility for this area vested in one Minister and on establishing a unit in his Department which was the subject of an ongoing turf war during my period in the Department. That turf war vaciliated from day to day and month to month according to people's views and I became very impatient about it on several occasions. Most people find that the greatest difficulty in dealing with unemployment is the range and complexity of agencies, establishments and their staff who act in good faith to help the unemployed.  At county level alone there are various agencies including area partnerships, county enterprise boards, FÁS, the Department of Social Welfare, and the IDA.  Forbairt and the back to work scheme organised by the Department of Social Welfare.  It is a wonder that any unemployed person or a person with a business idea is able to fight through the thicket to get to the fount of information. The Minister has responsibility for this area at ministerial level.  Other Ministers also deal with unemployment including the Minister, Ministers of State, Deputies Fitzgerald, and Gay Mitchell and the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A range of Ministers and agencies deal with it and there is a range of approaches and measures proposed in respect of it.  It would be worth considering, particularly at county level &mdash; not another body as I shudder at the thought of establishing another one &mdash; a coherent approach between county enterprise boards, the Leader programme, area partnership, FÁS, the Department of Social Welfare, the IDA and Forbairt.  When I was in the Minister's place and he in mine he outlined what changes he would make in this <Col N="1440" /> area when he came into the sunshine. He is in that position now and the challenge facing him is to make a coherent stream of the opportunities available to people, be they long or short term unemployed, people who have business ideas or who want to make progress. The range of opportunities open to people who have ideas and want to progress is truly perplexing.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Maureen Gaffney and the forum.  I also congratulate the Minister for setting up a unit in his Department headed by a civil servant whose name I should not mention, but I will. Mr. Rody Molloy, who is present.  To spare his blushes, I will just say that he is one of the best people the Minister could have put in charge of that unit.  He has undertaken an in-depth study of the area and he was very much involved in the turf wars to which I referred.</P>

      <P>People become perplexed when they hear the Minister speak on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and a half an hour later hear another Minister and the following evening another Minister all with noble ideals on the one issue.  When I was Minister people asked me who was responsible for this area and they still ask who is responsible.</P>

      <P>No, with the greatest respect they are not frightfully impressed with the plethora of people available to talk about this matter.  A <Col N="1441" /> multiplicity of the Department bodies and individuals are involved in dealing with this issue.  I welcome an overall body responsible for it.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke about the Cabinet being told to act in a co-ordinated fashion through local placement employment agencies.  I will go a little further and suggest that each Cabinet meeting should begin with a discussion on unemployment and each measure brought to Cabinet, be it a memorandum, legislation, notice of information should be employment proofed. There was a long period when we gender proofed everything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Not the Government's nominees to the chairs of committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government does not gender proof members of Cabinet or chairs of committee because it is exempt and only dictates that there should be 40 per cent gender representation on boards.  There is a remarkable dearth of the female sex, at Cabinet and on the chairs of committees.  The Minister should ensure that at Cabinet each measure is considered and has an addendum as to how it would promote, foster, encourage or, unfortunately in some cases, adversely affect employment. That would make people who may have finesounding ideas about employment think twice about their ideas in terms of their potential to adversely affect or improve employment prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first point concerns the proofing of each Government measure.  Second, in his contribution and when launching the interim report the Minister said the unit in his Department, headed by the estimable gentleman, of whom we spoke earlier, would have the task of reducing long term unemployment.  Until numbers are put on it long term unemployment will not be reduced.  I have said this constantly; it is not a new refrain.  I constantly asked the former Government, of which I was a member, to put a figure on it but I did not make much <Col N="1442" /> headway because we were tackling all the turf wars.  Having established that, the Minister will need to put on his armour because there will be snipes from the bushes.  I speak from experience. I am not being fanciful.</P>
    <P>The Minister will then have to suggest a target number by which to reduce unemployment.  We know the number of long term unemployed as that is what the report is all about but the target would be a worth-while measure and has been adopted by the Belgium and Dutch Governments.  At the Social Affairs Council of Ministers, both Ministers admitted the inroads they made are not substantial and said there would not be further inroads unless there was a numerical target towards which to aspire.  At the end of each month when we get the unemployment figures, statistics should also be provided in respect of the long term unemployed and how they had been affected.  It is not a case of &ldquo;how could we do it&rdquo;, as was put to me.  If you set an objective you can work towards it yearly and monthly by producing the figures for the long term unemployed.  This is the only quantifiable way, as a nation, that we can do this.  I do not speak here in an adversarial sense.</P>
    <P>While my remarks at the outset about the turf wars may be taken as jocose they were the truth.  Until we set targets we will not reduce the numbers of long term unemployed.  It is far too easy to use the jargon of the ESRI who, a month ago, issued a flowery report outlining the wonderful Ireland we will inhabit in 1995, in which all incomes will be increased, and there will be economic growth and reduced unemployment. Unfortunately, we are a small exposed country and the winds have begun to blow.  If the 1 per cent mortgage increase remains I shudder to think what it will mean for the recipients of the miserable, scrooge like 2.5 per cent social welfare entitlements.  The same applies in respect of the rosy scenario of employment.  While the ESRI and all the learned economic commentators make forecasts they are fallible and the country is small and exposed.  We have <Col N="1443" /> been told we will have economic growth and that we have had massive growth for the past three or four years way beyond that achieved by any other country, although I cast doubt on the veracity and accuracy of the type of growth included in those figures.  It is startling that if we can have that growth we still cannot tackle unemployment. We all quote Seán Lemass: &ldquo;the rising tide will lift all boats&rdquo;.  However, this quote is misused as it lifts only those in employment, not the long term unemployed. Page 19 of the interim report states:</P>
    <P>The central finding of the Forum's Report is that the long term unemployed are not being effectively brought back into the mainstream labour market through existing measures.  One of the most striking statements in the Forum's Report is that those who have been unemployed for more than two years have a 74% chance of being unemployed one year later.  This figure rises to over 80% for males aged 25-44 and to 90% for males aged 45-54.</P>
    <P>A young man of 25 who is unemployed for two years has an 80 per cent chance of remaining unemployed, this rises to 90 per cent for males aged 45 to 54.  The chances of a person in his 40s who may be the only breadwinner in his family, getting a job are 10 per cent, a frightening statistic.  Unless we tackle that problem no Government or politician of any party can go to the electorate when the time comes to be re-elected and say they have done their job properly.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that, unfortunately, reports for the end of the decade indicated that this difficulty would not be eased and that the chances of aiding long term unemployed were scant.  Presumably the purpose of the earlier Forum Report and this interim dissertation on it is that we will give more optimism and hope to the long term unemployed, hence the focused approach to which the Minister referred.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1444" /> We speak about the long term unemployed as if they are a mass of people, faceless, characterless, nameless, aspirationless, hopeless with no vitality in their lives; they are just a group.  Each individual started off with hopes and aspirations and wants to see them realised.  The most frightening and stultifying thing for the unemployed is to wake up each day and have nothing to do, nowhere to go and not to have an aim in life.  Each day their self-confidence is eroded, their sense of being able to look another person in the face and say they are of value to themselves and other people, not necessarily in terms of monetary reward: though clearly that comes into it, particularly when one has family responsibilities. This is a confidence that comes from being needed, being part of society and being involved in a community employment project, paid work, education, training and finally a job in the mainstream labour market.  That is all contained in the report.</P>
    <P>The Minister praised the Northside Partnership in Coolock, as I do.  When I studied it last year I was amazed at what could be done by strong interventionist hands-on tactics.  Nothing else can help the long term unemployed. When I began to preach that doctrine in the Department of Enterprise and Employment there were those who said I was dangerously socialist.  There were those who said &mdash; they are still in that Department &mdash; that I was off my head and that market forces would help.  I was told that if we got the economy right, if there was growth and consensus among the social partners and competitiveness in industry we would somehow solve the problem of long term unemployment. It has not happened and it will not happen unless money, time, effort, dedication, commitment and constant intervention is put into the services to help the long term unemployed.  They can be helped.  It means looking at every single unemployed person, man and woman of every age, and saying the State can help them.  In this case &ldquo;the <Col N="1445" /> State&rdquo; means the State agencies, employers, employees and community leaders within an area who can work together under the area based partnerships. I do not have to outline how difficult and time consuming the task is and the need for everyone to be involved if the process is to be effective.  There are opportunities available for people in every area but the problem is that there is no way to match people with the projects &mdash; the live register data available to us is very poor.  Fianna Fáil tried to deal with this issue in Government but the report said that very little could be done in this regard.  There is a great dearth of knowledge about the qualifications and potential of people on the live register.  We will need proper information if we are to match unemployed people with a programme or project which suits them.  We do not know the number of carpenters, musicians or people with no skills on the live register and this data should be compiled on a county basis.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, that we cannot sit back and wait for the long term unemployed to approach us.  These people do not know where to go or whom to ask for the information which will give them a first, second or third foothold in the employment market. The interim report has targeted the long term unemployed and people who are in danger of slipping into this category. We should abandon the practice of declaring people who have been unemployed for one year as long term unemployed. This is degrading.  People should not have to wait for a year before receiving help, at which stage they may have become despondent and less motivated.  They should be given help after six months.</P>
    <P>We must adopt a tailor-made approach to each individual.  All must be scrutinised as to their employment potential and targets must be set.  The relevant unit in the Minister's Department should put up on its wall a chart with the number of long term unemployed and the target for the following <Col N="1446" /> month.  This is the only way we can achieve our objectives.</P>
    <P>In a reply to a parliamentary question the Minister said that job sharing would be discussed at the NESC forum on 28 March.  This measure has proved very effective in countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands where unemployed people fill the vacancies created by people who take career breaks etc.  This is a very worthy measure and there should be no resistance to its introduction in this country.  The best way of giving unemployed people experience and a foothold in the employment market is to fill vacancies created in the Civil Service by people who have taken career breaks.  There is no reason this should raise the hackles of unions as it would be proper and structured job experience.</P>
    <P>The main vehicle for progressing the local employment initiative is the community employment programme.  I am appalled at the way in which the programme is being managed this year.  The funding has been increased but there has been no corresponding increase in the numbers.  Voluntary sponsors are being told by their local FÁS office that their projects cannot start and that they have been told to manage the programme in a &ldquo;sensitive&rdquo; way so as to reduce the numbers.  Prior to the publication of the report constant calls were made to free up the community employment programme so as to allow projects to commence.  There is no sensitive way of telling a person a project cannot begin.  There is a clear difference between what the Minister has set out here and what he is doing on the other side.  I urge him to get both sides working together so that the very fine ideas put forward in the interim report are not negated on the other side.  Otherwise the number of long term unemployed will increase and the chances will decrease.</P>
    <P>The main aim should be to ensure that people do not slip into the long term unemployment net and become a statistic.  The Minister has set up a unit to help industries, particularly those in <Col N="1447" /> the textile sector, adapt to changing circumstances. It is ludicrous to announce that a staggering sum of £22 million has been allocated to this unit to help people stay in what are regarded as the older and more traditional employments when 108 jobs in Sunbeam and 250 jobs in the Silverlea factories in Athlone and Athy are about to go to the wall.  Industries can be helped through a difficult patch where there are proven markets.  I am not so silly as to think that we should prop up an industry which had no market for its products. There are clear markets for the products produced by Sunbeam and Silverlea and these industries need help during this difficult period.</P>
    <P>All the fancy words and press releases in the world will not get over the fact that many people are desperately distraught. I received a telephone call today from a worker in Sunbeam who could not understand the report in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> which stated that £22 million would be provided to help people stay in employment in traditional industries when all she wants is her job in Sunbeam.  Will the Minister give some of that money to the Sunbeams and the Silverleas who have proven markets for their goods?  It would be money well spent.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is in office 90 days today and I would regard myself as reasonably informed about what it has <Col N="1448" /> done.  There have been five or six investigations into leaks and a number of task forces have been set up and programme managers and advisers appointed.  There have been many bureaucratic responses to the nation's problems, but little by way of decision making.  I have much regard for the Minister who has a genuine commitment to the plight of the unemployed.  I receive copies of all his scripts and read them carefully.  In the scripts dealing with the substance of his ministry, there is much emphasis on bureaucracy, committees, task forces and reviews and very little by way of action or decision. I am not expecting an unreasonable response in 90 days, but as this Government took up office mid-way through this Dáil term it has only two and a half years &mdash; not a long time &mdash; to prove itself.  The Minister should be more decisive in making the policy decisions that are necessary if we are to deal with the fundamental problem affecting employment.</P>
    <P>We have a workforce of approximately 1.9 million people and an enormous number of State bodies and boards helping to create jobs and encourage enterprise and initiative. Apart from Forbairt, IDA Ireland, Forfás and FÁS, we have area partnership companies, local enterprise boards and the proposed local employment service. My main concern is that this is not a co-ordinated and integrated response.  Notwithstanding the difficult problems that face the long term unemployed, we cannot separate the employment issue as neatly as some people believe.</P>
    <P>I join with the Minister and Deputy O'Rourke in complimenting the National Economic and Social Forum for its comprehensive and thought-provoking report.  It contained much of the analysis that has been carried out on unemployment and focused on the question of long term unemployment.  I share its view that the problem is not insurmountable.  We must start from the premise of setting targets and of assuming that we can solve problems. We must set ambitious, not unrealistic, <Col N="1449" /> targets.  I have always believed that politicians working to targets are more likely to achieve success than if they do not set targets, and only have an aspiration or commitment to do something about the problem.  One of the disappointments about the programme for Government is that it does not set specific targets on unemployment or the obstacles in our economy to the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt at length with the analysis in the report of the task force &mdash; which was a response to the Forum's report &mdash; on the profile of the long term unemployed.  In October last 135,000 people &mdash; one in ten of the workforce &mdash; were long term unemployed.  The report states that 92,000 people have been unemployed for two years and 66,000 for three years.  It also states that a person who is unemployed for two years has a 74 per cent chance of still being unemployed after three years.  Those are frightening statistics.  Given our small population and a workforce of less than two million people, to have so many people cast into the role of being long term unemployed is a frightening thought.  The Minister referred to the 7 per cent cost to our GDP.  If one considers the indirect costs such as health, crime, social deprivation, exclusion, family breakdown and general stress, the figure is much higher.</P>
    <P>Many of us deal with the consequences of long term unemployment because, in general, those people live in clusters in urban areas.  There are large areas in my constituency where the unemployment rate is much higher than the national average, in some cases up to 50 per cent of the workforce of an area can be unemployed.  I know the indirect effects of unemployment.  It is my philosophy that every able bodied person should have an opportunity to participate in the development of the country or economy in which they live. We must start from that basis.  I do not believe people who are capable of contributing to the social and economic development of their community or <Col N="1450" /> country should be facilitated not to work.</P>
    <P>If we are really intent on tackling the scourge of unemployment we must change certain fundamentals in this economy.  We must examine the cause and what prolongs and deepens the problem of unemployment.  We must also examine the profile of the unemployed. As the report states, half of those unemployed do not have formal educational qualifications.  Any response to the problem of unemployment, whether community employment schemes or otherwise, that does not provide an element of training and education will not equip people with the skills or attitude to allow them take up regular paid employment which, for as long as we can see into the future, will be the norm in our society.  Much of the training may have to be attitudinal because if children grow up in families and communities where nobody works, they will not have a correct attitude towards employment.</P>
    <P>We must also examine the policy matters that affect unemployment.  In that regard I wish to refer to the Culliton report.  Many people claim that my party is like a long playing record on tax reform but, as I said at the outset, we cannot separate matters that affect economic decisions and the behaviour of citizens in the way the Minister and this report propose.  That is far too simplistic.  The Culliton report stated:</P>
    <P>We need a spirit of self-reliance &mdash; determination to take charge of our future &mdash; to build an economy of real strength and permanence which will give jobs and wealth sufficient to our needs.</P>
    <P>It continued:</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government to take the hard political decisions needed for a decisive reform of the tax system ....  The group (referring to the Culliton group) would not argue that lowering marginal tax rates will, for example, by itself, lead to an immediate and evident surge in <Col N="1451" /> activity and in job creation.  But by removing the demoralising effect of the current tax system and removing the waste of non-productive tax avoidance activities, reform will create a far more conducive environment for productive enterprise and for more solidly based investment decisions.  In no other single area does the Government have at its disposal the tools to make as far reaching and effective a reform to support an enterprise economy as in taxation.</P>
    <P>I agree with that.  Just over a year ago, before his retirement, the former Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Maurice Doyle, drew the attention of the House to the problem of what he called the tax welfare trap, the huge gap between the cost of employment and take home pay. These are among the factors that lead to so much employment in this economy. We cannot say that that only affects short term unemployment; it goes right across the board.  It is worth recalling that long term unemployment in Ireland is higher than the total employment in many of the OECD countries.  For example, the level of long term unemployment here is three times higher than it is in Germany or the United Kingdom, twice as high as in Belgium and France and ten times higher than in Sweden and the United States.</P>
    <P>If we are to create employment opportunities, if we are even to halve unemployment by the end of the century and assume no net emigration, we will have to create 45,000 jobs each year to the year 2000.  It is a frightening figure but that is the challenge that faces anybody with responsibility for enterprise and employment.  We must confront the obstacles to the creation of those jobs.  Taxation is fundamental and so, too, is bureaucracy.  Not everybody is prepared to take a risk but those who do create an opportunity not just for themselves but for others.  They most frequently complain that, despite the plethora of enterprise boards, the <Col N="1452" /> bureaucracy, the ministerial announcements about new schemes etc., when they look for assistance it is not available.</P>
    <P>A person in my constituency who was unemployed a few years ago started a small cement products business.  He employs five people and has the capacity to employ five more.  He, on his own behalf and I, on his behalf, have gone from one Government agency to another to see if there is any way of helping him and the answer is no, because he is in an area where there is already a sufficient supply.  He is earning a very small income for himself and his young family and has put everything into the business.  He has told me that if he had remained unemployed for the past few year he would be better off in terms of the net gain to his family than he now is, having taken the risk and made the effort.</P>
    <P>The local authority and everybody else are hounding him to pay his rates and other bills, but he has managed to survive and take himself away from being unemployed.  His story is typical of many who want to make an effort. He sees the State investing £156,000 per job in Irish Steel and wonders how it can get that level of investment.  Is it because it is a State company and has clout?</P>
    <P>The response of Government, not just this Government, has been patchy and haphazard.  It is not a fair response. Many small businesses in our economy do not get the same opportunity as foreign inward investors.  If there is anything I would encourage the Minister to do it is to operate a level of support to industry that is fair and uniform, that would apply as much to the Irish person as it does to the foreigner, that appreciates the risk they take and reduces the bureaucracy they must put up with.  It is crazy that a small company has to file between 60 and 80 forms with the Companies Office if small changes take place in its enterprise in any given year.  I spoke to a company secretary about it this morning and was shocked at the level of bureaucracy involved.  Despite <Col N="1453" /> that, when controversies arise and one looks for details in the Companies Office, one discovers that the statistics are three years out of date.  When Deputies sought details when the C &amp; D Petfoods controversy arose, the files were out of date, yet there is a requirement on individuals in regard to such records.  It seems that what we are trying to do in our economy is stop rather than encourage enterprise.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to see the Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, in the House.  I am confused as to his role in employment development at local level <i>vis-à-vis</i> that of the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  It is not that I object to the involvement of the two individuals.  However, it seems to be part of a diffuse approach to unemployment, that there will be a little from this Department and a little from that.  It is part of the reason we end up with so much bureaucracy.  It would be much better if this were focused in one Department.  Regardless of the nature of jobs or the function they have to fulfil at local level, if we are to have a focused integrated approach which the forum recommended and which the task force reiterates, the responsibility must lie with one Minister alone.  All the resources, all the excellent back-up services that Ministers have &mdash; we have very talented public servants committed to the task ahead &mdash; should be located in one Department, the Department of Enterprise and employment.</P>
    <P>I began by saying that if we are to deal with the problem of long term unemployment we need to have a profile of the unemployed.  I cannot emphasise enough how important that is. Broadly speaking, we know that half of them have no formal educational qualifications, we have details about their age and the fact that they have many dependants, but we do not have specific details about the unemployed.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Mitchell was spokesman on Justice he said, in regard to the prison population, that we needed to know who they were, as we drew certain assumptions about them, that they came from poor backgrounds and had a low <Col N="1454" /> level of education etc.  The assumptions are generally right because there has been much general research into those who commit crime, but there are no specific details.  Deputy Mitchell wanted to know if we can have an appropriate legislative or Government response if we do not know who or what we are dealing with.  The same applies to the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Frequently one hears that a school requires a part-time caretaker to work under one of the community schemes. On contacting people in one's constituency who are unemployed one discovers that none is available to do this job &mdash; perhaps they are better off on social welfare because they have a large number of dependants, have health problems or are not in a position, for one reason or another, to take up that job.</P>
    <P>Much time is wasted at local level trying to fill vacancies that arise in a particular area.  That is why I strongly urge the Government to implement the recommendation in the forum report in regard to the appointment of mediators. In regard to those unemployed for more than a year, we should know who they are, their circumstances, their interests and their attitude to employment.  This is not just a question of filling in biographical details on a form.  It requires much more.</P>
    <P>When I was informed that this debate was to take place I had to ask the Whip which task force was in question.  I thought it was intended to debate the report of the task force on small businesses. To some extent this debate seems nothing more than legislative polyfilla because we have run out of legislation.  I hope that is not our attitude. I can think of no other area that should concern us more than the level of unemployment in this economy.  It is destroying our country and leading to a sense of isolation, deprivation and dependency.  It has the capacity to destroy us.  A group of more than 300,000 people is an enornous political lobby.</P>
    <P>Recently I asked the Taoiseach to include the Irish National Organisation <Col N="1455" /> for the Unemployed in any new social and economic group the Government might be involved in but he refused to give a commitment.  He said it would be involved in the National Economic and Social Council.  If this House is serious about combating unemployment and looking after the needs of the long term unemployed the first group to negotiate any new national economic and social programme should represent the unemployed. Up to now official responses and national programmes have been very much dictated by the interests of those at work, not those seeking work. Unless the Government gives a commitment to include them in negotiations, there will be no point in having debates, setting up more bureaucracy or initiating a local employment service with all that would do in terms of placement, training and opportunities.  If we do not involve those who represent and are the sole voice of the unemployed our commitment is not as great as it should be, is not genuine and we will be accepting defeatism and cynicism.</P>
    <P>I hope this is the beginning of many debates on unemployment.  I note the task force, in its report of October 1995, will review performance and make other suggestions.  I hope this House too, either through a committee of the House or through formal debates in the House, will continue to review performance in this area and not just accept an establishment of new units or new services. We have to look at the practical results.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterpise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have appointed IBI Corporate Finance Limited to advise on the possible sale of shares in and control of Irish Steel Limited.  The overall objective is to sell at least a majority stake in Irish Steel Limited, with the State keeping a minority stake. Notwithstanding this objective, offers for up to 100 per cent will also be considered. The question of granting a percentage shareholding to the workforce will be explored with potential investors.</P>
      <P>The overall objective of seeking a strategic partner is to secure the future viability of the company.  However, because it is not possible at this stage to predict the exact nature of any investment proposals which may be received, it is not possible to state what the legislative, financial and employment implications will be.  Any prospective strategic partner will be expected to contribute to the investment programme in the company and will also be expected to give undertakings in relation to the retention of employment in the company.</P>
      <P>While it is difficult to be exact in this matter, it is my expectation that negotiations to secure an investor in Irish Steel Limited should be completed by the summer.  Similarly, it is expected that the question of EU approval of the investment proposals in Irish Steel Limited should be determined in a broadly similar timeframe.  However, the company's viability plan envisages a timeframe for full implementation until the middle of 1997.</P>

      <P>The Minister has indicated the IBI Corporate Finance Limited has been appointed to advise <Col N="1457" /> him and that the sale of a majority shareholding in Irish Steel has not been ruled out.  There is also a possibility that all the shares will be sold.  I am glad this is now out in the open and the position has been made plain.  I hope everyone realises the legislative and other implications. What are the terms of reference of the company which the Minister has asked to advise him on this matter and the timeframe within which it is working? It is well known that an Italian firm has expressed an interest in Irish Steel. Will the Government invest between £50 million and £70 million before agreement is reached with a prospective partner?  In other words, will a potential buyer assume control of the company following a massive State injection?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The State will not hand over any massive sum to any potential investor.  In the application which has been submitted to the European Union a maximum has been set on the amount the State may inject in the context of achieving the company's viability plan on our own.  Any prospective partner will be expected to participate in the investment programme.  The investment programme envisaged under the viability plan spans a number of years and each element will be subjected to a cost benefit analysis before any taxpayers' money is invested.  There is no question of any money being handed over to any potential investor. The terms of reference of the Investment Bank of Ireland Corporate Finance Limited are to seek to determine as quickly as possible if any of the potential strategic partners wishes to proceed with a serious bid for the company and to assess that bid on behalf of the State.</P>

      <P>I understand the IBI Corporate Finance Limited will be acting on behalf of the State but I am still unclear whether Irish Steel is to be sold. We have heard for the first time that all the shares in the company may be sold. The Minister has not given me a clear answer.  Will any potential purchaser <Col N="1458" /> receive the benefit of any State investment and at what point will it assume control?  In other words, will the State invest in the company, control of which will then be assumed by a potential purchaser who perhaps will run it down after a period and have no brief to retain employment?  The workforce is highly motivated and the level of employment has been stabilised.  To put the minds of the public at ease and to remove uncertainty, will the Minister elaborate on the answers he has given?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be part of the brief of the Investment Bank of Ireland Corporate Finance Limited to secure all elements of the agreement, including commitments in relation to the retention of employment.  There is no question of the State handing over money without a firm investment agreement within a potential partner which will pin down the respective contributions of each party.  The advisers who represent my Department and the taxpayer will be determined to secure a fair deal in any negotiations.  Any prospective strategic partner will be expected to contribute to the investment programme in the company and will also be expected to give undertakings in relation to the retenton of employment in the company.  They are critical features about which the Deputy has expressed concern and they are covered by the brief given to the advisers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>In a press announcement the Minister stated that he had received Cabinet approval to invest in the region of £50 million to £60 million in the company.  I do not know the exact figure.  May I take it that the sum to be invested is not sacrosanct, that it will depend on the number of shares sold to a potential purchaser?  Will the Minister elaborate on the timeframe involved? We were told that the negotiations would be completed by last October, then December and March and now the Minister is talking about the summer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the viability plan presented by the company the Government has applied to the European Union for permission to invest in the company up to a maximum figure which is specified in the application. There is no suggestion that the Government will invest this amount. Any drawing down of State money is related, in the first instance, to whether a partner is found.  In the event of a partner not being found it is related to a detailed assessment of each capital project.  The Government decision has set a maximum figure in the context of a solely Government-owned Irish Steel viability plan.  Clearly, in the context of having partners, that would be an entirely different figure.  The timeframe is as I have indicated.  Obviously, we will work to a tight timeframe but negotaitions will have to be conducted with the various interested parties.  A realistic period by which we would know where we stood in relation to a potential partner would be the summer.</P>

      <Quest>the action, if any, he proposes to take on reports of excessive rises in retail drink prices in the Dublin area; his views on regulation in the wholesale drink industry; and the advices, informal, interim or otherwise, he has on these issues from the Director of Consumer Affairs.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of Consumer Affairs is finalising his report of his investigation and I do not propose to take any action until I have received and considered it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the regulation of the wholesale drinks industry the regulation of trade in all sectors of the economy will be greatly improved by strengthening competition law in line with the policy agreement for Government.  I refer specifically to the proposals to give the Competition Authority powers of enforcement and to enable the courts to <Col N="1460" /> impose fines on those found to be engaging in anti-competitive activity.  In this regard it is my intention to seek to have the Bill enacted at an early date. The director's report may be appropriate to the Authority to follow up with its proposed enforcement powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the request to the Director of Consumer Affairs was made over a year and a half ago when he was asked to report to the then Minister on the disparity of retail drink prices in the Dublin area.  That seems to be quite a long delay on the part of the director who is normally more expeditious in these matters.  Has the Minister received an informal interim report from the Director of Consumer Affairs, bearing in mind that it is now a year and a half since the public was alerted to the fact that Mr. Fagan was visiting pubs in Dublin to ascertain the prices of alcohol?  From information given to me, the prices of alcohol in certain pubs are alarmingly varied.  Why has there been a delay of a year and a half in producing this report and why will the Minister not provide me with the interim report which the director has given to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an interim report but it does not indicate any basis for a successful action in regard to alleged collusion or price fixing.  Notwithstanding that, there have been some other related practices which the Director of Consumer Affairs believes are worthy of further investigation.  That is being undertaken at present.  It was the issue of collusion on prices rather than high pricing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would, but the Deputy referred to variation in prices with some vey high pricing.  That would not be the subject of an investigation because high pricing is not an abuse of competition law.  However, collusive efforts to fix prices would constitute an <Col N="1461" /> abuse of competition law.  That matter was investigated and, from what is indicated in the interim report, there are no grounds for taking action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On the subject of drink prices, will the Minister ask the Director of Consumer Affairs to investigate the alarming prices being charged for bottled water?  One can pay from £1 to £2 for a bottle of aerated water in pubs, lounges and bars.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take note of what the Deputy says.  Competition law, for which the director is one of the authorised agents, only allows the investigation of anti-competitive practices, not high pricing.  However, if there are grounds for concern about competition rules I will certainly have them examined.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Enterprise and Employment</askee>
      <Quest>the reason Irish companies must rely on preference shares rather than grants as the principle means of State support while foreign owned companies are not restricted in the same way; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The levels and type of assistance to Irish and overseas companies reflect the very different requirements of these companies.</P>
      <P>The type of financial assistance required by Irish companies reflects the development needs of Irish businesses. The trend towards equity participation in Irish companies is in line with the recommendations of the &ldquo;Review of Industrial Performance 1990&rdquo; and endorsed by Culliton and in the then Government decision on the recommendations of the Moriarty Task Force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a wide range of assistance available to Irish companies to improve their capabilities and increase their competitiveness on the one hand and support expansion on the other.  This assistance includes equity participation where appropriate but also <Col N="1462" /> encompasses grants for feasibility studies, product and process development, technology acquisition, management development, employment and capital equipment.  Access to graduate placement programmes is also available.</P>
    <P>In the case of Forbairt, the agency with primary responsibility for indigenous industry, I understand that moneys paid out to companies in 1994 amounted to £42 million and of this, equity investment in Irish companies amounted to £11.6 million.  This shows that grants still account for the bulk of the overall financial supports provided to Irish companies.</P>
    <P>The primary objectives of taking equity stakes in indigenous companies currently is to promote a more self-reliant and less grant dependent industrial sector and to achieve a measure of repayability of support by the industrial development agencies.  Equity is at present invested mainly in the form of low coupon preference shares.  The coupon rate and the redemption period in each case will reflect the agency's developmental role, the financial position of the recipient company and the need to provide an equitable package in comparison with packages provided in other similar cases either by the agency concerned or other development agencies.</P>
    <P>In the case of attracting inward investment, the reality is that promoters are, generally speaking, not disposed to taking equity as part of the incentive package on offer.  The key objective underlying the negotiations with overseas promoters is to land the project and achieve the best possible value for the State.  This can include equity investment in appropriate circumstances. However, the Deputy will appreciate that if IDA Ireland is to compete effectively for overseas mobile investment it must pay the &ldquo;going-rate&rdquo; and, in this regard, the nature and form of its incentives package must at least match that of the competition.</P>
    <P>As indicated in my reply to the Deputy's question on this issue on 15 February last, State financial support for inward investment is not given at the <Col N="1463" /> expense of support for the development of indigenous industry which is the primary focus of industrial policy.  I repeat also that this Government's commitment to the development of indigenous industry is reflected in the resources being allocated to indigenous industry in the new Operational Programme for Industrial Development which I announced recently.  Over the period of the programme, 1994 to 1999, funding to improve the capabilities of indigenous industry will be increased by 29 per cent compared to the previous programme, whereas spend on inward investment will decline by 18 per cent.</P>
    <P>I would add that I am currently initiating a policy review in relation to policy on foreign direct investment and on indigenous industrial development which will address the effectiveness, value for money and other aspects of the respective policies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another review which I can add to my list.  The most accurate statement in the Minister's reply was that foreign promoters were not disposed to equity investment.  They do not want the State to invest in their companies; they want grant aid.  Will the Minister not accept that Irish companies are being discriminated against in two respects?  First, they get less per job by way of grant aid than their foreign competitors &mdash; the grant aid to foreign companies is at least £3,000 per job more than to Irish companies &mdash; and, second, contrary to what the Minister said, equity investment is substituting for grant aid because the State wants to get back from Irish companies what it gives in greater proportions to foreign companies. This clearly discriminates against those in our society who are taking risks, developing enterprises and creating jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an issue about which I was concerned when in Opposition. Despite Deputy Harney's dislike for reviews, I have initiated a policy review of these two areas.  Such a <Col N="1464" /> decision cannot be taken on the hoof. Careful consideration is needed as to the most effective way to support indigenous companies and attract foreign companies.  The range of capability supports available to indigenous companies is very wide.  We are attempting to support them in building strategic capabilities within the company rather than by simply giving capital grants.</P>
      <P>In simple cost per job comparisons the wider range of supports that exists is often missed.  There has been an indication of convergence in terms of cost per job.  For example, while in the 1986-92 period there was a gap of £7,500 between the amounts paid to a foreign company and a domestic company, that gap has now closed to less than £3,000. Aggregate figures conceal the capital requirements of different projects and they are not always easy to compare.  I share the concern expressed by the Deputy, but the best way to address the needs of indigenous industry is not necessarily by giving grants.  The strategy approach is the correct one to adopt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last point made by the Minister.  If we reformed our tax system and reduced corporation profits tax it would be much more beneficial than either the grant or equity investment route.  Will the minister confirm that in 1994 there was an increase of 50 per cent over the previous year in investment given by way of equity and that Forbairt is moving very fast in the direction of equity rather than grants? If that is so, will he ask Forbairt to review its position on this issue and certainly not to increase the amount of equity investment until he carries out an overall review of foreign investment in this country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the direction is towards grater equity investment. This is a move to which I have no objection. It is consistent with the Culliton approach and that of building the capabilities of Irish companies, I will investigate the adequacy of support for <Col N="1465" /> indigenous industry.  If we are to compete for overseas mobile investment we must pay the going price.  In some cases projects, because of their spin-off effects and the significant contribution they can make to the economy, are worth attracting to Ireland.  It will not always be a case of simply fixing maximum ceilings; there must be flexibility.  I am anxious to review the issue raised by the Deputy to ensure the strategy is robust for the future.</P>

      <Quest>the reason there is such a price difference between British magazines sold in Britain and the same magazines sold in this country; and the steps, if any, he proposes to take to outlaw excessive mark-ups.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the conclusions of the Competition Authority on notification No. CA1080/92 dealing with Easons and Newspread in their 1993 annual report. This report was placed in the Library of the House on 30 June 1994.  I would certainly be concerned if there was an unreasonable price difference between British magazines sold in Britain and the same magazines sold in this State. The Competition Authority, whose report I referred to, considered this issue in 1992-93 in the context of the then currency turmoil and the exchange rate arrangements between distributors. The Authority concluded that there were anti-competitive practices in the agreement notified to them and in the other associated arrangements between the main importers.  In the event the agreement notified to the Authority was withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to provide for more effective enforcement of competition rules to the benefit of consumers I propose to amend competition law in line with the policy agreement for Government.  I refer specifically to the proposals to give the Competition Authority powers of <Col N="1466" /> enforcement and to enable the courts to impose fines on those found to be engaging in anti-competitive activity.  It is my intention to seek to have a Bill in this regard enacted at an early date.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the Deputy's concern, I have asked the Department to prepare a report on the price comparisons to which she referred.  At this stage we are short of detailed information to take the matter further but I hope we will be able to study it to see if there is cause for concern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is taking the matter seriously because it is an ongoing cause of concern. There is a huge mark-up on magazines, with a difference in price between the UK and here of between 50p and £1.50.  In 1992 I met the proprietors of Easons and other booksellers who more or less told me not to bother my head about this matter, that prices are fixed well in advance, it is a complicated matter and one should forget about it.  We should not have to pay up to £1.50 extra for magazines imported from the UK.  I am not talking about newspapers.  If I did so the Ceann Comhairle would say it is a separate question.  A report is being complied which we await.  I am glad the Minister is taking the initiative in this regard.  I am convinced that strong anti-competitive activities are practised by groupings in terms of the sale of imported magazines from the UK and it is not fair that this practice be allowed continue.</P>

      <P>I would refer Deputies to the reply I gave to the Adjournment motion on insurance costs on 2 February 1995 in this House.  In my reply I indicated that my Department has been examining the key factors contributing to high insurance costs, including the factors to which I referred in the interview alluded to by the Deputy in the Irish Insurance Federation's publication <i>Insurance Update.</i></P>
      <P>Following this examination I have decided to commission a detailed consultancy study to provide a substantive analysis of insurance costs in Ireland and their economic impact and evaluate the key factors contributing to higher costs here as compared to competing economies.  I expect this study to provide an informed analytical basis for consideration of efficient and effective measures to reduce insurance costs to more competitive levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can confirm for the Deputy's information that my priorities for the insurance industry during 1995 are as stated in <i>Insurance Update,</i> namely maintaining the highest standards of prudential supervision to ensure that companies are, and remain, in a position to meet their liabilities to policyholders; the reduction of non-life insurance costs; greater transparency in the marketing of insurance products; a regulatory regime on the marketing of <Col N="1469" /> insurance which will encourage consumer confidence in the insurance industry and which will encourage the development of a more competitive insurance market, and the identification and implementation of measures which will assist the industry to maintain and increase its support for employment, both directly and indirectly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  Has he specific proposals on the cost of motor insurance for young drivers because quotations are unacceptably high?  Is he aware that in the United Kingdom motor insurers are considering a young drivers scheme and has he proposals for such a scheme here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a hoary old chestnut and what the Deputy says is correct.  Costs for young drivers are punitive but they are directly related to the incidence of accidents and the level of awards.  The sophisticated statistical data base available to insurance companies can identify with great precision the areas of highest risk and consequently their products are beginning to mirror that, for example there are now special packages available to women drivers who &mdash; Deputy O'Rourke will be delighted to hear &mdash; are safer drivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Women are quite good drivers in spite of what everybody thinks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Young drivers come out very badly in the statistical analysis and hence it is reflected in the cost of premiums.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked about the UK scheme but perhaps the Minister will reply to that later.  What is the Department's view on direct selling as against the traditional method of brokers and underwriters?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with the way the product is marketed and sold.  The problem afflicting young <Col N="1470" /> drivers is that they simply cannot get premiums at reasonable cost because of the general problems to which I have just referred.  Young drivers have more accidents, and the frequency and level of awards is higher than in the United Kingdom, the jurisdiction to which the Deputy referred.</P>
      <P>The general measures to which I referred in my reply which are designed to get insurance costs down generally will, I hope, have a spin off and have some impact for young drivers.  They are the category that bears the greatest penalty and highest burden having regard to the current level of premiums.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe the word processed reply which he read out?  I recognise the wording because it was there when I was at his desk some months ago.  Did I read correctly that the Minister announced to <i>The Irish Times</i> that he would appoint consultants to look at the cost of insurance to make sure there is an informed analytical basis?  If what is in <i>The Irish Times</i> and what the Minister has subsequently announced to the House is what he will do, does it mean the Minister is leaving aside the four or five consultancy reports he already has, including one from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, a very heavy one from the Department on the capping of insurance awards and the plethora of consultants' studies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which I know are already on the Minister's desk? Given that the Minister said the high cost of claims is the problem, has he any view on whether he will support legislation to cap such awards or will he wait until the consultants tell him what his Department has already told him.  The very fine officials in the Department have produced a good report which indicates the way forward.  The Minister does not need another report if he acts on the official advice which I know to be on his desk.</P>

      <P>I have great admiration for Deputy Brennan's preparedness to come into the House to offer views on what should be done on the cost of insurance premiums.  It is little wonder he recognises the answer as coming off the word processor because that was the way it was programmed when he was Minister.  We continue to get the same answer in this House month after month but no action.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The action by the then Minister Deputy Brennan unfortunately had no effect.  He told the consumer that the abolition of juries and two counsel would bring down insurance premiums but it had no appreciable impact at all&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which was a problem which Deputy Brennan generally had in the Department.  As regards availability of reports, the problem is that some reports and some evidence points to insurance costs being higher in this jurisdiction than in the neighbouring jurisdiction, but the essence of the legislation being contemplated by Deputy Brennan related to the capping of awards for pain and suffering.  With the exception of a good deal of anecdotal evidence, there is no reliable economic authoritative study that shows that within the matrix of costs, the capping of awards for pain and suffering.  With indisputably lead to the reduction of premiums.  That is the purpose of the study I have undertaken because I do not wish to follow Deputy Brennan by making promises to the consumer, such as to abolish juries, which at the end of the road make no impact.  We have to be as certain as we can be that the measures we propose will lead to a reduction in insurance premiums.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the abolition of the two <Col N="1472" /> counsel system ended up being more expensive because the one senior doubled his costs and as the junior got two-thirds of the costs we end up paying more legal fees?  Second, who will be involved in the review?  Third, have they been given a specific time frame in which to report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid it is apparently the case that whatever about increasing the costs, the abolition of the two counsel system had no measurable impact.  Legal fees are as expensive now as they were before this question was addressed.  That is pretty difficult for the rest of us to understand because we live in a world of productivity deals and greater output and it is a bit puzzling that with one senior counsel the cost remains the same.  Presumably that must be something peculiar to the way the Law Library operates and is not quite in line with the efficiency drive of some Members in this House.  On who will comprise the group, a professional consultancy study will be put out to tender and I hope it will be completed speedily but in any event not later than in six months time.</P>

As regards the announcement by the then Minister, Deputy Brennan, I would have thought Deputy O'Rourke, working closely with him in the Department, would be in a better position to elicit that information.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the study the Minister has in mind encompass public and employers' liability in addition to motor insurance?  There is sufficient statistical evidence in the Department to indicate the problem areas in insurance.  A number of small businesses in my constituency found that their premiums rose by well over 50 per cent because of their public liability claims.  In some instances, small businesses are unable to keep going and pay public liability premiums.  Difficulties in the motor insurance, public and employers' liability areas are underestimated. The Minister has considerable information available in his Department and I hope this study will be completed in a shorter time than the six months which he mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the situation is extremely serious.  It is a significant and disproportionate cost to business &mdash; 3 per cent of GDP goes towards the cost of insurance.  Employers' liabiltiy is a significant concern for industry. IBEC was assertive in its submission about how urgent a matter it is for its <Col N="1474" /> members.  It is fair to point out that perhaps less attention is given to safety in the workplace.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>There is much information on this in the Department and surveys show that the incidence of preventable accidents in the workplace is far higher here.  I am amenable to the argument by IBEC on the question of capping but I would like them to attach the same priority to improving safety in the workplace.  I agree with Deputy Kirk that we live in an excessively litigious culture and that is part of the problem.  As I said earlier, you may be prepared to accept that when one person stumbles into a manhole there is cause for compensation but when a number of members of the same family stumble into the same manhole you reach the inescapable conclusion that there are questions to be answered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying there is no comprehensive study available from his officials which satisfies him as to the need to continue with the legislation?  I put it to him that there is such a study.  Will he ask the consultants to examine the cap as a separate measure?  There is a fine study embracing the last five years of awards and High Court actions which was painfully studied by his officials going back over six months.  I know senior officials who spent months on end studying the matter. I am disappointed that is not enough for the Minister to act on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said some work has been done but what satisfies me is a matter for my judgment. I have not received the assurances I require from the industry that premiums and costs will be reduced if we legislate in a certain direction.  We must elicit such assurances from the industry and they must play their part.  The specific matter of caps for pain and suffering is <Col N="1475" /> expressly included in the terms of reference which I circulated to a number of interested parties.  I gave them seven days to reply and indicate if the terms of reference were defecitve or if they wished to add anything to them.  Capping for pain and suffering is expressly provided for and the consultants will be required to compute the impact of capping in that component of a matrix of components.  As Deputy Brennan knows, pain and suffering is not the only elememnt which drives up insurance costs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the link with health and safety at work. What moneys have been provided for the health and safety authority to provide the additional necessary inspectors and other staff?  How many posts will be created?  It is obvious that workers' lives will be at risk unless the matter is dealt with.  There are not sufficient inspectors to carry out the required inspections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>Safety in the workplace is a factor, especially in employers' liability. The question posed by the Deputy is more appropriate to my collegue, Deputy Fitzgerald, who has responsibility for the health and safety authority. I am assured that this year, six additional staff have been recruited and I know the Minister of State has the matter under review.  No matter how many people are employed by the Health and Safety Authority, it is the disposition of employers that is crucial. Indeed IBEC went out of its way to draw my attention to the fact that its advisory programme in this area is yielding results.  There is a good deal of evidence to demonstrate that that is true but we have a very long way to go and it will require more than simply the provision of resources for the Health and Safety Authority to elicit the correct response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any liaison between the Minister's Department and the <Col N="1476" /> insurance industry in regard to fraudulent claims?  Can any steps be taken to deal with that problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I have raised this matter with the industry and individual insurance companies.  The problem is that an individual insurer frequently finds it cheaper to concede an award on the steps of the courthouse than run the risk of the case going to trial inasmuch if the insurer ends up liable for the legal costs of both sides in all probability they will exceed the amount of the offered settlement.  Therefore, in small claims &mdash; which constitute a major area of abuse, I regret to say &mdash; there is a tendency on behalf of insurance companies to settle because it is cheaper.  Deputy Kirk raised an interesting point.  I am aware that some employers take the view that they will decide, not the insurer, and will prosecute those cases no matter what the outcome.  That has shown an incidence of diminution because, in regard to public liability, the same issue arises.  It is something that may be teased out further and on which I shall be interested to hear the views of the Incorporated Law Society and the Law Library representatives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>Most other EU member states already have significantly higher standards of social protection than those currently obtaining in Ireland or those which will be put in place as a result of the transposition of recent EU social legislation into Irish law.  For example, in Germany, Europe's strongest economy, there are significantly higher standards of social protection than those required under EU social policy.  In <Col N="1477" /> many EU member states, there are stronger standards prevailing in the area of employment rights and the health and safety of workers which arise from policies adopted at national level rather than those resulting from EU membership. I, therefore, believe that concerns about competitive disadvantage arising for Irish businesses within the Community or in a wider global context resulting from the implementation of EU social legislation have been unnecesarily magnified.</P>
      <P>The effect of the United Kingdom opt-out from the Social Chapter is more optical than real.  In fact there is only one directive, the Works Council Directive which has been adopted to date without the participation of Britain. Indeed, Britain is implementing the Works Council Directive in many areas on a voluntary basis.  We should not allow ourselves fall into the trap of believing that the United Kingdom has gained a significant competitive advantage by virtue of that opt-out; that would not accord with the facts.</P>
      <P>Indeed, Ireland's high level of investment in training and education, and our tradition of social partnership, places us in a good position to offer the kind of flexibility to meet the challenge of change.  I will shortly be announcing the setting up of a new unit in my Department, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, to better equip Irish business to meet the challenge of change through developing new forms of working, and new ways, in partnership, to meet the standards required by total quality management and world class manufacturing.</P>
      <P>To achieve the changes we need to make to compete in a changing and competitive world will require a new spirit of co-operation between workers and employers, the sharing of information, and the realisation that business is a shared enterprise involving the fullest commitment of both management and workers.  That commitment on the part of workers is best earned in an environment where basic employment rights are protected and respected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1478" /> Employers should not fear the social policy changes proposed, instead they should seek to avail of the opportunities they present in the form of a stable, well trained, highly motivated labour force. We have an increasingly flexible and adaptable workforce which compares very favourably with those in other similar European countries, including the United Kingdom.  Both employers and workers should seek to utilise this flexibility and, where possible, co-operate at enterprise level as regards the introduction of new work practices with a view to enhancing industrial competitiveness and creating additional jobs.</P>
    <P>European social policy has proved of enormous positive benefit for Ireland. Social policy is not just about labour legislation.  It is also about employment creation.  I must point out that Ireland continues to gain considerably from EU membership in terms of funding.  The European Social Fund, for example, is expected to provide 1,953 million ECU, or some IR£1,562 million, to Ireland over the six years 1994 to 1999 for our human resource development programmes. If we are happy to take the money we should also be happy to take the social legislation.</P>
    <P>In the Government's view, a meaningful social policy, which contributes to raising standards of living, income and education is essential in order to achieve a healthy and competitive economy and is an accepted fundamental in our society.  The harmonisation of European social policies is a corollary of the opening of borders and the breaking down of barriers to trade, which should be so beneficial to a country like Ireland which exports 70 per cent of what it produces.</P>
    <P>The consensus on economic and social policy issues which we have here could not have been achieved without the existence of basic social standards. This consensus approach has allowed us to put in place a well balanced body of labour legislation which, together with measures designed to stimulate employment, provides an appropriate framework for the purpose of achieving an <Col N="1479" /> efficient and competitive business environment. It is not the Government's intention to undermine that consensus and create a conflict between workers' rights on the one hand and industrial competitiveness and jobs on the other when it comes to participation in the framing of social legislation at European level or its subsequent transposition into Irish law.</P>
    <P>The position of successive Irish Governments in this area, as signatories of the Social Charter and in line with Ireland's position on economic and social cohesion, has been to support the development of the social dimension of the internal market.  However, successive Irish Governments have also sought to ensure that specific legislative initiatives do not impact disproportionately in Ireland, do not constitute an unnecessary burden on business and do not endanger the competitive position of Irish industry or jeopardise the maintenance and creation of employment in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I believe that both the degree of the changes we have to make to apply EU social standards, and their impact have been greatly exaggerated.  In most cases, these minimum social standards are the standards already being applied by good employers.</P>
    <P>The Government is very much aware of the global competitive pressures to which Irish industry and business are increasingly exposed and, consequently, is seeking to ensure that developments in EU social policy are fully evaluated in the context of the national economic priorities of job creation and maintenance. In this regard, I should point out that, in dealing with our obligations to implement existing EU social legislation and in negotiations regarding new EU social policy initiatives, my Department always seeks to adopt a very flexible approach and to consult as widely as possible with the social partners and other relevant interests so as to minimise any undue impact of EU proposals on Irish industry.</P>

      <P>While agreeing with what the Minister said about our laws incorporating European legislation and the benefits to be derived from that, small businesses contend that so much is coming on stream that they cannot keep up to date, it is too costly and, in that way, would have an impact on employment.  Rather they request that we consolidate, simplify and implement such legislation.  I referred earlier to the matter of health and safety which comes within the Minister's remit and is a very good example of provisions we are required to implement in the interest of workers.  I suggest that the Minister of State deal with some of these practicalities, that we implement such legislation as we are required to for workers with health and safety being particularly pertinent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms. E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Kitt knows, I am a very practical woman.  I am sorry if he feels that a comprehensive reply to what was a very fair question was unduly long but, had I given a skimpy reply, that would have been unfair to him.  These are important issues on which it is important that we place our views on record, in particular, our views on a very damaging campaign being run by Britain arguing the point that they are more competitive or flexible because they have an opt-out, which is more optical than real.  It would be my hope that Irish business would not travel the road of buying the British propaganda on that issue.  I do not accept that the requirements of European Union social policy are too costly for small businesses.  We can not have a <Col N="1481" /> two tier workforce in that those who work for smaller companies would have fewer employment rights than those who work for large companies.  People in business today must realise that their most important asset is human resources, the calibre and the commitment of the people working for them. Employers in small companies do not earn that commitment by treating their workers as second class citizens.  Any small company interested in developing will demand a commitment from its workforce and will study its quality.  Its employers will secure a good quality workforce and commitment if it treats its workers with respect and gives them the same employment rights as people working for larger businesses.  Otherwise small companies will lose their best workers who will obtain work elsewhere.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kitt about the need to simplify matters and that is a task on which I have embarked.  We need to simplify paper work and the language used.  I commend IBEC for organising a series of information conferences with small businesses on the area of employment regulations, EU social policy and producing a booklet which, while it may contain strong views in terms of its perspective on EU social policy with which I do not agree, has the merit of explaining simply the effects of such a policy.</P>
      <P>One of the first tasks I undertook in my first month as Minister with responsibility for Labour Affairs was to reform the Employment Appeals Tribunal and give it a clear mandate about ensuring consistency in decisions.  The chairperson of the Employment Appeal Tribunal is employed virtually on a full-time basis and the number of chairpersons has been reduced to ensure consistency in decisions.  We are ensuring that training is provided for those employed in the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>

      <P>I have built on the good work in this area undertaken by my predecessor, Deputy O'Rourke.  It is important to have an adjudication system for employment rights in which employers and employees can have trust.  If people believe adjudication is simple, fair, prompt and efficient, they will not have any difficulties with employment rights legislation, which is what good employers are implementing.</P>
      <P>The area of health and safety is important.  The fire in Government Buildings today makes us realise it is important to be alert to the hazards in the workplace.  I had some difficulty in having the reply to Deputy Kitt's question printed, I could not get access to my computer in Government Buildings because of the fire.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am paying a great deal of attention to the area of health and safety.  The Health and Safety Authority has prioritised its programme for the coming year based on where it can best use its resources to reduce the toll of death and injury at work and I know we will have the co-operation of employers in this area.  At the beginning of the week the farm organisations were involved in this area because the largest toll of death is on farms where 24 people died in farm accidents last year. I am anxious to ensure we move ahead in that area.  Small businesses will find that if they draw up a health and safety statement and study the practices and procedures in their workplaces, they will learn not only how to run a safer workplace and, I hope, reduce their <Col N="1483" /> insurance premia, but also how to reorganise their work more efficiently.  A study of the organisation of work practices will reveal how work can be made more efficient and I do not consider such a study an undue burden.  At a joint conference of the Health and Safety Authority in the South and the Health and Safety Executive in the North held last week in Dublin Castle the point was made that health and safety concerns result in profit and that message should go out to large and small businesses.</P>

Will she not accept the reasonable approach of the recommendation to the Government of the task force report on small companies that while firms are below a certain level there should be a threshold to allow them to ease into implementing such legislation?  Is the Minister's message to the 160,000 small firms, &ldquo;tough luck, you will have to put up with it and if you are not big you cannot make it&rdquo;?

      <P>There is no need for that comment, it was uncalled for.  I <Col N="1485" /> agree with the Minister that it is an outrageous decision by the Conservative Tory Party of the British Government to have opted out of the Social Charter. Given that we face much competition, particularly from Scotland, in attracting overseas foreign companies, has the Government quantified the competitive advantage, if any, that Scotland might have as a result of the British Government's decision to opt out of the Social Charter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EithneFitzgerald" hpid="Ms E. Fitzgerald Ms E. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms E. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The only effect to date of the British Government opting out of the Social Charter is that Britain has not been a party to the EU Directive on works councils which involve companies which straddle EU boundaries, have more than 1,000 employees and a minimum number of employees in a particular jurisdiction sharing information with their workers.  In Britain many of the larger companies are becoming involved in works councils on a voluntary basis.  Irish companies who employ fewer than 1,000 workers are by far the largest group of companies.  If employers share information with their workers and bring them along with them in good times, they are better positioned to bring them along in bad times. We need to learn lessons from industrial disputes like Packard that if employers win the confidence of their workforce, they are in a better position to deliver on change.  However, if employers do not win the confidence, trust and support of workers and do not share information in good times, is it any wonder that there is difficulty in employers having credibility when they seek to implement a programme of change at a time of difficulties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the Scottish position, the directive on works councils is the only issue relating to the British Government's decision to opt out of the Social Charter and it does not make any difference in terms of our competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> Scotland.  Our competitiveness is enhanced by the fact that we have negotiated national wage agreements which set a reasonable level of wage <Col N="1486" /> increases.  We are investing heavily in the area of education and training, we have a highly educated and highly skilled workforce and that is the basis on which we offer genuine flexibility, not on the basis of notional opt outs from EU social policy.  Britain, in possibly a dishonest way, has been marketing its opt out to give the impression that it has a more flexible workforce. Genuine flexibility and ability to adapt to change is based on a level of skills, education and a commitment of the workforce to the enterprise in which they work.  Those objectives must be worked towards and achieved by management and they are earned through treating workers with respect.  I cannot accept that Scotland has any competitive advantage arising from the result of the British decision to opt out of the Social Charter and I would not like any of us to fall into the propaganda trap being set by some British bodies who are trying to attract company investment. We are a competitive destination for any company and a competitive country in which to do business.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that for many Irish companies, particularly smaller companies, a combination of EU regulations, domestic requirements, lack of incentives from a tax point of view makes the decision to employ another person so marginal that it is not worth while?  Will the Minister accept that many of the EU regulations are not practical, that they are bureaucratic? For example, an employer who was in touch with me recently, said that by virtue of knocking down a wall between two small rooms they are required under EU regulations to provide a sick room.  I regard that as sick. The regulations are bureaucratic.  They are not drawn up by people who create jobs.  We have to distinguish between workers' rights on the one hand and regulations which are impractical and lead to a disincentive and to frustration on the part of many employers who see no reason for them.</P>

There are very few organisations, and those are mostly in the semi-State area, which would employ more than 1,000 people. Most of these companies offer conditions of employment which meet and often exceed those required by EU directives.  The EU directives are drawn up in a consultative process with the <Col N="1489" /> employers federation at European level, with the trade union federation at European level and are agreed by the European Governments at the Council of Ministers.  Deputy Mary O'Rourke, who represented Ireland at the Council of Ministers, was a party to agreeing many of these regulations which are drawn up with a view to enhancing the degree of social protection and maintaining Europe's competitiveness in the wider world.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason for moving the Patents Office rather than the Companies Office was essentially the high level of public contact with the Companies Office &mdash; about 200 per day or about ten times as many as the Patents Office handle.  Consequently it was easier to move the Patents Office and ensure the minimum disruption.  Despite the move to higher technology, virtually all contacts with the Companies Office are by hand rather than by post or any other method.  The business of the Companies Office is predominantly centred in Dublin.  We are working on issues relating to any additional costs that may arise.  We do not envisage huge costs at this stage but it is part of an assessment of the move.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am committed to the principle of decentralisation.  The Environmental Protection Agency, with which I was involved, is located in Wexford. The purpose of moving offices from Dublin to other areas is to increase activity in those other areas.  The Minister seems to have adopted the reverse approach.  Because the activity is minimal with the Patents Office it is moved to Kilkenny and the office with all the activity remains in Dublin.  This appears to be the reverse of the principle we have considered in relation to such decisions.  How many staff are employed in the Patents Office?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of staff intended to be moved is approximately 80.  In addition there are some professional and technical staff who may also move but that has to be finally decided.  Our intention is to move the entire office.  An important consideration in the move was that 90 per cent of the business in the Companies Office was Dublin based and many of their customers would be unlikely to move to Kilkenny.  The other more compact office would have a better chance of some additional activity because there would be scope to move the specialised patent and trade mark firms to operate at a Kilkenny base.  This is consistent <Col N="1492" /> with our policy, with which the Deputy agrees.  One has to be practical when dealing with these matters.  One cannot impose very heavy costs on those who seek to use the Companies Office, even though one might regard it as desirable to decentralise it.</P>

      <P>I agree that we have to be very conscious of the employment needs of Dublin but we need to adopt a balanced approach.  One of the major areas where Dublin has lost out is in industrial employment, not in public service employment.  I will seek the balanced development of the industrial base in Dublin and other areas.  There has been a 20 per cent decline in manufacturing employment in Dublin during the past 12 or 13 years, and this will be the focus of my attention.  A decentralisation policy in respect of what was once a very highly centralised public service in Dublin is sensible.

      <P>I take a totally opposite view to the one expressed by Deputy Byrne.  Will the Minister agree that workers should be able to get employment in their own areas?  The purpose of the decentralisation programme is to give rural workers an opportunity to work in their areas.  Is the Minister aware that a decision was made many years ago to decentralise an office to Kilkenny, which is probably the only city which does not have a decentralised office?  Will he say when the 18 months timeframe envisaged for the opening of the office in Kilkenny will commence? The decentralisation of this office and the finance section of the Office of Public Works will bring approximately 250 jobs to Kilkenny.</P>

      <P>I did not know that Kilkenny was the only city which did not have a decentralised Government office.  The purpose of the decentralisation programme is to ensure a balanced spread of public service offices and to give people an opportunity to work in their areas.  While there has been considerable delay in opening the office in Kilkenny, I can assure the Deputy that there is no intention to delay it further.  I am committed to giving the relevant accommodation brief to the Office of Public Works within six weeks at the latest and construction of the building will commence as soon as possible.  There will be no unnecessary delays.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Enterprise and Employment if he will intervene even at this late stage to ensure that the Silverlea factories in Athlone and Athy are not closed and if he will use some of the £22 million announced yesterday to secure these jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1494" />
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought this matter was to be raised on the Adjourment and, therefore, I have not had an opportunity to do some of the preparatory work I would like to have done.</P>
      <P>The proposed phased closure of Silverlea is a great disappointment to me and to all those who have made trojan efforts over the part four weeks to find a suitable purchaser.  I very much regret the loss of the 220 jobs in Athlone and Athy.  My powers do not stretch as far as the Deputy thinks in that I cannot control the role of the receiver.  During my reply to an Adjournment debate on 7 February last I outlined the reasons a receiver had been appointed to Silverlea. I wish to outline details of the efforts which have been made to help secure the future of the Silverlea operation.</P>
      <P>Following a series of discussions with interested parties, the receiver agreed to allow the Silverlea operation to continue manufacturing for a further four weeks.  The purpose of this extension was to allow the IDA and Forbairt time to find a prospective investor for Silverlea. I and my Department have been actively involved in efforts to save the Silverlea operation which have included regular contacts with the IDA, Forbairt and the receiver.  I have been active on a daily basis in monitoring progress and arranging meetings to deal with issues as they arise.  The Deputy is aware of this, and I had the opportunity to outline the position in the course of a number of meetings which I had with public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the four week extension the IDA and Forbairt have continued to work very closely with the receiver to sell the company as a going concern. However, despite their intensive efforts they have been unable to find a buyer. The many parties who expressed an interest and made detailed inquiries did not follow them further.  These efforts will be continued and even after the closure the receiver will be in a position to entertain any buyers who may come forward within the next two weeks.  At this stage I have to be very blunt &mdash; if <Col N="1495" /> nobody wants to buy the plant as a going concern there is nothing I or anyone else can do.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the possibility of an employee buy-out is under consideration. The feasibility study which has been completed and which identified the key issues to be addressed is the beginning of the process.  This is to be followed by the preparation of a detailed proposal and plan of action covering such issues as finance, management structures, nature of employee involvement etc.  Both FÁS and Forbairt will continue to provide every assistance possible to the employee buy-out team but in the final analysis the terms of the proposal are a matter for agreement and decision by the employees.</P>
    <P>The receiver has been asked to give a further extension to enable the employee buy-out proposal to be progressed.  I have spoken to the receiver on the matter but given the circumstances I have just outlined and his statutory obligations he was not disposed to keeping the plant in production for a further period.  Again I have to be blunt; if the receiver takes this decision there is nothing I or anybody else can do. However, I would stress that the closure of the plants will not prevent the workers from continuing to pursue the employee buy-out proposal.  For an employee buy-out proposal to succeed, they would have to make a fresh start and could not take over the existing company as a going concern.</P>
    <P>The receiver has also pointed out that the assets will be <i>in situ</i> for some time and a closure now does not rule out the possibility of an employee buy-out going ahead if it is seen as a viable proposition. I am disappointed at the fate facing the employees in Athlone and Athy and no stone will be left unturned in finding replacement industries for the two towns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true to say that nobody is interested in the firm.  A feasible employee purchase proposal <Col N="1496" /> has been put forward.  The workers have been very committed and courageous in putting their money where their mouths are by putting forward this proposal.  It is not correct to say that this proposal will have as good a chance to find its mark if the firm closes.  It would have a much better chance of being implemented if the firm remained open. It is mere common sense that a firm in production has a better chance of remaining in production and, more importantly, of keeping its valued customers than one which is closed.  Silverlea has some very valued and well known customers, such as Dunnes Stores and Next.  Dunnes Stores have been very supportive of Silverlea and its workers and I wish to express my appreciation to them.</P>
      <P>Soft words will not help.  Last night in a very incongruous and insensitive manner the Minister announced the allocation of £22 million to help industries, such as textiles, facing interim difficulties. I cited earlier the impassioned request I received from a worker in Sunbeam who wanted to know if she could have a little of that £22 million to keep her job.  Can Silverlea in Athlone and Athy, with its 220 workers, get a slice of the £22 million being provided for rainbow jobs to keep real jobs in place?  The Athlone firm is an excellent one with no adversarial tactics between management and workers and its order books are full, but it has interim cash difficulties.  The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, worked day and night to save the jobs in Packard.  Many public representatives have worked day and night to save the jobs in Athlone and Athy, and we want real backing, not soft words.  We want ministerial intervention and a cash injection to save the jobs in question.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, announced hundreds of jobs for the future but the jobs in Silverlea are tangible.  I appeal to the Minister to save those 220 jobs.  We can do it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy must be aware of the position.  The viability plan emanating from the employee buy-out <Col N="1497" /> proposal has not reached a stage where Forbairt would be in a position to provide a full package of support for the firm, but if that option develops to a viable stage, it could be supported.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated that Forbairt stands ready to support the option if necessary.  As a going concern the company carries debts of enormous proportions, which the receiver is legally responsible to collect. It is up to the receiver, not the Minister, to decide what to do about the execution of the receivership.  It is not open to me to provide money to keep in operation a loss-making company which is in receivership.  That is not within my remit.  I do not, on behalf of the taxpayer, put money into receiverships to keep companies operational. My job is to create an environment in which companies can flourish, but that does not mean I can support companies with huge losses or that have gone into receivership.  However, I stand ready to support an employee buy-out if the proposal is viable.</P>
      <P>While the firm has many orders on its books, the Deputy will be aware that part of the financial difficulty resulted from a loss of orders.  The sudden deterioration in Silverlea's fortunes in the middle of last year was due to a loss of business and substantial associated financial losses.  The Deputy is painting a misleading picture of the position.</P>

      <P>The company has suffered severe losses and incurred serious debts and it is in receivership.  The Deputy should recognise the limitations on a Minister, but she is unwilling to do so.  I cannot support every company that gets into difficulties.  I can provide support for a viable plan to create an alternative. We sought purchasers to provide that viability for Silverlea.  The agencies <Col N="1498" /> under my control went to enormous lengths to find a purchaser for the company but were not successful.  I cannot make water run up a hill.</P>

      <P>The buy-out proposal has been put forward by a well known firm, Farrell Grant Sparks which has connections with one of the parties in Government.  It has produced an authorative and well based plan, not one merely written off the top of somebody's head.  Two to three weeks are required to ascertain if it can be implemented.  I fail to understand how the closure of the firm will allow the plan to be assessed and put into action. There are many firms in the jeans market already waiting in the wings &mdash; who can blame them?  &mdash; with offers to supply jeans to the reputable firms who have been consistent buyers of Silverlea jeans in Athlone and Athy.</P>
      <P>Is it any wonder I am outspoken on this matter when one considers that I come from a town which has managed to weather most of the economic difficulties which have beset other industries and other towns?  I feel very affronted that this fine firm is being let go.  That is what will happen if more time is not given to the workers, who are proposing to put in their money to keep the firm operational.  I am not satisfied that every avenue has been teased out and every ounce of effort made by the Minister in an emphatic manner to keep the firm operational.</P>
      <P>I will make a final appeal to the Minister, and not one from a wild impassioned stance.  As a representative from Athlone, I do not want 170 jobs lost when at the same time I read about £22 million being given to prop up firms and enable them cope with transitional difficulties.</P>

It will be made available for preventive measures to foresee difficulties that companies may face in the future and provided only when a company presents a sensible proposal for the repositioning of the design and marketing of its product to shore up the company against competitive challenge.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputy's disappointment in this regard because I have taken a keen interest in the matter.  I spoke to the receiver about a extension of time, but he is not willing to make that time available and that is not something I can alter.</P>
      <P>I am quite happy to provide any possible support to the employee buy-out and the receiver has indicated that the plant will be available for some time. Also, part of the employee buy-out is considering whether this is the most appropriate location or if alternative locations would be better.  We will work with the employee buy-out and if sensible and viable proposals emerge the State agencies will not be found wanting. The Deputy cannot ask me to do things which she knows in her heart of hearts are not open to me, to put money into companies in receivership to keep them limping along.</P>

      <P>It is too early to say whether the feasibility study will ultimately materialise into a viable proposal. However, the support of both FÁS and Forbairt will be available to assist in transforming the early structure into a solid proposal.  The Deputy asked if taking over the company as a going concern was an option.  The reality is that the company is in receivership and has substantial debts which the receiver is under a legal obligation to deliver upon to the creditors.  That means that anybody taking the company on as a going concern would, in the first instance, have to provide finance to the receiver of such dimensions as to satisfy the claims of the creditors.  That is not something that an employee buy-out would be in a position to do.  The best future for the employee buy-out will be in the alternative of using the resources for some time and, perhaps, looking at other suitable locations for an ongoing concern.  It would be premature at this stage to identify those.  The employee buy-out must first be brought to a stage where they can make a decision on whether it is a visable proposal that would secure their future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. G. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to come to grips with the term &ldquo;local development&rdquo;.  Deputy Harney made the point that all employment issues should be dealt with by the one Department.  Local development is co-ordination and is rightly located in the Department of the Taoiseach which is where co-ordination properly takes place given that the civil servants in this <Col N="1571" /> Department chair many interdepartmental committees.  Local development is a means of creating local employment but it also has greater implications.</P>
      <P>I will announce 35 disadvantaged areas throughout the country.  They have been scientifically chosen based on data compiled by bodies such as the Combat Poverty Agency.  In each area there are problems associated with long term unemployment and social structure problems.  In each area a partnership company will be established comprising the social partners &mdash; businesses and trade unions &mdash; the local community and State agencies.  It will have a local office and manager.  It will consult widely with the community to determine its needs under a number of headings and produce a plan which will be submitted to an umbrella a company called Area Development Management Limited, ADM.  Each company could receive, on average, up to £400,000 per year for up to five years.  This figure was arrived at by dividing the amount available by the number of areas designated. An area as big as Donegal could expect to receive more than could a small segment of the city if it submits a plan to justify this.  I am giving an indication of the magnitude of the assistance available.</P>
      <P>In addition each company will be able to avail of the services of mentors, professional and business advice, advice from State agencies, information and advice on how to plug into mainstream services and to identify vulnerable school-leavers who become the long term unemployed.  The Department of Education will also allocate an education co-ordinator to each area who will consult with the partnership company and produce a menu of items covering such matters as teaching people computer and other skills. Assistance will be provided for preschool facilities and in certain categories more generous community employment training will be provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community integration is not just a matter of employment, it is a matter of <Col N="1572" /> tackling poverty and disadvantage in the poorest areas.  It is also about empowering local communities aware of their own needs to tackle their problems. Local development is targeted and integrated and there are 12 pilot partnership area schemes from which we can learn.  If it works according to plan, which I think it will, it will be one of the most successful schemes ever introduced here.</P>
    <P>One of Fianna Fáil's newest recruits, a former IDA chief executive, said on radio recently that his partnership company has placed 600 people who were long term unemployed in employment in north Dublin during the past 12 months.  It is to be commended for this. I am not interested in the political hue of those involved; the only question I ask is whether they can be effective and I look for a positive answer in each case. Similarly in Tallaght a significant number of people who were long term unemployed have been placed in employment during the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>This is not about making announcements; rather it is about informing the local community in disadvantaged areas of the opportunities available, giving them the tools with which to do the job, real power and, in turn, asking them to take responsibility.  In giving them a budget, a manager, an office, back-up advice, assistance and encouragement the approach is to find out why young people are leaving school and what can be done to prevent it.  Each community will have a different answer.  That is the reason a menu will be supplied by the Department of Education from which local partnership companies will be able to choose the best solution for their areas.</P>
    <P>The interim report of the task force on long term unemployment proposed the establishment of an all-in-one combined service for the long term unemployed. This service which is currently operated in 12 pilot partnership areas offers guidance, counselling, career path direction, education and employment placing, the net intended effect being to break the cycle of self-perpetuating <Col N="1573" /> long term unemployment.  The operational programme for local urban and rural development is expanding the number of partnership areas from 12 to 35.  These areas, which meet certain disadvantage criteria, will now be supported in the creation of small local enterprise; the establishment of projects to enhance the local environment.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the link between poverty, unemployment and early school leaving, innovative measures will be taken to reduce the incidence in disadvantaged areas of school drop-out at a young age.  In one part of Dublin 35 per cent of all those who leave school do so at the age of 15 or younger.  In one of the areas covered by this scheme in Dublin the unemployment rate is 45 per cent; it is as high as 70 per cent to 80 per cent in parts of this area.</P>
    <P>Community employment which is intended to act as a bridge between long term unemployment and eventual reentry into the labour market may be extended from one to three years for certain participants, mainly those over the age of 45.  All these measures are dependent on and should ensure the participation of local communities in the forging of their own future.  Up to £10 million will be provided to identify early school-leavers and assist pre-school centres in disadvantaged areas together with a programme to help vulnerable early school-leavers who usually become the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Thirty-five companies will be created locally, made up of the social partners, State agencies and the local community, with a budget of £89 million over the five year period.  The objective will be to enhance the local environment so as to attract enterprise to areas of greatest need.  We are empowering local communities to have a real and substantial say in creating job opportunities.  The programme will facilitate training in local authority estate management as the environment in which we live has a direct relationship to education and employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1574" /> I have long believed that there are two primary ways of creating an opportunity for equality in society, access to third level education and to decent housing.  Even if people have access to third level education, how can we expect them to study in some of the local authority flat complexes in this city and in some local authority estates around the country as the environment in such housing is completely wrong? Not only is access to third level education and, in many cases, second level education completely cut off to those people, but the environment in which they live marks them out as people who have a hill to climb.  There is a direct relationship between education, environment and employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The programme will provide a framework agreement between each partnership company and FÁS, within the partnership area locally.  Plans will be agreed between the company and FÁS to ensure that the FÁS schemes are those needed in that area in terms of their priorities.</P>
    <P>It is easy to denigrate and be critical but it is not so easy to be hard working, to research and to ascertain the facts. Many people in the House who advocate certain economic policies from time to time do not live in the real world of the unemployed or the unemployable person living in a local authority flat in inner city Dublin or in many of our rural areas.  This local development plan will give hope to local communities and provide them with the tools to do the job. It will also cut through the patronising nonsense which has emanated from State agencies for years by acknowledging that local communities know best and must do the job.  However, local communities cannot continue to ask what the State will do for them.  The people to whom we give this type of responsibility must shape the future of their own communities.  If they do that, I have no doubt that the target which I set of creating 8,000 jobs through local partnerships over the next five years will <Col N="1575" /> be realisable.  If the Northside partnership is anything to go by, that target certainly can be achieved in those 35 partnership companies.  The £89 million will considerably help that process but, equally important, is co-operation between the communities, the State agencies and the business, trade union and farming organisations involved with these companies.</P>
    <P>As a former Lord Mayor of Dublin and a member of Dublin Corporation's Housing Committee for 16 years until I resigned on my appointment as Minister of State, I am not satisfied with Dublin Corporation's record in regard to estate management.  That probably applies to other local authorities also but I can only speak about the one with which I am most familiar.  This is an important point in any debate on employment in our community.  If people do not have the right environment in which to study and evaluate their own worth, they are starting out in life not just with a bad address but with a millstone around their necks.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to simply spend money on refurbishing local authority flat complexes.  In Fatima Mansions, in my constituency, approximately £10,000 per unit was spent on refurbishment. That is a substantial amount of money which obviously incorporated work on the exterior of the flats and the gardens. However, having refurbished the flats Dublin Corporation did not put in place any type of proper estate management, by that I mean management which involves the tenants and requires them to take some of the responsibility for the maintenance of their estates.</P>
    <P>Some of these flat complexes contribute to bringing down these areas.  Businesses will not locate in a community that looks derelict or which has dark, dank stairwells on which people shoot up drugs.  They do not want to be associated with those areas.  If we are serious about tackling unemployment in our blackspot communities, we must be serious also about removing decay and dereliction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> In one flat complex in my constituency &mdash; not the one to which I have just referred &mdash; 2,000 people are living almost on top of each other in a series of tower blocks.  That is equivalent to a fairly large village in any part of rural Ireland and yet, there has not been any attempt to encourage proper estate management or a system whereby there is control over who enters those flat complexes; anybody who wants to enter them to ply their illegal trades can do so.  I believe estate management is central to preventing urban decay which takes from the possibility of attracting industry to local areas.</P>
    <P>Under the programme local communities will be provided with a budget and a local office.  Communities will be consulted on their plans which will be evaluated.  Early school leavers will be identified and the pre-school situation will be examined.  A menu of educational opportunities will be identified and consultations will take place with the local communities on a framework document for training through FÁS. These measures are an important part of an integrated plan to tackle disadvantaged and unemployment in those areas of our community which have suffered greatly for far too long.</P>
    <P>I ask the support of all the Members for this programme of urban and rural development which goes beyond the simple remit of employment.  The provision of employment and helping the long term unemployed is the objective but that must be done through an integrated programme.  I hope that all Deputies who are invited to attend local launches around the country will do so because it is important to encourage and give leadership locally to the community to participate in this important programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the most important debates we have had in this House for some time.  Unfortunately, it is not well attended but I have no doubt that other Members intend to contribute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1577" /> I welcome the Minister's comments and I am very much aware of his personal experience gained as a member of Dublin Corporation and as Lord Mayor of Dublin.  I particularly welcome the fact that in this debate rural and local TDs are of one mind in relation to the need for local initiatives.  I come from the west and I have always supported rural initiatives, particularly relating to the west for which the arguments are very strong.  For too long this House neglected the needs of urban areas, particularly Dublin, and I am glad that position is changing.  In many regards rural areas have advantages in that local parishes have a sense of community and neighbourly support which very much fits into this approach of bottom-up development and community participation. Sadly, that does not exist in many parts of Dublin and that is why we need intervention by agencies from the Government down.</P>
    <P>I agree with the point made by many of my colleagues that there is a complexity of agencies and a number of Minister agencies dealing with this matter. That issue needs to be addressed. We heard a very fine speech from the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, who has responsibility for local initiatives. The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, and the two Ministers of State at that Department, are also involved.  Demarcation lines and responsibilities in this area should be clarified.  Sometimes we hear reports of competition between Ministers, but I do not know whether they are true.  Those involved in community initiatives at various levels &mdash; many excellent groups and organisations are involved &mdash; should be told who is responsible and who will support them in their efforts.</P>
    <P>Since this is the first of two reports, the Local Employment Service will not operate to its full potential until the comprehensive package of recommendations by the National Economic and Social Forum is fully implemented by the Government.  The establishment of the Local Employment Service was the central recommendation of the forum's <Col N="1578" /> report published in June of last year. Like other Deputies, I pay special tribute to the chairperson of the NESF, Ms Maureen Gaffney, for her commitment, energy, leadership and dedication, all of which she demonstrated in endeavouring to tackle the greatest challenge of our time, long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>The forum has clearly set an agenda for the future.  A new, realistic approach is being taken to this matter and a fundamental reassessment of policies in this area is taking place.  We have had many excellent reports, documents and analyses and I think everyone would agree it is time for action.  The problem is serious and needs our attention.  Structures must be put in place immediately. This can be done relatively swiftly in the 12 partnership areas.  I suggest that the Minister make the necessary arrangements immediately for the non-partnership areas.  He must ensure they get off the ground without delay so that they can provide the necessary services in the most needy areas.</P>
    <P>The forum report emphasises that the Local Employment Service should make available education, training and employment experience options, as appropriate, to its clients.  It also stresses that the purchase and delivery of programmes must be eventually separated. That recommendation is worthy of support. It is not desirable that the purchase and delivery of a service be in the hands of the same agency.</P>
    <P>The Government task force will concentrate on the forum's recommendations on employment options for the long term unemployed.  I agree with the forum report that the full set of options as recommended be implemented.  I would place particular emphasis on the longer duration contract type options.  It is vital the Local Employment Service has direct access to resources and has control of expenditure, otherwise its functions will be ineffective.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication of this report and the launch by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment of the new Local Employment Service.  The <Col N="1579" /> service and the local management committees which will be responsible for running it build on the area development partnerships established under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> by Fianna Fáil in Government. In this context, I am pleased to note that the local management committees will operate under the auspices of the existing area development partnerships and will thus benefit from the experience which has been gained by the partnerships.</P>
    <P>The new initiatives which are welcome and which build upon work commenced by Fianna Fáil, not only under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> from 1990 onwards but earlier under the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> launched in 1987, address one side only of the very serious challenge to us all to provide jobs for the 280,000, or 20 per cent of the workforce, who are unemployed.  It is desirable, indeed essential, to improve the operation of the labour market and to positively discriminate in favour of the long term unemployed who are undoubtedly the most disadvantaged of those who are without employment.</P>
    <P>Services for the long term unemployed, no matter how excellent in quality or how well co-ordinated, will not, however, directly result in the creation of very many additional jobs.  We cannot rely totally on local initiatives, however desirable and effective they may be.  We must return to address each of the four essential integrated components of economic and social policy which were first enunciated by the social partners in the NESC report of November 1986 and which formed the cornerstone of the <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> agreed between the Fianna Fáil Government and the social partners in 1987.  The four essential and integrated components of the strategy for economic recovery were and still remain: control of public finances; tax reform; development policies and the removal of social and economic inequities.  The provision of new services to help the <Col N="1580" /> long term unemployed will certainly help to alleviate some of the social disadvantages from which they suffer and it will help to prepare them for entry to the job market provided jobs exist for which the long term unemployed can compete.</P>
    <P>I spoke in the budget debate about a number of issues which the Minister for Finance should address in the forthcoming Finance Bill if he is really serious about encouraging enterprise.  I suggested, for example, a targeted approach to reducing corporation tax which would help small companies to grow by allowing them to retain and invest profits for expansion.  I suggested extending the PAYE tax allowance to owner directors who operate the PAYE system in full.  I reminded the Minister for Finance that if he wants to encourage the entrepreneurs in our society, he should look at these issues.</P>
    <P>My comments about the need to encourage enterprise which I made in the context of the 1995 budget are equally applicable to the debate on how to help the long term unemployed to gain employment.  We must remember that jobs are created by people who have the skills and other resources to produce and successfully market goods and traded services in Ireland and internationally. The development and encouragement of these entrepreneurs is what job creation is all about in the final analysis.  The development of entrepreneurs is the only sustainable way in which to provide jobs for the 280,000 who are out of work, including the 135,000 long term unemployed.  The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, referred to a very successful project in Coolock where people with experience who showed leadership in getting involved in these projects drew from their entrepreneurial skills and achieved tremendous results.  The approach of entrepreneurs leading others is a model we should pursue.</P>
    <P>An aspect of national economic policy which is very topical and is directly relevant to job creation is the current <Col N="1581" /> instability in international money markets and the knock-on effects on Irish interest rates and on the exchange rate of the Irish pound with sterling.  I remind the Government and the House that small Irish exporters are particularly dependent on the British market and will lose market share, and consequently jobs, if the appreciation of the Irish pound against sterling remains for anything other than a very short time. The United Kingdom remains by far Ireland's largest trading partner both in terms of imports and exports.  More than two-fifths of our imports come from the United Kingdom whereas only one-twelfth of our imports come from Germany.  In terms of exports almost one-third go the United Kingdom &mdash; the figure is very much higher for indigenous Irish manufacturing exports &mdash; in contrast to one-eighth to Germany.  In terms of economic importance, therefore, the United Kingdom is five times more important to us as a source of imports and two and a half times more important as an export destination.</P>
    <P>The interests of Irish jobs in business demand that the Government prepare as a matter of urgency and place for debate before this House a paper assessing the implications for Irish monetary policy, trade, economic development, job maintenance and job creation of the current instability in the international money markets.  The paper should focus on the implications for Irish interest rates and exchange rate policy of the <i>de facto</i> and financial market links with sterling and the implicit public policy of shadowing the deutschemark. It is clear the two sections in the economy to suffer most from interest rate increases are home owners with mortgages and small businesses trying to finance working capital in order to underpin jobs.</P>
    <P>There is a need to focus on enterprise and job creation.  If we really want to help the long term unemployed in an economically sustainable manner I suggest the Government should look more fundamentally at the relationship between education and jobs.  The <Col N="1582" /> Government should concentrate in a focused way on providing the necessary resources to enhance the job prospects of early school leavers so that they will not become the long term unemployed of the future.  I agree with many of the sentiments expressed by Members from all parties.  Let me remind the House that according to the National Economic and Social Forum almost half of the long term unemployed are without formal educational qualifications and fewer than one-fifth have a leaving certificate or higher qualification.  Every year approximately 20 per cent of students leave the education system with poor qualifications or none whatsoever. The view expressed in the report which we are now debating is that it is almost inevitable that a large percentage of these will become long term unemployed.  It is time for the Government to address the problem of such school leavers rather than wait until they become statistics in some future report.  The last annual school leavers report I read showed that 5,200 young people left school with absolutely no qualification while a further 11,000 left with just the intermediate or group certificate. We are aware that there is a direct relationship between the level of educational qualification attained and success in the labour market.</P>
    <P>The fact that 20 per cent of those who leave school each year do so with little or no educational qualification indicates that in all likelihood these young people will become tomorrow's long term unemployed.  I agree with targeting as suggested by Deputies on this side of the House.  All the Ministers involved should have a chart in order to check and monitor targets weekly.  It is vital that this be done and that serious efforts be made by Government now that funds are available, which were not available in the past, to provide jobs for the long term unemployed.  Currently there are 27,000 young people under the age of 25 who are classified as long term unemployed. If we are to defeat long term unemployment, would it not be sensible that Government policy should in large <Col N="1583" /> part be aimed at heading off the entry of young people into the ranks of the unemployed in the first place?  Setting targets would be vital in trying to achieve this.  All the evidence shows that the longer a person is unemployed the more likely it is that he will remain long term unemployed and that his chances of successfully competing in the labour market are severely restricted.</P>
    <P>As the interim report correctly points out, the longer pupils stay on in school, the more likely they are to acquire qualifications.  However, the reality is that many of those who leave school each year do so with little or no qualification. Being a primary teacher before I entered the Dáil I think it is crucial to try to keep people within the system and that is where the concentration of resources must be placed.</P>
    <P>While links between the proposed local employment service and schools are to be welcomed, the fact is that many of those young people who leave school early are totally alienated from the school environment and require alternative forms of education and training, Reports into the Youthreach scheme highlight many of the problems young people face and also the difficulties that exist in relation to certification and accreditation.  The Youthreach programme has been in operation since 1989 and provides two years of integrated education.  It is disturbing to read that generally speaking some of the participants are severely disadvantaged and a recent survey carried out among course co-ordinators shows that almost 28 per cent of participants have been in trouble with the law, 31 per cent have suffered from alcohol or substance abuse, 29 per cent have less than one year of post-primary education, 32 per cent have one to two years post-primary education.  The report deals with the home environment and the difficulty of motivating themselves.  The figures speak for themselves.  As the report correctly points out, the relationship between educational qualifications and employment success is particularly <Col N="1584" /> strong for the young unemployed.  What is needed in my view is to ensure that those young people who leave school early with few qualifications and with the likelihood of becoming long term unemployed should be offered educational-training programmes which will have a credible value in the labour market and will enable the young person to progress to further education and training and employment.</P>
    <P>There is a serious gap in the provision of programmes for unemployed 18 to 21 year olds.  This has been pointed out by bodies such as the National Economic and Social Council, which states in report No.95 that there is no provision for educationally disadvantaged young people in that age group.  The council recommends that the needs of this age group should be addressed in the further development of compensatory second chance education for the educationally disadvantaged.  The growing skill and educational requirements of the employed labour force mean that preparation for the labour market is not just a preserve of the labour market policies for the unemployed or those at work but also has a strong educational dimension which ought to be addressed at an earlier stage through the cultivation of relevant life skills, including social and entrepreneurial skills in the educational system.</P>
    <P>In the light of the close relationship between educational qualifications and unemployment, especially for the young unemployed, there is an urgent need to ensure that the qualifications young people receive on education and training programmes are of a high standard and mean something to the young person as well as to prospective employers. It is essential that they provide a ladder or progression for the young person enabling him to compete in the labour market.  The days when a certificate of attendance would suffice on education and training programmes are long gone. What is required is a nationally recognised form of certification which will enable the young person to progress and <Col N="1585" /> further his career and not end up on the scrap heap of long term unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like many Members, I know a number of long term unemployed people.  There are far too many of them.  I also know a great number of young people who are about to join the labour market, some leaving school next summer and some finishing third level education.  They are understandably worried about their employment prospects. They want to know if they will join the ranks of the short-term unemployed or if, in the fullness of time, they might join the ranks of the long term unemployed.  They are entitled to know the effect of public policy on their chances of gaining employment.</P>
      <P>For people in that position it is not interesting to look at the macro factors that effect overall employment.  They do not see the immediate relevance of them to their individual chances of employment.  It is evident that any approach to such people, whether it is a policy or political approach &mdash; there is a difference between the two &mdash; must identify with the person.  That cannot be done at the expense of attention to the macro factors, what we do in the market and in terms of public, economic and social policy which will affect their chances of employment.  By dint of being so concerned with being relevant to individuals, we tend to lose sight of the deeper underlying factors that affect people's chances of employment who are not currently in the labour market and we affect the chances of continuing employment for many in the labour market already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We ignore the more fundamental factors and the result of our effort to be humane and concentrate on the individual is very often inhumane because long term unemployment is an inhumane position in which to place anyone.  That is what strikes me in reading the report and I am sorry that it does so because my party campaigned from 1987 until 1993 to set up something like the National Economic and Social Forum.  It was not until 1993 that the initiative was <Col N="1586" /> finally taken.  I am glad it was taken because it was the first time democratically elected politicians were involved in making these decisions.</P>
    <P>I make no apology for saying I object to the process under which Governments, without much reference to the national Parliament, and economic interest groups, who have their own job to do and cannot be criticised for doing it but have no democratic mandate, set up the <i>Programme for National Recovery, Programme for Competitiveness and Works</i> and so on.  They are not quangos and thankfully have not been institutionalised but they make agreements which are political accommodations between political forces and conveniently ignore the fundamentals of the market they have to deal with.  They have visited more unemployment on us than we deserve.  We have more people out of work than we should have.  That will be interpreted by some as a hostile comment on the <i>entente cordiale</i> which has reigned for some time between Governments, trade unions and employer organisations but I see no reason to change my view.  It is a bad formula for making fundamental decisions on economic and labour market policy.  We see the result of it all round us.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the NESF has allowed itself to be seduced into this kind of consensus which has not produced good results.  It allowed itself to be side tracked into the same old formula which has given us an enormous multiplicity of organisations, initiatives and programmes of every kind which are more like bits of sticking plaster put on a chopped up body than any real attempt to heal the ill.  I am sorry to say that.  We have wasted a good deal of energy, imagination and resources on things which are fundamentally incapable of producing the necessary answers for the long term unemployed and young people who are about to come onto the labour market.  They have been ignored because their structure is such that they are bound to ignore the fundamental questions of economic policy, competitiveness and <Col N="1587" /> labour market policy which must be addressed if we are to expand employment.</P>
    <P>The European Union is the largest trading block in the world.  It is potentially the most powerful economic unit in the world, yet it has a far worse record of unemployment than the United States or Japan.  In terms of employment growth, innovation and the development of new technology it is only trotting after South-East Asia.  We need to learn from that.  South-East Asia is now the employment boom capital of the world.  We could expand that to the Pacific rim but the employment boom capital of the world is not where we live.  That is something for young people and those at work to worry about.  We criticise that kind of analysis sometimes because we say we will not turn Europe or Ireland into a low wage, rapid expansion economy.  I understand why people say that but it ignores what is happening.</P>
    <P>I had an opportunity to look at conditions in one of these booming economies in Taiwan recently.  It is true that they have an income per head which is so low that any movement towards the kind of income per head or the housing or working conditions we have in the West is bound to be huge progress. Even if such progress is gradual, it will keep people in those countries happy for a number of years.  That ignores the fact that something else is changing.  The day is gone when goods we bought from Hong Kong or other places we had not heard of when I was young were shoddy.  The day is also long gone when goods imported from Singapore, South Korea or Hong Kong were cheap imitations of things we made so much better in the West.  Today the goods we buy from those countries are high quality, high tech products which are totally reliable and comparable in every way to products made in the West.  They compete increasingly with Western products. We may deplore that but it is the reality.  The nature of competition is changing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> The day is not far off when we shall have lost the consoling opportunity we had of saying that all these things were made with sweated labour, in back streets, in Taipei and Singapore and that decent people would not buy them; that is no longer the case.  Admittedly, some of them work in conditions that would raise more than a few eyebrows here.  I visited a computer plant in Taiwan where the more skilled parts of the workforce work a 48-hour week, in four 12-hour shifts, a firm in which the employees are reasonably well paid compared with many other people in Taiwan.  However, the people who work for 12-hour shifts a week in that plant are not much better paid than the other workers in that plant; they accept that is the way they have to work to use their technology to supply their markets.</P>
    <P>If you tried to persuade workers in any high, medium of low-tech firm here that that kind of operation is required if they are to maintain their markets it would cause a revolution.  Members in this House would complain about the type of unnatural working conditions being forced on people.  We are ignoring the realities of the market.  We may feel superior to people prepared to work like that; in some respects we may even be superior to them at present, but they will have the satisfaction of being superior in terms of their control of the markets.  We must also face competition from economies characterised by higher levels of pay and productivity than we have.  For example, we face competition from firms in the United States, Germany and Belgium &mdash; a different kind of competition but competition nevertheless.</P>
    <P>I know there is no good giving a lecture on this to somebody who has been unemployed for 13 months but it is part of the background of what will determine whether that person has a job. These reports are not addressing it.  In place of that consideration they are resorting to short term palliatives that do nothing for the structure of our labour market or our capacity to employ people.  We have been through two <Col N="1589" /> major rows in this House.  We have witnessed the position in TEAM Aer Lingus and in Packard, neither of which was put into liquidation, to which I shall revert in a moment in another connection. TEAM Aer Lingus must compete on the one hand with firms that have access to labour at a fraction of the price paid by TEAM and which have produced comparable productivity levels. On the other hand, TEAM has to compete with firms that pay higher wage levels but which produce correspondingly higher levels of productivity, rendering them capable of competing with or out-competing TEAM and to get work that TEAM would like to get.</P>
    <P>We saw the so-called rescue plan put together for TEAM Aer Lingus.  As far as I could understand recently, it was posited on the assumption that TEAM would be in a position to charge the equivalent of £45 an hour for work it did on its contracts.  What happened?  Its competitors produce the same work for £30 an hour.  That is not a rescue plan, it ignores reality.</P>
    <P>We have the same problem in Packard, another firm that must deal with competition from high and low wage economies and firms but the difficulty comes to the same thing in both cases &mdash; the combination of wage levels and productivity renders other firms competitive with Packard.  If we do not want to change the wage levels, we must change the productivity, and if we do not want to change the productivity, then we must change the wage levels.  If we do not want to change the wage levels or productivity, then we must accept we will not be in business; there is no other way out of it and no amount of jumping up and down on the part of the politicians in here or elsewhere will change that.  The market does not want to know what Members think about matters of social justice and competitive equity, the markets want to know how much we can sell to the customer at a price that allows us make a profit.</P>
    <P>If we fail to learn those lessons, as we seem hell bent on doing, we shall condemn more people to unemployment. <Col N="1590" /> We had another example of it earlier today when Deputy O'Rourke spoke about what needs to be done to save the Silverlea company and jobs in Athlone and Athy, a very worthy cause but she was seriously proposing things she knows a Government cannot do, which she knows have no basis in any kind of competitive reality.  I know Deputy O'Rourke knows that much of what she is saying was pure pretence because, if she does not, she spent at least the last two years of her life fast asleep &mdash; which I know she has not.  Nonetheless, she is pretending that a Government can step in to a firm in liquidation and pull the chestnuts out of the fire.  She is pretending that a worker buy-out scheme-feasibility study she has seen on paper &mdash; perhaps because it was undertaken by a firm she says has associations with the Government &mdash; is the answer to the problem, that in some way the Government should wield the big stick on the liquidator, tell him to hold off his statutory job, a law she knows backwards, inside out, because she lived with it for two years &mdash; contending that the Government should find some way around the law and try to save this company. That is not the way to protect employment in this economy; that way lies absolute, utter madness, more unemployment for people now in our workforce amd longer term unemployment for people who are not.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, in his speech earlier identified some of the causes of long term unemployment. He spoke of low levels of skills, educational attainment, barriers facing the long term unemployed in terms of recruitment practices, employer reluctance and unemployment traps, loss of skills and other policy factors.  The measures set out in the report are aimed at dealing with some of the problems but they will deal with some of them only in a very local or partial way. Undoubtedly these measures are needed as part of our local approach to the problem but, if not underpinned by a sensible view of the macro factors <Col N="1591" /> affecting overall employment in our economy, they are doomed to failure.  It does not matter how many agencies we have if the basic combination of wage rates and productivity in our economy is wrong, it does not matter how many ADMs, local partnerships or Outreach programmes, whatever else we may call them, we have, we will not get more people into employment because they just will not win markets.  The only way we will employ people is by manufacturing goods and delivering services at prices that will beat competition.</P>
    <P>The problem I have with some of what is set out in this report is not that it is not worthwhile in itself but that it diverts a good deal of attention and resources from the main problem. These are supposed to deal with long term unemployment.  I find in the Executive Summary of the report &mdash; a fashionable phrase &mdash; the objective is to aim at long term unemployment first. However, the report goes on to attach some importance to prevent the drift into long term unemployment.  Then I find in the key proposal, in the target groups for local employment service, one of the &ldquo;broad priority groups&rdquo; for that service includes the registered unemployed for more than six months. In fact it is implicit in this report, although not recognised, that the problem of unemployment is not comprised of several different problems &mdash; it is not the long term, short-term or recently unemployed, it is a problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>There are as many different unemployment problems as there are unemployed people but the fact that somebody is long term unemployed just means it has taken longer to solve that person's problem than for somebody else.  If we devise too many different programmes, based speciously on these different kinds of unemployment, we will miss the boat because they divert our attention from the fundamental factors that determine our total level of employment.</P>
    <P>I find one encouraging thought in this <Col N="1592" /> report and it is set out on page 15 of the Executive Summary.  It states, &ldquo;There must be a financial incentive for the unemployed to take up part-time temporary position and changes should be made in the tax and social welfare systems to ensure this incentive exists&rdquo;.  When that is decoded and put into recognisable English, it means that we believe our labour market should be made more flexible.  All I ask is that those in Government and in the services which produce this wonderful wisdom recognise that the prescription is just as valid when no State agency is involved as when State agencies are involved.  It is just as valid in the private sector as when a multiplicity of State agencies are involved.  Labour market flexibility is something we must aim for.</P>
    <P>The section of the report immediately preceding the section dealing with labour market flexibility is called &ldquo;Community Employment&rdquo;.  We know there are community employment schemes throughout the country.  They are being held up now because one trade union has decided to use the existence of community employment schemes as a bargaining lever with local authorities to increase certain kinds of employment. That is the wrong way for them to go about that job and they are stopping employment projects proceeding which have nothing to do with local authorities and never had anything to do with them. Will they take seriously the logic of the reports they support and let us see some labour market flexibility for the sake of the unemployed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Long term unemployment is at the heart of the unemployment problem.  It is difficult when people find themselves unemployed and it involves a good deal of personal trauma.  However, if they are back in employment within a few months they can put that period of unemployment behind them, look on it as a bad phase and avoid lifelong damage to their prospects and self-esteem.  Unfortunately, that is not the case for the long term <Col N="1593" /> unemployed, who are in a much more difficult position.</P>
      <P>This report focuses on efforts to help the most needy among the long term unemployed, and that is only right.  We are all aware there is a raging academic debate &mdash; some of which we have heard in this House today &mdash; among polititions, and economists about concepts such as structural unemployment, the possibility, however remote, of full employment and so-called natural rate of unemployment or what is more distressingly recognised as the acceptable level of unemployment.  However, we would consider it an enormously valuable practicable achievement if we could minimise long term unemployment alone.  If we crack that problem, we will have holed the general problem of unemployment below the waterline.</P>
      <P>The interim report focuses on the initiative to establish a local employment service which would offer a wide range of services to help the long term unemployed get back to work.  I commend the report for the detail with which it addressed the implementation of the idea of local support services. Some of the details seem on the face of it a trifle bureaucratic.  However, there is little point in arguing over the design of optimal oversight systems.  Let us see what happens in practice and be prepared to change the management structures later, if necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept there are good reasons why we should focus on the local level and why the report does that, but in my short contribution I caution against an over-rigid emphasis on employment opportunities in a particular geographic area.  It is well recognised that one of the reasons European unemployment rates are still higher than in the United States is that people in the European Union are less willing or perhaps less able to move around freely in search of opportunities. Mobility in the European Union, even within individual countries, is probably lower than in the United States.  A total focus on particular geographic areas mitigates against mobility. <Col N="1594" /> I support the focus in the report on geographic areas but not in a paranoid and highly targeted fashion to the exclusion of the overall problem.  Employment cannot be boxed in in that way; mobility is essential.</P>
    <P>Naturally most people would prefer to find employment in their locality, but State services assisting the long term unemployed should not limit themselves to helping the unemployed find suitable opportunities in a particular geographic area alone.  I support the policy, but it should not be the only one.  That is particularly applicable to younger people or those who do not have significant family commitments.  Would it not be unfortunate if there were a match for a person's skill elsewhere in the country and our State support services had not, because of the manner in which they organised, been able to make the connection between that person's skill and the requirement for that person's abilities? Co-ordination across areas and within the national FÁS database should not be forgotten as attention is paid to the local scene.  There should be balance in that area.</P>
    <P>I query the thinking behind the idea in the report that the employment service must be able to place the individual in the conventional labour market or in employment resulting from a special employment opportunity.  If that could be done, long term unemployment, at least in statistical terms, would be eliminated at a stroke, but we know that would be a buck exercise and would be illusory.  We know that forcing the issue eventually devalues one or other good idea.  In this case it is likely that if any special employment opportunity must be found, the attractiveness of special employment opportunities will be lost. A less charitable interpretation of that would point to dangers of coercion of the individual involved.  That is not to say that some individuals will have to be left behind, the contrary is the position. Some people will want to hold out for conventional work and if they apply themselves to securing it, they should <Col N="1595" /> not be corralled into special employment opportunities.  The long term unemployed are interested in training and placements, but only if they see them as part of their progress towards conventional work or more generally towards a meaningful productive life. They are entitled to that view.  Unless this perception is shared by both the unemployed individual and the employment service and based on reality, it would be a disservice to the unemployed to insist on some form of placement.</P>
    <P>I welcome this report and commend the work that has gone into it.  It is an extremely valuable contribution and I compliment all those involved.  I believe the ideas contained in it will work if they are thought through and if rigidities of any kind are avoided.  The labour market is not static.  The goal is to break down barriers between people seeking work and the work that needs to be done.  I argue that we should allow for greater flexibility.  We must not lose sight also of the basic economics of the situation, as they are always with us.</P>
    <P>Taxes on unemployment must continue to be reduced.  Financial incentives given by the tax and welfare systems should not operate as barriers to people offering and accepting work, rather they should be designed to increase employment. The tax burden on the producing sector of the economy has to be kept as low as is practicable.  The environment has to be conductive to wealth and employment creation and small businesses and service companies must be developed.  There are some 150,000 small firms in Ireland today.  Even one extra job in half of those would put a major hole in our unemployment problem. We must do much more to develop the great potential of the service area.</P>
    <P>At Question Time today I was staggered to hear the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, following questions from this side of the House say, not once but two or three times, that she saw no distinction between a person working for a small or a large <Col N="1596" /> company.  She took the view which she suggested was a Government view &mdash; I doubt if it is the Fine Gael view &mdash; that a person working in a small firm with two or three people should have exactly the same employment rights in regard to unfair dismissal, labour laws, health and safety laws and a plethora of European Union directives which apply to the labour market.  She was strongly of the view that whether you worked for a company with two people or a company with 2,000 people precisely the same legislation should apply.  I totally reject that view.  I would like to hear the Fine Gael view on this.  I doubt if the Minister for Enterprise and Employment agrees that if you work for a two or a three person firm the whole weight of European Union labour market regulations, audit requirements and the various directives should apply in exactly the same way.  If I do the Minister a disservice no doubt she will correct the record, but I understood her to say there should be no distinction based on the size of the firm.  I ask her to rethink that view and, in particular.  I ask the Fine Gael members of Government to examine the record and see whether they can live with that attitude.  There are 150,000 firms who, in my view, would adopt an entirely different approach.</P>
    <P>All of these changes and an attitude of flexibility is necessary.  They are necessary, if not sufficient, conditions to reduce unemployment.  A well designed local employment service operating in this context will make a strong contribution towards reducing long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>I took part in the debate primarily to draw attention to the need not to box ourselves in to a localised geographic solution to unemployment.  It is a help, it is good and it is worth doing but we must not be so rigid and inflexible as to make it difficult to match skills which may be available on a national basis.</P>
    <P>The success of the United States in employment is substantially due to mobility, particularly among young people who get up and go and find or <Col N="1597" /> generate employment wherever their talents fit.  If we in Ireland insist on catching the European disease of starting from a proposition that one is entitled to work where one grew up it gives us inflexibility and it would be a disservice to the long term unemployed. We should insist on mobility and flexibility being part of the system, particularly for younger long term unemployed persons.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report and I commend the excellent work which has gone into it by all concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I too welcome the report.  I wish to comment briefly on Deputy Brennan's remarks, which I appreciate.  The report is not rigid in relation to local employment.  It proposes a local employment service and points out the benefits from placing people in the local geographic area. Where national employment is available it does not exclude access to such employment.  It provides a focus rather than rigid parameters.  That is the spirit of the task force and the spirit of the forum, of which I was a member, which drew up the report.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan referred to the comments by the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald.  What she said was that the status and working conditions of regular employment should be approximated in whatever business enterprise an employee is engaged and that we should seek the best level of standards for all employees.  Too often employees in certain types of business are exploited.  We should use as few excuses as possible, whether it is a small or medium operation or a part-time contract.  That is the direction in which this report is going.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This report &mdash; Interim Report of the Task Force on Long-term Unemployment &mdash; originates from the National Economic and Social Forum Report, No. 4, presented in June 1994, entitled Ending Long-term Unemployment. What was interesting about that Forum report was that for the first time we had a full spectrum of interests represented <Col N="1598" /> in drawing up the report.  Strand No. 1 consisted of politicians representing all parties.  Strand 2 was made up of the social partners consisting of the farmers, the business community and trade unions.  Strand No. 3 consisted of women, the unemployed, disadvantaged people, youth, the elderly, people with a disability, the environment and academics.  We had an expansion of the normal social partnership which the Government has engaged in drawing up work programmes for Government.  On the industrial relations side we had an extension to strand 3 which was crucial to the quality of the report.   The terms of reference of the National Economic and Social Forum which was established in 1993 focused on combating unemployment, particularly long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Report No. 4, which gave rise to the interim report of the task force, is the most important of all the reforms to date.  I cannot imagine any report in the future being more important in its intent.  The problem is one we have always had.  It has countered that adage that the rising tide lifts all boats.  That is not correct in economic terms.  All boats are not lifted.  The boat that is not lifted is the boat of the long term unemployed. Irrespective of how burgeoning our economy the long term unemployed scarcely shift in terms of numbers.  They do not benefit and that is clear from the statistics.  The 1980s was a time of spiralling unemployment, originally prompted by the two oil crises in the seventies.  In 1980 8 per cent of the workforce was unemployed.  In 1994 the rate of unemployment was approximately double that.  Approximately 100,000 were unemployed in 1980 while today the figure is 275,000.  Some 2.8 per cent of the workforce who were unemployed then were long term unemployed while 135,000, almost percent, are long term unemployed now.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we target the long term unemployed and deal with the problem seriously.  In 1993 approximately £2.16 billion was lost through social welfare unemployment payments <Col N="1599" /> and tax and PRSI foregone.  Unemployment payments account for 7 per cent of our gross domestic product while the average in the European Union is 4 per cent.  We are second only to Spain in the amount of GDP allocated to unemployment payments.</P>
    <P>Economists regard short term unemployed people as a pool of available labour which can be soaked up as jobs are created.  Business people and economists regard long term unemployed people as a stagnant pool &mdash; it does not change, is of benefit to no one, is a burden on everybody and creates incredible poverty, human degradation and other problems.</P>
    <P>We have never had coherent policies on how to deal with long term unemployment and many of our policies have led to an increase in long term unemployment. For example, local authorities, which have operated in isolation, have built housing estates and flat complexes without proper amenities, employment structures, industrial complexes, transport systems, estate management or shopping centres.  The only amenities in unemployment blackspots such as Tallaght and Ballymun are primary and secondary schools and churches, and the only reason these were provided is because the church intervened when the State did not and the local authority felt it had fulfilled its duty by providing the housing.  Ballymun, which has a population of 20,000, has no shopping centre, industrial complex or transport system.  It is out in the wilderness and nothing has changed over the years.  Instead of dealing with unemployment our planning policy has given rise to problems largely because it has been divorced from any integrated approach.</P>
    <P>We have a burgeoning economy, yet we still have endemic unemployment. We must intervene to address the problem. It is not good enough to have low inflation, low interest rates, industrial stability, relatively low wage increases and high exports if we do not intervene effectively to address the problem of <Col N="1600" /> unemployment.  This debate is appropriate in that this year we will commemorate the Famine which occurred 150 years ago.  At that time Ireland was a relatively wealthy country, yet because of lack of intervention hundreds of thousands of people died of starvation. Intervention is a key factor in solving the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Under the National Development Plan approximately £20 billion will be provided in Structural, Cohesion, European Social and Community Framework Funds to develop education, infrastructure, community projects waste management, transportation, ports and urban renewal.  While this is a very fine package, the ESRI estimates that between 1994-2000 unemployment will have declined by 3.5 per cent per annum at best.  This means that by the year 2000 there will be 132,000 long term unemployed persons on the live register.  This minuscule decrease proves that the rising tide does not lift all the boats.</P>
    <P>The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> refers to placing 100,000 people in training and education courses by 1997.  While I welcome this proposal, it will not remove the burden from the State.  It is envisaged that the National Development Plan will create 50,000-80,000 jobs by the year 2000.  During the 1980's approximately 20,000 people emigrated for various reasons but mainly because they had no choice.  All these factors have an effect on the unemployment figures but they have a minimal effect on the long term unemployment figure.</P>
    <P>We need to focus almost exclusively on this section of the live register, to target long term unemployment in a way it has never been targeted before.  I was a member of the forum which drew up the report &ldquo;Ending Long-Term Unemployment&rdquo; which provided a real basis on which to deal with long term unemployment. It referred to the elimination of unemployment and drew much of its thinking from the European Community &ldquo;White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, 1993&rdquo; and the OECD report &ldquo;Employment <Col N="1601" /> Outlook, 1993&rdquo;.  The Interim Report of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment does not reflect the way in which the matter was discussed and analysed by the forum.</P>
    <P>The report proposes that a local employment service be established which would consist of a group of mediators.  It is estimated that approximately 100,000 out of the 135,000 people on the live register would volunteer for employment service.  Under this proposal approximately 800 specially trained mediators or counsellors would be employed to contact volunteers and develop an action plan in the context of the person's strengths, resources, training etc.  That mediator would act as a placement person.  He could build up a portfolio of employers in the community and act as a broker between potential employees and employers.  He could engineer social contact, find out if an employer would recruit an extra person and what skills would be required for the position.  He could then seek out persons with the necessary skills.</P>
    <P>There are thousands of small businesses which, with a little persuasion, could take on an additional employee and a budget of £30 million was sought for this purpose.  However, a budget of £6 million is available, £1 million for training and education purposes and £5 million for general purposes.  That is a start, but it is not sufficient.  We would seek a guarantee from employers that they would take on a person and that mediator would have access to resources whether from the local vocational education committee, FÁS office or otherwise.  That is the approach which is envisaged, using small and big businesses and computer data about jobs available on a national basis.</P>
    <P>The French Government adopted a similar approach in 1992.  It interviewed and counselled one million people, 17 per cent of whom were placed on training programmes immediately.  There was no immediate solution in only 25 per cent of cases.  The process of mediation, counselling, guidance and <Col N="1602" /> placement &mdash; absent from our training schemes &mdash; has proven successful in France.  The Coolock contact point, referred to in the report, was set up 14 months ago and since then 308 people have been placed in employment, 46 of whom were long term unemployed.  In a burgeoning economy it is simple enough to place the highly skilled and those fresh out of universities in employment. When we reach the stage of securing employment for 50 per cent of the long term unemployed then we will have succeeded.</P>
    <P>Another part of the equation is to prevent people becoming long/term unemployed.  The report sets out proposals on how to stem the flow of those on short term unemployment which, if successful, would prevent the number on long/term unemployment from increasing.  The employment service would be obliged to provide options in training, education, personal development and work experience for people who are less than 12 months unemployed to enable them to participate in the workforce.  We should endeavour to prevent an excess in the numbers on short term unemployment and focus specifically and personally on the question of long term unemployment.  That is the only solution to the problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>In 1992, 48 per cent of the long term unemployed did not have educational qualifications and only 4 per cent had a third level education.  Virtually nobody with third level education is long term unemployed but approximately 50 per cent of the long term unemployed have no educational qualifications.  Sixty-six per cent of the unemployed over 35 and 22 per cent of those between 15 and 24 have no educational qualifications. Twenty per cent of our young people leave school annually without official accreditation or qualification and that area must be addressed.  The report deals with that under the European initiative, Youthstart.  Each member state must guarantee facilities for those who leave school without qualifications by placing them in a training system.  We <Col N="1603" /> must start at pre-school level when children are most impressionable and those in deprived settings can drift and lose out if they are not channelled properly through the education system.  We must establish a proper national pre-school system.</P>
    <P>I am reasonably happy with the recommendations of the task force report, but I would prefer if they were targeted stringently along the lines proposed in our report.  I acknowledge that a final report will be published in October 1995 which I hope will propose that, instead of providing £6 million in funding to fill gaps in the services, a main employment structure for the long term unemployed which will have its own funding will be put in place.</P>

      <P>I do not consider this report a blueprint for solving our unemployment problem and I do not say that in a party political sense, I say it from my 20 years' experience in creating employment and trying to deal with some of the perceived definitions that bedevil the problem of unemployment.  The proposed solutions will only tinker with the basic underlying problem regarding the structure of our society and the reason for our high unemployment rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has come to my attention that there are cutbacks in the community employment schemes, which are very serious for rural areas as the extension last year to allow people to remain on those schemes for two or three years at a time has provided many basic facilities and gainful occupation for the people.  We know from the demand that, of all the schemes, the community employment schemes are those with which rural <Col N="1604" /> people have identified most and have seen as beneficial.</P>
    <P>It would seem that this document was written from an urban perspective as it deals mainly with the unemployment problems of urban areas which, I concede, are horrendous.  However, those problems are exacerbated by the social make-up of our cities and by segregation in housing which has an adverse effect on people's chances of getting gainful employment.  Why, when mankind has reached its highest point of technological development, are we faced with one of our greatest disasters, forced unemployment?  For centuries people have had to spend most of their time working to provide themselves with the basic necessities of life &mdash; food, shelter, clothing and heat.  It is heartening that, because of modern technology, it is no longer necessary.  On the face of it, these technological developments should have provided people with new vistas, new opportunities to develop the things of the mind, cultural and physical matters.  Instead, in our modern society, we face the terrible spectre of forced idleness and structured unemployment. We must examine, as a matter of grave urgency, why this is so and why the freedom afforded by this progress has become a millstone around our necks.</P>
    <P>The problems relate to our definitions of work, employment and unemployment. They stem from our linking of payment and occupation, and from the erroneous perception that a large part of our population is still engaged in the production of our basic needs.  Two Victorian concepts have a predominant influence on our society.  The first is the notion of a job as a fixed amount of time worked in a fixed place of employment for a fixed remuneration.  The second is the definition of unemployment which involves a payment to those who have no work on condition that they are available for work and do not engage in any activity until a standard job is provided for them, and the penalty for engaging in any type of activity by those who are considered unemployed is loss of the payment.  The concept of being <Col N="1605" /> available for work and not engaging in any occupation is amazing in a society that no longer needs the sweat of all its citizens' brows to provide its basic needs.</P>
    <P>Why, in a modern society with so much unemployment, does so much need to be done and so much forced idleness, when there is so much opportunity for activity?  We all accept the need for more nurses, social workers, environmental workers, council workers, research, art and culture workers, gardaí, teachers etc., but we need to mend roads, care for the old, the handicapped, bury telephone cables and provide ourselves with 1,001 other services that would be good for our society.  Again there is a paradox: in these days of cutbacks in basic services, when we are told that we cannot afford teachers and nurses, that hospital wards must be closed, we are also enjoying the greatest output that this society has ever experienced.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the question of economic growth, of growth in GNP and its relationship to the provision of employment.  There is a myth that if the economy grows, employment will automatically follow and that unemployment is because of a lack of economic growth.  This is false as economic growth is about the creation of wealth, and the creation of employment, although dependent on the creation of wealth, is more fundamentally dependent on the distribution of that wealth in an equitable way.  There has also been concentration on the idea that the creation of wealth and the creation of jobs would happen in the same sector.  For example, there was, and still seems to be, an idea that we will create both wealth and jobs by increasing manufacture, agriculture, fishing etc.  There is even a new belief that tourism can solve our unemployment problem.  These services are important for the creation of wealth as, without the creation of enough wealth this society would not be able to buy from outside the services it requires. However, as long as we can buy all <Col N="1606" /> necessary services from outside, the provision of employment or useful activity for people has more to do with distribution of wealth and activity than with the creation of wealth itself.</P>
    <P>Curiously enough, earlier societies had adequate wealth creation and fully occupied populations.  It struck me that if, in previous centuries, when there was surplus labour and societies had our system of unemployment, the monks and the craftsmen, instead of providing us with treasures like the Ardagh Chalice, the Book of Kells, the Celtic crosses etc., would have been on the dole forbidden to engage in anything that might be artistic or useful.  Thank God their system was more enlightened than ours.</P>
    <P>We must accept that in future fewer people will be employed in manufacturing, agriculture, fishing and primary production.  This is not necessarily a bad thing as many of the jobs in these industries in the past were back-breaking, monotonous and even dangerous.  Basically, we have enough wealth to provide a useful and gainful occupation for all our people and our task must be to examine how we distribute this wealth and ensure that everybody shares it. This can be done by compulsion, for example, through the imposition of high taxes and the provision of more State services, or by the creation of a tax or social welfare code that makes it attractive for people to provide services that other people want.  It is by a combination of the provision of more State services for which there is a public demand and the creation of a tax or social welfare system which gives an incentive to work that we will solve unemployment.</P>
    <P>I would like to look at the tax and social welfare code and its inhibiting effect on the creation of employment and on equalisation in the distribution of wealth.  It flies in the face of the whole purpose of business to depend for the creation of employment on giving incentives to the rich and powerful in society by way of grants and tax reliefs in the hope that they will create not only wealth but employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1607" /> The shareholders of our publicly quoted companies would lose faith quickly in those companies if their primary aim was not the maximisation of profits but the maximisation of employment. This is not to condemn those involved in business but to recognise the structures, particularly the financial structures, of the society in which we live.  The reliance therefore on the myth that business is about employment creation rather than the creation of profits is dangerous.  As someone who for many years was involved in job creation and in the running of a business I am more than aware that pressure is constantly brought to bear to maximise profits, to compete and minimise the cost of overheads, including employment.</P>
    <P>There is also a belief that by providing further training for everyone we will solve the unemployment crisis.  This is another myth, yet it is one of the core concepts in this document.  While the person who has been trained has an advantage and a competitive edge in seeking employment the provision of training only has a marginal influence on job creation.  However, it increases the possibility of attracting overseas investors because of the availability of a trained workforce.  If one looks at the figures for total employment one will find that the number of positions likely to be offered because of this factor is very small.</P>
    <P>I wish to examine our taxation and social welfare systems to see whether they inhibit the creation of useful occupational employment and discourage the transfer of resources from one group of persons to another in return for the provision of services.  I wish to introduce the concept that what most people are concerned with is the maximisation of their income.  None of us works all our waking hours; most people do not spend all their lives trying to increase their income.  Humans are social animals and therefore most of us try to strike a balance between the time spent earning a living and pursuing other social activities. The amount of voluntary work <Col N="1608" /> done in society is testimony to this phenomenon, which is often overlooked.</P>
    <P>There is a simplistic belief that most families or individuals have one source of income &mdash; a standard job.  In rural areas in particular more and more people are able to earn an income from various activities.  For example, when I was manager of the co-op in Cornamóna most of those employed also owned small farms and were involved in the tourism industry.  We created the concept of a family or household income which provided an adequate standard of living.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about the need to provide incentives.  In this respect we should examine what we do to the unemployed.  We destroy initiative.  For example, small farmers, fishermen, the self-employed and others who can earn an income from various activities but who also need to receive social welfare payments are caught in a system under which for every £1 they earn above a certain figure their social welfare payment is reduced by the same amount. This is a catch-22 whereby they are paying taxation at the rate of 100 per cent. Once social welfare recipients such as lone parents earn more than £6 per week their payment is reduced in this way.  Furthermore, if they are in receipt of a rent allowance the system is structured in such a way that they are not allowed to retain any extra income earned.  Is it any wonder that these groups tend to operate in the black economy or become totally disenchanted with the system and give up the impossible struggle?</P>
    <P>A few years ago there was much talk about the disincentive for those earning between £50,000 and £100,000 per annum, who had to pay tax at the rate of 56p in the pound, to create employment and wealth.  Yet we wonder why those at the lower end of the scale do not feel like taking up employment when their social welfare payments are reduced pound by pound for the amount they earn.  In many cases they <Col N="1609" /> believe it is futile to seek gainful employment.</P>
    <P>For those who manage to escape from the social welfare system by obtaining employment we place numerous obstacles in their way.  As soon as their earnings exceed £70 per week they are taxed.  Once they proceed up the ladder under the marginal taxation system they are taxed at the rate of 40 per cent.  With PRSI this gives an effective tax rate of 45.5 per cent.  If they continue to climb the ladder they will lose their family income supplement and medical card and begin to move backwards instead of forwards.  Is it any wonder that the unemployed are not breaking their necks to seek out scarce employment opportunities?</P>
    <P>Let us examine the areas where occupational employment may be created. Employment may be created in the provision of services to the community.  We have to examine the concept whereby the same income is taxed each time we pay for a service.  Much of our tax receipts are based on the transfer of income from one person to another in return for their labour.  If a person earning £30,000 per annum &mdash; to give a simple example &mdash; employs a child minder, in order to pay them £2,500 per year they will have to earn £5,000.  In turn, the child minder finds that the State takes some of the £2,500 back.  Under our taxation system the higher the sum transferred the higher the sum collected in taxation and the greater the disincentive to create employment.  I describe this as trying to ride a bicycle with the brakes on.  In the case of social welfare recipients it is like trying to ride a bicycle with the wheels clamped.</P>
    <P>The social welfare code inhibits the development of activities such as farming and fishing.  It has to be accepted that a small farmer living in Connemara cannot have a modern lifestyle on his income from farming.  It is nonsense to suggest that he is unemployed in the sense that he has no work to do.  What he needs is a supplementary income from the State to raise his standard of <Col N="1610" /> living to an acceptable level.  There is therefore a need for radical reform.</P>
    <P>On the question of study and training, I am a great believer in education as the key to success.  Many people have come to my clinic to state that they wish to attend a course at university.  Instead of paying them unemployment assistance why do we not pay them study assistance whereby they would retain their payment without any limitations?  I fail to understand why this obstacle is placed in their way in providing themselves with an education.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity the last speaker was not a member of the Front Bench of the last Fianna Fáil Government as I agree with most of what he says.  There is a global term for what he described &mdash;&ldquo;the system does not encourage savings&rdquo;.  No matter what one does one cannot advance.</P>
      <P>One in ten people in the State has been unemployed for over a year: 92,000 have been unemployed for two years or more and of these 74 per cent are likely to be unemployed one year later.  These are but some of the grim statistics outlined in the interim report of the task force on long term unemployment.</P>
      <P>Long term unemployment is the single greatest cause of inequality in our society, and that inequality is perpetual. All available evidence indicates that those who have been unemployed the longest find it most difficult to get work, even when the economy is booming.  It is thus apparant that we must launch a two-pronged assault on unemployment and its causes.  We must address the structural problems which cause unemployment and the social and human problems confronting the unemployed in their search for work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task force report highlights ways in which the long term unemployed can be integrated back into the workforce and I welcome many of its recommendations. In particular, I welcome the proposal to establish local employment exchanges.  For too long we have had the absurd spectacle of people signing <Col N="1611" /> on at so-called employment exchanges. The term &ldquo;employment exchange&rdquo; is, of course, a misnomer: generally the only aid to job searchers is an appointment's page from the <i>Irish Independent.</i>  Those in search of work have been forced to look to FÁS centres which are generally not situated in their local areas and are often not viewed as relevant to the individual's situation.  A local employment service, with linkages to local employers and community organisations, would be a giant step forward and I look forward to the speedy implementation of these proposals.</P>
    <P>The report also recommends that schemes providing direct employment to the long term unemployed should carry the status and working conditions of regular employment.  For too long we have shunted the long term unemployed into schemes which, all too often, are seen as irrelevant both by the general public and by those directly involved.  It is vital, not just for the schemes concerned but for society as a whole, that the status of community work is raised. In this regard, the report identifies the problem and suggests some of the solutions.</P>
    <P>The social divide today is not between rich and poor; it is between those who have a little &mdash; the people at work &mdash; and those who have nothing &mdash; the people out of work.  But there are also those at work who have nothing, who are working to maintain their self-respect and to keep in touch with the world of work but who, at the end of the week, take home little more than what they would get on the dole.  Those people have been described in greater detail by Deputy Ó Cuív.</P>
    <P>The report identifies the need for financial incentives to encourage the unemployed to take up part time or temporary positions by way of changes in the tax and social welfare systems. This is a crucial issue and the implementation of the recommendations of the report in this regard will make a substantial difference to thousands of low paid workers, many of whom are <Col N="1612" /> women and young people.  There is no doubt that the report's recommendations, if implemented, will make a difference but they will do little to address the root causes of unemployment, nor was that part of the task force's mandate.</P>
    <P>For some time unemployment has been at the top of the political agenda, or so we are constantly assured.  Yet our live register figures continue to hover around the 300,000 mark.  The number affected by unemployment, of course, are far greater.  Whole families are consigned to the dole queues and communities have been devastated.</P>
    <P>General unemployment is fast becoming a fact of life &mdash; one which is in danger of becoming the norm.  Yet &mdash; and this is surely the supreme irony &mdash; our economy is booming.  We have a high economic growth, we have complied with the convergence criteria under Maastricht, the national debt is under control and inflation is low. Despite all that we have the second highest rate of unemployment in the EU.</P>
    <P>Booming economic indicators are of little comfort to people in Cork, where unemployment is now running at 22.8 per cent.  That is nearly twice the national average.  The people who come to my clinics every day are unimpressed with the Maastricht convergence criteria and they find the national debt supremely irrelevant.  They are the human faces behind the phenomenon of jobless growth.</P>
    <P>Last week 108 jobs were lost in the Sunbeam knitwear division.  There are those in this House who would like to turn that human loss into a party political football.  They know, however, that Governments can create the conditions for job creation and job maintenance &mdash; but they cannot simply save individual jobs with the wave of a wand.  They also know that Government investment all too often postpones, rather than averts, disaster.</P>
    <P>The Sunbeam workers deserve better from us than party political squeals. They deserve a long term assault on the <Col N="1613" /> root causes of unemployment and of enterprise failure.  The old panaceas have not worked and are not likely to work in the future.</P>
    <P>The world of work is changing at a rate unimaginable just ten years ago.  By the end of the century less than half of all workers are likely to be working in traditional forms of employment.  The number of part-time workers &mdash; voluntary and involuntary &mdash; is growing, while many who would like to avail of part-time work of job-sharing have, in the past, been faced with a variety of obstacles and disincentives.</P>
    <P>In addition, economies no longer function in a national vacuum.  The collapse of an English-based bank, triggered off by events in Singapore, can have worldwide repercussions, as we experienced just a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>We live and work in a global market. Most experts are now agreed that individual state governments are powerless to tackle unemployment on their own. Capital and jobs are increasingly mobile.  In the case of Ireland, the major economic and monetary decisions are made at a European level.  It is for this reason that Democratic Left has long supported the concept of a common European industrial policy.  Unemployment is rising throughout the EU as a whole.  Europe's position <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Far East and North America is changing, especially in the context of GATT and NAFTA, and the North-South relationship continues to be ignored.</P>
    <P>We raised the need for a common industrial policy during the Maastricht referendum and again during last year's European elections.  There is a need to move jobs, as well as cash, from the centre to the periphery.  The Structural Funds &mdash; which, in any event, are finite &mdash; are a limited response to the problems of peripherality.  Democratic Left believes that the issue of a common industrial policy should be central to the discussions in the run up to the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>All too often today's problems have been met with yesterday's solutions. The programme for <i>A Government of <Col N="1614" /> Renewal</i> contains a number of innovative proposals which will tackle unemployment and increase the range of choices available to those wishing to enter, or re-enter, the world of work. The task of implementing these proposals began in the budget presented last month, and will continue in forthcoming budgets.</P>
    <P>The task force report picks up on some of these proposals.  The scope of the report, however, is necessarily limited and determined by the mandate given to the task force.  I would welcome follow up research on the structural causes of unemployment and I believe the conclusions of such a report would point in the direction of a common industrial policy or similar.</P>
    <P>Unlike the parties opposite, my party believes that the State has a vital role to play in the economy.  We do not believe that the State can allow itself to be driven out of the economy by privatisation. The State has a vital role to play, too, in the boardroom.</P>
    <P>In this regard, I particularly welcome the Government's committment to revitalise public enterprise and the recognition of the dramatic changes facing our State companies.  Employment policy must focus not merely on job creation, but also on job maintenance and it is vital that our State companies be equipped to deal with the challenges posed by rapid technological change and the demands of EU membership.</P>
    <P>During the past decade State companies in Ireland and elsewhere have all too often been viewed as little more than disposable assets to be sold off when the economic going gets tough.</P>
    <P>Our policy towards State companies should be one of commercialisation rather than privatisation, and I am glad this is the route chosen by the Government parties in the programme.  I particularly welcome the commitment to give commercial State bodies a clear commercial mandate and to clarify the financial targets by which their performance will be measured.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the Government's commitment of indigenous industry.  We <Col N="1615" /> should have learned the painful lessons of over-reliance on multinational enterprises which have little or no commitment to the communities in which they operate.  A lesson should have been learnt in terms of jobs lost and communities devastated, and I hope that will not be repeated.</P>
    <P>The development of industrial clusters will revitalise whole communities and allow for integrated industrial development.  There is, however, a danger that industrial development will bypass those most in need, the long term unemployed.  All too often, newly created jobs go to those already in employment or who have been unemployed for just a few months while the long term unemployed remain on the sidelines.  In this regard, much valuable work has been done by various groups and institutes, not only in identifying the problems, but also suggesting solutions. In this regard, I am especially glad the Government programme borrows from the NESF in its commitment to establish an intensive guidance and placement service operated at local level and involving local employers and trade unions.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the work being done by NESF, the task force and similar fora, I am conscious of the danger that theory may be substituted for action. The shelves in Government Buildings are weighed down under the dust-covered reports produced by various organisations.  The time has come for these reports to be taken down, reexamined and, where appropriate, acted on.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome the interim report of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment.  It echoes the comments of William Beveridge in his famous book, <i>Full Employment in a Free Society</i>, in which he states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1616" /> Unemployment cannot be conquered by a democracy until it is understood by them.  Full productive employment in a free society is possible but it is not possible without taking pains; it cannot be won by waving a financial wand; it is a goal that can be reached only by conscious organisation of all our productive resources under democratic control.  To win full employment and keep it, we must will the end and must understand and will the means.</P>
    <P>On the publication of this report we have at last embarked on the route pointed to by William Beveridge in 1944, the creation of a third force in the social economy.  This report is based on the NESF report, <i>Ending Long Term Unemployment</i>, published last June.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the Leader of the Labour Party, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, who took the decision to proceed with the central recommendation, the establishment of an intensive local employment service.  The key recommendation of the report is that such a service be set up as a gateway to a variety of options such as training, education and job placement for the long term unemployed.  I am delighted the Ministers, Deputies Richard Bruton and Gay Mitchell, have taken the project on board and have ministerial responsibility in the 12 partnership areas and two non-partnership areas.  As the report recommended, the programme is aimed at the four priority groups, the registered long term unemployed, those unemployed for more than six months, dependant spouses and lone parents and 18 to 21 year olds.</P>
    <P>It is a source of great pride to me that the local employment service was pioneered in Coolock on the northside of Dublin.  In the last ten or 15 years there has been a unique coalescing of the social welfare partners, local community organisations, employers, trade unions and other local interests resulting in the Northside Partnership which has a successful record and which is now the first contact point in the country.  I pay <Col N="1617" /> special tribute to the Chairman of the Northside Partnership, my colleague, Padraic White, former Director of the IDA, and the Director, Ms Marian Vickers who very successfully presided over the development of this service on the northside of Dublin in the last four years or so.  As Padraic White remarked yesterday on radio, when he came to work for the people of Coolock he noticed it was a heavily industrialised zone with hundreds of factories, yet there were estates with up to 70 per cent unemployment.  He set about remedying this problem and, together with Marian Vickers, set in motion a process of positive discrimination in favour of the long term unemployed.  With well over 600 placements in real jobs, he has achieved a great deal for the northside of Dublin, particularly the Coolock area.</P>
    <P>The cost in terms of human suffering and misery as well as the financial cost of the long term unemployed, as outlined particularly in the appendix to the report, is totally unacceptable.  In October 1994 there were 273,000 people unemployed, 133,000 of whom had been unemployed for more than 12 months and 67,000 for more than three years. Much of the devastation, social deprivation and crime fuelled by drugs can be traced back to this problem.  As my colleague, Deputy Lynch, said, sometimes politicians lose their sense of moral outrage at this state of affairs.  I am glad that we are now taking the first steps towards dealing with the problem.</P>
    <P>One of the key points referred to in the report is the indictment on our education system that up to 20 per cent of people leave school without qualifications. This plays a key role in the increase in long term unemployment.  I welcome the training and education proposals in the report, particularly the determination to provide a certified educational qualification to every man and woman who takes part in the local employment service.  It proposes setting up through the mediation service in contact points, a system of progression which will allow for access to third level education for people without basic skills <Col N="1618" />&mdash; I particularly welcome the focus on 18 to 21 year olds.</P>
    <P>The report rightly looks for links, as we have done on the northside, between local employers, schools and the universities. I am unhappy with the links between our three Dublin universities, Dublin City University, TCD and UCD. In a couple of days' time we will celebrate St. Patrick's Day.  A few years ago I remember TCD talking in terms of town and gown in this city, but we have never had this type of necessary interaction between our universities.</P>
    <P>Another key feature of the report is that unemployment impacts mostly on Dublin.  Much humbug is talked in this House about the problem in other regions, yet a labour force survey in 1991 shows that Dublin is the second worst region in terms of unemployment, with 107 per cent of the national average compared to 89 per cent in the south and 79 per cent in the west.  Dublin is the deprived and neglected region&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil had seven years to do so but unfortunately it did nothing about the problem.  The appendix to the report points out that 38 per cent of overall employment in this State is in the three Dublin regions, north, west and south, which encompasses many of the areas Dublin Deputies represent. Dubliners are no longer prepared to accept that.  Nearly 50 Deputies are now speaking as a united group so that Dublin will no longer be discriminated against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the £6 million allocated in the budget to begin to remedy the terrible disease of unemployment which impacts so badly on our city.  I welcome the central thrust of the report and look forward to the new common logo of the contact points, not just in Dublin but <Col N="1619" /> across the country which will at last provide a basic approach to full employment which must be our economic pariority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming the interim report of the Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment. It focuses attention on the difficulties faced by the long term unemployed and puts forward recommendations and suggestions as to how best we can intervene to break the cycle of long term unemployment and return people to the workforce where they have a more meaningful quality of life.</P>
      <P>Primarily I will address the sections dealing with education but in passing, by agreement with our spokesperson on enterprise and employment, Deputy O'Rourke, I will develop the point she made that we must be careful about embarking down the road where we have a plethora of bodies with responsibility for employment generation in a given area.  The north Lee area partnership board has been extended to embrace areas on the south side of the city.  We also have the enterprise board, the vocational education committee, whose offices are playing an important role on these boards and in other areas, Forbairt and in rural areas there are Leader projects.  We have to be careful that the same people are not running around to different meetings, all talking the same language.  There is a tendency for that to happen and I am worried about that danger.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of a local employment service is fine but I am worried that we may have a duplication of effort.  Once we identify the fundamental structural problems that have given rise to long term unemployment, essentially it is a matter of allocating resources to the agreed interventionist methods.  For example if it is agreed that early school leaving is a problem or that lack of achievement in the school system is a contributory factor to long term unemployment &mdash; and all the evidence confirms there is a strong correlation <Col N="1620" /> between early school leaving and those in the ranks of the long term unemployed &mdash; we must put the resources into this area.  As Deputy Broughan has remarked it is an indictment of our system that 20 per cent leave school without the leaving certificate.  That is unacceptable.  If we agree that this is a fundamental issue we already have the structures in place to deal with it but resources are required.</P>
    <P>The early start programme was initiated in eight centres last year and will increase to 33 by the end of this year.  That is only the tip of the iceberg. What we need is a national system of pre-school education.  It is incontrovertible that a proper pre-school programme would have a remarkable impact on the educational achievements of young people and generations to come and greatly increase their capacity to achieve at second level.  The task force report talks about establishing pilot pre-schools in certain disadvantaged areas.  We already have the early start programme but prior to that the health boards had established pre-school programmes and in some areas the early start programme was a duplication of that service.  The understanding is that the health boards will draw back on their involvement in such provision. In Churchville in Cork there was a health board pre-school staffed by AMI Montessori teachers in existence but adjacent to it the early start programme was established.  The AMI Montessori teachers' qualification is recognised by the Department of Education as indicating a particular expertise in infant education but they are debarred from participating in the early start programme and they may now lose their jobs.  I would oppose any moves to set up a third tier of pre-school education. I suggest we accept the principle that pre-school education is essential and then create one national model and fund it in a comprehensive manner.</P>
    <P>The home-school teacher liaison scheme has been a great success but is not uniformly available throughout the country.  We should provide extra <Col N="1621" /> resources for it.  Instead of creating new boards, new local bodies and ploughing money into administration, we should provide extra resources for the system that is in place.  Likewise for remedial teaching and extra resource teachers in certain areas.  My argument is that we have the structures in place to deal with most of the issues that have been raised in the task force report but we require the resources to drive these programmes forward and increase their capacity.</P>
    <P>The task force report recommends that a local training and education fund should be available to the local employment service to enable it to arrange pre and post VTOS support which is administered by the educational system and in many ways is doing a fine job.  Considerable expertise had already been built up.  As chairman of the City of Cork vocational education committee I am familiar with the excellent VTOS scheme in Coláiste Stiofáin Naofa on the Tramore Road and the teachers administering the scheme have built up expertise and experience in dealing with it.  I suggest that it would make far greater sense to allocate the additional resources at one's disposal to the existing VTOS scheme and allow the school or college to become the centre in that locality for the operation of VTOS. That could mean providing counselling and advice services and a guidance service in terms of the pre and post VTOS course.  If you created a new body the officials who administer it will ring up the school to talk to the person in charge of the VTOS scheme to arrange to do things.  The obvious thing is to directly ask the person who is doing that already.  There is a danger that there will be a duplication of effort with too many people running around trying to carve out a niche for themselves.  The infrastructure is in place and we require the resources to enable that infrastructure to provide the services and intervention that is necessary to help to assist those who are long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>On the question of linkages between colleges and the local community, I am <Col N="1622" /> conscious of the BITE programme in Ballymun which operates under the auspices of DCU and is administered by a management board.  That is an excellent model which could be followed throughout the country by other universities and third level colleges.</P>
    <P>These colleges should look at what is happening in DCU in Ballymun in terms of linking in with feeder primary and second level schools in a catchment area where up to now participation in third level has not been what it should be.  The objective of the programme is to provide educational and financial assistance to students at primary and secondary level to enable them become greater achievers, complete the leaving certificate course and then go on to third level education.  They reserve a quota of places for students to attend the DCU.</P>
    <P>A model exists where a particular university has brought about an interventional strategy to help students change their attitudes and look at third level education as another option.  In many cases students do not consider completing second level as an option never mind attending third level.  The BITE programme is a good model which could easily be replicated if the necessary resources were made available directly to the providers of such a programme.  We could do that without much duplication of effort or the necessity to appoint an administrator.  I strongly recommend it.</P>
    <P>While early intervention is critical, at a recent seminar in Trinity College, Barry Keogh stated we must help those attending second level who, up to now, would not have looked at third level as an option.  We need to develop strategies which will assist such students to look at participation in third level education as a realistic option.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment in the report to 18-21 year olds.  No young person should leave school without having the possibility of being placed on a course or in employment.  I welcome the youth start programme.  The Minister at the Department of Enterprise and <Col N="1623" /> Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, was responsible for initiating that programme and bringing it forward.  Society stands indicated when the first experience of a young person leaving school is the dole queue.  Our objective should be to provide a more constructive option for a young person through education or employment.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that there is no mention in the report of the PLC structure. Some 17,000 students attend these courses.  It has been a most exciting innovation in education.  Much of it emanated from local initiative which is the hallmark of this report and of the National Economic and Social Forum. The PLC system was driven by principals and teachers who had the courage of their convictions, who developed new curricula and courses with little by way of resources and backup.  The courses are well suited to the market place and many of them lead to employment.  If the PLC structure had not developed where would those 17,000 young people be now?  I suggest that many of them would be unemployed.  I am surprised that there is no emphasis on the PLC system in the report.  This is an area which could be looked at again as it has a significant contribution to make towards breaking the cycle of long term unemployment.  Extra resources must be provided for this area.  Many of the schools involved are second level schools which are becoming third level colleges but do not have the same level of resources, equipment or facilities.</P>
    <P>The community employment programme is a relaunch of the old social employment scheme, the main difference being the education provision within that programme.  The programme needs to be reviewed, in particular its training dimension.  Some areas are experiencing difficulty with this programme. Cork Corporation has not been in a position to fill the 250 places available to it and Cork County Council is experiencing similar problems.  That suggests there are some anomalies <Col N="1624" /> within the scheme which render it unattractive to the unemployed.  It must be looked at again.</P>
    <P>VTOS is an excellent programme and some schools have developed expertise in that area.  However, its linkage with employment must be reviewed.  What happens to students when they complete the course?  Perhaps those involved in compiling this report or the Forum report could carry out an initial analysis on the operation of VTOS to date and ascertain the views of students on how they see the scheme, the difficulties involved in it and where they see themselves going when they complete the courses and so on.</P>
    <P>There have been welcome changes in social welfare payments which enable students to attend third level education and still receive their allowances.  That is commendable.  However, there is need for someone to promote such programmes and give greater advice and assistance to potential participants. There should be a greater link between the Departments of Education and Social Welfare.  At present, the Department of Social Welfare looks after a particular aspect of the programme and the Department of Education looks after another.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report.  While it was announced that the area of partnership is being extended to Cork, we have the spectacle of 100 jobs being lost in the Sunbeam factory.  There was a certain paradox in Government Ministers coming to my city, saying they would initiate measures with a potential for 7,000 or 8,000 jobs, on the same weekend when approximately 100 families in Cork were beginning to experience the reality of unemployment.  There is a fundamental double-think by the State in that area since an amount of £300,000 or £400,000 of working capital could have kept that factory going in the location where the area-based partnership was being established. The fact that these programmes are launched alongside very significant closures of factories, such as Sunbeam in Cork, Silverlea in Athlone does <Col N="1625" /> nothing for public confidence or credibility. Rather it creates a certain sense of unreality in the efficiency of these programmes and a certain degree of cynicism on the part of the public.  Yet we know that is not the intention of those who want to launch these initiatives or programmes.</P>

      <P>There was discussion last evening on the reduction in the State grant provision for non-national roads from £107 million to £103 million, when the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Allen, was about to explain how that constituted an increase.  Will he inform us how that could possibly constitute an increase, an explanation to which all mathematicians look forward? All our constituents using county roads will be extremely interested to learn how there could have been an increase in such funds from £107 million to £103 million.</P>

      <P>I was shocked at the Government's reduction of 4 per cent, from £107 million to £103 million for county road programmes for 1995, a significant reduction which does not make any provision for inflation.  This has come as a bombshell to Fianna Fáil and people living in rural areas, as our commitment to the improvement of county roads has been proved.  In former Governments Fianna Fáil increased the grant for county roads from £32 million in 1986 to £107 million in 1994.  The county road funds grants for Kerry were increased from £2 million under the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government in 1986-1987 to £5.220 million under the Fianna Fáil-controlled Government of 1994.  I am astounded at the 20 per cent plus reduction in these grants for Kerry in 1995.</P>
      <P>I want to refer in particular to the position in County Kerry, the fifth largest county, being placed sixth in the <i>per capita</i> league nationwide but, as far as rate support grants are concerned, figures 16th only in the national league. Other major factors which render County Kerry severely handicapped as far as the provision of funds for county roads is concerned are the low effective rateable valuations in the county compared with other counties, such as Clare &mdash; although I have nothing against the people of County Clare &mdash; which benefits from a rates income of approximately £6 million from the ESB alone. In County Kerry there are 2,500 miles of county roads in an extraordinarily bad state of repair, thus a reduction of over 20 per cent in the total grant allocation for non-national roads in 1995 is a disaster.</P>

    <P>Apart from the very low rate support grant, the impact on the low, effective rateable valuations is very serious as County Kerry does not have the larger industrial projects on which huge <Col N="1628" /> amounts of rates can be collected, it is dependent on a low valuation base for rates, on service charges &mdash; water, sewerage and domestic refuse collection charges &mdash; to make up the shortfall in running all the county's services annually, including the maintenance, repair and improvement works on county roads, including resurface dressing.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware that the roads in County Kerry and other counties in the west were not built to cater for the weight and volume of traffic they now carry and will continue to carry to the year 2000 and beyond.  It is commonplace now to see trucks carrying total loads of up to 40 or 50 tonnes on such roads.  This means that Kerry County Council and other local authorities may have to abandon some of their county roads, thus all the money spent since 1987-88 will be wasted because of the lack of maintenance funds.</P>
    <P>Kerry County Council increased its already high allocation for county roads by £100,000 in its Estimate for 1995 in anticipation of obtaining a substantial increase in funding from the Department of the Environment, the former a clear indication of the commitment of county councillors and management to the improvement and maintenance of county roads.  I have no doubt that the proposal contained in the last paragraph of the amendment to this motion &mdash; for an integrated plan to achieve the necessary improvements over the next ten years &mdash; will be viewed with bewilderment on the part of users of county roads.  How can one ask people whose cars are being damaged and broken daily on these county roads to wait ten years for necessary repair and improvement works.</P>
    <P>This Coalition Government started off badly as far as people in rural areas are concerned.  I call on the Minister and Government to refund the road tax collected in County Kerry, and every other county, to the relevant local authorities, thus enabling them to embark on a realistic scheme of repairs, improvement and surface dressing of our county <Col N="1629" /> roads at present in such a bad state.  The reduction in the rates support grant for county roads and non-national roads has been one of the bombshells of the latest budget and is viewed with dismay in rural areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to share my time with Deputies Connaughton, Lynch and Finucane.</P>
      <P>This is a good political motion tabled by Fianna Fáil.  I commend it on availing of this opportunity to highlight what all Members have drawn to the attention of the Minister for the Environment.  I spent all day on Monday listening to the same rigmarole by Fianna Fáil members of our local authority comparing last year's allocation with that for this year, not a fair comparison because the initial allocation for my constituency last year was smaller than the present one, one I consider an initial one.  When the Minister decided this allocation he based it on an estimate prepared by an outgoing Fianna Fáil-Labour Administration which had set in train an estimate less than required and that for which Deputy John O'Leary has been asking. I have no objection to Deputy O'Leary seeking additional funds because his request will assist us in our efforts to ensure that these funds are increased.</P>
      <P>In spite of that initial allocation last year we were fortunate to have received an additional allocation towards the end of last year for two reasons: one was the European elections for which we received an additional £5 million or £6 million, the second an allocation of £20 million from the tax amnesty; they were over and above the initial allocation of the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith.  Altogether we received an excellent contribution from the Exchequer for local authority works last year.  Yet, in spite of one of the largest allocations ever, our roads are in a disastrous condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Money is not the answer to the problem. There must be a planned programme in which money will be set aside over some years specifically to improve county roads.  That work does <Col N="1630" /> not simply involve filling potholes here and there at the political persuasion of members of local authorities at their meetings dealing with roads.  Our constituents are complaining about the condition of non-national roads.  Filling in the potholes is the political answer to the problem, but it is not the solution.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, with his Cabinet colleagues will properly structure a programme to address the condition of those roads which are important to all of us.  They are important to the farming community, the business community and rural Ireland.  Having regard to how they link into the national primary routes and the allocation for county roads from the National Roads Authority which is not responsible to this House or the Minister for any of its decisions, we must have a planned approach to address the problem of county roads.  We may need to take an unpopular decision of allocating specific funds through specific taxation, perhaps additional taxation on petrol which would affect all motor vehicle users.  We may have to ringfence money from a specific tax and use it to repair the roads at the discretion of the Minister for the Environment and his Department thereby diverting it from the Department of Finance, a procedure to which that Department would no doubt object.</P>
    <P>In 1994 State assistance to local authorities for non-national roads in my constituency was paid in the form of discretionary grants.  That means that local authorities make specific allocations out of their resources to maintain roads in their areas.  If a member of a council wishes to check the contribution of their area to road funding, whether it be Kerry, Tipperary, Westmeath or another county, they will find that some counties made an effort through local authority resources to invest a reasonable amount of money in non-national routes.  My local authority area invested £1.4 million in non-national routes last year.  That was in addition to the discretionary grants from the Department. <Col N="1631" /> The result was that we had a reasonable input in county roads at local level in that we could spend funds and not be directed and dictated to by officials of central Government who always endeavour to influence either an engineering section or local authority members as to how money is spent.  I am aware that EU co-financed grants are available for county roads.  That was dealt with by the Minister in his statement which addressed the public recognition of this problem.  I have called on my colleague, the Minister, in this regard.  He made a major impact in the Department of Health in an area of specific need when he was Minister for Health.  At that time rather than allocate funds which could have been lost in health boards, he identified that a specific job had to be undertaken and entered a contract with consultants.  As a result, additional hip replacement and other vital operations for which people were on waiting lists for many years were carried out.  I have no doubt that the Minister, Deputy Howlin, will adopt a planned approach to this problem because, as we are aware, throwing money at it is not the answer.</P>
    <P>Rural Ireland is devastated because of the recent bad weather which did not result from our having a rainbow coalition or because we had a change in Government, it was determined by the Lord above.  We must respond to the problem.  Obviously the Exchequer was not aware that we would have bad weather conditions so it could not have budgeted for the present problems.  I am not criticising the previous Government in this regard, but it reduced the Estimates for the Department of the Environment and we have had to retrieve those funds from the Department of Finance similar to the manner in which all Departments seek such funds.  I am not satisfied with the allocation for county roads but I am confident that there will be an increase in the funding and I have no doubt that all Deputies on this side of the House will co-operate with the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to <Col N="1632" /> ensure that rural Ireland is not forgotten in the allocation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Fianna Fáil motion with a grain of salt.  I do not deny that the money provided this year for the repair and reconstruction of county roads is not enough.  It goes without saying that it is not sufficient.  The £102 million made available for roads is the second highest allocation in the history of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>A speaker last night said it was the highest allocation ever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The highest allocation for roads was made last year and this is the second highest.  Last year £15 million of the tax amnesty was added to the allocation for roads.  The tax amnesty was a once off, non-recurring nest-egg.  The Exchequer allocation for roads is considerable.  This year it is approximately £10 million higher than previous allocations with the exception of last year's nest-egg to which I referred, but it is still not enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I represent a rural constituency, it would be foolhardy for me to say that enough money has been allocated for roads.  Roads have been underfunded for many years by successive Governments. I am not pointing the finger at any particular Administration.  Fianna Fáil Deputies and others realise that has been the position for the past ten to 15 years.  The people who live in the heartland of rural Ireland have a nightmare existence traversing roads which, in some cases, are no better than those in Bosnia or Ethiopia.  Can anyone in this House blame any householder, businessman, farmer or schoolchild who is frustrated, angry and depressed because of the conditions of roads outside their houses?  Many families in rural Ireland travel mostly on county roads, probably for 80 per cent of their journeys. Only very few would spend much time on the major traffic routes.  It is obvious that the level of funding for roads during the past ten years has been insufficient.  Two years ago a county <Col N="1633" /> engineer said that given the level of funding for county roads for the previous few years he would expect it would be 37 years before a road tarred this year would be tarred again.  That is the type of investment that has been made in our county roads during the years.  Poor county roads attract great local interest, but the impact at national level is a good deal less visible.  Is that because the majority of people living in cities and towns are used to somewhat better road surfaces and the condition of county roads does not attract national attention?  The issue may not be a sexy enough matter to catch the national imagination.  It has come to the stage that rural Deputies had best raise the matter on the agenda quickly because there will be a networking effect in relation to this matter in rural communities from Galway to Cork and in Monaghan, Cavan and other counties who do not like what they see.</P>
    <P>I find it inconceivable that in the context of European funds that will be available through various operational programmes over the next five years that a sizeable tranche of the money cannot be made available for an improved road structure.  The Fianna Fáil motion is pure hypocrisy and opportunistic because Fianna Fáil members, more than other Deputies, are aware of the position.  I understand a top level committee in the Department of the Environment is considering this matter.  I, like Deputy Ferris, do not doubt that if the Minister were given half a chance he could address this problem. I am sure the Government would back him.  It is important that we show the people of Ireland what is required in this regard, the bad condition of our roads, how much money will be needed during the next five years to repair them and where we will get that money.  The important question is who will bell the cat.  There has not been a single word from Fianna Fáil about where one is likely to find the extra money.  Since it could not be found while Fianna Fáil was in Government for the past eight <Col N="1634" /> years, it would be difficult to expect them to find it in Opposition.  All we have is a crumbling road structure.  I accept that criticism will not fill the potholes. We will have to do better.  No matter what we do over the next five years it will be better than what went before.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about how to increase the funding now that £100 million is not sufficient.  There was mention of a surcharge on petrol and diesel.  As a nation we must accept that we have a national crisis in regard to county roads. If we get to the stage of levying a few pence per gallon on petrol and diesel two things must be done.  First, it must be used precisely for the reason it is levied. Second, and more important &mdash; I do not know how this can be written in red ink in the Department of Finance &mdash; it cannot be used as a substitute for money which the Exchequer should be putting in.  It will always have to be a topping up fund.  A sum of £100 million will not solve our problem in any one year, it will have to be substantially more.  If the public is given those guarantees, it would go along with it.</P>
    <P>We have a national emergency.  Old practices and remedies did not and will not fix deteriorating county roads.  We have to seek value for money.  There has been no shortage of evaluations through the years as to how the money was spent.  On a cost of benefit analysis it appears everything is OK.  I doubt that. We should get better value for money and I hope the investigation being carried out by the committee will reveal more about that.  I cannot understand the reason participants in the social employment scheme cannot perform small tasks such as reducing the water tables of the small roads of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope we come to grips with this problem.  The motion before the House is purely for point scoring purposes.  It will not fill a single pothole. I want to see more road mileage of tar and chips in order that people in rural Ireland will be proud of where they live.</P>

      <P>The motion, as proposed by Deputy Dempsey, has my sympathy.  It is difficult to adjust to being in Opposition.  Fianna Fáil look like a party in need of bereavement counselling.  The Fianna Fáil Party did not lose power as such, rather it was whipped from their hands.  In the words of their Leader: &ldquo;I had it in my hands one minute and it was not there the next.  It seemed to vanish&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to speak about county roads or rural roads but about the roads which I and Deputy Liam Burke know only too well &mdash; the roads in Cork city. Last year the quilt exhibition came to Cork.  It had been advertised far and wide and announced well in advance. The majority of visitors coming to the city thought it was held in Olive Plunkett Street.  They stood there in their droves and looked at the road and said it definitely resembled a patchwork quilt, as does every other street in the city.</P>
      <P>Following my election I recall walking up the steps for a vote.  A Minister of State in both the former Government and in the present Government walking up behind me said: &ldquo;My God, the roads in Cork are terrible&rdquo;.  I turned around and looked at him with bemusement and said: &ldquo;Yes, they are.  Did it take a by-election to tell you that?  Had you not been told up to this?&rdquo;  They are not in an appalling state because of this Government.  They have been getting into that state for the past ten years.  We do not have potholes, we have trenches. We have trench warfare.  The end of Oliver Plunkett Street is a trench.  This is the street by which the majority of people going to Dublin leave the city. Deputy Liam Burke is smiling, he knows how to avoid it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should take a look at how Cork city has been treated in the past ten years in relation to road funding.  Grants for the years 1985-94 to Cork Corporation for non-national roads fell from £1.99 million to £1.2 million.  For most of that time Fianna Fáil was in Government. Even if the allocation for this year <Col N="1636" /> was doubled it still would not be sufficient because we have to deal with a backlog.  The manner in which roads have been neglected is frightening.</P>
    <P>We have been calculating how much funding local authorities get and the amount of road they have to look after. Everyone knows that county councils have much longer stretches of road, but city roads get greater usage and need more repair.  We need to address that problem and to discriminate in favour of areas of greatest use which are in need of greater maintenance.  A matter which needs to be addressed immediately is that £24 million is allocated to new road development on the south side of Cork city while only £600,000 has been allocated to the north side.  I will be making representations to the Minister on that issue in my own capacity. Our sympathies should be with Deputy Dempsey, for whom I suggest bereavement counselling.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to dwell on the statistical data or draw comparisons with previous years.  That has been elaborated on sufficiently by previous speakers.  The motion is opportunistic on the basis that the Government has been in power only for three months. Fianna Fáil was in power continuously for seven years.  The problem in our counties where there are discussions, meetings, petitions and so on is putting much pressure on politicians.  Similar meetings took place last year and as a result of pressure additional funding was provided.  At that time people were threatening not to vote in the European elections because of the condition of the roads.  There is no point dwelling on history, but I would like the Government's performance to be assessed at the end of this year in the same way as was the previous Government's performance at <Col N="1637" /> the end of last year in terms of the funding allocated.  I have no doubt the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, is committed to improving the condition of county roads.  There are similar problems in Wexford.</P>
      <P>We are all exposed to pressure at county council meetings and naturally the Opposition will oppose.  I anticipate that at the next meeting of Limerick County Council councillors from the Opposition parties will lash the present Administration.  However, it is very important to put the issue into perspective. Many of the problems have been caused because roads are no longer able to sustain the increased volume of traffic on them.  This year Limerick County Council provided an extra £1.3 million for county roads.  I hope the Department of the Environment will recognise this increased allocation by topping up the amount given to the council.  The council has to raise this additional funding through local service charges.  I would like to think recognition would be given by the Department to the sacrifices which had to be made to raise this finance.</P>
      <P>Recently 200 people attended a meeting about county roads.  When the sumps of cars are damaged, tyres are punctured etc., it is only natural that people's emotions run high and that there are calls for improvements to be made to the roads.  The Minister stated that desperate diseases require desperate remedies and it may be necessary for him to top up the funding given to councils.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local communities also have a responsibility in regard to roads maintenance. One of the major problems is caused by water flowing from land onto the roads.  This may be due to neglect by the owners of the land.  The people on the community enterprise development programme in Limerick are applying themselves to their task and engineers can now say that not alone will the roads be repaired but drainage will also be carried out.  I hope this type of work will be expanded.  Some of the problems have been created by successive <Col N="1638" /> Governments who gave redundancy packages to outdoor workers leading to a reduction in the work force.</P>
    <P>The Minister asked county councils to submit proposals to him.  The programme he intends to develop will put forward recommendations on the strategies which should be adopted to ensure a proper road network in each county.  This could be achieved within a number of years.  I look forward to the provision of extra funding later this year to improve the road network.  I hope we will eventually be able to solve the problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  The condition of county and regional roads causes problems for all of us whether we are in Government or Opposition.  I was amused and somewhat annoyed that Opposition Deputies should put down this motion when their party in Government did not use the funding under INTERREG as additional but rather as an alternative to Exchequer funding. The problem started with them.  I am disappointed that the funding under INTERREG II is not additional.  I accept that Cavan and Monaghan have benefited to some extent this year but I should have liked £1.1 million under INTERREG to have been additional, which the European Union meant it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputies opposite are being very hypocritical in putting down this motion.  Last year the then Minister told us that the tax amnesty money was a once off which it could not be repeated this year.  The Government has managed to come within a few million pounds of the amount provided last year and we are only at the start of the year. It was not until very late last year that Monaghan County Council knew that its budget would be £3.7 million, £400,000 of which was specifically for cross-Border roads.  I am not happy that sufficient funding has been allocated to Cavan and Monaghan county councils which have to deal with extraordinary problems such as drumlin soil etc.  I will <Col N="1639" /> continue to make this case, whether in Government or Opposition, until this problem is rectified.  Playing stroke politics will not achieve this.  We need to work together to ensure that county roads are improved and that the Ministers for Finance and the Environment provide the necessary funding to keep people in rural Ireland.  If this is not done in a few years even more people will be living within a few miles of Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment must look seriously at the provision of proper funding for county roads on a long-term basis.  The poultry, mushroom and dairy farms in County Monaghan have to use these minor roads if they want to stay in business and create jobs. We want proper funding and I am satisfied that the Government will provide this over the next two and a half years.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this motion and congratulate the Fianna Fáil Front Bench and Deputy Dempsey for tabling it.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from listening to Government speakers that we are all singing from the same hymn book.  If I was Minister for the Environment or, indeed, any Government Minister listening to the debate, I would be concerned about the contributions from Government backbenchers because they have been restrained in what they said.  The frustration and annoyance coming to the surface in regard to some of the contributions is abundantly clear, particularly tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a time when every local authority is screaming for additional funding for the maintenance and upkeep of their county road network, the Government has decreased funding in all but one case.  Having regard to our recent <Col N="1640" /> weather &mdash; when our county road network was devastated by flooding, frost, and snow &mdash; and the increasing number of vehicles using the roads, it is disgraceful that a Minister should notify a local authority of a decrease in its funding.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil's attitude to this debate has been criticised.  I compliment our Front Bench, it would have been wrong of them not to highlight the problem now.  It must be highlighted and the Government might as well prepare itself because it will hear a great deal more about this problem.  Up to now county councillors &mdash; many of whom are Members of this House &mdash; have been fobbing off constituents who complain of poor road conditions and potholes, saying they are waiting for grants from the Department of the Environment and when they arrive they may be in a position to deal with the problems. There are no excuses now for any Government Deputy, Senator, county councillor or urban councillor to say they are waiting for funding as it has been made available.  However, it is not enough to maintain our county road system and some county roads will have to be abandoned.</P>
    <P>One of the most disturbing aspects of this problem is the plight of road workers, with whom I sympathise.  The outdoor working staff complement in Carlow County Council has been reduced from 150 in 1986 to a little more than 70 at present.  A number of county councils are receiving only sufficient funding to enable them to maintain their existing workforces.  There is no money available for the purchase of materials or the purchase or hire of plant.  We will soon reach the stage when county council workers will be out with their shovels cleaning the drains and cutting the hedges while motorists drive past trying to avoid the potholes. Those workers will be subject to odium and unfair criticism from everybody using the roads.  It is not their fault the roads are not repaired, the buck stops at the Minister's door.  County managers, engineers and so on cannot produce the goods unless they have the funding.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1641" /> The bottom line is that the Government proposed an 8 per cent increase in Government spending in the budget while at the same time reduced road grants to local authorities by up to 25 per cent.  The Government cannot blame the National Roads Authority. The funding comes directly from the Department of the Environment and the problem must be resolved by the Minister.  The National Roads Authority has been unfairly criticised about the national road grant allocations, but that authority cannot function properly unless it is provided with sufficient funding from the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers spoke about the problems associated with creating, manufacturing and maintaining new national primary routes.  While millions of pounds are being spent on a network of national primary roads, many county roads a few hundred yards from those magnificent routes are unfit for use.  It is not good enough for a Minister or member of the Government to say they have done their best.  It is not good enough in this case and the matter can be resolved only by providing an increase in the allocation for county roads and, in fairness to local authorities, sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Our national and non-national road grant allocations come too late in the year.  Most county councils budget for a certain amount of spending early in the year and by the time the national and non-national road grants are made available they have overspent.</P>
    <P>If Government speakers were honest they would vote for this motion. However, as they cannot do that they must look into their hearts on this issue because it will not end with this debate tonight.  This is only the start.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion.  I also welcome the support from the benches opposite.  If a newspaper reporter was present he or she could only report on a Government backbench revolt over road funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister tried every trick in the <Col N="1642" /> trade to defend the budget.  The figures were juggled in many ways by his officials, who are good at that.  Last year we received an allocation of £107 million and this year it will be £103 million, including £8 million from INTERREG funding, making a total of £95 million. With the exception of the three Dublin county councils &mdash; who received substantial increases &mdash; all county councils received a reduction in road funding but those with the biggest complaint are the six counties on the southern side of the Border who were waiting patiently for INTERREG funding and who do not have discretion in spending the £1.1 million.  The roads to be repaired will be selected by the Department.  There was a reduction from £3.7 million to £3.5 million in Monaghan and from £4.64 million to £4.08 million in Cavan.  Both counties will suffer because they do not have discretion in regard to INTERREG funding.</P>
    <P>Deputy Crawford and I were members of a subcommittee of a British-Irish Parliamentary Body that travelled to Brussels last year when we pointed out to Bruce Millan that roads were an essential part of our infrastructure. Many questions were raised about whether this involved additionality.  I asked him if he was satisfied that the Government &mdash; the Fianna Fáil-Labour Coalition &mdash; was complying with the additionality clause and he assured me it was.  If he had the figures that I now have in front of me he would certainly change his opinion about additionality in 1995.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister gave us details of allocations.  In 1983 Monaghan County Council received £470,000 for non-national roads; the following year it received £439,000; in 1985 it received £599,000 and in 1986 it received £538,000.  Fianna Fáil returned to power in 1987 and immediately doubled the allocation to £1.08 million.  The following year the allocation was almost £1 million.  In 1989 it was £1.2 million, in 1990 £1.8 million, in 1991 £2.3 million and in 1992 £2.4 million.  That is the record.  Compare that with the four <Col N="1643" /> years when the last Coalition was in office and we see that is when the damage was done to the roads infrastructure because of inadequate funding.  In 1987 we inherited the problem of potholed roads.</P>
    <P>From 1986 to 1990 Fianna Fáil, the Government at the time, increased the allocation 400 per cent.  From 1986 to 1992, Fianna Fáil, with the Progressive Democrats, increased the allocation 500 per cent over the 1986 figure.  In 1994 Deputy Michael Smith was criticised because of the allocation he gave. However, in announcing the 1994 round of grants in the Slieve Russell Hotel he said he was not prepared to provide £12 million for filling potholes but that the county council would have to draw up a programme of road drainage and strengthening which would be acceptable to the Department and if they did that he would guarantee them six years of additional funding to carry out the work.  The officials and councillors on both Cavan and Monaghan County Councils responded to his proposals by selecting small county roads where farmers and other road users removed the water, cut the hedges, cleaned the drains and provided the diggers to dig trenches for pipes.  We complied with the Minister's request.  It is regrettable that we now find the substitution of INTERREG funding for the normal funding.</P>
    <P>We put forward a comprehensive plan to the Minister for Health for a health centre in the grounds of Monaghan hospital which was acceptable to him.  When Deputy Michael Smith was there, we asked him about funding and he undertook to provide money for an inner relief road in the town which would facilitate entry to the health centre. I have a letter to the effect that the recently published operational programme for transport provided the framework for investment in national roads over the period 1994-99 but that, <Col N="1644" /> having regard to the overall level of funding available for national roads generally, and the many competing demands, it would not be possible to include the inner relief road among the projects.  This was a serious disappointment because it brings into question a large development in which I was deeply involved with other health board members.  Deputy Howlin was a good Minister for Health and I believe he will deliver on this health centre, it will be a serious blow if he does not.</P>
    <P>After the publication of the Book of Estimates I raised the question of the cutbacks in housing aid for the elderly which was reduced by 50 per cent.  At that time we were told that the increase was once-off.  Tonight we are told that the money from the tax amnesty was also a once-off.  I have no doubt but that we are looking at a once-off Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I dtús mo thréimhse mar Theachta Dála, b'é an rud ba mhó a bhí ag teastáil ná go gcuirfí barr cruaidh nó tarra ar bhóithre nach raibh ach gaineamh orthu sa chuid is mó.  Tar éis deich mbliain nó mar sin i ndiaidh an tarrála, bhí &ldquo;potholes&rdquo; ag teacht sna bóithrí sin, ach ní <Col N="1645" /> raibh aon phlean ceart i bhfeidhm in aon chontae chun obair dheisiúcháin nó ath-tharráil a dhéanamh de réir mar a bhí ag teastáil chun caoi cheart a choinneáil ar bharr na mbóithre.  Ar feadh na mblianta níl aon ligint suas ar na gearáin faoi droch-staid na mbóithre seo agus níl aon suim airgid a chuireas leigheas ar an scéal seo go brách muna bhfuil clár rialta cúram ceart á choinneáil ar na bóithre de bharr an aimsir fhliuch a bhíonn againn ar feadh na bliana ar fad agus an sioc a thagann sa gheimhreadh; agus an méadú ar thrácht ar na bóithre seo.  De réir an méid atá feicthe agamsa ar feadh na mblianta, séard atá ag teastáil go coitianta ná craiceann nua a chur ar na bóithre contae gach deich mbliain ar a laghad.</P>
    <P>Is mór an náire nach bhfuil na comhairlí contae in ann cúram ceart a thabhairt dos na bóithre contae trí chlár rialta a bheith á chur i bhfeidhm acu agus dá bharr, tá an dea-obair a rinneadh ag suncáil na billiúin punt ag tarráil na bóithre seo an chéad lá riamh á chaitheamh san aer de bharr easpa cúraim orthu.</P>
    <P>Is scannalach an rud é go bhfuil Airí Rialtais, bainisteoirí contae agus innealltóirí contae ar ard phá ag caitheamh an súil dall leis na blianta fada ar an méid billiúin punt atá curtha amú de bharr easpa pleanála i leith cúram na mbóithre contae, ar a bhfuil suas le 55,000 de mhíle bóithre sa tír seo.  Dar liomsa, tá faillí mhór déanta ag Airí Rialtais le 20 bliain anuas, nuair nár chomhlíon siad an dualgas a bhí orthu breathnú i ndiaidh na hinfheistíochta a rinneadh i mbóithre contae le airgead cáin-íocadóiri na tíre seo.</P>
    <P>Mar a deirtear sa sean-fhocal &ldquo;An té nach gcuirfidh greim, cuirfidh sé dhá ghreim&rdquo;.  Mar a gcéanna ó thaobh na mbóithre contae, agus níl aon leathscéal inghlactha chun míniú a thabhairt ar an faillí scannalach seo ag Rialtais agus bainisteóirí i ngach contae.</P>
    <P>Gan dabht, beidh dream amháin ag chur an mhilleáin ar an dream eile ach <Col N="1646" /> tá gach páirt ciontach, go háirithe Airí Rialtais a raibh cúram bóithre acu le fiche bliain anuas; na bainisteóirí a raibh dualgas faoi leith acu ó thaobh caiteachais phoiblí; na páirtithe polaitíochta a thug cluas bodhar do gach gearán a rinneadh ag chuile leibhéal leis na blianta fada ó ghnáthmhuintir an phobail; an gearán ó na hionadaíthe poiblí, na comhairleoirí contae go háirithe; an gearán atá déanta le fada an lá istigh anseo i nDáil Éireann, agus an gearán atá déanta ag turasóirí a gcaitheann a chur suas leis na droch-bhóithre seo chomh maith.</P>
    <P>Cén fáth a tharla an fhaillí seo in ainneoin an méid sin aird á dhíriú ar an fhadhb ag an méid sin daoine thar tréimhse chomh fada sin?  Tá rud amháin dar liom nár chóir neamh-aird a dhéanamh air, sé sin, an neamh-shuim sa Roinn Airgeadais leis na blianta faoi chás na mbóithre áitiúla ar fud na tíre. Rud eile ná neamh-shuim lucht CII nó IBEC anois agus CIF sna bóithre seo de bharr iad a bheith go síoraí ag brú ar an Rialtas mórchuid airgid a chur ar fáil do na &ldquo;corridors&rdquo; móra ó na príomh bailtí chuig na príomh portanna, agus an phríomh aidhm atá acu ná bóthar mór amháin a thogáil ó Bhéal Feirsde síos go Corcaigh agus an chuid is mó den airgead atá ag teacht ón Chomhphobal Eorpach agus ó cháin-iocadóirí na tíre seo a chaitheamh ar chósta oirthear na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Ar aon nós, tar éis an méid sin neamh-shuim ar feadh na mblianta, sa deireadh, tá aithint á tabhairt go bhfuil fadhb mhór anseo go gcaithfí é a réiteach agus go bhfuil gá le gach eolas faoin fhadhb a fháil sular féidir díriú air i ndáríre.  Fáiltím roimh chinneadh an Rialtais seo mar a fograíodh ag an Aire sa díospóireacht seo go ndéanfaí staidéar faoi leith ar staid na mbóithre contae agus sa staidéar sin, go gcuirfí san áireamh na hathruithe ar thrácht na mbóithre contae; an bealach a chuirtear caoi orthu go dtí seo; pleanáil todhchaí na mbóithre.  Seo é an chéad am dár <Col N="1647" /> liom inar shocraigh aon Rialtas staidéar iomlán a dhéanamh ar staid na mbóithre contae.  Tuigim ag bhfuil sé i gceist go núsáidfí toradh an staidéir seo mar bhunús do phlean caiteachais deich mbliana chun caighdéan na mbóithrí a chur ar meán cothrom ar fud na tíre.</P>
    <P>Déanaim chomhgháirdeas leis an Aire, Brendan Howlin, agus an Rialtas as ucht an staidéar seo a chur ar bun.  Tá súil agam go mbeidh an staidéar déanta ina iomlán, go mbeidh na daoine i gceannas air neamhspleách óna Roinn féin agus ón Roinn Airgeadais agus nuair a fhoilsítear an tuarascáil, go mbeidh sé le feiceáil go bhfuil an staidéar cuimsitheach, gairmiúil agus go dtabharfar cothrom na Féinne do gach aird den tír.</P>
    <P>Is maith an rud go bhfuil príomh áit á tabhairt don tuarascáil seo ach ní fheadar an mbeidh siad in ann tuarascáil chruinn a chur ar fáil taobh istigh de dhá mhí.  Cuireann sé sin imní orm dá mbeadh an iomarca deifre air.</P>
    <P>Deirim leis an Aire, tóg do chuid ama, déan an &ldquo;job&rdquo; i gceart agus beidh creidiúint ag baint leis an toradh agus tiocfaidh an-tairbhe as.</P>
    <P>É sin ráite, níl sé cinnte cé chomh neamspleách is a bheidh an staidéar.  Tá súil agam go gcuirfidh an tAire in úil dúinn cé a bheas in a cheannas, cé a bheas páirteach sa staidéar, agus gur féidir linn glacadh leis an toradh agus nach rud é a chuirfear le chéile taobh istigh den Roinn gan aon bhunús seasmhach a bheith leis.</P>
    <P>The county roads structure is the vital artery of rural life, a network of roads which connects villages and provides access for local communities to the regional and national roads network. The economic and social fabric of rural Ireland is becoming more and more dependent on the existence of a sound network of county roads.  Where this lifeline is neglected and allowed to deteriorate in time it will lead to a depleted and disheartened rural community whose best efforts to sustain a <Col N="1648" /> viable community are undermined continuously by bureaucratic neglect.  If there are roads on which doctors, nurses, vets, school buses, travelling shops and so on cannot travel it is a certainly that young people will not want to settle there and their exodus will increase at an even more alarming rate.</P>
    <P>Rural depopulation is one of the major crises facing society in Ireland today and the lack of basic infrastructural facilities such as a good local road network is accelerating this decline.  The deterioration of the county road system has long been identified as a major problem affecting those living in rural areas but, sadly, the response of those in Government has never reflected the concern of the people or the enormity of the problem.  The priority in roads policy during the past 20 years has been to achieve high standard traffic corridors between the major areas of economic activity, our larger cities and the ports and airports which handle our imports and export trade.  Road planners, with the support of successive Ministers for the Environment, have successfully argued for the investment of billions of pounds in the inter-city corridors to the neglect of the county roads system and the rural communities so dependent on it.</P>
    <P>We should contrast the extensive forward planning national primary and secondary routes, where we know well in advance what the Government's plans are and what the level of investment will be, with the lack of planning of the county road system.  On average approximately £6 million per mile is invested in the national primary routes as against £500 for each of the 55,000 miles of county roads on which rural Ireland depends.  This is a sad reflection on politics and those in power since the mid 1970s who have continually turned a blind eye to the needs of so many of our people.</P>
    <P>This debate reflects the chameleon nature of politics and shows how quickly <Col N="1649" /> one party can change its tune depending on whether it is in Government.  Just over 12 months ago this House debated a Private Members' motion on this matter tabled by the Fine Gael Party, then in Opposition.  Its leading spokesperson in that debate, Deputy Avril Doyle, sought to impress upon the then Minister, Deputy Smith, the need to accept that a crisis existed in regard to the condition of county roads.  Motions have been tabled by both of the main parties in the House asking each other to accept that there is a crisis.  Can we agree that there is a crisis and that action should be taken?</P>

      <P>I am sorry that Deputy Leonard has left the Chamber because I wish to assure him that while I do not have a bag of tricks I do have factual information. With other Deputies, he suggested that the Border counties which qualify for INTERREG II funding have been treated badly and have not received their fair share of road grants.  This is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The framework programme pertaining to the Border areas element of the INTERREG II Programme was approved recently by the European Commission and funding of £6 million is being provided this year to eligible county councils.  Details of the programme will be sent shortly to the councils concerned and they will be invited to submit road improvement projects meeting the criteria of the grants scheme.  The Minister has sought to facilitate the councils concerned in drawing up their proposals for funding under the INTERREG II Programme by including indicative allocations under this heading in the 1995 non-national road grants he has notified to them. Allocations totalling £5.7 million have been made to the six front line Border counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo and the <Col N="1650" /> remaining £0.3 million has been shared equally between Longford, Meath and Roscommon County Councils which qualify for limited funding under the programme.  Payment of these indicative grants is conditional on each council putting forward sufficient qualifying projects so as to be in a position to expend its allocation in the current year.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances there are no grounds for allegations that the councils concerned have not received their due entitlements under this Community initiative.  It is quite clear, however, that a number of local authorities, and indeed Members of this House, had unrealistic expectations as to the level of grants they were likely to receive in 1995 and, in particular, a limited understanding of the factors which would affect this.  I will outline briefly, therefore, some of the factors which applied.</P>
    <P>First, as has been already explained, the funding available for non-national roads in 1994 was boosted by the once-off injection of £15 million from tax amnesty receipts.</P>
    <P>Second, the EU co-financed scheme of specific grants for road improvements relates to projects which have a significant economic impact and facilitate local employment creation.  The allocations are based on proposals submitted by local authorities themselves and these are evaluated and prioritised on a merit basis and checked for compliance with EU criteria.  It is the very nature of this scheme that allocations to local authorities will tend to fluctuate from year to year depending on the size and scale of individual projects.  This can be illustrated very simply.  In 1994, South Dublin County Council received less than £400,000 by way of an EU specific grant in respect of a particular improvement scheme.  Due to contractual commitments under this scheme it received in 1995 a massive allocation of over £2 million.  Similar situations arise elsewhere. These swings and roundabouts will tend to even out, however, over the <Col N="1651" /> life of the programme, which will run until 1999.</P>
    <P>Third is the inclusion of special allocations totalling £0.5 million in the 1994 grants in connection with road works associated with the Shannon-Erne waterway which was opened to cruisers last year.  The need for similar funding for the local authorities concerned does not arise this year.</P>
    <P>Fourth, a number of the councils which qualify for INTERREG assistance received allocations totalling £1.1 million in 1994 for pilot schemes intended to promote community involvement, in money or kind, on road works in their areas.  These grants were identified as being over and above the normal grants for the councils concerned. The pilot scheme concept, which was initiated in 1992, now has a proven track record and is being applied generally by local authorities around the country.  In the circumstances, the practice of giving special grants to a small number of councils is being discontinued.</P>
    <P>Fifth, councils in Border areas were specifically told in 1994 that their EU co-financed specific grant allocations took special account of the absence of INTERREG funding in that year and, in the circumstances, allocations under that grant scheme were higher than would obtain once the INTERREG programme was approved.</P>
    <P>Sixth, in some counties work on the reopening of cross-Border roads was completed, or substantially completed, in 1994 with the result that grant allocations for this purpose are not required and can be reduced this year.</P>
    <P>It is worth while putting those points on the record and reassuring the House that the benefits of the funding have been channelled to the areas which are entitled to such support and that this has been done in an equitable and reasonable manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1652" /> In so far as the six Border counties are concerned, listening to this debate one would get the distinct impression that these counties had fared particularly badly in the recently announced grants.  That is simply not the case and I can illustrate the point quite easily.  The grants allocated to these counties average almost £2,000 per mile of non-national road, whereas the corresponding figure for all other counties combined &mdash; excluding the Dublin authorities &mdash; amounts to just over £1,500 per mile.  This establishes clearly and beyond doubt that the Border counties have fared very well and that there are no real grounds for complaint.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy has graciously acknowledged the initiative taken by the Government in relation to the drawing up of a report.  I assure him that all the implications, including the funding implications, will be taken into account in that report.</P>

      <P>Tá súil agam go dtabharfar an oiread deis domsa ag deireadh mo chuid cainte agus a tugadh don chainteoir deiridh.  Cuireann sé áthas orm deis a bheith agam labhairt ar an ábhar seo.  Sa díospóireacht inné, rinneadh tagairt do go leor figiúirí.  Is é fírinne an scéil gur fíor-bheag an t-airgead a caitheadh ar na bóithre contae idir 1983 agus 1987.  De réir a chéile ó shin, tháinig méadú ar an airgead sin agus, san iomlán, caitheadh £109 milliún anuraidh. Cé go nglacaim leis go raibh £20 milliún curtha ar fáil ón maithiúnas cánach anuraidh bhí sé i gceist ag Fianna Fáil, dá mbeadh siad i Rialtas i mbliana, cur leis an airgead sin de réir an ráta boilscithe.  In ionad sin is éard atá tar éis tárlú ná go bhfuil airgead na bliana seo laghdaithe go £103 milliún.  I gcás Chontae na Gaillimhe tá laghdú £800,000 ar an gnáth-airgead a chuirfear ar fáil do bhóithre contae.  Táan laghdú sin tar éis an t-airgead speisialta ó na cistí struchtúrtha a fhágáil ar leathtaobh.  Ciallaíonn sé seo go mbeidh suas le 80 bóithrín nach gcuirfear cuí orthu i mbliana.  Leis an drochaimsir, is ionann sin agus a rá go bhfuil 80 bóthar nach mbeidh daoine in ann taisteal orthu i mbliana de bharr an ghearradh siar seo.</P>
      <P>Of all the issues that one comes across in rural Ireland, the question of roads tends to be one of the most emotive. For too long the policy on roads has been dictated by the economists and the manufacturers who are, in the main, operating from major urban centres. With the major increase in funding last year there was some hope that at last the crisis in rural Ireland in relation to roads was being tackled.  Last year was the first time that Structural Funds made a significant impact on the county roads problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Credit must be given to the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government for having negotiated that funding in Brussels. However, the roads allocation this year is a big disappointment.  It is difficult to understand how a Government, which <Col N="1654" /> managed to add £200 million to the Estimate prepared at the end of last year by the outgoing Government, reduced the allocation for county roads by £6 million.</P>
    <P>This problem must be seriously addressed.  As one person said to me in Connemara the other day, &ldquo;I would be quicker getting from Dublin to Galway than I would getting from my home in Connemara to Galway city&rdquo;.  That is an indictment of the Government.  The Government's attitude to this problem can be summed up in the following terms: out of sight, out of mind.  Because a large number of the worst roads are located in isolated rural areas, the problems being faced by the people living there are not being given serious consideration.</P>
    <P>Many roads are now totally impassable and, with the recent bad weather, there is total destruction of the road surfaces in many areas.  The vast increase in traffic on these roads, particularly heavy goods vehicles which are necessary for a vibrant economy, is also causing serious damage as most rural roads were not designed for this type of traffic.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister of State spoke about the need for local authorities to put more of their own resources into roads.  I find that difficult to understand from a Government that promised to abolish service charges.  Most rural county councils are already imposing much higher service charges than their urban counterparts.  For example, in my own county the water rate in the county area is £115 per annum compared to £50 in Galway city.  What is the Minister of State proposing?  Does he expect local authorities to increase water charges further or is he suggesting that we put toll gates on all our county roads?  The Minister should explain how to reconcile a policy of increased local authority expenditure on roads with the elimination of service charges.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State also criticised <Col N="1655" /> Fianna Fáil for wanting to keep a control on current budget spending, particularly the current budget deficit, while at the same time calling for additional expenditure on roads.  This criticism however has no validity.  Fianna Fáil is saying the Government must get its priorities right.  There is a limit to the amount of money that can be spent by a Government, but it must be directed at the areas in greatest need.  Every person in rural Ireland will say that county roads should be one of the highest priorities of any Government.  It is difficult for most people in rural Ireland to understand how the Government could increase spending so much this year without giving a major increase for roads.  Major expenditure on county roads should not add to the current budget deficit as it would be basically capital expenditure which over time would give a return in economic activity on the investment made.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister understands that one of the greatest difficulties in running a business in rural Ireland is the lack of a proper roads infrastructure.  It has been made clear time and again by industrialists looking at rural locations for industry that one of the biggest problems is bad road infrastructure.  I was involved in setting up a major industry in Connemara, and I know how much the road infrastructure hindered our efforts.  If the Minister is serious about rural development a major programme of work must commence this year to ensure the roads network is brought up to an acceptable standard. In the Dáil yesterday the Minister said a plan is being prepared.  To talk at this stage about assessing the position and preparing a plan is nonsense.</P>

      <P>We can do the work but not without money.  It appears the National Roads Authority has no plan for national secondary routes.  Its concentration on national primary routes to the exclusion of national secondary routes leaves large sections of the country without access to decent national roads.  Large parts of the west are 50 or 60 miles away from the nearest national primary route.  The National Roads Authority must put forward a comprehensive plan for national secondary routes.  It is about time it clearly spelled out what it intends doing in the next five years and explained its policy on the development of the very important national secondary routes.  It seems it would be easier to get information from the KGB in its heyday than it is to get information from the National Roads Authority.  I call on the Minister to ensure that the National Roads Authority publishes a detailed five year plan for all roads under its charge and that it responds with full information to queries from public representatives, whether Members of the Oireachtas or members of local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The battle of the national roads network is only beginning.  This is not a time for procrastination and excuses; it is a time for action.  It is time the Government realised what is needed is a major injection of capital into the county roads structure in the next five years to bring it up to an acceptable standard and ensure there are decent roads to all houses.  This is a fundamental human right.  While not begrudging the people of Dublin extra road finance, it seems strange that extra finance was <Col N="1657" /> made available to the Dublin County Council this year while funding for a county such as Galway, where roads are impassable, was severely cut back.  This indicates where the Government's priorities lie, despite the lip service of commitment to rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>On the issue of a carbon tax, I would ask the Minister to lay off.  Because of high taxes on fuel, industries and individuals operating in rural Ireland pay much higher tax than their urban counterparts.  For example, whenever a person in a rural area needs to visit a hospital it often entails a round trip of 70 or 80 miles.  Allowing for normal fuel consumption, tax paid on fuel would amount to £3 or £4.  This is what I call a hospital visiting tax, paid by people in rural areas.  Similarly, with most other activities that involve travelling to major urban centres, rural people, because of the high tax on fuel, pay tax at a much higher rate than their urban counterparts.</P>
    <P>For businesses this problem is acute. For example, if one compares a company operating out of Dublin with a company operating out of Connemara, allowing for sales of one lorry load of goods per day, exported from the east coast, the difference in fuel tax paid is £10,000 per annum.  Taking an industry such as that in my village that exports ten lorry loads per day, the difference in tax burden on fuel amounts to a whopping £100,000 per year.  This is obviously not sustainable.  To make this position worse is unthinkable and will be resisted by anybody who has the interests of rural Ireland at heart.  The people of rural Ireland will no longer tolerate being second class citizens in their own country, paying high fuel taxes and vehicle taxes.  They have had enough.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister forthwith to seek extra funding for the county roads network.  I suggest he begin by getting an extra £50 million for the road network this year, with an increased amount each year for the next five <Col N="1658" /> years.  If there are difficulties in getting such resources I suggest the Minister talk to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, who has shown himself very able this week in procuring an extra £140 million for his Department &mdash; where there is a will, there is a way. I am delighted that women will receive their equality payments.  I call on the Minister for the Environment to take equally seriously the requests by the people of rural Ireland for equal treatment in the basic matter of access to their homes and businesses.</P>
    <P>Tá mé 25 bliana ag saothrú i gceantair thuaithe.  Táimid ag snámh in aghaidh an easa i rith an ama sin faoin fhadhb seo.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an ardú san airgead LIS a fuair Contae na Gaillimhe i mbliana, ach ní leor é.  Tá mé ag troid seo le tamall fada anois.  Tá daoine in a gcónaí ar bhóithre sa chontae seo againn agus go leor contae eile nach bóithre comhairle contae iad.  Fuaramar tuarascáil ón chomhairle contae anuraidh agus cruthaíodh ag an am sin, ag an ráta a bhfuilimid ag fáil an airgid faoi láthair, go dtógann sé deich mbliana le bóthar a dhéanamh faoin LIS, sin an scéim faoin a n-íocann na daoine iad féin 10 faoin gcéad den airgead le caoi a fháil ar an mbóthar.  Mar a dúirt mé, is séanadh cearta daonna nach mbeadh bóthar ceart ag chuile dhuine go dtí a dteach; go bhfuil cásanna ann anois nach bhfuil dochtúirí ná tréadlianna ná banaltraí in ann dul chuig tithe seandaoine mar nach bhfuil bealach ceart chucu.</P>
    <P>Mar urlabhraí do na hoileáin, cuireann sé uafás orm nach gcuirtear airgead speisialta ar fáil le fadbhanna na mbóithre ar na hoileáin a réiteach. Bunáite na n-oileán ar an gcósta níl aon infrastruchtúr ceart bóithre acu agus tá sé in am anois díriú ar an bhfadhb sin, airgead faoi leith a sholáthar do na hoileáin agus déanamh cinnte de go bhfuil a gcearta bunaidh curtha ar fáil do phobal na tíre seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom Binse Tosaigh mo Pháirtí féin a mholadh as ucht an rún <Col N="1659" /> seo a chur síos.  Tá súil agam go n-éisteoidh an Rialtas leis an méid atá á rá againn, agus go dtiocfaidh siad aníos le airgead breise a chaitheamh ar na bóithre ach nach ndéanfaidh siad é ar dhroim mhuintir na tuaithe atá ag íoc níos mó náa gcion cheana féin do na <Col N="1660" /> bóithre agus go minic, d'fhéadfá a rá, nach bóithre iad.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Industrial Action at Dublin Hospital.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with regret that I heard of the action taken by the caring professional staff in the Mater Hospital to make their point well and truly known.  We associate industrial action with people who wish to make a demand, normally to benefit themselves. It is regrettable that the staff had to take this action today not for any benefit or gain for themselves but for the patients to whom they provide a service.</P>
      <P>As late as 1 March the Minister for Health replied to a question I put down on the Mater and Beaumont hospitals and other hospitals in the Dublin area providing an accident and emergency service.  The reply records that the Minister is happy with the services provided in the accident and emergency service. He recognises that there are seasonal fluctuations and that there is a problem with the elderly who need more appropriate accommodation.</P>
      <P>His reply is no different from replies to questions I put to the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board in January 1995 and to the then Minister for Health in January 1994.  I also asked a similar question in September 1993.  I am not sure if it is the Minister of the day or civil servants who drafts the replies but the language and tone used in the replies is similar.</P>
      <P>I put down the questions because my attention was drawn to the fact that there is a serious recurring problem in the accident and emergency departments of Dublin hospitals.  As can be seen from the questions I asked over a prolonged period, this debate does not arise just from the industrial action taken by the staff at the Mater Hospital today but from the totally unacceptable situation that exists throughout the accident and emergency departments in Dublin hospitals.  It is about back-up beds and services not only in the Mater Hospital but in all Dublin hospitals.  It is not a seasonal problem, as has been contended in replies to me on so many occasions, nor is it only a shortage of appropriate facilities for elderly patients.  Of course we welcome the moneys the Minister recently allocated to the Eastern Health Board, if my memory serves me correctly amounting to £850,000 but, if one examines previous questions, one will find similar amounts were allocated heretofore.</P>
      <P>The problem here does not relate to whether it is a new or an old building, if it is fully manned by auxiliary staff.  It is a simple matter of there being insufficient beds within the system to serve the daily-annual demands.  I am sure Members and the general public will be aware that patients and their families are often left waiting for hours without knowing whether the patient can be accommodated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This must be very frustrating for those providing the care in accident and emergency departments.  The staff simply cannot cope and token <i>ad hoc</i> gestures will not solve this serious problem. <Col N="1663" /> We know from the latest census that the percentage of elderly in our population is increasing.  That is demonstrated by the demand for long-stay accommodation which is insufficient to meet present needs.  Yet <i>ad hoc</i> remedies, this year £850,000, last year £750,000 and the year before of £500,000 are of no benefit and cannot be unless the proper back-up services and support beds are made available.</P>
    <P>I will not quote cases to the Minister this evening which I am sure could be echoed by many other Members.  From the Minister's experience of being a member of his health board until recently I am sure he too could quote such examples and, I understand, has expressed concern at inadequacies in the services in the past.</P>
    <P>This is a daily occurrence warranting special consideration.  I call on the Minister and the Government to give this urgent attention to ensure that those in need of these services will be enabled to avail of them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank Deputy Callely for raising this matter.  As he said, he has been pursuing this issues for some time past and has quoted replies from the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board and my predecessor back as far as 1993.  I know that from his experience and expertise garnered as chairman of the Eastern Health Board he understands many of the issues involved.</P>
      <P>In responding I want to extend my sympathy to any patient or other member of the public who has been affected by the dispute in the Mater Hospital today.  I also accept that, given their normal level of commitment to patient care, it has taken a particularly acute sense of frustration on the part of staff to take the action they have today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a particular background to the problem in the Mater Hospital <Col N="1664" /> which does not allow for easy or quick-fix resolution.  The accident and emergency departments of the six major hospitals in Dublin operate a 24-hour service.  Because of the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict the workload of hospitals accident and emergency departments at any particular time.  Generally, the six accidents and emergency hospitals can cater for the number of people who present themselves for treatment.</P>
    <P>Overcrowding is a seasonal problem and the post-Christmas period usually sees a heavy demand on these services. Perhaps due to the severity of the weather since Christmas there has been sustained pressure on the accident and emergency departments of the six Dublin hospitals beyond that normally expected for this period.</P>
    <P>One of the principal causes of delay in transferring patients from accident and emergency departments to wards has been the shortage of suitable facilities for elderly patients who are no longer in need of acute hospital care. The shortage of more appropriate facilities results in elderly patients having to remain in acute hospitals longer than necessary, consequently reducing the number of beds available for admissions through accident and emergency departments.  As an immediate response to and anticipating this problem, £850,000 has been granted to the Eastern Health Board to provide additional alternative accommodation for patients in acute hospitals who no longer require acute care.  Placing such patients in accommodation more appropriate to their needs eases the pressure on the acute hospitals and reduces the delays in admitting patients to hospitals.</P>
    <P>The management of the accident and emergency service in the Dublin area is carried out under the auspices of a steering committee which includes representatives of the six accident and emergency hospitals and is chaired by <Col N="1665" /> the Eastern Health Board.  This committee follows closely the operation of the accident and emergency service and provides a means to facilitate co-operation between the hospitals involved in the accident and emergency service to ensure its smooth operation.</P>
    <P>These co-operative arrangements include provisions whereby hospitals experiencing an increase in accident and emergency activity can seek to have ambulances diverted to the other hospitals for a period of time, allowing the hospital to deal with those patients already at the accident and emergency department.  This arrangement which operates under the supervision of the chief ambulance officer, Eastern Health Board, provides a mechanism whereby attendances at individual accident and emergency departments can be managed in a manner which takes account of the workload in individual hospitals.</P>
    <P>In relation to the situation in the Mater Hospital, the management has met the union representatives on a number of occasions and endeavoured to ease the problems in the accident and emergency department by implementing a number of improvements. Among these are the provision of a separate dressing clinic for patients and improved catering facilities &mdash; two particular grievances raised by the Irish Nurses Organisation; extra cubicles in the casualty unit and an observation ward to deal with temporary overcrowding. The hospital authorities are currently in the process of planning a new accident and emergency unit. Despite these efforts by management to improve conditions, the Irish Nurses Organisation decided to embark on a 12 hour work stoppage from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. today, 15 March.  Emergency cover was provided.  The overall impact on patient services of this action has been minimal and the combination of the <Col N="1666" /> accident and emergency services in the other five hospitals and the limited service at the Mater has coped with the situation today.</P>
    <P>My Department has arranged a meeting tomorrow with the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board to discuss the overall provision of the emergency services.  Following this, I will be asking the Eastern Health Board and the six major hospitals to review the services and to consider improvements which will help to alleviate the problems which have given rise to the present situation.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Boyne Valley Visitor Centre.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>May I avail of this opportunity to congratulate the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael Higgins, on his reappointment and wish him well in his ministerial tasks.</P>
      <P>Obviously this issue is of great importance to the people of County Meath and to many others &mdash; conservationists and all with an interest in and a love of our heritage.</P>
      <P>Since it is he who will be replying to this debate, will the Minister confirm that that is an indication that the future of the Boyne Valley and Mullaghmore Centres are a matter of Government policy?  If that is the case, I might point out that the decision in relation to the centre in the Boyne Valley has already been made by two successive Governments, one of which has been the subject of the widest possible consultation process, warmly welcomed by the general public in the Meath area and wider afield, a process in which I was directly involved when various groups, those in favour and against &mdash; opinion was divided &mdash; participated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stressed the need for an urgent decision to prevent any further wastage of taxpayers' money which is now becoming a cause of scandal.  The total <Col N="1667" /> cost of the Boyne Valley site and the provision of the centre erected there so far is approximately £1.7 million, excluding legal costs.  To allow the eyesore remain and to provide security and insurance cover for it costs £5,000 per month.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the total cost of the site on which work stopped in February 1993 is more than £114,620 and the maintenance of the site costs the taxpayer a further £5,000 per month.  There is no valid reason for not proceeding with the works in the Boyne Valley.  It has gone through the consultation process and those who opposed it made a number of remarks about that process, but it was a consultation process and everybody got a chance to contribute.  I listened carefully to those contributions, revised the plans for the centre and put them before Meath County Council.  Meath County Council put the plans for the centre through the full planning process, and they were then passed to An Bord Pleanála. They have been fully discussed from the environmental, conservation and planning points of view and are awaiting a Government decision.</P>
    <P>There is no valid reason for not proceeding with the works; the opposite is the case and I am sure the Minister will accept that. On the grounds of conservation and preservation the centre is urgently needed to cater for the 150,000 visitors annually who travel to Newgrange, a number which I believe will steadily increase during the next number of years, particularly as it was declared a world heritage site last year. The increase may be spectacular.  It is only because the Office of Public Works is not currently advertising Newgrange as a visitor centre that the figures are not higher.</P>
    <P>The centre is necessary for the proper management of the entire site not only Newgrange but Knowth and Dowth and <Col N="1668" /> all that archaeological area.  It is absolutely necessary that a decision be made on that centre immediately rather than allow it to drag on.</P>
    <P>On financial grounds it would be nonsensical to reverse the decisions made. Figures I received when I was Minister of State revealed that if the project were to be stopped it would cost the taxpayer more than if it were completed. However, that is not a reason for proceeding with the centre and it was not one of the reasons that influenced my decision.  That site was chosen on purely crowd management and conservation grounds.  I am sure the Minister who has had an opportunity to study this was aware of this during the consultation process and will agree it is reasonable that the centre should proceed.</P>
    <P>When I announced a decision on the three visitor centres I stated that they would go through the full planning process at county council level and the plans would be sent to An Bord Pleanála.  The plans for the Boyne Valley Centre went to An Bord Pleanála and were accepted. I said I would accept the results of that process, and others should do likewise. The Minister should accept them and proceed with the centre.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Boyne Valley Centre should be tied to any other centre. It stands on its own merit and any decision should bear that in mind.  If there are difficulties in relation to other centres or if the Minister has a particular difficulty with Mullaghmore, that is no reason to delay a decision on the Boyne Valley Centre.  I urge him to make a quick decision for the sake of our heritage and on the grounds of common sense.  Taxpayers should not have to fork out £5,000 monthly for a project which should be proceeding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Dempsey for raising this issue and thank him for his kind remarks on my reappointment to the Ministry for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1669" /> There have been slight changes in the arrangement under the current Administration. I am not now the Minister with responsibility for future policy in relation to matters of heritage, as was the case previously but, since a Government decision by way of statutory instrument has transferred functions previously held by the Minister for Finance to me, I take responsibility for this area.  The Deputy will be aware also that the Programme for Government makes an explicit reference to this and related matters.</P>
    <P>The policy agreement between the three parties forming the present Government states that &ldquo;The future of the proposed Interpretative Centres at Mullaghmore, Luggala and the Boyne Valley will be a decision by the incoming Government&rdquo;.  Immediately following the formation of the present Government I initiated a review of each of the three cases.  I recently completed this exercise, have now brought proposals to Government and I expect that a decision will be made in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I reject the Deputy's suggestion that there has been a waste of taxpayers' money because of indecision on the part of the Government.  As he said, the previous Government authorised him, when he was Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, to come to a decision in this matter following a process of public consultation and subject to planning permission being obtained.  I understand that these requirements had been met by 31 August 1994 when An Bord Pleanála upheld Meath County Council's decision on the matter.  However, when the Deputy left office three and a half months later he had still not made a final decision in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I, of course, understand the complexities of these cases and appreciate that the Deputy was wise not to rush into a decision.  I hope he would equally appreciate the need for the present Government to give carefully consideration to the issues involved before coming to its decision.</P>
      <P>These three projects at Mullaghmore, Luggala and the Boyne have been the centre of controversy for about five years now and have been intensely divisive of the communities in which they are located.  Many wish that divisiveness could have been avoided.  It has always been my aim to try to heal these divisions and to work towards consensus, and it is worth while spending a few weeks to ensure that the best decisions are now made in the circumstances.  I understand that the direct additional costs in the case of the Boyne Valley site amount to £5,000 per month for security, but this is infinitesmal compared to the costs that have already arisen from the manner in which these projects were handled in the past.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern for the world heritage site in the Boyne Valley.  I do not see what effect a few weeks' delay in reaching a decision in regard to the visitor centre there could have.  I am satisfied that a decision made in a calm and deliberate manner is more likely to redound to the benefit of this important site in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding some of the points made by the Deputy, I will give him further information.  I hope I have clarified the role of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht in relation to these <Col N="1671" /> matters.  There is no point looking back, but it may clarify who has responsibility for making recommendations.  I agree this is an issue of great importance.  We must be careful about what we mean by &ldquo;consultation&rdquo;.  I am sure that much of the divisiveness to which I referred could have been avoided if there had been a consultation process in respect of some of the other sites.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that I do not have any personal difficulty with any of the three sites.  My only concern is to bring about a resolution that hopefully will bring together communities which were previously divided.  In that spirit I agree with the Deputy that the three sites covered by the Government decision differ in levels of complexity.  The one he mentioned is probably easier in terms of the matters to be resolved.  We must remember that in the five years I mentioned a decision has been taken by the High Court and by the planning authorities in this area.</P>
    <P>If we are to resolve it and secure a consensus it will not be by threatening the public in terms of how much was spent.  This automatically provokes the question: why was the money spent so precipitously and could much of the conflict have been avoided?  This is precisely the territory we want to avoid.  We are talking in terms of a number of weeks before the Government arrives at a decision on the basis of recommendations I have already made to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The announcement last week that Mr. Larry Goodman and a group of investors have acquired control, from a consortium of banks, of most of the assets of the former Goodman Group raises a number of disquieting questions which have not been dealt with in the announcement nor have they been dealt with by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment or <Col N="1672" /> the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The amount of information disclosed is minimal and I have had considerable difficulty getting any of the matters concerned clarified from official sources.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that consent was refused under the mergers Acts for certain proposed take-overs by the Goodman organisation before its collapse, and prohibition orders were made by me in 1990, it seems strange that the present take-over which is far more extensive has been approved by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, to whom I understand it was notified late last November.  It appears he gave this consent about a month ago without referring the matter to the Competition Authority, although they had already looked at various aspects of this and are familiar with the background.</P>
      <P>So far as I can ascertain, not all the assets of what was popularly known as the Goodman Group have been included in this arrangement.  Certain assets which Mr. Goodman claimed he did not own but which the then Fair Trade Commission found he exercised effective control over, have apparently been excluded.  It appears that the assets formerly known as the Master Meats Group, together with some other plants, have been excluded from this transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before they went into examinership in 1990, the Goodman Group had over 40 per cent of the beef export market and there was considerable concern about that at the time.  The information available suggests that a large group of banks have written off £300 million due to them.  I believe the public is entitled to know why this should have happened given that banks generally, and in this country especially, pursue people relentlessly for small sums of money and often force small companies and businesses to close down because of their inability to pay off their liabilities quickly enough.  The public is also entitled to know whether the Revenue <Col N="1673" /> Commissioners have been paid in full all income tax, corporation tax, PAYE and PRSI due to them.  In view of the findings of the beef tribunal at page 335 that:</P>
    <P>there was a deliberate policy in the Goodman Group of companies to evade payment of Income Tax ... the records of the company were misleading and calculated to deceive the Revenue Authorities in the event of an investigation and did so deceive them: the records submitted by the Goodman Group of companies were misleading and intended to be so.</P>
    <P>In addition the beef tribunal report, at page 334, states that after June 1993 negotiations between the Revenue and the Goodman Group of companies took place in the context of the provisions of the Waiver of Certain Tax Interest and Penalties Act, 1993 &mdash; the tax amnesty scheme.  To what extent did the Goodman Group avail of this tax amnesty? How much money have the Revenue had to forego in penalties and interest as a result of the Goodman Group availing of the tax amnesty Act?</P>
    <P>Now that Mr. Goodman has been restored to a dominant position in the Irish beef trade we are entitled to ask what will happen to beef cattle prices if the present live export trade were to come to an end for any reason.  Will we then have a situation where the price of cattle will be fixed by the dominant player in the market?  How is this supposed to be in the interests of Irish farmers?  Given the vulnerability of Irish farmers to this arrangement which has now got the approval of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, I am astonished that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry saw fit to make a statement towards the end of last week in which he was quoted as welcoming this new arrangement.  Does the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry not realise, given the track record of the individual concerned and <Col N="1674" /> the findings of the beef tribunal, just how insecure the position of Irish farmers may well become so far as the purchase of their cattle is concerned?</P>
    <P>Farmers are unwise to take a short term view of a matter like this.  Have we any guarantee that the serious malpractices in the various meat plants of this group, which came to light in the beef tribunal, will not be continued in the future?  I greatly welcome the fact that there are additional investors as well as Mr. Goodman in this new arrangement. So far as I can see none of them has experience in the meat business which means that effective control is likely to be exercised by Mr. Goodman.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that somebody whose companies have been found to have engaged in a wide variety of serious malpractices and who has, as a matter of company and group policy, deliberately set out to evade paying very substantial sums of tax, should now be facilitated quietly and privately in this manner.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the former Goodman Group would have got away with all these things were it not for the beef tribunal.  The manner in which all this has been quietly facilitated gives rise for concern about how strenuously the State will seek to defend a claim against it for a sum which could approach £200 million by the same group, arising out of the extreme foolishness of the then Minister in the export credit insurance field in 1987 and 1988.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy O'Malley has indicated on 29 November 1994 I received a notification under the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Acts, 1978 and 1987, as amended by the Competition Act, 1991, concerning the proposed refinancing and restructuring of the Goodman Group operations and involving the <Col N="1675" /> acquisition of the cattle and beef slaughtering and beef processing business and assets of the Goodman Group by Oppiac Limited.  On 15 February 1995, I decided not to refer the proposal to the Competition Authority for further examination and, consequently, decided not to make an order under section 9 of the 1978 Act in relation to the proposal.</P>
      <P>Under the notified proposal, control over the assets and businesses of the Goodman Group would change from the then owners, comprising the bank syndicate which owned 60 per cent of the group and Mr. Larry Goodman who owned the remaining 40 per cent, to a new investors group comprising Oppiac Limited as the investment vehicle.  The composition and ownership of Oppiac Limited as notified was as follows: Larry Goodman &mdash; 40.91 per cent; Morgens, Waterfall, Vintiadis and Company, a US based financial institution &mdash; 22.72 per cent; the McCann family &mdash; 13.64 per cent; John and Frank Gleeson who control an international commodities trading company called Glibro Holdings Limited &mdash; 13.64 per cent; and McDonald Holdings Limited which is involved in the electrical business owning 9.09 per cent.  Subsequent to my approval under the mergers legislation I have been advised that Monaghan Nominees Limited was given an option in return for loan stock which can be exchanged for share capital to acquire 9.09 per cent in Oppiac Limited the effect of which, if exercised, would be to reduce both Mr. Goodman's and Morgen's shareholdings by 4.55 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland and the UK were to be hived down to three wholly-owned subsidiaries. Phase one was not notifiable under the mergers legislation as it entailed an internal group reorganisation with no change in ultimate control.  Under the notifiable phase two proposal, the shares of the three newly created &ldquo;hive-down&rdquo; companies were to be acquired <Col N="1676" /> by the new investors group.  This proposal was examined by my Department with reference to the usual mergers criteria, including competition and employment issues and the 1990 prohibition orders relating to the Goodman Group.</P>
    <P>The Goodman Group's share of cattle slaughterings and beef processing for the export market &mdash; the relevant market for the purposes of competition assessment &mdash; which is currently 25 per cent remained unaffected by the notifiable proposal.  This market share was confirmed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  No immediate or significant change in the operations of the businesses of the Goodman Group was anticipated as a result of the notifiable phase two proposal.  Employment of all existing employees of the group would transfer to the hived down companies on the same terms and conditions as currently apply.  The proposal appeared to raise no concerns regarding competition as it did not give rise to any concentration in the relevant market or concerns with respect to any other matter under mergers.  On its own merits, therefore, it did not appear to warrant referral to the Competition Authority for further examination under the mergers legislation.</P>
    <P>The two 1990 prohibition orders relating to the Goodman Group sought to prevent the group from increasing its then share of the relevant market of cattle slaughterings and beef processing for the export market from 31.4 per cent to 41.7 per cent resulting from its control of the Master Meat plants in Freshford, Bandon and Clonmel.  The orders effectively permitted the Goodman Group to increase its then market share from 31.4 per cent to 38.2 per cent by allowing it to retain the Bandon and Donegal plants.  This compares with a current market share of 25 per cent.  In this context, the question of whether the phase two proposal should have been referred to the Competition Authority <Col N="1677" /> in order to seek to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the terms and conditions of the 1990 order relating to the change in control of the Master Meats companies were fully satisfied required consideration.</P>
    <P>I received further confirmation from the solicitors acting on behalf of all the parties to the current restructuring proposals that the Goodman Group had complied with the terms of the orders within the time periods specified in them and that the purchasers of the four Master Meat Packers at Clonmel, Kilkenny, Longford and Omagh are independent of the Goodman Group as required by the orders.  Under the mergers legislation any false or misleading information given by notifying parties would have the effect of invalidating a notification.</P>
    <P>On balance I did not consider it necessary or appropriate to refer the matter to the Competition Authority having regard to the following considerations: (i) the existing powers and proposed new regulatory controls in the Competition (Amendment) Bill and (ii) the fact that neither the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry nor the Department of Tourism and Trade, who were consulted, raised any objections to the proposal.</P>
    <P>Under existing competition legislation and with regard to any future concerns resulting from any increase in market shares which the Goodman Group may be able to achieve, it is open to me as the Minister concerned, should the circumstances warrant it, (i) where I am of the opinion that there is an abuse of a dominant position, to ask the Competition Authority to carry out an investigation of any abuse of a dominant position under section 14 of the Competition Act, 1991, and (ii) to make a sectoral order under section 2 of the Mergers Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978, as amended, similar to the newspaper order which would require all mergers and take-overs <Col N="1678" /> affecting the beef sector to be notified irrespective of the thresholds.</P>
    <P>In addition, the proposed new enforcement powers of the Competition Authority under the Competition (Amendment) Bill, which provides for investigations and action by the authority on its own initiative, could lead to sanctions for anti-competitive activity.  It is my intention to have this Bill enacted at an early stage.  While they do not normally discuss individual taxpayer's liability, I have been advised that the Revenue Commissioners position in relation to the tax liabilities of the Goodman Group has not been disimproved by last week's restructuring.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and the Minister of State for being present in the House.</P>
      <P>This issue relates to the conservation of fish stocks and the management of depleting resources in a way which is ecologically viable.  There is overwhelming scientific evidence that the fishing of Greenland halibut is in excess of what the stocks can sustain.  In recent years EU fishing effort has taken over 80 per cent of the Canadian halibut catch in an area covering only 20 per cent of the Greenland halibut habitat.  It is contrary to the recommendations of NAFO, the scientific council which includes EU scientists, to have such concentrated fishing.  It is well known that concentrated fishing of this kind, especially with new technologies, can drastically reduce fish stocks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Spanish factory freezer trawler fleet began fishing Greenland halibut at the beginning of 1989 when the most important stock at the time, northern cod, became increasingly scarce &mdash; it was eventually put into moratorium in 1992.  This pressure on the fragile stock, together with the fishing of juvenile fish, will exhaust these stocks, bearing in <Col N="1679" /> mind that the halibut reproduces at the age of ten years and over.  I accept that one of the freedoms of the high seas is to fish but that is not an unqualified freedom.  It must be subject to the duty by distant water fishing states to co-operate with each other and to conserve and rationally manage the stocks being fished.</P>
    <P>I am not backing the measures taken by the Canadian authorities to arrest the Spanish trawler &mdash; I have reservations about this action &mdash; but there is little doubt that the Spaniards have a case to answer.  Were the logs on the trawler falsified or were there two sets of logs, one showing a 40 per cent catch of halibut and the other an 80 per cent catch? I have been told by a reliable source that 80 per cent of the catch in the hold of the ship was juvenile immature fish. This is a flagrant transgression of conservation policies throughout the world. These small sized young fish could only be caught through the use of a net mesh half the legal size.</P>
    <P>There are now more Spanish trawlers in this area than there were last year when 46,000 tonnes were fished, this notwithstanding the fact that the total allowable catch has been reduced to 27,000 tonnes and that the EU portion has been considerably reduced.  Spanish trawlers are now thought to have fished more than a quarter of the total allowable catch for all countries for the full year.  I want to make it clear that I have no problem with the Spanish Government or the Spanish people.  My problem, and it is a serious one, has to do with the Spanish fishing fleet which is obviously out of control.  The consequences for spawning stock are catastrophic; this is unadulterated plundering, destructive fishing.  I am not raising the issue of the share out of the total allowable catch between the EU and Canada as I do not have the time. Suffice it to say that there is room for negotiation and compromise.  I would <Col N="1680" /> advocate restraint and the carrying out of a totally independent analysis of the situation in Greenland by a third party.</P>
    <P>Next January the Spaniards will be able to fish in the Irish box.  We desperately need meaningful and effective enforcement controls and measures to combat this wholesale plundering. Instead of showing teeth and independence, the Minister and the Government have given the Spanish fishing fleet a blank cheque to ride roughshod over everyone.  Given this mortal threat to fishing stocks and the fishing industry, the Government should be active in promoting effective international mechanisms to deal with vessels which transgress the law.  They must protect our fishing stocks and the livelihood of those dependent on them and build up the Naval Service to ensure the controls which we desperately need are in place at the beginning of next year.</P>
    <P>The Government has a great opportunity to tighten up international laws, to work in the United Nations towards removing legal uncertainties in this area and to protect the specific rights of coastal countries.  Many small communities in Europe, and in Ireland, are frightened by the prospect of this reckless overfishing and they need to be sure that Governments are on their side in ensuring that there is respect for international law and that depleting stocks will be conserved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to set out Ireland's position on the fishing dispute between the European Union and Canada.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The dispute has been simmering for some six months now.  Ireland has been actively involved in discussions at European Union level and there have also been ongoing high level contacts with Canada.  Our position has been defined over a lengthy period and is based on an objective and principled approach to what is a complex and difficult problem. <Col N="1681" /> We have throughout this period urged restraint on both sides and have encouraged efforts at an negotiated settlement.</P>
    <P>We support the European Union position because we feel this is in the best interests of the Irish fishing industry. Ireland is a Member of the European Union.  The key decisions which affect Ireland's fishery concerns are taken within the European Union and unilateral action by Ireland against the European Union position in an international dispute would be an extremely grave step to take.</P>
    <P>The facts in this case would not justify such action and Canada's arrest of the <i>Estai</i> in international waters was an illegal act which we cannot support &mdash; I am glad Deputy Smith does not support it either.  Indeed, support for the Canadian arrest of a European Union vessel on the high seas would run directly counter to Ireland's interests.  If, for example, Spain should arrest an Irish vessel in international waters we would vigorously defend our legal rights and demand and expect support from other states in the Union.</P>
    <P>We understand Canadian concerns. We support their calls for conservation and appreciate their frustration with the difficulties in controlling the activities of certain fleets.  We are also fully aware of the deep socio-economic problems and loss in employment in Newfoundland which have resulted from the collapse in cod stocks.  Given the natural affinities between Ireland and Newfoundland, this is obviously a matter of very serious concern for us.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we have been closely involved with this issue from its inception and adopted a carefully considered and principled stand throughout aimed at stock conservation.  In particular, it has to be stressed that the EU Council of Fisheries Ministers in November last supported a substantial reduction in the total allowable catch of Greenland halibut from 40,000 tonnes to 27,000 tonnes.  This was despite <Col N="1682" /> strong opposition from Spain and Portugal. Ireland supported this reduction.</P>
    <P>The subsequent split decision by the NAFO contracting parties to allocate a mere 12.5 per cent &mdash; 3,400 tonnes approximately &mdash; of this to the Union and 60 per cent, 16,000 tonnes approximately &mdash; to Canada was adjudged by the European Union to be inequitable having regard to recent catching patterns which would justify a reversal of those allocations.  The issue, therefore, in this case is not so much about conservation as about share-out of the reduced allowable catch.  Thus, the European Union without any dissenting voice among its 15 member states &mdash; that decision was not taken lightly &mdash; invoked the valid objection procedures provided for in the NAFO Convention and appealed the initial decision.  The Union has always made it clear that it was open to negotiation on this issue. Instead of negotiating with the European Union on the issue, Canada chose to take unilateral and illegal action which has precipitated the present crisis.</P>
    <P>We condemn illegal fishing activity by any country's fishing fleet.  We have been at the forefront of those within the Union who have argued for tighter controls on the Spanish fleet.  We are determined to eliminate such illegal activity.  I agree that the Spanish fleet must answer questions both in regard to the catch on the vessel now under arrest and about their general fishing behaviour in that area.  We must not, however, allow our concerns about the Spanish fleet blind us to our interests in the dispute between the European Union and Canada.</P>
    <P>Our strategy of working within the Union and not breaking ranks on this issue best protects the interests of Irish fishermen and allows Ireland to play a credible and useful role in attempting to achieve a solution.  To break ranks and take a partisan stance would sideline Ireland in the process while jeopardising Ireland's position on ongoing issues of <Col N="1683" /> crucial importance to the Irish fishing industry.  Moreover, if any country were now to break ranks with the Union position it would prolong the dispute and make it more difficult to resolve.  I believe that we were right to resist any temptation to adopt a populist stance on this issue and I am confident that the reasoned position we have taken will contribute to the resolution of the problem.</P>
    <P>It is essential that both parties take immediate steps to de-escalate this dispute and to urgently get back to the negotiating table.  A speedy and mutually acceptable durable settlement must <Col N="1684" /> be negotiated.  This must provide for equitable distribution, proper controls and protect stocks while safeguarding Canada's interests.  We are using every opportunity to impress on both sides the need to take this approach.</P>
    <P>This Government will take a far more vigorous approach than its predecessor in dealing with the question of illegal fishing, whether by the Spanish fleet or any other, particularly if it affects the interests of our fishing industry.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concerns expressed in the article in a recent issue of Consumer Choice magazine alleging widespread non-compliance with the requirements including labelling requirements for furniture set down in the Industrial Research and Standard (Fire Safety) (Domestic Furniture) Order, 1988.</P>
      <P>The 1988 order was devised to ensure that domestic furniture is designed, manufactured and constructed to a particular standard so as not to endanger persons or property.  Under the order only materials which meet strict fire safety requirements are permitted in domestic furniture both new and secondhand. In addition, furniture is required to bear both display (which may be detachable) and permanent labels detailing certain safety and manufacturing data.  The enforcement of the order is the responsibility of the Director of Consumer Affairs and is achieved, generally, by following up complaints of non-compliance &mdash; particularly with the labelling provisions.  A number of successful prosecutions have been brought by the Director.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While every effort is made to implement the order effectively I would <Col N="1502" /> wish to assure the Deputy that breaches of the furniture labelling requirements may not, in themselves, have the negative implications indicated in the Consumer Choice article.  This is so because, since 1988, the manufacture of flammable foam &mdash; the main fire hazard in relation to domestic furniture &mdash; has ceased in this country and replaced by foams having the fire-retardant properties required by the order.  I am not aware of any benefits relating to insurance premiums which might be available in respect of the use or otherwise of furniture complying with the 1988 order.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the very process of tendering and the operating realities of small businesses do not sit comfortably together.  Typically, small firms find the process of accessing timely information on public contracts, whether on domestic or on export markets, to be difficult.  There is also a reluctance on the part of many small businesses to involve themselves in public contracting as this tends to be a time consuming process and often one failure to secure a contract can be enough to create an impression that it is not worth the effort and-or that the process is <i>de facto</i> stacked against the small firm.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to introduce at an early date a new subsidised loan fund for small businesses under the SME initiative of the European Union.  The draft operational programme responding to this initiative has been lodged in Brussels since November 1994 and I would hope that the relevant negotiations on the Programme can be concluded in the near future.</P>
      <P>The banking sector is becoming increasingly aware of the small business borrower and I welcome the many positive developments in small business banking since the task force.  It is fair to say that the small business expansion loan scheme introduced in 1994 was very successful in making low cost, long term, fixed interest rate funds available for small business investment.  As well as creating and maintaining nearly 5,000 jobs, this £100 million loan fund generated a strong competitive response from most financial institutions concerned with small business.  I expect this trend to continue and perhaps be accelerated by the new scheme which will, when approved by the Commission, be put to competitive tender among the banks to get the best deal for small business in the current economic environment.  I see funding such as this being delivered in partnership between the Exchequer, the EU and the banks.  Banks have shown a readiness to commit resources to such a partnership arrangement as well as to meet the small business agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As well as looking for better banking products and relations with small business, the task force recommended that the Government consider certain tax incentives to encourage banks in a more positive direction towards small business lending.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 29 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The Government has accepted the central recommendation of the task force on long term unemployment to put in place a local employment service to meet the needs of the long term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local employment service will be introduced on a phased basis.  Initially <Col N="1506" /> the service will be set up in the 12 area based partnerships established under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and in two non-partnership areas.  The aim of the new service will be to reduce the numbers of people who are long term unemployed.  To ensure that the new service is up and running as quickly as possible I have established in my Department a new policy unit on long term unemployment whose immediate task is to oversee the putting in place of the local employment service as recommended by the task force on long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>Essentially the new service will be managed by a local management committee, operating under the auspices of the area partnership.  The local management committee will oversee the drawing up and implementation of the overall strategy for the local employment service in their areas.  My Department has begun consultation with other Government Departments and agencies and the area partnerships to ensure that the new service is operational as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government has decided to allocate £5 million in 1995 to meet the additional costs of providing the guidance, counselling and active placement service to be available from the new service, which will draw mainly on existing resources.  The Government has also decided to provide £1 million for a special local training and education fund for innovative training and education measures for the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>The task force on long term unemployment will report to the Government by end October 1995 on the progress of the local employment service.</P>

      <P>Both prior to and since assuming office I have consistently been supportive of initiatives to develop the services sector.  In accordance with the commitment given in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> I am advancing recommendations to extend the definition of service sectors qualifying for assistance from the development agencies as well as reviewing the corporation tax structure for the international services sector.  I am continuing to press ahead with the implementation of the remaining recommendations of the report of the task force on jobs in services and I am planning to increase the participation of the services sector in the small business operational programme and measures thereunder including the soft loan fund.</P>
      <P>A significant recent development has been the county enterprise board structure which now provides State assistance for the development of a new micro enterprise in the services sector.  I am also undertaking a policy review and hope to devise additional proposals for the services sector as part of a wider employment strategy.</P>

      <P>No specific study is contemplated at this time into the subject area referred to by the Deputy. However, I understand that Forfáas, as a function of its input into policy development, is considering undertaking such a study some time in the future. For the information of the Deputy, my Department, together with the development agencies, regularly monitors market developments.  Policy initiatives, strategies or specific measures including at times, where appropriate, studies on particular aspects of competitiveness, are initiated on the basis of that monitoring.</P>
      <P>For example, Forbairt constantly monitors the market situation in relation to its client companies.  In addition to sectoral studies carried out on an ongoing basis, individual company development work focuses on identifying the key success factors which will enable these companies to achieve sustainable advantage, in some instances, in the face of market threats from central and eastern Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I announced yesterday the establishment of a new task force for industry adjustment to identify areas of business at risk from competitive forces and to propose renewal strategies. We have learned many lessons over recent times about the fierce pressures of international competition facing individual companies and sectors, including competition arising from the developing Eastern and Central European countries. This task force, which will include the participation of ICTU and IBEC, <Col N="1509" /> will consider and advise on steps and actions for furthering the adjustment of industry to competitive pressures. Accordingly, this task force will be looking at competitive pressures from whatever source, including potential competition arising from the developing Eastern and Central European markets.</P>

      <P>In its first report, the Company Law Review Group recommended that the application of company law generally to small companies should be examined either in a future phase of their work or that of some other such group.  I will be examining the appropriateness of this recommendation as part of my overall examination of all the recommendations made in the first report of the Company Law Review Group.</P>
      <P>However, I have to point out that for the vast majority of small companies, the only return that they have to make to the Companies Registration Office is their annual return.  I do not think that this could be considered to place an undue burden on small companies. Indeed, the task force on small business made specific reference to two company law issues only &mdash; company registration and audit.  The Company Law Review Group commented that this would seem to support the view that company law does not impact onerously on a day-to-day basis on small companies.</P>

      <P>The county enterprise boards operate as autonomous bodies under interim guidelines pending their incorporation as companies limited by guarantee and the coming into effect of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development.  Accordingly, it is the responsibility of each board to determine whether, and to what extent, projects in a particular sector require assistance, having regard to the established eligibility criteria and to such considerations as the possibility of the displacement of existing business in that sector.</P>
      <P>Moreover, each board is required to prepare and implement a county enterprise plan which will take stock of existing provision and outline sectoral objectives to guide the board and its evaluation committee in deploying the limited resources available to it for direct enterprise support.</P>
      <P>Each county enterprise board has been given the same clear project evaluation and eligibility criteria.  While similar types of small enterprise projects can be expected to feature among the projects assisted by different county enterprise boards throughout the country, every project is the subject of an appraisal process in the course of which the county enterprise board considers what its local area could use or could develop to strengthen the economic activity of that county or city.</P>

      <Quest>in view of the difficult experiences of labour-intensive industries in Ireland in recent years, if he will initiate a special study of the sector to establish its comparative cost competitiveness with the purpose of establishing its present needs and medium and long term prospects; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1695/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy rightly implies in his question, cost competitiveness is a vital component in the long term survival and prosperity of labour-intensive industries, and industry generally, in Ireland.  However, the labour-intensive sector is not a homogenous sector, and practical difficulties would arise in trying to encapsulate the various elements of labour-intensive industries into a special study.  Labour-intensive industries vary widely by sector, market-orientation, skill requirement, geography, ownership profile and current trading circumstances, to mention some of the major distinguishing features.  The problems particular sectors or individual firms face to secure their long term future could be related to any one or a combination of the above.</P>
      <P>A recent report, &ldquo;Taxes on Labour in Ireland and in the United Kingdom,&rdquo; by McCarthy &amp; Tansey, notes that job growth in Ireland has been lower than in countries perceived to have done poorly, including the United Kingdom. The report goes on to state that the reasons for this low jobs growth are many and complex and have been analysed in numerous official reports. Pre-eminent amongst those official reports has been the report of the Industrial Policy Review Group &mdash; the Cullition report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of competitiveness was identified in the Culliton report as a central requirement if indigenous firms are to maintain their existing markets <Col N="1512" /> and expand into new ones.  In this connection, the recently published Operational Programme for Industrial Development brings to attention the fact that many Irish companies have a considerable gap to bridge before they can compete successfully on a long term basis with international firms both on the domestic and export markets.  Many indigenous firms tend to have particular deficiencies in areas of marketing, technology, business skills and finance for expansion/marketing which represents a significant obstacle to their development and to the expansion of trade.  For this reason, the primary focus of strategy in the operational programme will be on improving the competitiveness of indigenous industry by improving performance in all these key operational areas.</P>
    <P>Improving competitiveness also involves important aspects of national policy which do not come within the scope of the industry programme.  These relate to the broader issues identified in the Cullition report as affecting the competitiveness and productivity of the economy as a whole.  These broader issues include tax reform, improvements to physical infrastructure, access transport, improvements in the education system and having competitive public utility costs.  These issues are being addressed by the Government in the context of the implementation of the Moriarty report.  In relation to tax reform, measures outlined in the budget by the Minister for Finance are clear evidence of the Government's commitment to helping potentially vulnerable indigenous sectors to lower their cost base and improve their competitive position.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, I announced the establishment of a new task force for industry adjustment to identify areas of business at risk from competitive forces.</P>
    <P>In keeping with the Government's commitment to a participative approach to economic development as set out in its policy agreement of December 1994, <i>A Government of Renewal</i> and in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and</i><Col N="1513" /><i>Work,</i> this task force has been established to enable the social partners &mdash; ICTU and IBEC &mdash; to contribute, along with State agencies and Departments, to addressing the problems of job maintenance/losses and to the promotion of models for early, preventative change and adjustment strategies in industry.</P>
    <P>The task force will also oversee a new initiative to assist areas of business under particular pressure, such as traditional sectors and segments of industry like clothing, timber and furniture and some engineering areas, to identify early and preventative actions that should be taken to gear up to the pressures from international trade and the increasing immediacy of the global marketplace.</P>
    <P>This new task force within whose remit the social partners and State bodies will identify the early preventative actions that need to be taken, will provide a further and necessary impetus for employers and workers to implement an agenda for change so as to survive and prosper in competitive markets.</P>
    <P>The decision to increase the income threshold below which the lower rate employers' PRSI of 9 per cent applies from £9,000 to £12,000 and to reduce corporation tax to a standard rate of 38 per cent, with further reductions planned as resources allow, are a clear demonstration of that commitment.  In addition, the position of low paid employees will be improved by the introduction of a £50 per week allowance for full rate PRSI contributors. Furthermore, the increases in personal allowances and the significant widening of the standard rate income tax band will increase the reward for people in work and reduce the number of people paying tax at the higher 48 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government is addressing the cost of labour in a coherent and comprehensive way by reforming the three key elements of the tax wedge; income tax, employee PRSI and employer PRSI.  This will enhance the relative competitiveness of Irish labour and help labour-intensive firms, in particular.  By doing this we should <Col N="1514" /> increase the employment intensity of current and future economic growth.</P>
    <P>While the employment creation task facing us is daunting, it is reassuring to note that recent employment growth, as compiled in the OECD's Employment Outlook 1994, shows Ireland outperforming both the EU and the total OECD positions in 1994 and they expect this performance to continue into 1995.  This reassuring position is echoed in the European Commission's publication <i>Employment in Europe 1994</i>, which states:</P>
    <P>Indeed, only in Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom is employment expected to increase in 1994, and only in Ireland, is the rise likely to be more than 1 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>There is widespread agreement in our society that tackling unemployment remains the most important challenge facing us. With some 280,000 people unemployed &mdash; an unemployment rate of over 14 per cent &mdash; the problem speaks for itself. The magnitude of the unemployment problem is such that, clearly, there are no quick fixes.  However, rather than acting as a deterrent, this must strengthen our resolve to tackle the problem across a broad range of fronts with imagination, persistence and determination.</P>
      <P>One overriding priority must be to create and maintain the framework conditions which fuel growth in the economy. It is also essential that we promote measures which turn economic growth into increased employment, either by preserving existing jobs or creating new ones.  That is why the Government introduced a number of measures in the budget designed to lower the costs associated with job creation.</P>
      <P>Among the measures we introduced were: the annual income threshold below which the lower rate of employers' PRSI of 9 per cent applies has been increased from £9,000 to £12,000; the employers' PRSI exemption scheme is being extended to include all first-time workers under the age of 23 who meet the conditions; and the standard rate of corporation tax has been reduced from 40 per cent to 38 per cent and we plan to push it down further in line with European norms, as resources allow.</P>
      <P>One of the key effects of these measures will be to lower the costs of employing people by some 3 per cent, as well as improving the profitability of Irish businesses and providing increased access to the capital necessary for growth and expansion.  These changes will also have a substantial beneficial effect on the services sector, which is a major vehicle for employment growth in all modern economies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, we must tackle the unemployment situation on a <Col N="1517" /> range of fronts.  Creating the right economic conditions is the essential first step.  With these in place, it is the goal of my Department and the development agencies to build on them by helping firms to increase their competitiveness and thus create and maintain jobs.</P>
    <P>The <i>Operational Programme for Industry 1994-99</i>, which I have launched recently, sets out an overall target of 20,000 gross new jobs per annum.  This target was, exceeded by Forbairt, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development in 1994.  I am confident that the agencies will maintain this excellent performance in 1995 and, over the remainder of the decade.</P>
    <P>Overseas industry has made a very significant contribution on job creation. IDA Ireland has been outstandingly successful in winning new greenfield and expansion business in the face of ever increasing competition.  I am fully committed to supporting the agency in its drive to win additional business and provide a value for money return, in terms of jobs created and other benefits, to the economy.</P>
    <P>Indigenous industry is the subject of ongoing transformation, with traditional industries being replaced by modern technologically-sophisticated firms equipped to compete in today's global markets.  In fact, 70 per cent of all indigenous companies now operating have been established since 1973.  Building on this radical transformation, Forbairt has set some ambitious targets for indigenous industry to the year 2000 which envisage that: sales of indigenous businesses will rise to £15 billion from a 1994 level of £10.8 billion; exports of indigenous businesses will increase from £5.7 billion to £9 billion, and net employment in indigenous industry will increase from 118,000 to 130,000.</P>
    <P>Achievement of these targets will pave the way toward creating an indigenous industrial sector which is more innovative and which has the core competencies necessary to achieve sustainable competitive advantage.  Only by adopting a long term strategic approach <Col N="1518" /> will we make a lasting impact on unemployment.</P>
    <P>An indigenous sector possessing both the &ldquo;know what&rdquo; and the &ldquo;know how&rdquo; must also have access to the capital necessary to fund growth.  The agencies play an important role here, particularly through the provision of equity finance. However, the agencies need not be the prime movers in the provision of capital. In my budget speech I outlined an approach which involves increased responsiveness by the banks to the needs of entrepreneurs and business generally and welcomed the recent positive steps the banks have taken to achieve this.  I also referred to our objective of building on the very successful £100 million loan scheme for business expansion, and to the new equity measure which has been introduced in the Operational Programme for Industry. Taken together, these initiatives will provide a sound financial foundation for the accelerated growth of indigenous enterprise.</P>
    <P>While all of these measures will impact positively on the creation of employment opportunities, we must also work proactively to tackle the specific problem of long term unemployment. Last week I announced the creation of a new unit within my Department whose mandate is to help the long term unemployed get back into employment.  The new unit will oversee the putting in place of the local employment service as recommended by the Task Force on Long-term Unemployment. In addition, the unit will come forward with policy proposals for new initiatives to reduce the number of long term unemployed and to better co-ordinate the delivery of State services to the unemployed.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned that a large proportion of the unemployed are young people, many of them school leavers. This is a serious problem, one which cannot be tackled in isolation by any single Department of State, particularly when the evidence shows that youth unemployment is closely linked to low educational achievement.  The fact that <Col N="1519" /> large numbers of young people drop out of the educational system at an early stage without qualifications exacerbates the problem.</P>
    <P>For my part, I am committed to increasing employment opportunities for school leavers and young people through greater focus on training and upgrading of skills generally.  My forthcoming White Paper on training will consider how best to ensure maximum benefit from our training investment and will address such issues as the skills gap, and &ldquo;in-company&rdquo; training.  It will also review and seek to improve the operation of the national Youthstart programme which covers employment and training opportunities for unqualified school leavers in the 18-20 age group.</P>
    <P>I am determined that the employment needs of our economy will receive concerted and sustained attention in every aspect of my Department's work.  To that end I have initiatied a review of all aspects of our employment policy to ensure that we have a coherent strategy in place.  I have sought and will welcome input and suggestions from all with an interest in improving the quality of policy intervention.</P>

      <P>The Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1987 prohibits the payment or receipt of &ldquo;hello money&rdquo; and below-cost selling of many grocery goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I announced recently that I have decided to retain the Groceries Order <Col N="1520" /> for a period of two years.  I believe the retention of the order is necessary because competition law, as it now stands, is ill-equipped to tackle anti-competitive activity in the grocery trade. The lack of public enforcement and inadequate penalties for breaches of law are fundamental deficiencies in the existing competition regime.  I propose to amend the Competition Act, 1991 to deal with these defects in line with the policy agreement for Government, which provides for the strengthening of competition law by giving the Competition Authority powers of enforcement and by enabling the courts to impose stiff fines on those found to be engaging in anti-competitive activity.  When this legislation is on the Statute Book and in operation for some time I will consider the matter further.</P>

My colleague, the Minister for the Environment has, I understand, in a recent response to a question from the Deputy, outlined the plans to foster development of best environmental management practice, starting with the public sector.  I am considering what further steps can be taken to prepare industry to meet the stricter environmental standards and to develop the commercial opportunities from better environmental standards, and I hope to take initiatives in this area.  In so far as social auditing is concerned, the matter will be considered in conjunction with the social partners in the context of the special unit signalled in the Programme for Government to assist in the development of improved management-employee relationships at the level of the enterprise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question focuses on the capital expenditures proposed in the Irish Steel viability plan.  I have previously stated my position in relation to these expenditures in an Adjournment Debate on Irish Steel in the House on 23 February 1995 (column 1669, line 40).  In that debate I stated that it will have to be shown that the capital investment projects will meet the cost and benefit projections that have been put forward in the viability plan before any funding will be committed to them.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel have had an independent assessment of the viability plan carried out and I have had access to this.  I have also appointed IBI Corporate Finance Ltd. to act as advisors in relation to the possible sale of a stake in Irish Steel.  As part of that exercise IBI in conjunction with the international steel consultants, Beddows &amp; Co., will carry out an assessment of the viability plan.</P>
      <P>The European Commission is arranging to have an independent assessment of the Irish Steel viability plan and the capital expenditure proposals contained therein, carried out as part of the process of considering approval of State aid to Irish Steel.</P>
      <P>In addition to all of these analyses of the Irish Steel proposals it may still prove necessary to have specific independent assessments carried out of particular capital investment proposals. However it would be premature to initiate any such assessments until the Government and the European Commission's consultants have completed their assessments.</P>
      <P>Anyone taking a stake in Irish Steel will be expected to contribute to the investment programme.  The level of investment will depend on negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be evident to the Deputy from the foregoing that it is too early to give a detailed answer to that part of the <Col N="1523" /> Deputy's question which seeks to determine the implications of the proposed capital expenditures for the Exchequer. The Government has decided however that the maximum level of Exchequer support for Irish Steel, subject to European Union approval, will be IR£50 million.</P>

      <P>In 1991, the Government established the Refugee Agency to co-ordinate arrangements for the welfare and resettlement of refugees who are admitted to Ireland under Government decisions.  The principal Departments concerned, including Health, Education and Social Welfare, are represented on the board of the <Col N="1526" /> agency which meets regularly to consider all the different aspects of refugees' welfare.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive review of the operation of the Refugee Agency was undertaken in 1994 and the recommendations of that review are being implemented. Additional staff resources have been approved, a new chief executive has been appointed and the administrative budget for the agency has been increased this year to £215,000.  In addition, refugees have access to the full range of State services on the same basis as Irish citizens and the costs of such services are met from the Votes of the relevant Departments, health boards and public services.</P>
      <P>Rescue Trust, a voluntary agency, have asked that the Government provide them with funding to establish a specialist centre in Ireland for the treatment of refugees suffering from the effects of torture and ill-treatment.  This proposal has been carefully considered and the director of Rescue Trust met the then Minister of State at my Department last summer to discuss issues relating to refugee welfare.</P>
      <P>I am sympathetic to the situation of refugees who may have suffered long term effects from torture but, having regard to the role being carried out already by the Refugee Agency and the services available through other State agencies here, it is considered that the existing health and social services are well placed to meet whatever demands for specialist treatment exist or which may arise.

A draft report on the research, entitled &ldquo;The Badger and Habitat Survey of Ireland&rdquo;, has been prepared together with an executive summary.

      <P>I am aware of the present condition of &ldquo;Bremore&rdquo;, Balbriggan, County Dublin, following a fire last year which caused major damage to it and destroyed its thatched roof. I understand that this building is regarded as being the longest thatched house in Ireland and that it is listed for preservation in Dublin County Council's Development Plan.  I feel that the best way of ensuring its future as part of our living heritage would be through its acquisition by a sympathetic private <Col N="1532" /> purchaser.  I have, therefore, no plans to intervene in this case prior to the public auction on 22 March 1995.</P>
      <P>Regarding restoration of the building, the National Heritage Council, which comes under the aegis of my Department, has at its disposal national lottery funds which it can, subject to my approval, allocate to architectural restoration projects, including thatch.  The council is independent in its assessment of grant applications and in its grant recommendations to me.  If the present or any future owner of the building wishes to be considered for grant assistance for restoration of the building he should contact the Secretary, National Heritage Council, Dún Aimhirgin, 43-49 Mespil Road, Dublin 4.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Department of the Environment provides grants of £2,000, or two-thirds of the costs, whichever is the lesser, for the renewing or repairing of the thatched roofs of houses used as normal places of residence.  Further information and application forms may be obtained from the Department of the Environment, Housing Grants Section, Government Offices, Ballina, County Mayo.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that responsibility for Hartley Bridge is shared between Leitrim and Roscommon County Councils. It is a matter for these councils to carry out any works required and to meet the cost involved from their own resources, supplemented by the discretionary grants for non-national roads provided annually by my Department.  I have recently notified discretionary grant allocations totalling £1,402,000 and £2,114,000 to Leitrim and Roscommon County Councils, respectively, for this year.</P>
      <P>Each council had an opportunity to submit an application in respect of Hartley Bridge under the 1995 EU co-financed scheme of specific grants for improvement works on non-national roads which have a significant and quantifiable economic impact.  Leitrim County Council submitted 12 applications and Roscommon County Council 11 applications in respect of 1995 but neither council included a proposal relating to Hartley Bridge.  It will be open to both councils to consider whether to submit proposals for this bridge in the future under this grants scheme.</P>
      <P>The 1995 allocations for non-national roads notified to Leitrim and Roscommon County Councils include indicative grants amounting to £800,000 and £100,000, respectively, under the INTERREG II Community initiative for Border areas.  It will be a matter for the Councils to decide whether to include Hartley Bridge in the proposals to be forwarded for consideration under this scheme.</P>

      <P>Approval issued from my Department on 23 November 1993 to South Dublin County Council's preliminary engineering report in respect of the Fonthill Road to Nangor Road section of the Newlands/Fonthill Road scheme. As the proposed road would be a non-national road, decisions on the timing of construction and funding are matters primarily for the County Council.  I understand that the estimated cost of the project exceeds £6 million and that <Col N="1540" /> the Council is not in a position at present to finance the project from its own resources supplemented by the discretionary grant paid annually by my Department.</P>
      <P>It will be open to the Council to apply for funding for the scheme in due course under the EU co-financed scheme of specific grants for improvement works on non-national roads which are important for employment and economic activity.  The Council's funding priorities in 1995 were Firhouse Road, Stage 3 and Nangor/Fox &amp; Geese, Stage 3.  I have allocated specific grants totalling £2,627,172 to meet anticipated expenditure on these projects this year.</P>
      <P>Work is due to commence shortly on the Boot Road to Newlands Cross section of the Newlands/Fonthill Road scheme on the basis that the Council will seek recoupment from grants in 1996.</P>

      <P>Three primary schools in County Leitrim and two in County Sligo have been designated as disadvantaged. The schools in question are: St. Clare's national school, Manorhamilton; Scoil Mhuire na Toirbhirte, Carrick-on-Shannon, St. Brigid's national school, Drumcong; St. Edward's boys national school, Forthill, Sligo; Our Lady of Mercy national school, Sligo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each of these schools receives a special rate of capitation funding.  The level of this funding is being increased from £55 per pupil to £65 per pupil for the coming school year.  Three of the <Col N="1545" /> schools in question have also been allocated an additional concessionary teaching post.</P>
    <P>At second-level, additional teaching posts have been allocated to: Mohill vocational school, Drumkeerin vocational school, and Marian College, Mohill.</P>
    <P>The authorities at the schools in question have been requested to use these posts to counteract the impact of disadvantage through the provision of remedial help and the development of home-school links.  I propose to allocate an additional 30 posts to the homeschool-liaison service at both primary and second-level.  These posts will be targeted at schools in disadvantaged areas and the needs of the schools mentioned above will be considered in this context.</P>
    <P>I have commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to undertake a detailed study of educational disadvantage; the approaches used in selecting schools for receipt of special assistance; and the nature of the supports which should be provided.  I expect to receive a report on the outcome of this study by mid year. This will provide a valuable basis for the development of future responses in this area.</P>

However, due to the demands on the available capital resources priority is being given to the provision of essential teaching spaces.  In the circumstances therefore it is not possible to provide a capital allocation for the development of the playing pitch at this school.</P>

To date, a total of 26 such posts have been allocated to the primary school sector.  I intend to allocate an additional ten resource teacher posts to primary schools in 1995.  These posts will be allocated on the basis of priority of need following the collection of data by my Department's primary inspectorate.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the remedial teaching post at Our Lady of Mercy national school, Bantry will be retained. However, the school will lose its tenth assistant's post at the end of the current school year.  This is because the staffing of national schools for a particular year is determined by the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The total enrolment of Our Lady of Mercy national school on 30 September 1994 was 282 pupils, which warrants a staffing in the 1995-96 school year of a principal and nine assistants.  Accordingly, the tenth assistant's post will be suppressed at the end of the current school year.  The teacher in question has been given the option of having his name placed on the diocesan panel for redeployment, which will not take place before 1 September 1995.</P>
      <P>In addition to the staffing details which I have mentioned above, this school has the services of two full time special additional assistant teachers who cater for the special needs of pupils suffering mild and moderate degrees of handicap and who are included in the overall enrolment of the school.</P>

      <P>It is understood that a purchase agreement for a building adjacent to the courthouse in Delvin was signed in January 1993 by the chairperson of County Westmeath Vocational Education Committee, Mr. H. Abbot.  The purchase price agreed was £30,000 and £10,000 of this was paid in January 1993.  The purpose of the purchase was to enable Youthreach trainees to acquire relevant training and work experience in renovating the site. A valuer's report was not sought.  The building has been used for storage and some initial renovation work.  A plan was prepared proposing the development of the building as a hotel and catering centre, for use in training and work experience, and this was approved in principle by the vocational education committee in March 1994.  However, the renovation work has not been completed.</P>
      <P>My Department approved the provision and funding, under the usual conditions, of a Youthreach centre in Delvin.  Youthreach is usually provided in rented premises.</P>
      <P>Ministerial approval is necessary for the purchase of property by a vocational education committee and no such approval was given in this case.  In the circumstances, this matter will be subject to further investigation by my Department.</P>

Furthermore, the regulations provide that the commissioner shall do so if he is satisfied that the applicant for a licence &ldquo;is not engaged in any occupation which, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is likely to impair his efficiency or to conflict with his responsibilities or to be incompatible with his employment as a driver of small public service vehicles&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that the person in question had his application refused by them following interview, and that he was so informed on 16 February 1995 and of the reason why.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Back to Work Allowance</i>
      </P>
      <P>The back to work allowance was introduced in October 1993 to encourage the long term unemployed and lone parents to return to the active labour force while retaining a percentage of their social welfare entitlements and secondary benefits.  At present there are 5,625 participants of whom 3,686 are involved in self employment projects.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Third Level Allowance</i>
      </P>
      <P>This scheme is for unemployed people and lone parents who have obtained a place at third level education. They can attend a full time undergraduate third level course at any third level institution, university, regional technical college or a technical college of the Dublin Institute of Technology. The number of persons participating in this scheme in the current academic year is 1,228.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Part Time Education</i>
      </P>
      <P>Under this scheme, people on unemployment benefit or assistance may attend certain part time education courses without affecting their ongoing weekly unemployment payments.  They simply have to demonstrate to their local Social Welfare office that they are still actively looking for work and that the part time course is likely to improve their chances of getting a job.  As the unemployment payments are ongoing, statistics are not kept of the numbers availing of this facility.</P>

      <P>Share fishermen who are engaged under a contract for service as their principal means of support are insured for a limited range of benefits.

As a result they have to be regarded as self-employed persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special scheme for share fishermen engaged under contract for service was introduced in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1993, which allows those persons to join an optional social insurance <Col N="1554" /> scheme.  The new scheme enables them to top up self-employed contributions and provides entitlement to treatment benefits for themselves and their spouses and also disability and unemployment benefits.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1555" /> Section 9 (6) (g) of the Consumer Information Act, 1978 provides that the Director of Consumer Affairs shall `ensure that the provisions of any legislation providing for the protection of consumers that, in his opinion, should be brought to the attention of the public and for this purpose to publicise those provisions in such manner and to such extent as he thinks appropriate&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that these arrangements are working well.</P>
    <P>I indicated in reply to a question on 15 February, 1995 (Volume 449 &mdash; (No. 2) Col. No. 437) that I had recently signed regulations the effect of which is to outlaw all unfair terms in consumer contracts which have not been individually negotiated.  Further major legislative measures planned by me for 1995, which shall advance consumer rights and entitlements, include:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the enactment of the Consumer Credit Bill currently at Committee Stage, which regulates all forms of consumer credit;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the making of Regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972, giving effect to the EU Directive on Timeshare (Directive 94/47/EC);</P>
    <P>&mdash; new footwear labelling Regulations which will inform the consumer, through compulsory labelling indications, as to the exact nature of the materials used in the main components of footwear. </P>
    <P>Finally, I should say that I continue to keep the needs of consumers under review in the light of both domestic and international developments.</P>

      <P>The details sought by the Deputy on project funding for 1995 are available in the recently published Book of Estimates.  The annual employment survey, carried out by Forfás, formerly by the IDA, details the employment in all manufacturing and internationally traded service companies in the State known to the industrial development agencies.  The employment in those companies at the end of 1994 was just over 218,000 people.</P>
      <P>As far as anticipated job creation levels are concerned.  I refer the Deputy to the recently published Operational Programme for Industrial Development 1994 &mdash; 1999 which sets out a job creation target of 20,000 gross new jobs per annum over the period of the programme. I expect that this target will be achieved by Forbairt, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development in 1995.</P>
      <P>Details supplied by the 35 county enterprise boards for their first full year of operation indicate that in 1994, some 1,776 full time and 263 part time jobs were created.  The Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development sets out a target for the creation of 8,000 new jobs over the duration of the operation programme: 1994-1999.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The code of practice on dispute procedures, including procedures in essential services, drawn up by the Labour Relations Commission and published in January, 1992, aims to ensure that disputes are resolved without resource to industrial action by providing practical guidance on procedures for the resolution of disputes. The code places particular emphasis on the avoidance of disputes in essential services, with additional safeguards set out for inclusion in employer-trade union agreements in such services.</P>
      <P>Adoption of the code is primarily a matter for negotiation and agreement between employers and trade unions in accordance with the voluntary nature of our collective bargaining system. However, I am concerned that adequate procedural arrangements should be in place and be followed if industrial relations are to be conducted in a professional manner.  The need for procedural safeguards in organisations providing essential services is widely acknowledged.</P>
      <P>Regrettably progress on the adoption of the code's provisions has been disappointing. Because of the lack of progress consultations were held with the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Labour Relations Commission with a view to establishing a basis on which the negotiation of better procedures could be further encouraged, particularly in essential services.</P>
      <P>Arising from this consultative process, the Labour Relations Commission, under the auspices of its advisory service, is currently carrying out a detailed review, involving managements and trade unions in a range of organisations providing essential services.  The purpose of the review is to establish the potential for improving the procedures and processes used in dispute resolution. A senior official from my Department is assisting the advisory service with this review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1559" /> Sixteen organisations providing essential services have been selected for this review.  The officials carrying out the review are in the process of meeting management and unions in these organisations with a view, <i>inter alia,</i> to (i) discovering what action has been taken so far in relation to the adoption of the code; (ii) finding out what dispute procedures are already in place in these organisations; (iii) getting the views of the parties as to what difficulties they are experiencing or foresee in adopting the code; and (iv) providing encouragement and support to the parties in their efforts to make progress on the adoption of the code.</P>
    <P>There are many complex issues to be addressed in the review, which will involve meetings with over 40 different parties as there is more than one union in many of these organisations.  It will, therefore, take some time to carry out the review.  The commission has undertaken to make available to me the outcome of the review as soon as it is completed.</P>

      <P>The science and technology budget allocation for 1992 was £27.8 million, all of which was voted expenditure.  Although the pilot phase of a new industry research and development initiative was launched during 1992, funding for it only commenced in 1993.  The figures for 1995 are £20.7 million and £15.148 million respectively, giving a total of some £35.848 million for this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>It is now widely recognised that badgers play a role in the transmission of bovine TB and there is a growing body of scientific evidence to support this opinion.  This was the consensus <Col N="1562" /> view expressed at the Royal Irish Academy Conference on &ldquo;The Badger&rdquo; which was held in 1991, proceedings of which are now published, and at an international seminar held in London in November 1993 under the aegis of the British Ministery of Agriculture.  In addition, a review by the Economic and Social Research Institute entitled &ldquo;Badgers and Bovine TB in Ireland&rdquo;, published in 1989, indicates that in many areas of the country it may not be possible to control bovine TB without controlling the badger population. There is a growing evidence to support this conclusion.</P>
    <P>The badger is a protected species under the Wildlife Act, 1976, and may be removed only under licence for research purposes, strictly in accordance with conditions specified by the Wildlife Service of the Office of Public Works. In the context of the bovine TB eradication scheme my Department applies for licences where tuberculosis infected badgers have been identified in areas with high levels of bovine TB.</P>
    <P>While there are no regulations governing the collection of carcases of dead badgers, all reported cases are utilised in the research programme.</P>
    <P>This Department co-funded a national badger census with the Wildlife Service.  The census was completed over a four year period and the furnished report is now awaiting publication. The primary focus of the census was to determine the overall badger population.</P>
    <P>ERAD's research is focused on the role of the badger in the spread of TB and other possible causes of disease spread.  The development of a vaccine is being actively pursued.  A report on the Feasibility of Developing a Vaccine against Tuberculosis for use in the Badger was published jointly by this Department and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland in June 1994.  In August a World Health Organisation meeting in Geneva was held to further the development of such a vaccine and a collaborative programme has a scheduled starting date in <Col N="1563" /> 1995.  This may be part-funded by the European Union.</P>

      <P>The rate of aid payable under the scheme of investment aid for upgrading on-farm dairying facilities is related to the quota size of participants and priority under the scheme is given to smaller producers. For farmers with quotas up to 15,000 gallons the rate of aid is 60 per cent, for those in the 15,001 to 30,000 gallon bracket and for those in the 30,001 to 40,000 gallon range it is 40 per cent and 25 per cent respectively.  Farmers with quotas of more than 40,000 gallons are not eligible.  The producer to whom the Deputy refers is eligible for the 40 per cent grant rate.</P>

      <P>The general information requested by the Deputy on the funds available in 1995 to my Department or agencies under its aegis to fund or grant aid projects is contained in the recently published Estimates for Public <Col N="1564" /> Services (Abridged Version) under Votes 31 and 32.</P>
      <P>In common with other developed countries, employment in Irish agriculture has been gradually falling over the past decades.  The overall level of employment in the agriculture, forestry, food and drinks sector now stands at 180,000 which represents 15.3 per cent of total employment in Ireland. Employment in primary agriculture is expected to decline, but with Union financed schemes operated by my Department, it is hoped to encourage diversification and alternative farm enterprises, many of which will offer greater opportunity for sustainable employment.  In addition, employment in added value food processing and in timber processing is also expected to increase.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy requires more specific information on particular categories of projects.  I will make this information available to him on request.</P>

      <P>In 1990, the old barracks in Cavan town <Col N="1567" /> was closed and the troops stationed there were relocated to the new barracks, Dun Ui Neill.  Three civilian employees were relocated to the new barracks.  The military post at Cootehill, County Cavan, was closed in the same year and the troops stationed there were relocated to Dun Ui Neill and to Monaghan barracks.  Six civilian employees were relocated to Dun Ui Neill and two of these were subsequently transferred to Monaghan barracks.  The military post at Fort Dunree, County Donegal, was closed also in 1990 and the troops stationed there were relocated to Rockhill and Lifford military posts.  Two civilian employees accepted voluntary redundancy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>A current application for a harbour works order to reclaim an area at the Sealink freight terminal, now the coastal line terminal has not been received by the Department.</P>
      <P>Dublin Port and Docks Board made an application, in December, 1987, to the Minister for the Marine for a harbour works order to reclaim an area of 21 hectares east of the Sealink freight terminal and to construct a quay on the river side of the reclaimed area.  The application was advertised in the press and a substantial number of objections were received.  The application was not proceeded with following a request, in January 1990, from Dublin Port to the Minister to defer making any decision until after the board's officials had completed discussions with the community groups concerned with the proposed development and a detailed report submitted to the Department.  This report was not received.</P>
      <P>In view of the length of time that has elapsed since this application was received.  I consider that any proposal for reclamation of land in this area must be subject to a new application from the board.</P>
      <P>The mechanisms in place to deal with a proposal for land reclamation in Dublin Port are set out under the Harbours Act, 1946 which empowers the Minister to authorise a harbour authority to construct, <i>inter alia,</i> quays, embankments or other works subject to such conditions and restrictions as the Minister thinks proper.  Under section 136 of the Act, the Harbour Authority must publish such notice of the proposed Order as the Minister may direct so that any interested party may make representations or objections which the Minister must take into account in deciding whether or not to make the Order. Section 137 of the Act provides for the holding of a local inquiry in regard to a proposed Harbour Works Order, if the Minister thinks fit.</P>
