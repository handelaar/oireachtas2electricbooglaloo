      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I met Commissioner Flynn in my office last Friday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney is lucky, at least she got an answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am lucky to have had the question placed on the Order Paper. I presume Commissioner Flynn <Col N="2" /> expressed his appreciation that this Government did not withdraw his name for renomination?  Did the Taoiseach discuss with Commissioner Flynn arrangements for the Intergovernmental Conference and outstanding issues on the finalisation of the Community Support Framework for Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first question is that I do not expect Commissioner Flynn to express thanks to anybody.  The answer to the second question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly he expressed his appreciation publicly and, I am sure, has also done so privately.  On the issues which will arise within the context of the Intergovernmental Conference &mdash; in particular, the matters of our neutrality <Col N="3" /> and enlargement of the EU &mdash; will the Taoiseach say whether the Irish position will be discussed within the context of the Tánaiste's White Paper?  Is the Taoiseach in a position to tell us when that White Paper may be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are having an extension of the subject matter of the question now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>These are entirely separate questions.  I would prefer if the Deputy put specific questions on those matters because I am sure she is as anxious as I am that she should receive comprehensive, full information.  As she knows, the appropriate way of obtaining it is by tabling appropriately phrased questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I put the question in this form is that it is so difficult to get questions to the Taoiseach on the Order Paper, so I was endeavouring to keep it very specific.  Will the Taoiseach say what he discussed with Commissioner Flynn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not customary after a meeting of this nature to give a detailed account of everything discussed.As I am sure the House will be aware, it is important that there be confidential discussions between the Government and all Commissioners, including the Irish one.  Therefore, the information I could give would be of a general kind only.  I would ask the Deputy not to seek specific or additional details in regard to those matters.  We discussed the development of the special initiative on Northern Ireland, preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference, the possibility of a visit by President Jacques Santer &mdash; the subject of another question &mdash; and a range of general matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach say why his office does not agree to <Col N="4" /> accept the majority of questions from the Leader of Fianna Fáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the Leader of Fianna Fáil has not yet taken up the offer I made to him, of a briefing, on how best to frame questions to ensure they are in order for answer by the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is arrogance; the Taoiseach is dictating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Please, Deputies, this kind of argument should not take place now.  There are other ways and means of dealing with that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will not answer questions tabled to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that the attacks by a small number of MEPs on Commissioner Flynn were wholly unjustified and that the Council for the Status of Women and several other women's organisations have congratulated Commissioner Flynn on the excellent work he has done on women's issues since becoming a Commissioner?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is quite an extension of the question, which merely asked what plans, if any, the Taoiseach has to meet the Irish EU Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the proceedings of another Parliament, the European Parliament, but obviously, given that the Government had the option of not continuing Commissioner Flynn's nomination after the change of Government but did so, it is plain that the Government has a good opinion of Commissioner Flynn's general abilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, a Cheann Comhairle, but we are fast moving away from that position.  We have four questions tabled today and one tomorrow. The Taoiseach two weeks ago suggested having a discussion on questions &mdash; clearly he will not answer questions on Northern Ireland; nobody can table a question to the Taoiseach on Northern Ireland and everything in relation to Northern Ireland is a matter for the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that is not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy had seven years in which to answer questions and has forgotten how to ask them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing on the Order Paper in relation to this subject today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's Office stated that he would answer questions on speeches he had made but when we contacted his office afterwards, they said none of his speeches had been circulated.When we inquired whether we could pose questions on his official engagements we received a reply in the affirmative yet, when we posed such a question, his reply was that he had no official responsibility to the Dáil, which you clarified for me, a Cheann Comhairle, so, the fact is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to respect and assist the Leader of the main Opposition party in this House, that is my duty, but he must co-operate with me in respect of what is appropriate on the Order of Business and at Question Time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If we put down a general question as Deputy Harney has <Col N="6" /> done we are told it is not a specific question and if we put down a specific question it is transferred because it is not the Taoiseach's responsibility.  He has five Ministers of State and he passes questions to them.  It is practiclly impossible to frame a question to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for the Government of the day, the Cabinet and the Taoiseach.  I suggest that you deliberate between each other at a more appropriate time rather than fighting it out here at Question Time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Day to day matters concerning relations with Northern Ireland are a matter, as Deputies well know from precedents set by previous Governments, for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  There is a clear division of responsibility in regard to both functional activities and answerability for questions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

I recognise that the relationship between our head of Government and the head of the Commission is a very important relationship for Ireland.  It has been traditional European policy here to support and enhance the powers of the Commission in European affairs because of the very good record of the European Commission in supporting the interests of smaller countries, particularly Ireland.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore the leaking of material on the budget.  I have asked the head of each relevant Department or office to carry out an internal investigation into the leaking of budget material which occurred recently.  The investigations are being co-ordinated by the Secretary of the Department of Finance.I have asked that a critical part of these investigations should be the recommendation of mechanisms designed to avoid the recurrence of the incidents we have just experienced.</P>
      <P>I would like to stress that I would welcome a more open approach to budgetary information in the future with less emphasis on secrecy and greater emphasis on the provision of better information to the public on the choices that have to be made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>However, any rules concerning confidentiality that exist now or in the future must be abided by. I believe that the budget introduced by the Minister for Finance last Wednesday was an excellent one and focused on the priorities facing this country at the present time.  It was a <Col N="16" /> budget which has shown &mdash; by the political agreement between the three parties in Government &mdash; that the parties in Government can work together to produce a coherent response to these issues.</P>
      <P>For the record, dealing with budgetary leaks, it is important to note that there were substantial leaks of confidential budgetary material in the past when both of the Opposition parties, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, were in office.</P>
      <P>For example, in 1990, with a Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government, the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme, eight hours before the Minister's budget speech carried a leaked report, with specific, detailed and accurate information on seven items, including the new top rate of income tax, the new VAT rate, the increase in the standard income tax band, the increase in social welfare payments and the changes in PRSI.</P>
      <P>In another broadcast RTE announced, again accurately, that there would be no increases in excise rates in the budget on the so called &ldquo;old reliables&rdquo;, but that unleaded petrol would be cut by 5 pence a gallon.</P>
      <P>In 1994, when Deputy Bertie Ahern was Minister for Finance, in the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme, eight hours before the budget speech, a leak was given containing 15 items, including the widening of the standard income tax band, the abolition of the income levy, the exact rate of increase in the child allowance, the precise change to residential property tax, the precise details of changes in mortgage interest and VHI relief, a £100 million fund for low interest loans, and the fact that workers on low incomes would be exempt from health, employment and training levies.</P>
      <P>Earlier, RTE also reported that social welfare rates were to be increased by 3 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, also in 1994, two days before the budget,<i>The Irish Times</i> carried a front page lead story, in particular on the abolition of the 1 per cent income levy.  Also the <i>Irish Independent,</i><Col N="17" /> over two days, carried detailed page one stories which leaked specific items from the budget on the residential property tax changes and child benefit increases.</P>
    <P>So it is quite clear that a pattern of leaks of sensitive budget information had been established long before this Government came into office.  I have made inquiries into how these leaks from the previous Government were dealt with.  I understand there is no record of any investigation undertaken by the then Ministers for Finance into the extensive leaks which took place either in 1990 or in 1994.</P>
    <P>Stephen Collins, a respected political commentator with the <i>Sunday Press</i> made some relevant observations last Sunday about the hypocrisy of Opposition politicians and the media over these leaks.  He said:</P>
    <P>A great deal of comment on this, both by Opposition politicians and the media, has been hypocritical in the extreme.</P>
    <P>For a start, this is not the first year of major budget leaks.  Such leaks have been a feature of political life for almost a decade.</P>
    <P>Mr. Collins goes on to say:</P>
    <P>There may be some excuse for Opposition TDs trying to make a bit of political capital out of Budget leaks, regardless of their own record on the matter, the wave of indignation in the media at the leaks is baffling.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most important lesson all parties can learn from this experience is that we need to design a totally new approach to the annual budget process. I expect the Secretary of the Department of Finance, and his colleague secretaries, to now bring forward urgently recommendations for Government to do just that.</P>

      <P>I ommitted to answer part of Deputy Brennan's question which I wish to answer.  I am not yet in a position to make a definitive statement on publication of the report because it is not yet complete although it is proceeding rapidly.  A great deal of progress has been made in one Department in particular and I compliment all officials involved on the speed with which the investigation is been conducted.I hope the House will understand that the findings of the report may prejudice the interests of individuals outside the House and it may not be possible for total publication of the report in view of the civil rights involved for persons outside the House.  I assure the House, Ministers will give as much information as possible in response to questions and I would like answers to <Col N="21" /> why previous Governments did not carry out similar investigations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously it was long after the budget that I became aware of the issue of material to the Fine Gael Press Office.  It is something about which I take a serious view because even though that information was not disclosed to a third party it is clear that such information should not be disclosed outside the public service, and Deputy Hogan, in a very honourable <Col N="22" /> way, has accepted responsibility for that matter.  The social welfare inquiry has proceeded rapidly and I understand it is at a very advanced stage.  It has demonstrated quite clearly that the Minister, Minister of State and political advisers were not involved.  A definite line of inquiry, including admissions of responsibility, has been achieved to date in terms of people who were not acting out of political motivation and had no political involvement that I know of.</P>

      <P>The investigations are not complete and it is a matter for the Minister concerned to make a decision on that matter.  I believe that some of the people concerned freely admitted what happened, which obviously facilitated the inquiry considerably, and by so doing removed the possible risk of suspicion attaching to others.  In consideration of any diciplinary course that might be appropriate due account should be taken of the fact that if the persons concerned had not been honest in answering questions a great more difficulty might have been unjustly caused for others.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to an old age non-contributory pension is determined by reference to the age of the applicant, whether they are resident in the State and whether they satisfy a means test. The means test is similar to that used to determine entitlement to all social assistance schemes and takes account of any income the applicant or his or her spouse or partner may have as well as property, except their home, or assets which are capable of providing an income.  It includes an assessment of the value of any capital or investments held by the applicant.  For old age non-contributory pension purposes, an initial £200 of capital is disregarded, 5 per cent of the next £375 is assessed and the balance is assessed at the 10 per cent rate. The figure arrived at is then divided by 52 to obtain the weekly means and £1 is <Col N="29" /> added to the weekly value thus calculated.Any improvements in the means test generally would have significant financial implications which could only be considered in the context of additional resources being made available.</P>
      <P>The national fuel scheme assists householders who are on long term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  One fuel allowance is payable per household.  All people in receipt of a non-contributory pension automatically qualify for payment under the national fuel scheme as their means are already assessed as for pension purposes.</P>
      <P>At present, where a contributory pensioner and his household have a combined income, from any source, of more than £5 a week above the relevant contributory social welfare pension, they will not qualify for the fuel allowance. However, as announced in the budget, I will be increasing this limit to £10 per week for the heating season commencing next October.  The effect of this increase is that more people on low incomes will qualify for the fuel allowance next winter.</P>

      <P>I welcome the increase in the allowance under the national fuel scheme for £5 to £10 which will be of benefit to many elderly people who need a great deal more heat than younger people.  However, a sum of £6 per week or £300 per annum is derisory in terms of income where an old age pensioner and those on assistance receive a reduced rate on anything they receive over £1 per day.</P>

      <P>I agree that many of the social welfare payments are inadequate to meet people's needs and it is my intention to improve that position during my time in office.  Deputies will be aware that there has been no increase in the fuel allowance since 1987 and any increase obviously depends on the availability of resources, bearing in <Col N="30" /> mind that a £1 increase in the fuel allowance costs approximately £7 million in a full year.</P>

      <P>Only £200 is disregarded before an elderly person qualifies for a reduced pension; this leads to much crime.  People at that stage of their lives like to put a few pounds aside.  If they lodge money in their local post offices or banks it is considered part of their means, so they tend to leave it in the house. Criminals regularly raid houses and beat these unfortunate people up.  Will the Minister increase the amount disregarded in means testing elderly people?</P>

      <P>I apologise for my intervention but the Deputy's remarks conjured up visions of elderly people roaming the countryside engaging in crime.  I appreciate the point he was making that if they keep money at home this may encourage criminals to burgle them.  That is a serious matter and I would encourage any elderly person who has resources to put them in a safe place, preferably a bank or credit union.  I am conscious that elderly people in particular fear they will not <Col N="31" /> have enough money to live on, to heat their homes, pay for electricity and so on.  I will consider the possibility of adjusting the means test but I caution the Deputy not to raise expectations that anything major can be done in the foreseeable future because of the costs involved in extending it greatly.</P>
      <P>The means test does not relate only to the amount of cash on hands; a very small amount of cash would not be taken into account in means testing elderly persons where property and capital are primarily taken into account.  It seems fair, in order to allocate the available resources as evenly as possible to those who need it most, that there be an adequate means test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 36, 37 and 172 together.</P>
      <P>Precise figures are difficult to calculate in this area but it is estimated that up to 50,000 self-employed people may fail to qualify for an old age contributory pension because they were over 56 in 1988 when PRSI for the self-employed was introduced.  Some of these people, however, are likely to qualify for an old age non-contributory pension which is payable subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension, a person must have, <i>inter alia</i>, entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since it was introduced in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to the pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the Social Insurance Fund.</P>
      <P>All persons who enter social insurance after age 56 are entitled to a refund of the old age pension part of their contributions provided that they do not qualify for an old age contributory or a non-contributory pension. Accordingly, self-employed people who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension, and are entitled to a partial refund of contributions.</P>
      <P>Self-employed people in that age group, who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56 could, depending on their total contribution record, qualify for the old age contributory pension as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension entitlement purposes.As these people first entered the social insurance system prior to age 56 they are not entitled to a refund of contributions in the event of failing to qualify for a pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations dealing with refunds is under review within my Department <Col N="34" /> and the issue raised by the Deputy will be considered in the context of this review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is taking Question No. 36 with Question No.6.  His reply is contradictory; in the earlier part he states that all those who fail to qualify for a pension will be entitled to a refund.  He also made this point in reply to Question No.227 on 24 January in which he stated that refund of the old age pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance less than ten years before pension age and failed to qualify.  As can be seen, this is not the case.  Some of those who entered the self-employed pension scheme after 1988 paid contributions for two years in the 1950s and because of this they are debarred from receiving a refund or a pension.  This is an anomaly in this system and I ask the Minister to give a commitment that he will ensure it is changed.</P>
      <P>As the Minister rightly pointed out, the old age pension scheme was introduced in 1961, 27 years before the self-employed were allowed to contribute. During that period they did not have the option of making contributions despite the fact that they were working. It seems unreasonable that the Department would debar them from paying contributions.  At the very least they should be entitled to a <i>pro rata</i> pension. It seems that they are being badly treated by the Department.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My reply is not contradictory; if the Deputy reads it closely she will find that those who cannot qualify for a refund paid contributions before they reached the age of 56.  These contributions are taken into account along with the contributions paid after they reached the age of 56 for pension purposes.  Only those who started to pay contributions under the 1988 scheme after they reached the age of 56 and had no previous contributions can claim if for instance they do not <Col N="35" /> qualify for a non-contributory pension.  I acknowledge that this area is extremely complex.  New pension entitlements have been introduced. In order to try to balance the costs to the Social Insurance Fund and because of the need to receive an adequate contribution from those who will eventually qualify for a pension certain regulations had to be introduced.I am in the process of having these regulations and contribution conditions reviewed so that we can eliminate as many anomalies as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>As the self-employed were not allowed to contribute during the 27 year period, 1961-1988, the least they should be entitled to is a <i>pro rata</i> pension.  It is not their fault that they were not allowed to contribute.It is unfair that the ten year rule applies in their case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <P>I will certainly arrange to have the Department examine that aspect of it.  Recommendations from the Pensions Board on this whole area are currently being examined also. Trying to regularise people's entitlements to pensions is a major task.  In the next decade we face a fairly rapid expansion of the numbers of people on pensions and whatever we put in place now must be consistent with ensuring that people in old age have an adequate income and that we can actually afford to pay the income we are promising.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 17, 39, 173, 174, 175 and 181 together.</P>
      <P>This is an extremely important area on which I have a fairly detailed reply. If, at any point, Deputies wish to intervene, I would be quite happy to interrupt my reply but the information I am providing will be useful to Deputies.</P>
      <P>Guidelines on rent and mortgage supplementation under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme were issued by my Department to health boards in 1988 for the information of community welfare officers administering this element of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
      <P>By 1990, these guidelines were considered to offer inadequate information to health boards on issues arising in administering an increasingly complex scheme.  Accordingly, my predecessor initiated a review of the guidelines which is now nearing completion.  I intend to publish the revised guidelines, but no useful purpose would be served by incurring costs in publishing the now out-of-date 1988 guidelines.  However, I have arranged for my Department to send a copy of the 1988 guidelines to Deputies and Senators who request a copy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total expenditure on the rent and <Col N="38" /> mortgage supplement element of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, on a health board basis since 1987, is not available.  This type of information was provided for in 1994, following the introduction of a new system for the collection of data relating to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>However, the 1994 full year figures are not yet available.  Total estimated expenditure for all health boards on rent and mortgage supplementation under the supplimentary welfare allowance scheme for years 1989 to 1994 is set out in a tabular statement which I will make available to the Deputies by circulating it in the Official Report.  This statement shows that expenditure has grown from £7 million in 1989 to £52.4 million in 1994.</P>
    <P>Private rented accommodation is the type of accommodation normally paid for by community welfare officers by way of a rent supplement.  Bed and breakfast type accommodation is not normally relied on by community welfare officers in providing assistance with housing needs under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  However, arising from their responsibilities under the 1988 Housing Act in respect of homeless people, housing authorities have entered into arrangements with health boards who may meet the needs of homeless people in this way subject to reimbursement of the boards by the housing authority.  In Dublin, for example, there is a specialised unit dealing with homeless people and staffed by Eastern Health Board community welfare officers.  The unit is part-funded by reimbursement from Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>The cost of housing homeless people in bed and breakfast on a health board basis is not available for years 1987 to date.  However, reimbursements of the local authorities by the Department of the Environment in respect of accommodation for homeless people is set out in tabular statement which I will also make available to all Deputies.  This shows that expenditure has increased <Col N="39" /> from £7,000 in 1987 to £1,359,000 in 1994.</P>
    <P>Health boards have no function in taxation matters and there is no provision in the legislation for boards to require evidence of tax compliance by the person's landlord in the context of determining entitlement to a rent supplement.Representations were made by the Revenue Commissioners to my Department in 1993 regarding the possibility of obtaining names and addresses of landlords in the Eastern Health Board whose tenants are receiving rent supplements under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  This information is held by the health boards, who administer the scheme, and not by the Department of Social Welfare.  The Social Welfare Acts provide for the exchange of information between certain bodies but it has no specific provision which would allow information to be transferred by the health boards to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>I understand the Revenue Commissioners have been in discussions with the Department of Finance with a view to taking the necessary powers to obtain the relevant information.</P>
    <P>At the end of October 1994, the number of rent and mortgage supplements in payment was 30,900 and 7,200 respectively.  In a recent analysis carried out on the source of income of clients in receipt of rent and mortgage supplements it was found that some 60 per cent of clients are in receipt of unemployment payments, 14 per cent are in receipt of basic supplementary welfare allowance, 11 per cent are in receipt of lone parent's allowance, 3 per cent are in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance and 3 per cent are in receipt of disability benefit.  The remaining 9 per cent are mostly pensioners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="40" /> Clearly, considerable State resources are being directed to the private rented sector through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme and it is important that such expenditure should represent value for money and be consistent with the thrust of State housing policy.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the increasing role of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in housing provision and the attendant financial implications, a housing review group chaired by my Department was set up in September 1994 to review the role of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in housing provision.</P>
    <P>The group consists of representatives from the local authorities, health boards, and the Departments of the Environment and Finance.  This review will attempt to identify the reasons for the increase in rent and mortgage supplements and to identify the likely trends for the future.  It will also consider what is the most cost-effective way of assisting those on social welfare incomes to meet their housing needs.  I will consider this matter further when I receive the report of the group in the coming months.</P>
    <P>The use of private rented accommodation by the State to meet housing needs should be fully integrated with existing housing policy and this is not currently happening.  One of the provisions of the Programme for Government is that all forms of social housing be administered by the local authorities and I will consider along with my Ministerial colleagues, how this can be implemented in the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  The review group findings will provide the necessary factual basis to enable informed decisions to be taken in this complex area.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on his appointment and I thank him for his comprehensive reply.  What action is the Government prepared to take to provide housing for eligible categories so that the escalating costs of rent supplements can be reduced?  Also, has the Minister any plans to review the guidelines on mortgage interest subsidies in view of the fact that mortgage interest and rent allowance will become a huge disincentive to employment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The real disincentive to employment in many instances is the low level of pay offered to people.  A specific case was brought to my attention recently where a young woman, living on her own, is expected to work for £60 net.  This woman wants to work but if she was on social welfare and entitled to a rent allowance, she would have an income in excess of £80 per week.  Because she is working she does not qualify for a rent allowance and is, therefore, in this trap.  This is an area of policy which needs to be addressed fairly quickly.  How do we deliver assistance to people for housing needs in a way which does not trap them either in unemployment or in low-paying jobs?  I hope the review group to which I have referred in my reply will address that issue and that the recommendations it brings forward will enable us to deal with that.  I also thank the Deputy for his good wishes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8,26 and 41 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The priority rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare in 1986 have been implemented.  In so far <Col N="44" /> as the main rates recommended by the commission are concerned, the programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i> contains a commitment to commission the ESRI to review these rates, with a view to recommending new rates in the light of improvements in social welfare and other changes since the report of the commission was published, and taking into account changes agreed in the programme itself.</P>
    <P>Initial discussions between officials of my Department and the ESRI have already commenced with a view to drafting the terms of reference for this review.</P>
    <P>The ESRI, with a wide variety of published reports, identified families with children as being at greatest risk of poverty.Indeed, the report of the Commission on Social Welfare itself highlighted child income support as one of the areas requiring priority attention.</P>
    <P>In this year's budget I have taken a significant step towards addressing this issue.  Social welfare and related improvements which I will be implementing will cost £90 million in 1995 and £212 million in a full year.  The increase in child benefit will account for 38 per cent of total cost of this year's budget improvements and almost 50 per cent of the full year cost.</P>
    <P>This year's budget represents the start of my work towards meeting the commitment in the programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to providing a form of basic income for children, through the creation of a child benefit supplement.  The £7 increase in child benefit represents a substantial improvement in the State's contribution toward the cost of rearing children.  The child benefit increase is in addition to other child-related measures I have taken, such as extending child benefit to 18 years olds in full-time education and the extension of child dependant allowances in respect of 22 year olds in full-time education.</P>
    <P>Having established a good basic child benefit payment this year I now intend to address the issue of the creation of the child benefit supplement which will <Col N="45" /> be payable in addition to child benefit. The supplement will be paid to all families whose income is below a certain level irrespective of whether that income is from social welfare or employment.  This base line level of support for children will target resources effectively at families with children who are at greatest risk of poverty.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that an old age pension, disability benefit, unemployment assistance and disabled person's maintenance allowance of £62.50 a week in inadequate and that he had a glorious opportunity in this budget, if he had been able to persuade his Cabinet colleague, to increase the rate to that recommended by the commission, namely £65.40 a week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Old age contributory and retirement pensions are already at 109 per cent, survivor's contributory pensions are at 99 per cent, lone parent's allowance is at 94 per cent, unemployment benefit and disability benefit are at 94 per cent, long term unemployment assistance is at 94 per cent, short term unemployment assistance is at 91 per cent and supplementary welfare allowances are also at 91 per cent of the main rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. A considerable amount of progress has been made.</P>
      <P>I emphasise that we are talking about the lower end of the rate recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare. When it produced its report in 1985 it said there were no absolute criteria on which one could decide what rate to establish but that in its view it should be somewhere between £50 and £60.  Based on indexation that would be around £66 &mdash; I do not have the exact figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To reach the lower end of the recommended rate would cost £139 million in a full year on top of what was provided this year.  To reach the top end of the rate recommended by the Commission would cost an additional £698 million. The Deputy will see, therefore, that it is an enormous task to reach the main <Col N="46" /> rates recommended by the Commission. I convinced my Cabinet colleagues that something like 35 per cent more should be spent on social welfare increases this year than was spent last year.  About £71 million was provided for increases last year and more than £90 million is being spent on increases this year.  I made a deliberate choice &mdash; for which I make no apology &mdash; to concentrate that increase on child benefit because there is strong evidence to show that the greatest risk and level of poverty is in families with children.  Like the Deputy I regard the current rates of social welfare as grossly inadequate, but this is a position I inherited from previous administrations and I intend, in so far as I can from the resources that will be made available to me and for which I will fight over the next two budgets, to redress the lack of progress made by previous administrations in providing adequate income for those on social welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I can only wish that the Minister will do better than he did this year because, however he twists the figures, he only succeeded in convincing his Cabinet colleagues to provide a 2.5 per cent increase, the lowest for 30 years.  It is a bit much that the Minister should, in his new-found middle class cosiness where he earns £1,000 a week, expect an old age pensioner to live on £62.50 and if, by any chance, that old age pensioner puts a few pounds aside to have a decent funeral, he is docked&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a joke to ask people to put money in a safe place when for doing so they are charged a rate of 10 per cent.  One would not get 10 per cent in any institution in the country but that is what unfortunate old age pensioners and people on marginal incomes are charged.  Further, is the Minister satisfied that £37.50 for an adult dependant is realistic in 1995?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="47" />
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made it clear that I do not regard the current rates as being adequate in any sense, even those that have reached or are almost at the lower end of the Commission on Social Welfare recommendations.I honestly do not know how people on those rates of payment survive and while I am in office I intend to do what I can to change the situation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is misrepresenting the position of old age non-contributory pensioners, whom he claims are assessed at 10 per cent of their capital. That is not accurate.  I gave statistics in an earlier reply: there is a £200 disregard of capital in the first instance before it is assessed.  The rate is lower than 10 per cent.  I think it is around 5 per cent but I would have to check it and I can convey the information to the Deputy by letter.  The 10 per cent rate is only charged on ownership of very substantial capital amounts.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is pushing an open door in relation to the adult dependant rate as I happen to believe there is no reason that an adult dependant should not be in receipt of the same amount as the main claimant.  I favour the individualisation of social welfare payments.  I hope in the course of time the Deputy will support me in trying to move in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House how he could sit at a Cabinet table that agreed to abolish a bank levy to the tune of £36 million over three years and expect people for whom he is directly responsible &mdash; and for whom I have heard him crying day in day out in the last few years &mdash; to live on £62.50 or an adult dependant to live on £37.50 per week?  It is appalling to expect individuals to live on those meagre amounts.</P>

      <P>I am giving the Deputy accurate information.  The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government abolished the levy effectively by allowing the banks to offset the money they were liable to pay against corporation tax.  What has happened in this budget is entirely revenue neutral: there is no loss to the Exchequer by simply wiping out the levy in name when it had been, in fact, abolished.  There is no loss to the Exchequer and there is no gain for the banks as a result of what has been done in the budget.</P>

      <Quest>his interpretation of the family in view of the Government's acceptance of the definition of the family given by the United Nations and the Irish Steering Committee of the 1994 International Year of the Family.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1171/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Col N="49" />
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The United Nations General Assembly proclaimed 1994 as the International Year of the Family.  The United Nations considered that the fundamental principle underlying the celebration of the international year is that the family constitutes the basic unit of society.  In doing so, it focused on a broad definition of the family, as the basic unit of society in all its forms, whether they be traditional, biological, common law, extended or one-parent.</P>
      <P>The technical definition used by the UN is as follows:</P>
      <P>Any combination of two or more persons who are bound together by ties of mutual consent, birth and/or adoption or placement and who, together, assume responsibility for, <i>inter alia,</i> the care and maintenance of group members, the addition of new members through procreation or adoption, the socialisation of children, and the social control of members.</P>
      <P>When launching the International Year of the Family in Ireland last year, my predecessor as Minister accepted that definition.  This was in line with the views of the United Nations that, given the diverse forms and functions of families from one country to another and sometimes within national boundaries, it was essential that the International Year of the Family encompass and address the needs of all families.</P>
      <P>Our Constitution describes the family as the &ldquo;natural primary and fundamental unit group of society&rdquo;.  (Article 41.1.1.) Additionally, the Constitution pledges to guard with special care the institution of marriage in which the family is founded and to protect it against attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, there are thousands of Irish families which do not fit that concept. They consist of, for example, a lone mother or father and children or a cohabiting couple with children.  So while the traditional family of breadwinner, spouse and children is still the most common, it is no longer the only family <Col N="50" /> unit.  These other family units cannot be left out in our understanding of what constitutes the family.  It is an understanding of the family which goes beyound the traditional view to encompass a complex set of relationships and which reflects the living arrangements of many Irish families today.  We need an understanding which accepts the term &ldquo;family&rdquo; as an all-embracing and all-inclusive one which covers a wide range of structures and functions and which recognises, supports and empowers families in their many diverse forms whether based on marriage or not.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the rather cumbersome definition of family as set out in the UN Charter would be inconsistent with the traditional perception of family, as we know it in Ireland?</P>
      <P>Will he confirm also that under the all embracing UN definition of family, any family form, regardless of the sexual leaning of its members, whose functions and values conform to the UN definition would be included?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree that it would.  As I have said there are thousands of Irish families, as indeed is clear from the kinds of schemes we operate in the Department of Social Welfare, which do not fit the traditional idea of family.  Irish society has moved far beyond what was thought to be the family unit when the Constitution was agreed in 1937.  Much of the language in the Constitution is inimical to the rights of women where it is implied that the only role of a woman in Irish society is to bear children and rear them in the home.  I do not believe there are many women in Irish society who accept this any longer.  I hope the expert group being established by this Government to review the Constitution and the Dáil committee which will be established towards the end of the year to review the Constitution will address that aspect of it.  It is not for me or anybody else to dictate what individuals may decide to <Col N="51" /> do in relation to family arrangements or what the sexual inclinations or leanings of family members ought to be.</P>

      <P>No, I do not accept that.  The UN definition is intended to encompass many different forms of family which are common in Ireland and other parts of the world.  We are no longer a totally Catholic society, if we ever were.  There are many people in our society with different religions or with no religion.  It is not for us to dictate their family arrangements.  As regards Article 41 of the Constitution, we know it prohibits divorce and remarriage in Ireland.  I hope in the not too distant future we will have a referendum to change Article 41 and I hope it is successful.For too long we have allowed the ban on divorce and remarriage to blight the lives of thousands of citizens.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if he will review the method of assessing means of smallholders for unemployment assistance purposes; and, in particular, if he will take into consideration the farm income assessment by the inspector of taxes for each smallholder who applies for unemployment assistance.</Quest>
      <QRef>[2988/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Social welfare legislation provides for the assessment of smallholders means as the gross yearly income from the holding less expenses necessarily incurred.  It is a factual assessment and is designed to reflect the actual net income to the smallholder from working his farm.  I presume there may be women smallholders.I will have to talk to my Department about gender-proofing my replies in future.</P>
      <P>In computing income, account is taken of the value of sales of milk, livestock, crops and subsidy payments such as headage payments.  All expenses actually and necessarily incurred are deducted from this.  These include the cost of fertilisers, repairs to farm building and fences, the cost of replacing farm machinery, use of hired labour other than family members, the cost of electricity and transport used for farming purposes, veterinary expenses, purchases of fodder and animal feed, rent of land, crop sprays etc.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The claimant is given a copy of the report by the investigating officer on the sources of income and expenses and is also given details of how the deciding <Col N="53" /> officer has calculated the means and how this determines the rate of assistance payable.</P>
    <P>In practice, most smallholders applicants for unemployment assistance are not liable for tax and are not required to submit tax returns.  In so far as any assessments which are available show the factual income position, as required under social welfare legislation, they would be used by the social welfare inspector in preparing his report. However, the use of tax assessments would not be a reliable approach in all cases.</P>
    <P>Any smallholder who is dissatisfied with the rate of means assessed may apply for a review or may appeal the assessment to the independent social welfare appeals office.  The procedure in this regard is the same as for all categories of claimant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that we have a charter of rights for farmers would the Minister agree to allow smallholders the same right as other farmers, that is, to bring in a farm assessment agreed by the inspector of taxes?  Contrary to what the Minister said, I have come across cases where the farm assessment by the inspector of taxes is less than that compiled by the social welfare officer.</P>

      <P>I understand it is proposed to develop a charter of rights for farmers but it is not yet in existence. Obviously, I will have some interest in it when it comes up for discussion.  The present system is fair to all concerned. It would be unfair to have a different form of assessment for smallholders than for other claimants for social welfare.The fact that most, if not all, smallholders are satisfied with the current arrangements is evidenced by the fact that there are few appeals against the assessments made.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that depreciation is not allowed in the assessment of smallholders?  The reason for the small number of appeals <Col N="54" /> is there is no use appealing the assessment.The appeal must be based on wrong information or wrong assessment not on the system being unfair.  Would the Minister accept that it is unfair and totally against the spirit of enterprise to have a pound for pound assessment for small farmers?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.  The money paid to smallholders is a valuable way of assisting them to remain on their holdings.  I am aware, as are those who raised the question, of the extent to which some smallholders live in a precarious financial position.  I am pleased that the Department of Social Welfare are in a position to assist them but it is only fair that such assistance is based on the actual income of those concerned.  It would be invidious to have a system of assessment for smallholders which would be different from or more favourable than that applied to other persons in similar circumstances, for example, small business people who may have fallen on hard times.  Repairs to buildings and so on are allowed for in assessments. Depreciation is not provided for in means tests and it would not be proper to do so.  Farmers have other ways of availing of such benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the Minister.  There is a completely different system for medical card assessment. When it suits a Department it says we will assess a farmer's income in a different way.  It is sometimes very difficult to make out what is on the report which is made available to small farmers because social welfare officers do not have the typing facilities to print a report.  Will the Minister look at that?  As regards the charter for farmers, the least to which a farmer is entitled is to see the printed report.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is possible for people to live in reasonable dignity, even though they are dependent on social welfare, have reached old age, suffer infirmity or are unable to find work in normal employment.  In current circumstances in which smallholders, who are after all owners of land, have capital, it is useful to have a system of providing them with assistance to remain on their land.  If a change is to be effected in the assessment of means, it will have to be applicable to all claimants of social welfare, not merely to smallholders.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not think it is about time change was effected as there is chaos when different means are used for assessing self-employed people, regardless of, whether they are farmers?  For example, if somebody applies for a medical card or a higher education grant, if another has a query in respect of income tax and perhaps another in regard to a pension, officals from different Departments assess them.  Surely their income is the same no matter which Department assesses it?  Will the Minister agree it is time this assessment was streamlined and rationalised?  Furthermore, since the Department of Agriculture pays headage grants, which will be taken into account in reducing the amount of unemployment assistance to some <Col N="57" /> unfortunate small farmer, has the Minister any plans to rationalise this means of assessment for self-employed people generally?</P>

      <P>I intend to investigate means-testing in general in so far as it is undertaken by my Department. Of course, it would be very nice if we could have circumstances in which all Departments applied the same criteria &mdash; I am not too sure how practical that would be at this juncture &mdash; but it is something I would be interested in following up.  I must emphasise that social welfare payments to smallholders are intended to ensure that they do not fall below a certain level of income.  I have already made the point that I do not regard the level already provided as adequate for a whole range of people on social welfare, but it is not intended as a substitute for income earned from farming or any other kind of work or activity.</P>

      <Quest>the reason for his Department's refusal to pay unemployment benefit to two people (details supplied) in County Donegal in spite of the fact that their P60s show that they have paid A1 contributions in respect of the governing year; and in view of the commitment to the Select Committee on Social Affairs on 2 December 1993, that the contributions made in the 1992/1993 tax year would be honoured, if he will have arrangements made for payment of all such benefits.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The two people concerned are share-fishermen.  Prior to 1986 all fishermen were treated as employees under the PAYE and PRSI systems and were thus covered for all social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>In 1986 a High Court judgment ruled in the case of a particular fishing vessel that the skipper and his crew should not be regarded as employer and employees for PAYE purposes.  However, fishermen continued to be regarded as employees for PRSI purposes until 1992 when the High Court ruled that share-fishermen should be regarded as self-employed partners.  Like other self-employed workers they are required to pay Class S social insurance contributions which are reckoned for entitlement to contributory pensions but not for unemployment or other short term social welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the unique position of share-fishermen in regard to social insurance arising out of their exclusion from insurance as employees, my predecessor made provision in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1993, to provide share-fishermen with cover for unemployment, illness and treatment benefit.  The new scheme gives share-fishermen the option of paying special additional contributions which give cover for these benefits and 154 share-fishermen availed of that option.</P>
      <P>There was confusion in the industry over the matter and some share-fishermen continued to have Class A PRSI contributions paid on their behalf for periods after the 1992 High Court judgment.  In the circumstances it was decided, as a transitional arrangement, to allow these contributions to be reckonable for entitlement to unemployment, disability and treatment benefit claims arising in the benefit years 1994 and 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am afraid it becomes even more confusing.  The position of the two share-fishermen concerned was considered in March 1994 when the owners <Col N="59" /> of the boats on which they fished sought formal decisions from my Department on the insurability of these men. Decisions were given, on 5 May 1994 in one case and on 7 June 1994 in the other, that they were deemed to be self-employed and liable to pay social insurance contributions at Class S. Those decisions were not appealed.  A refund of Class A contributions was applied for in each case and have been allowed.  Their social insurance records were amended.</P>
    <P>Both men made claims for unemployment benefit, one on 30 June 1994 and the other on 1 July 1994, which were disallowed on the grounds that they had fewer than 39 reckonable contributions paid in the governing contribution year, which was the tax year 1992-93.  Neither of the claimants appealed these decisions.  The deciding officer's decision is in line with the 1992 High Court ruling.</P>
    <P>In relation to my predecessor's commitment to the Select Committee on Social Affairs, this cannot apply in these cases since a formal decision was given on request and a refund in respect of PRSI contributions was sought and made.  In these circumstances nothing can be done to alter the position in the two cases.</P>

      <P>The focus of the document entitled &ldquo;Charter of Rights for Welfare Claimants&rdquo;, published by the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, is the treatment recipients of social welfare payments should expect to receive when dealing with my Department.  It emphasises the basic rights of an efficient service, courtesy, access to information and a presumption of honesty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the document stresses the <Col N="60" /> need to be informed when one's claim is being investigated, the right to be given the name of the person deciding the claim, and allowed the opportunity, if possible, to make a case directly to the deciding officer.  If dissatisfied with the deciding officer's decision, the person should be afforded an oral hearing by an independent third party.</P>
    <P>Much of what is advocated in the INOU charter is set out in the Programme for Government &mdash;<i>A Government of Renewal</i>.  For example, the programme lays emphasis on the importance of introducing reform in the delivery of public services with the aim of ensuring value for money, high standards of service, efficiency, courtesy and accountability.  Those objectives also figure prominently in the strategic action programmes developed by my Department in the follow-up to the strategic management initiative initiated in all Government Departments and offices last year.</P>

Does he intend to consider the request for a charter of rights and publish it, given that the request has been made by a representative organisation which deals with the problems of recipients of social welfare on a daily basis? If such an organisation recognises the priority need for a charter of rights, that recognition must be based on complaints received and difficulties claimants have encountered.  In view of the efforts of the INOU in publishing a document, will the Minister reconsider the position and agree to publish a charter to clarify beyond doubt the rights and principles outlined by him and in the charter published by the INOU?</P>

      <P>The question <Col N="61" /> specifically asked my views on the proposal by the INOU for a charter of rights for welfare claimants and that is what I have given.  People's entitlements to rights should be incorporated in our law and should not depend on a type of voluntary charter.  I can send the Deputy a copy of the values which the Department of Social Welfare developed last year following the strategic management initiative initiated by the last Government.  It runs to three pages and outlines the values which the Department will peruse, such as recognising the generation of economic progress.It also states that we value the partnership and cohesion of society and place the interest of our customers first; in our dealing with customers and others we will act with integrity, openness and courtesy; we will treat the personal information we hold in respect of our customers with the highest degree of confidentiality; we will be accountable for the funds entrusted to us; we will presume that our customers are open and honest in their dealings with us; we value the commitment and contribution of all who work in our Department; we value the work we do and the skills and capabilities we have developed to do that work effectively in response to changing needs.</P>
      <P>Reference is made to high level goals, immediate strategic objectives and so forth.  I can circulate that document to the Deputy.  Much of it is in line with what is sought by the INOU. I emphasise that the rights of people who obtain their income from the Department of Social Welfare should be enshrined in legislation and should not be dependent on some type of voluntary charter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise today to pay tribute to the memory of a former Member of this House.  Last week was an occasion to pay tribute to the memory of a former Member, the late Mr. Des Foley.  On this occasion we pay tribute to the memory of another former Member of this House who was deeply associated, as was the late Mr. Des Foley, with the Gaelic Athletic Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late Mr. Tom O'Reilly, or Big Tom as he was known, was a native of Killashandra.  He played for the Cornafein team and served in this House from 1944 to 1948.  He was elected to Cavan <Col N="200" /> County Council as an independent farmer and was also a Member of the Dáil in that capacity.  He subsequently joined Fine Gael and served that party in an organisational capacity.  He was a noted follower and player of the Gaelic Athletic Association.  He won two All Ireland medals for Cavan, the first in 1933 when, at the age of 18, he was the youngest man to have won an All Ireland medal.  Tom O'Reilly won another medal for Cavan in 1935.  He played in two other All Irelands, including the famous one in the Polo Grounds in New York in 1947.  He was a brother of the late John Joe O'Reilly.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my sympathy to Tom's widow Joan, to the O'Reilly family and all his many friends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I join the Taoiseach in extending sympathy to the O'Reilly family.  Big Tom O'Reilly, a mid-fielder, was one of the great characters of an earlier period.  Last week, as the Taoiseach said, we talked about Des Foley who was the great success of the 1960s. John Joe was doing the same job with his brother, Big Tom, exactly 30 years earlier.  From my knowledge of the GAA not alone was Big Tom on a team at 18 years of age, he was one of the longest serving captains.  All the books referred to him as a gentle giant, a man of immense talent and skill.</P>
      <P>The years 1944-48, his term in this House, were difficult for his constituency and the world.  He made his contribution which we remember today.  My research differs in one respect from that of the Taoiseach.  I agree with him on Big Tom's successes in 1933 and 1935 but, perhaps, we will let those on quizzes argue whether he actually played in the Polo Grounds.  I believe he was on the panel at that time but did not play.  However, we will not argue about that today.</P>

He made a tremendous contribution during his term in the House and became a very important developer and builder active in the property market in my native city long after his playing and political days were over.  We offer our deepest sympathy to his family and friends.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dhílis.</P>

      <P>I join previous speakers in paying tribute to the late Tom O'Reilly who was a former Member of this House and represented Cavan as an independent farmer from 1944-48.  Even at that stage he had Fine Gael leanings, subsequently joining Fine Gael and becoming actively involved in the party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is better known as a Gaelic foot-baller.He graced the fields of this country for his native Cavan in the famous blue and white when it was a team to be remembered and cherished.  He had two brothers, the great John Joe O'Reilly, who was remembered in song and verse, and the lesser known, Fr. Brian O'Reilly.All three brothers, of a family of 13, played for their native Cornfein where they won seven county championships. As the Taoiseach rightly said, he won <Col N="202" /> All Ireland medals with Cavan in 1933 and 1935 and he was a member of the Cavan team that beat Kerry in the Polo Grounds in 1947 on the only occasion when an All Ireland final was played outside Ireland.  He was a fine man and a fine sportsman.  He comes from Cornafein which has produced many great sportsmen.  Uniquely, at that time, from that small townland there were two Dáil representatives: one for Fianna Fáil, the late Michael Sheridan and Big Tom O'Reilly.  Of course Cornafein was famous for its football and today our great athlete, Caitríona McKiernan, comes from the same townland in County Cavan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with previous speakers in paying tribute to a former Independent Member of this House, Tom O'Reilly.  To his wife, Joan, his sons, daughters, brothers and sisters I wish to extend my sincere sympathy and that of the Fianna Fáil organisation throughout County Cavan.  Tom entered Dáil Éireann in June 1944 as an extremely popular young man with support from all age groups and from all classes and creeds.  He was the essence of humanity, big in character and a real gentleman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tom O'Reilly did not seek re-election in 1948 and subsequently, as Deputy Ahern said, was to develop a very successful building and property business in this city.  However, it was as an outstanding sportsman that Tom initially gained fame and became known as Big Tom.  He began his inter county career with Cavan minors and juniors in 1932. As an 18 year old he starred as a mid-fielder in Cavan's first All Ireland success in 1933.  He was to win another All Ireland medal as a player in 1935 and as a panellist in 1947 with the team that played in the Polo Grounds, in which my predecessor, John P. Wilson, was left half back.  He won three All Ireland medals with Cavan, was a player on 12 successful Cavan Ulster teams.  He also won nine county senior championships with his native Cornafein and on seven occasions was the team captain.  He was <Col N="203" /> to win Railway Cup medals with Ulster in 1942 and 1943 while his brother John Joe was the team captain.</P>
    <P>The name of the O'Reilly family, as Deputy Boylan said, is synonymous with the GAA in Cavan.  Nobody has worn the blue of Cavan or the saffron of Ulster with greater distinction.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dhílis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Foxe</NameTxt>
      <P>I also pay tribute to the memory of that great man Big Tom O'Reilly.  In the 1940s a very good friend of mine who was also a good footballer in County Roscommon was asked to run for the 1948 election.  He was not sure whether to accept.  He met his friend, Big Tom, and asked what he thought of representing Cavan people in the Dáil and whether he would run again.  Big Tom's comment was that he would much prefer to go around the county with a bag over his shoulder collecting empty bottles than take on that number again.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dhílis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has tried to present the budget as being responsible.  However, as Deputy Bertie Ahern has already shown, when allowance is made for the 1994 out-turn in current expenditure of £191 million in special expenditures as a result of the tax amnesty, the increase in budgeted current spending proposed by the Minister is 8.4 per cent above the 1994 level. If the once off use of the £108 million run down in departmental balances and social insurance fund cash balances is excluded against current expenditures as provided for in the budget, the budgeted increase in current expenditures is 9.4 per cent and, based on a number of other 1994 adjustments, results in a true budget deficit of 12 per cent of GNP.  It is clear that the budget provides for a 10.6 per cent increase in current spending over comparable 1994 levels.  This is not the figure given by the Minister to the House last week.  When the creative accounting in Minister Quinn's budget is stripped away, this will result in a 1995 current budget deficit of £470 million or 1.3 per cent of GNP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget has, therefore, weakened the Government finances at a time when they should be strengthened. European Union transfers to Ireland could fall by approximately £500 million per annum in five years.  This will have a very severe impact on the economy if the Government has not by then significantly improved its debt finance position and made the economy more competitive.The Minister has moved the country backwards, mortgaged our future and guaranteed higher taxes than would appear to be necessary.  He has <Col N="212" /> not set aside the savings necessary to pay higher interest rates on Government debt, to provide for lower taxation during times of recession or to deal with lower transfers from Europe.</P>
    <P>The economic prosperity of any country depends on the consistent application of long term prudent policies.  In 1986 the results of the bad economic policies of the then Government were obvious to all.  At that time the economy was strangled by excessive taxation and crippling Government borrowing.  In 1987 the new Fianna Fáil Government set about cutting current expenditure and put a greater emphasis on the private sector for the development of the economy.  As has been independently testified to, that programme was extremely successful in establishing a secure basis for growth in the economy and a steady improvement in the Government finances.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were returned to Government almost eight years ago the 1986 current budget deficit was £1.395 million, which was equivalent to 7.9 per cent of GNP.  Over the past seven years the current budget deficit, allowing for the economic cycle, has been steadily reduced as a percentage of gross national product, excluding, of course, the effects of the tax amnesty.  The current budget deficit was reduced during that time by Fianna Fáil and Fianna Fáil-led Governments from 6.2 per cent of GNP in 1987 to 0.7 per cent in 1994. The poorer economic conditions in 1991 and 1992 led to a set back in that trend in the public finances but the trend resumed in 1993 as economic conditions improved and further progress was made in 1994.</P>
    <P>Given the booming economic conditions this year, a current budget surplus could have been achieved if the Minister for Finance had continued the policies adopted in the late 1980s. Unfortunately, and tragically, the Minister decided to reverse course and now claims we have a current budget deficit of £310 million or 0.9 per cent of GNP. However, as I have shown the reality is much worse.  He had introduced a <Col N="213" /> budget with a hard-core 1995 current budget deficit equal to £470 million or 1.3 per cent of GNP.  I did not get this figure from the Minister for Finance last week but if he studies the figures he will see that I am accurate.</P>
    <P>The budget is financially reckless and irresponsible.  Having finally introduced a balanced budget, the Minister for Finance decided coolly, deliberately and totally unnecessarily to plunge us back into a deficit.  The sad thing is that there was absolutely no necessity for this. After seven years of solid financial and social progress, during which borrowing as a percentage of GNP was hauled down from 125 per cent to 92 per cent, the Minister for Finance now plans to continue the borrowing &mdash; a sum of £830 million in 1995 &mdash; instead of availing of the growth cycle, an option open to him, to reduce it.  Given an enlarged EU of up to 20 members, EU transfers to Ireland, which now run at approximately £2 billion per annum, will probably be reduced after 1999.  It is estimated that thereafter Ireland will receive between £500 million-£1 billion less per annum than it currently receives.  No account whatsoever is taken of this in the budget.</P>
    <P>In addition to the need to provide for this EU shortfall and possible rising interest rates, it makes good economic sense to balance the budget and store up a surplus in times of growth to provide for times of recession when one may have to run a deficit in order to maintain the social services.  As Deputy Bertie Ahern pointed out, the planned increase in public spending is well and truly over the 6 per cent suggested and could be three or four points higher. Why is the Government planning to increase public spending by three times the rate of inflation at a time of economic growth, at a time when it is totally unnecessary from an economic point of view?  It is verging on financial treason for the Government to embark on this course, and following further study of the budget, economic commentators will see that this is the case.  The Minister for Finance and the three party <Col N="214" /> Government have decided to institutionalise the current budget deficit. The sad thing is that there was absolutely no need for this substantial reversal in economic strategy.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is the lack of real strategic thinking clearer than in the area of small business.  Reducing the corporation tax rate from 40 per cent to 38 per cent will help both large and small businesses. This reduction will cost £43 million per annum.  We calculate that this will give approximately £12 million per annum to financial institutions.  This measure has been introduced in the same budget which for the first time in memory, gave an increase to old age pensioners which is less than the rate of inflation.  When I was chairman of the task force on small business we asked the Minister for Finance to consider reducing from 40 per cent to 25 per cent the rate of corporation tax for the 156 small service companies earning less than £100,000 per annum.  This would have cost £16 million, which is much less than the £43 million the Minister has given away.  It would have made much more sense, particularly to old age pensioners, to direct some of this £43 million to small businesses where it would have made a real difference rather than to the major institutions which did not ask for it.</P>
    <P>The crime is that the reduction has been spread too thinly.  I have been told during the past few days that this is the source of major disappointment to small businesses.  They had an agenda but the Minister chose to ignore it.  For example, if the reduction was confined to all companies with profits of up to £200,000 per annum the rate of corporation profits tax could have been reduced from the present level of 40 per cent to 25 per cent.  Increasingly, we look to smaller companies with profits of less than £200,000 per annum to create new jobs but the Minister chose to take the lazier route and apply the reduction across the board rather than target smaller companies which could have done with it.</P>
    <P>At current Irish pound-sterling rates <Col N="215" /> small Irish companies have to work very hard to survive and prosper.  The Minister has forgotten that in 1992 when we had similar exchange rates small Irish companies found it difficult to survive. He seems to have forgotten also that many Irish owned small businesses find themselves in a difficult position in competing with their UK competitors.  It is another mark of the Government's apparent lack of awareness of the realities of world economic conditions such as the trend in OECD countries of increasing interest rates and the weakness of sterling, that it ignored such factors in representing the budget.</P>
    <P>The more one examines the residential property tax the more one must decide that it is purely an ideological tax which, unfortunately, my party went along with for too long.  Twelve million pounds in revenue is raised by way of this tax per annum.  We should compare this with the figure of £30 million which will be raised by way of the 12p increase on cigarettes.  It is clear that the sum of £12 million is insignificant in national terms.  It should also be taken into consideration that we need an army of Revenue staff to police the thresholds and the valuations supplied, with the result that the sum of £12 million is reduced substantially.</P>
    <P>An income of £29,000 is not a rich salary from which to pay this tax.  The threshold of £94,000, with rising property values, will soon be reached by thousands of home owners.  It makes commonsense to abolish it as Fianna Fáil has now suggested.  Fifteen million pounds could be raised by way of a 6p increase on cigarettes &mdash; the Minister for Health would also accept this &mdash; but instead we have an army of civil servants to measure houses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that we went along with this tax.  Fine Gael gave a commitment in this House to abolish it. <Col N="216" /> The Minister of State should have thought of that earlier.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the budget to reflect, facilitate or encourage the historic peace process in Northern Ireland. There is nothing that I can find to encourage cross-Border trade or closer co-operation between State agencies which would contribute to the efficient working of what the chairman of the Ulster Bank, Sir George Quigley, called &ldquo;a single island economy&rdquo;.  It is a pity the Minister in the first budget since the announcement of the historic ceasefire did not find a way to give tangible encouragement to the peace process. I call on the Government to correct this major oversight in the Finance Bill.</P>
      <P>Time will show that the Minister, by the many fiscal changes, has considerably shifted Government policy away from the sound economic policies he inherited.  He has now taken an economic course which, if pursued, will lead him to significantly setting back the prospect of economic stability by the year 2000.  It is essential that sound economic policies be re-established soon if the reversals are not to prove serious for the economy.</P>
      <P>There were several favourable once-off factors, including late 1994 EU receipts and the run down of departmental and Social Insurance Fund balances.If these three factors were excluded the post-budget EBR would be approximately 3.1 per cent of GNP. If the effect of a once-off running down of departmental and Social Insurance Fund balances was ignored the current budget deficit would be £418 million or 1.2 per cent of GNP.  On this basis the 1995 budget provides for a 9.4 per cent increase in spending over 1994.  The Government coolly decided to increase public spending by about three times the rate of inflation at a time of growth. That is the reason this budget must go down in history as being irresponsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadly, the Minister for Finance has been tempted from policies which provided the virtuous economic circle <Col N="217" /> which transformed the economy during the past seven years.  A mistaken hope of gaining increased popularity for his Government by introducing an irresponsible and imprudent budget has led the Minister into making a serious policy error.  It appears that he framed his budget in an attempt to be all things to all men and particularly to embrace big business.  It is obvious he felt vulnerable in this regard.  He picked the wrong budget strategy.  Instead of being prudent, reducing the debt or being bold, favouring either investment or leaving money with people to make their own choices, he chose the worst of all worlds &mdash; a bit of everything &mdash; and wound up in a mess.  He has paid a dividend before he has made a profit and has not realised there is no such thing as a free lunch.  The bill for his mistake will only be presented in years to come.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Minister outlined his hopes for the year 2010 &mdash; his vision of 2010 as he refers to it.  It is extraordinary that he did not focus on the well known fact that after 1999 the value of EU economic transfers to Ireland will fall substantially in real terms as a result of three factors &mdash; structural changes affecting agriculture, the enlargement of the EU to 16, possibly 20, countries and the fact that Irish GDP <i>per capita</i> is now beginning to exceed 75 per cent of the EU average.  This is significant and will affect transfers to Ireland.  It is clear the Minister ignored these factors.</P>
    <P>The figure of £2.2 billion which Ireland receives from the EU per year by way of £1.3 billion in agricultural price guarantees and £950 million in ESF, Structural and other funds will fall after 1999.  It is only a question of by how much.  If the Government, for example, has to compensate our farmers for any reductions in these transfers Government spending will have to be reduced or taxes dramatically increased.</P>
    <P>EU transfers to Ireland during the five year period after 1999 will be cut by a minimum of 25 per cent in real terms at current levels.  At worst, the cut could be as high as 50 per cent.  Even a 25 per cent reduction would cost the economy <Col N="218" /> over £500 million per annum.  A 50 per cent cut would cost £1.1 billion.  In order to avoid a large setback to the economy it was necessary in the budget, given the Minister's vision of 2010, to produce a surplus in time to meet the reduction in funds after 1999.  It is obvious that he ignored this major development in this irresponsible budget.  I hope history will not show that this budget marked a general retreat by the Government from economic reality towards the economic myopia which dominated the Labour Party's thinking in the 1970s and 1980s.</P>
    <P>The Minister's vision of 2010 is sadly deficient.  He addressed none of the economic issues facing Europe; he ignored the impact of cuts in EU transfers to Ireland, the issue of a single currency and the effect this may have, the issue of a single political European entity, the risk of increasing interest rates and has not recognised that during a period when OECD interest rates are rising he should have tried to keep inflation down and to temper other pressures for increased Irish interest rates.</P>
    <P>The Minister chose to do the direct opposite and reversed economic policy. He has stimulated consumer demand. This is crazy in a rapidly growing economy.Why stimulate an economy which is growing?  This constitutes financial recklessness and irresponsibility.  He has increased the risk of a higher inflation rate and thus significantly increased the risk of higher interest rates.  Taxpayers who briefly benefit from this budget will shortly have reason not to be grateful to this three party rainbow Government when interest rates increase partly because of inaction in regard to certain aspects of this budget.</P>
    <P>Taxpayers will have even more reason to be concerned about this budget in 1996.  A 6 per cent increase in current spending was proposed because of certain once-off favourable factors, for example, the £108 million draw down on departmental balances.  In effect, however, the core 1996 current expenditure level, excluding the once-off factor and deferring the £233 million, will be approximately that level <Col N="219" /> higher than the 1995 budget current expenditure levels.  The Minister is heading for a difficult 1996 budget.  The 1996 current expenditure level, therefore, assuming EU transfers remain solid for 1996, will be 2.1 per cent in real terms above the 1995 current expenditure levels set out in the Minister's budget.  Already this budget has set a level for 1996 current spending which is above the 2 per cent increase for 1995.</P>
    <P>The evidence is clear, therefore, that the Minister has no strategy for dealing with medium term economic issues.  As I said, this budget fails to address critical EU issues.  The plans which the Minister has put in train for 1995 have already set the scene for either a 1996 budget which is made up of cutbacks in public services or real tax increases in 1996. The 1995 budget has failed to tackle the fundamentals.  Therefore reductions in public spending or increases in taxes in the 1996 budget are unavoidable because of the failure in this budget to make the tough decisions.</P>
    <P>This budget has been financially irresponsible.It is a platform for misery.  The Minister has introduced a spend and tax budget, a course of action even worse than Labour's traditional fondness for the other way around, which was to tax and spend.  It is serious policy mistake budget and a serious reversal of economic strategy for which our economy and our people will pay dearly, commencing in 1996.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It was a great performance.  I know the Deputy had to make a speech and I sympathise with his difficulty in not having any firm ground under his feet on which to make an economic speech.</P>
      <P>I wish to address some of the main inaccuracies in the Deputy's approach to economic policy.  First, he accuses my colleague, Deputy Quinn, of being financially imprudent.  That is not so.  The increase in public expenditure in the budget is 5.8 per cent.  That is within the guidelines laid down in the programme which established this Rainbow Coalition when we said we would increase public expenditure to a limit of 6 per cent.  We could contrast that with the increase in public expenditure last year by the Labour-Fianna Fáil Government which was 9.6 per cent.</P>
      <P>In trying to make a case from a rather weak position, Deputy Brennan said if we look forward to 1996 we get a core deficit of approximately 1.3 per cent of GNP and he quoted a figure of £475 million.  I do not know whether that figure is accurate but there is an obvious inaccuracy in the calculation because he is calculating 1996 GNP percentages with a projected current deficit of £475 million, but he is using the 1995 GNP figure as the base of his calculation. Clearly, the correct calculation would be to divide the figure of £475 million into the 1996 projected GNP and the Deputy has not done that.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There <Col N="222" /> should be a quota programme for restricting the number of &ldquo;Deputy Aherns&rdquo; in this House.  It should be part of the EU initiatives in which Deputy Brennan is so anxious to get involved.</P>
      <P>The provision for the health service clearly reflects the Government's concern that the needs of the health service are accorded the highest priority in the allocation of resources.  As Minister for Health I am determined to make significant progress in the areas set out in <i>A Programme for Renewal</i>.  The December 1994 Government policy agreement endorses the health strategy as the basis for the Government's programme in the health area.  The health strategy reorients our health care system and sets out a four year action plan with targets for reductions in risk factors associated with premature mortality, together with improvements in other indicators of health status.</P>
      <P>Our health services are facing new challenges in the 1990s and the performance of this Government will eventually be judged by its willingness and ability to meet these challenges.  Our population is beginning to age.  The number of elderly people will rise significantly over the next ten to 20 years and we will have to provide increasingly for high dependency groups in the population such as adults with a mental handicap and persons with AIDS.</P>
      <P>The series of developments announced by me as part of the 1995 health Estimates and those announced in this year's budget reflect the changing direction and emphasis of health service delivery towards a service which not only seeks to treat and cure but a service which, above all, cares for people. As Minister for Health I am determined to tackle the problems associated with premature mortality due to cancer, cardiac disease and accidents.  A national cancer treatment policy will be drawn up as a priority by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1995 net Health Vote, when the additions in the budget are taken into account, is almost £2,000 million.  The provision for health represents over one-fifth of all Government spending on <Col N="223" /> supply services this year.  The allocation of such a large share of national resources is concrete evidence of the Government's determination to ensure that those who need the public health service most have a right and an entitlement to the highest possible level of care.</P>
    <P>There are two main areas affecting the health services in the budget &mdash; waiting list initiative and health cash allowances.  I would like to comment in some detail on these items.  However, this is but a small part of the initiatives being taken by the Government in 1995 to continue the orderly development of services.</P>
    <P>The Government is anxious to build on the success of the previous waiting list initiatives in 1993 and 1994.  The continuation of the initiative in 1995 with the special allocation of £8 million announced in the budget will enable further inroads to be made in problem areas.</P>
    <P>A detailed review is under way on the experience gained during 1994 and the Department will be discussing with the health agencies shortly the arrangements to be put in place during 1995.</P>
    <P>I am sure that all Deputies will be pleased with the progress now being made to bring about a reduction in the length of time a patient has to wait for treatment.  I am determined to continue with this development and I want to thank everyone in my Department and throughout the service who have made it possible.</P>
    <P>With effect from July 1995 an increase of 2.5 per cent will be applied to cash allowances and cash grants such as disabled person's rehabilitation allowance, blind welfare allowance and long term illness schemes.  This will maintain the value of these payments for the people relying on these allowances.These are in line with the 2.5 per cent increases in all the schemes organised and administered by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>This is an aspect of the budget which has come in for an unreasonable <Col N="224" /> amount of criticism from the Opposition.They claim the 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare payments is inadequate and paltry, but the actual figure in the budget is sufficient for a 3 per cent increase which is what was given last year and this is applied by bringing the payment date forward by six weeks.  The money, then, is for a 3 per cent increase which is given at 2.5 per cent paid from six weeks earlier in the year.  Everybody else in the country who is at work is confined to 2.5 per cent increase this year, but this pay increase is subject to PRSI and tax deductions whereas the social welfare increase is net and, in real terms, 3 per cent, because of the advancement of the payment date.</P>
    <P>One can ask what good is 2.5 per cent or 3 per cent.  That the allocations are so small is a tribute to the previous Government and the present Government in keeping inflation so low because these small nominal increases are keeping pace with inflation.  I compliment the Minister for Social Welfare on deciding to focus on the areas of greatest need by increasing child benefit by £7 per child per month.  All the international documentation now suggests that the greatest poverty occurs in families, and the greater the number of children the greater the level of deprivation.I compliment the Minister on targeting families.  It is great that as a result of this budget a woman with four children will have an income of her own of £1,400 a year.  In the past my party, under the Taoiseachship of Dr. Garret FitzGerald, was criticised for making a commitment to give women at home a separate allowance and the famous £9.60 was trotted up, down, over and back.  I am glad to be back in Government when the women through the child benefit system are getting an income into their hands, with no tax deduction, which is far greater than the £9.60.  It is true that there was a major increase in child benefit last year but the increase this year is much bigger and great credit is due to the Minister for Social Welfare in that respect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="225" /> A sum of £13 million was provided to fund acute hospital developments initiated in 1994 and an additional £4 million is provided to fund new developments.There is also a major expansion in services for the mentally handicapped.Additional funding amounting to £10 million revenue and £2 million capital has been provided for improving services for the mentally handicapped. Included in the additional money being provided is £2 million to cover the cost of increased independency of existing clients and £8 million non-capital and £2 million to develop new services.  This funding will enable health boards to put in place a broad range of services including additional residential, respite and day care places and further development of home support services and services for those with disturbed behaviour and autism.  It will also enable the boards to continue the programme of transferring persons with mental handicap in psychiatric hospitals to more appropriate care settings.  Provision is also being made for hepatitis B vaccinations for staff working in the service.  An additional £2.4 million is being provided for training centres and associated support facilities.</P>
    <P>Additional funding of £10 million will be provided for child care services.  This will enable me to bring into effect key sections of the Child Care Act which will strengthen the powers of health boards, the Garda Síochána and the courts to protect children who are being abused or neglected.  The additional funds will be used to finance new services and facilities dealing with child abuse and neglect, improved arrangements for monitoring children in residential care, further expansion of facilities for homeless young persons and strengthening of preventative services and other community-based child and family support services.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, who has responsibility for child care in my Department will be expanding on this further at a later stage.</P>
    <P>An additional £9.5 million, made up <Col N="226" /> of £6.5 million non-capital and £3 million capital, has been provided for developments approved under the first phase of the dental health action plan.  The extra funding will enable health boards to extend eligibility for services to children up to age 14.  At present the cut off age is 12 years and I am glad that the dental action plan will be progressed further in 1995 under my ministry.  It will enable all the health boards to further develop secondary care orthodontic treatment.  The additional funding will also provide for the further phased introduction of the dental treatment services scheme for adults.  All Deputies know that there is now a demand for orthodontic treatment. There has been a difficulty in the past in providing resources and attracting suitably qualified consultant orthodontic staff to certain health board areas. Recruitment is now in progress to hire three consultant orthodontists in health boards which do not have them.  Of the allocation for dental care in the Estimates this year, £1 million is dedicated to further improvement in orthodontic care.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitments in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> services are being further developed for the care and management of persons who have contracted HIV and AIDS.  Drug abusers are a major group at risk of contracting HIV. Additional facilities and community drug teams will be established to help prevent the spread of HIV among this group.  Funds are also being provided for palliative care services for people with AIDS in Our Lady's Hospice, Harold's Cross.  Provision is also being made for a detoxification unit for drug abusers at Cherry Orchard Hospital.  This will relieve the pressure on the existing unit at Beaumont Hospital.</P>
    <P>Funding of £7.5 million is being provided to improve services for the dependent elderly, particularly home, community and day care services.  In addition, new departments of medicine for the elderly will be opened in Mullingar, Nenagh, Tralee and Wexford <Col N="227" /> Hospitals, Cork University Hospital, Limerick Regional Hospital and Beaumont.Additional funding of £2.7 million is being provided to continue the development of community psychiatric services.  It is proposed to develop additional services for disturbed adolescents with psychiatric problems, provide additional old age psychiatric services and rehabilitation facilities.</P>
    <P>Last year a pilot diploma course in pre-registration nurse education and training in the Western Health Board, involving a collaboration with University College, Galway, was established. Funding was also allocated for continuing education for nurses.  Additional funding of £3 million has been provided to continue these projects and to extend the Galway pilot project to other training schools.  Further funding of £1.6 million has been provided to complete phasing in the EU Directive on Nurse Training.  I hope that at the end of my time in office the norm for nurse training will be through courses attached to the universities with a university diploma required at registration level and the option of an extra year's study to provide a degree in nursing.  Consultations will take place with all the universities to see how best there can be collaboration so that we will continue to have the finest nurses in the world.  As an endorsement of their high quality, their qualifications will be underpinned by a university diploma or university degree.</P>
    <P>Additional funding has been provided for an expanded measles-rubella immunisation programme which will be aimed at children between five and 16 years.  My colleague in the United Kingdom is predicting a major outbreak of rubella and public health programmes have been put in place there to expand their rubella immunisation programme.  I cannot say if we will be faced with similar circumstances here but, in the light of what is happening in the United Kingdom, it would be prudent to expand the rubella immunisation programme here and sufficient <Col N="228" /> money has been included in the Estimate to do that.</P>
    <P>Funding is also being provided for the implementation of a number of reports, including the review group on infant and maternity schemes and the report on cervical screening.  As Deputies know, I intend to deal with the issue of cancer as it needs far more focus and attention and a policy review group has been set up in my Department with a view to reporting some time this year. In that context, cervical and breast cancers are high priorities.  Many Deputies have brought to my attention and to the attention of other Ministers for Health, that cervical cancer is a curable disease when discovered in the pre-invasive stage.  With a proper screening programme and smear testing, it can be discovered at the pre-invasive stage and is treatable.  If that kind of programme were available nationally and 100 per cent successful, the 75 women who died of cervical cancer last year would be alive today.  We must progress in that direction as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Additional revenue and capital funding is being provided to implement the recommendations of the review group on services for persons with a physical or sensory disability.  It will provide for the further development of home, day and respite care facilities for the physically disabled.  The funding will be used to develop a wide range of services including home, day and respite care, community based therapy, residential care to provide technical aids and appliances and to fund voluntary organisations.A further £4.2 million is being provided for the development and upgrading of training centres for people with disabilities.  The increase in funding in 1995 is a concrete indication of this Government's commitment to developing services for people with physical disabilities.  I have had a number of meetings with representatives of the Irish Wheelchair Association and I appreciate their concern and the concerns of the people they represent.  The physically handicapped will not be neglected during my period in Government. <Col N="229" /> They have received a major increase in funding this year and they, together with persons with mental handicap, will be a high priority of this Government. It is worth saying that the increase this year for the mentally and physically handicapped is the biggest announced by a Minister for Health since the foundation of the State and the allocation in the 1995 post-budget Estimate is the biggest allocation ever for the handicapped.  I thank my colleagues in Government, in particular the Minister for Finance, for putting me in the position to be able to make such an announcement.</P>
    <P>On the capital side, a total of £103 million, £10 million of it through term loan, is being provided for the capital programme.  Provision is being made for ongoing expenditure on major projects such as the Tallaght hospital, where £40 million is being spent this year, Waterford Regional, that is, Ardkeen and Mullingar hospitals.  The funding will also enable further progress to be made in the improvement of hospital services in centres such as Cork, Limerick, Galway and Dublin.  In addition, funding will also be provided for a wide range of community based services.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, arrangements are being made to transfer responsibility for the National Social Services Board to the Minister for Social Welfare.  It is not proposed to change any of the statutory functions of the board and the change reflects the emphasis on its evolving role.  It would be appropriate to pay tribute to the work of the board and staff in the National Social Services Board and to recognise the considerable contribution they have made in a very quiet and efficient way to the development of a network of citizens' information centres throughout the country.</P>
    <P>The National Social Services Board has been very supportive of the development of the work of the National Council for the Elderly and I have no doubt that the work of the board will be even more productive <Col N="230" /> within the overall community development and information framework which is being developed under the Minister for Social Welfare.  I believe this rationalisation of responsibilities is not only desirable in itself but indicative of the growing willingness of Ministers and Departments to work together in providing the most appropriate and efficient public services.  In return for transferring the National Social Services Board to the Department of Social Welfare some respite care facilities have been transferred from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Health.  I think the transfer in monetary terms is £1.2 million from the Department of Health to the Department of Social Welfare and approximately £1.8 million from the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Health. No doubt the post-budget Book of Estimates will reflect these changes in due course but I think the House should be informed about them at this stage.</P>
    <P>In framing the 1995 Estimate, the Government made every effort to provide the best possible standard of health service and to direct additional resources to areas of special need.  The provisions made in the budget for the health services are clear evidence of the Government's commitment to the development of such a health service. Strict control of health spending and more accountable management will continue to form key elements of health policy.  The health services have a special role to play to ensure that the large proportion of national resources spent on health is used wisely and effectively.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a year in which, working together, we will build on the significant progress so far achieved and continue to provide services of the highest standards responsive to the needs of all who depend on our health services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Jim Higgins on his appointment as Minister of State and I wish him well during his term of office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In introducing his budget last <Col N="231" /> Wednesday, the Minister for Finance outlined the main objectives of the Government as being threefold: (1) to reward work; (2) to promote enterprise; and (3) to strengthen solidarity.  The opportunity was given to this Government to fulfil those objectives thanks to the leadership and wise decisions taken by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1987 and the Fianna Fáil-led Governments of 1989 and 1992.  Those Governments, in which Fianna Fáil played a principal role, created a flourishing economy resulting in Government finances being brought into a sound position, with low inflation and a social partnership of consensus.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance is, by and large, continuing the strategy of the Fianna Fáil-led Government, but not entirely, and this is where he has gone wrong.  The Government has decided to go for a substantial current budget deficit &mdash; I think of the days of 1982-87 when the national debt doubled from £12.5 billion to £25 billion, for which we are still paying.  If the rainbow coalition Government continues on this path the debt will again soar and future generations will be required to pay for today's borrowings.  There was an opportunity to keep borrowings down but the inherent instability of a multi-party Government does not allow for proper decisions to be taken in the long term interests of our country, our children and our childrens' children.  The exigencies of keeping this disparate Government together rule the day and in the final analysis the budget turned out to be a damp squib.</P>
    <P>From 1987 onwards when the Fianna Fáil Party returned to power we were subjected to bombardment by The Workers' Party-Democratic Left as to how we should treat the less well off in our society.  After this year's budget, people will thank us for not listening to their rhetoric.  Actions speak louder than words, now we have the opportunity to see the results of the actions in the social welfare increases in this budget and the people, sadly, lost out <Col N="232" /> by the actions of the Democratic Left Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  It is important to be reminded of what that Minister said about social welfare increases during his former life in Opposition.  Speaking on the Social Welfare Bill on 1 March 1994 he referred to the 2 per cent increase as &ldquo;miserable&rdquo;.  In March 1993 he suggested that Dáil Éireann should deplore the inadequacy of increases, described as &ldquo;meagre&rdquo;.  In January 1992 he said the Minister for Social Welfare made much of the fact that increases in social welfare would be slightly above the rate of inflation but that a policy of setting social welfare increases on or about the level of inflation would only be satisfactory if basic social welfare levels were themselves adequate.  This, he said, was clearly not the case.  What will he say after this year's increases?</P>
    <P>In 1991 he said virtually the same thing about the 4 per cent increase.  On the 1990 budget, where a 5 per cent general increase was given, he said: &ldquo;The overall level of social welfare increases is quite inadequate in the context of the scale of poverty facing the country&rdquo;.  In 1989 Deputy De Rossa was particularly savage about the 3 per cent general increase plus a special 9 per cent increase for the long term unemployed. He said:</P>
    <P>Given the appalling levels of poverty which have been widely documented by a wide range of independent groups over the past 12 months the failure to provide adequate increases in social welfare payments is particularly cruel.</P>
    <P>One would expect the person who said all that, if given the opportunity, to ensure that social welfare increases would be above the level of inflation. Alas, the Minister failed to match his words with his actions and as Minister for Social Welfare he should do the honourable thing and resign.  He has been codding the people for long enough and now he has been found out. Why did the Minister not give reasonable increases to pensioners and to child <Col N="233" /> dependants?  Why did he not give more than a miserly 10p increase to recipients of a living alone allowance?  He gave an increase of 25 per cent to some welfare organisations.  I can only conclude from their silence compared to their vociferous attacks on Fianna Fáil over the years that those organisations were led by people who had been bought off or who were in the hands of the Democratic Left/Workers' Party over the years and many of their protestations were politically motivated.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase of £7 in child benefit.  It shows the importance attached to families in this country and continues the policy adopted over the last number of years.  There should be a discussion on targeting increases so that the less well off in society get a proportionately greater share-out of what is available.  I welcome the increase to £25 in the minimum unemployment assistance for single people living at home. Many young people left home and went to live in flats.  If they lived at home they received a maximum of £10.  This placed a strain on health board budgets and this increase should reverse that.  It is important that people stay at home in their own environment and with their families.  Many problems, for example those associated with vandalism, arose from the fact that young people left home and went to live in flats.</P>
    <P>The changes in PRSI liability are welcome.The removal of liability on the first £50 will make it less expensive to employ additional workers and it will be easier for many hard pressed employers to maintain their workforce.  It is also of benefit to employees as £50 at 5.5 per cent will give them £2.75p extra take home pay.  That is a welcome direction in which to go to reduce the tax burden on employees.</P>
    <P>The Minister has exempted the first £50 for full rate contributors but has only allowed a £10 allowance per week for the self employed who pay, under contribution class S, 5 per cent of their income towards pay related social insurance.  Why is there such discrimination against the self employed?  Why <Col N="234" /> does the Minister not continue on his mission statement to reward work and risk taking?  He should have gone further down the line and granted a PAYE allowance to propriety directors of limited companies who are subject to tax under schedule E, similar to all PAYE workers.  If job creation is the Government's aim it is necessary to give every assistance to small companies to set up and continue in existence.  The extension of the £50 allowance against PRSI and the extension of the PAYE allowance is the least that should be done.</P>
    <P>The widening of tax bands and increases in tax free allowances are nothing to write home about and the decision to reduce further mortgage interest relief and VHI premium relief will offset any benefits.  The decision to increase exemption limits is in line with Fianna Fáil policy over the last few budgets and is welcome.</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister stated he would abolish tax relief on covenants from next year.  He should clarify the matter of relatives in retirement homes.  People are worried that covenants will not be allowed in future and are to be abolished.</P>
    <P>In order to direct investment into job creation the Minister should take action along the following lines.  BES schemes were set up to provide risk capital for new ventures but over the years they were hijacked into areas for which they were not intended.  The Minister should cancel the taxation benefit of asset-backed BES schemes or at least reduce the taxation benefits by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Woods.  Pension funds are the largest investment source available in this country and the State is not getting the maximum benefit of the moneys available in those funds.  The Minister should concentrate on offering specific inducements to those funds to invest in Irish industry and should tax cash holdings and off shore investments.  He should consider expanding the BES benefits to <Col N="235" /> allow for the setting up of specific venture capital funds with rules for investments in set ups and expanding businesses.Instead of doing away with the bank levy he should develop a fund for bank bail outs and deposit guarantees. He should give consideration to the take over of dormant bank deposits for the benefit of society in general.</P>
    <P>The environment and import substitution are two concepts which are very much to the fore and are important to the development of the country.  Consideration should be given to the introduction of a specific energy tax which would differentiate between imported and home produced goods and environmentally friendly and unfriendly goods. A reduced rate of VAT should be considered for recycled products which would benefit job creation and the environment.</P>
    <P>Specific benefits for groups having Irish holding companies and for groups carrying out research and development in Ireland should be considered as this would ensure that such companies would maintain their presence in Ireland and would not leave the country at the first sign of difficulty.  This would maintain jobs and offer opportunities to graduates to apply their expertise for the good of the country.</P>
    <P>We must accept that manufacturing is cheaper in the Far East and Third World countries and must concentrate on becoming an international services country.  An initial step may be to focus on, and offer incentives for super highway development.  In this day and age of impermanent employment there should be a fund, perhaps operated through the PRSI system, 1 per cent contributed by the employee and 1 per cent by the employer to retain people who may become redundant or who wish to change their careers.</P>
    <P>The aim of this or any future Government should be to render this a nation of taxpayers which, in the long term, would mean a reduction in the burden for all.  It is important that all make their rightful tax contribution to the State, <Col N="236" /> thus lowering the burden on everybody. For example, if everybody paid their fair share I have no doubt that the tax burden would fall from 50 per cent to 30 per cent.</P>
    <P>I welcome the relief for farmers, especially the continuance of the 25 per cent stock relief and the special relief for farmers who must de-populate.  I also welcome the changes proposed with regard to capital taxation.  I await with interest for details of the charter of farmer's rights in which £5 million is to be invested.  Our farmers have two excellent bodies looking after their interests, the Irish Farmers' Association and the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, not to mention Macra na Feirme, the Irish Co-Operative Organisation Society.  I question whether it is necessary to invest £5 million in order to devise a charter of farmer's rights when there are many others in our society who need money to an even greater extent, within the health, education, social welfare and hospitals sectors.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the scheme for seaside resorts, especially in regard to the town of Youghal, which I discussed with my colleague, the former Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy McCreevy.  I am glad the new Minister for Tourism and Transport, Deputy Enda Kenny, has taken that scheme on board and will implement its provisions, which will be especially welcome in the Youghal area, a town which has been ravaged by unemployment in recent years and is in dire need of a leg-up to reinstate it to its former prosperity.</P>
    <P>In this budget the Government abolished the bank levy and during the week the Minister of State to the Government, Deputy Rabbitte, explained how it would be Exchequer-neutral.  It will only be Exchequer-neutral because the Minister for Finance is bringing forward corporation profits tax payments from ensuing years.  The reason for so doing is the Government is well aware it will not be in office in the years ahead.  The Exchequer will lose £12 million per annum from the abolition of the bank levy, on top of which the Government <Col N="237" /> is offering a 2 per cent reduction in corporation profits tax to the banks.  No wonder the banks are happy today.</P>
    <P>There was a famous baker here known as &ldquo;Pat the Baker&rdquo;, whose bakery distributed dough nationwide.  We now have &ldquo;Pat the Banker&rdquo; who has distributed the dough to the banks rather than to those everybody might have expected the Minister for Finance and his colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare, to look after.  It is a shame coming from the so-called socialist parties, Democratic Left and the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>For understandable reasons this Government failed to grasp the opportunities available in drawing up its budget &mdash; there were too many cooks. It is unfortunate for future generations that we have a Government which because of its different philosophies and ideologies does not allow for brave, courageous, job-creating decisions to be taken.  It is unfortunate that Fianna Fáil do not remain in office to take such decisions based on the results of our good Government in recent years, contributed to by, among others, my colleague, Deputy Woods to whom I now give way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Jim Higgins on his appointment and wish him the very best.  He has been a very vigorous representative of the west in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In debating this budget I hoped we could have said many good things about its proposals, that we could all have been very pleased with its provisions due to the resources available, the work undertaken in recent years to ensure our economy remained in a sound state and because of the direction in which the country was going.  I am afraid this budget has been a bitter disappointment for those dependent on social welfare and it completely ignored the targets set by the Commission on Social Welfare. Instead, this Government set out to woo the middle income voter, giving the lowest increase in 30 years to pensioners, disabled people, the homeless, the <Col N="238" /> unemployed and carers.  This is the first occasion in 27 years on which a surplus was available to the Government, yet the Democratic Left Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, granted the lowest increase in recent memory to those for whom he is constitutionally responsible.  Reminiscent of the old Cumann na nGael right-wing Ministers, who took a shilling from old age pensioners, it did not take the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and his colleague at the Cabinet table long to let down those who thought they could depend on them.  Deputy De Rossa spent years protesting on the opposite side of the House but it took him a mere matter of weeks to forget his alleged principles and the people who put him there.  One might well say: &ldquo;Tomás Mac Giolla, come back, all is forgiven, let us resurrect The Workers' Party and get back to concern about the real people on the ground&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said that his rainbow Coalition Government is giving these historically low increases to enhance the incentive to work among people on social welfare.  Both the Labour and Democratic Left parties have supported this approach but, one might well ask: since when did the old age pensioner, widow, invalid, or the homeless person need an incentive to work?  It is well established that what they need is adequate, basic payments and the support of all the community if they are to survive.  They are entitled to that support but did not get it from this rainbow Coalition Government.  Those who are genuinely unemployed, or families at work in receipt of low pay also deserve our support but neither did they receive it.</P>
    <P>We should contrast the miserable 2.5 per cent increase granted this year with what happened in former years.  Many Deputies here including Deputy De Rossa complained when we granted increases of the order of 3 per cent, plus a 9 per cent special increase for the long term unemployed.  Deputy De Rossa complained it was not enough, it was <Col N="239" /> totally inadequate.  Yet, then real progress was being made on the targets set out by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Looking back to 1977, when I first became a Member of this House, we can observe increases having been granted of 14 per cent, 10 per cent, 12 per cent, 20 per cent and, for old age pensioners, in 1981 and 1982 three consecutive 25 per cent increases.  Of course, that was given by a Fianna Fáil Government. The increases were always well ahead of inflation and, in more recent years there was always an extra provision for those in receipt of particularly low payments to bring their entitlements up to the targets set by the Commission on Social Welfare.  I hear people here speak about the 3 per cent granted last year, which was an overall, general increase, in addition to which there was a 6 per cent increase, to continue to raise people's income levels, followed by a 10 per cent increase in unemployment and disability benefit, selectively supporting those in receipt of lowest payments.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, earlier endeavoured to justify the 2.5 per cent increase on the grounds of the child benefit payments but what he and this Coalition Government forgot was that not everybody on social welfare will gain from child benefit, pensioners being a very obvious example; they will not benefit at all from the increase in child benefit.  An old age pensioner, on assistance, will receive an increase of £1.50 per week; on insurance, a pensioner will receive 30 pence more but, if that pensioner has a dependant spouse, and they are in receipt of assistance, between them they will receive £2.40 per week extra, or £1.20 each on the basis of equal treatment.Similarly, somebody in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance will receive the princely sum of £1.50 per week extra.</P>
    <P>To put these increases in context, I met some pensioners on Saturday last <Col N="240" /> who did not perceive their increase buying even one extra pint a week.  As they said, obviously if they are on assistance, they will have to seek a subvention from their sons and daughters to raise the £1.50 to £1.89 or, if on insurance, to raise the £1.80 to £1.89.  That is how the public view the budget and what I outlined puts it in the context of real life outside this House.</P>
    <P>People on invalidity pensions and those in receipt of benefit under the social insurance fund get 10p more than a person in receipt of a disabled person's maintenance allowance.  Widows, deserted wives and the homeless also get an increase of £1.50 per week as do carers.  The unemployed and those on sickness benefit are also held down to an increase of £1.50 per week.  Those people want to work.  There is no need to subject them to the new concepts introduced by the Taoiseach &mdash; to &ldquo;Brutonise&rdquo; them.  The Government showed in this budget that it is out of touch with reality.  There is no increase in child dependant rates and, in any event, payments are now taxed.  Did the Minister for Social Welfare forget that when he accepted a reduction?  Did he forget that payments to unemployed adults are taxable?He could have argued for more on that basis because the net cost to the State of such welfare benefits is much lower.  The point of that taxation procedure was to reduce the disincentive to work so that the Government could give improved payments on basic personal rates.  The Minister for Finance will claw back part of the welfare increases for adults.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare set out the targets for social welfare payments.  The previous Fianna Fáil-led Government with Labour had exceeded the priority rates in current terms and had achieved over 90 per cent of the main rates for all payments.  In this budget the commission's main rates were to be achieved as promised by Fianna Fáil and Labour in Government, but the rainbow Coalition has reneged on it.  Those rates for all benefits could easily have been achieved this year.  I <Col N="241" /> cannot understand why the Government did not pursue that.</P>
    <P>The rainbow Coalition has made a virtue of begrudgery.  It set out to improve the incentive to work by freezing welfare payments to the children of recipients, by tying increases to adults strictly to the expected rate of inflation and by taxing the miserable 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare.  One million adults have been cheated in this way, including 250,000 retired people on social welfare pensions, more than 100,000 widows, disabled people, lone parents, the homeless, carers and the 280,000 unemployed.  Only fewer than one-third of social welfare recipients are unemployed and of those only 36 per cent have dependent children.</P>
    <P>I ask Members to accept that the rainbow Coalition's figures have gone tragically wrong.  The Government has made a serious error in thinking that child benefit would compensate people who depend on social welfare.  The number who will be compensated is relatively small considering the total involved.  It is principally the unemployed and some widows.  Only 36 per cent of the unemployed have dependent children.  The Government must realise what it is doing and be conscious of the fact that it is impossible for the vast majority of social welfare beneficiaries to avail of child benefit.  Even though the increase in child benefit is excellent, it does not reach enough needy people because they cannot avail of it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the rainbow Coalition's commitment to the previous Government's programme for encouraging enterprise, rewarding work and initiative and reforming the tax system.  I welcome the tax and PRSI reliefs and support given to families in general through increases in child benefit allowances.  I particularly recognise the work done by the committee on child benefit chaired by Dr. Finola Kennedy which prepared the valuable report on which that development is based.  That valuable and effective report was produced quickly.</P>
    <P>The current healthy financial strength <Col N="242" /> of the social insurance fund has made it possible for the Government to follow the lead given last year and give further PRSI relief to both employers and employees.  It also made it possible to set aside for this year the expected charge on the Exchequer arising from the Fine Gael-led Government's failure to implement the equal treatment directive of 1984.  I am dismayed and deeply disappointed at the rainbow Coalition's failure to provide the funds needed to tackle stark inequality and disadvantage in our society.  People with disabilities have been largely forgotten despite what the Minister, Deputy Noonan, said about the Estimates, not the budget. Those people cannot wait any longer for real support and recognition.  They have listened too often to expressions of sympathy without getting a real share in the nation's prosperity.  This year was to be the year in which a surplus was available to ensure that development was possible.With 87 per cent of people in wheelchairs not in open employment and 74 per cent not involved in education or training programmes, surely it was time for real action and a financial commitment to tackle their needs.  The global and poorly researched restriction on covenants will, unless more clearly thought through and reversed, have disastrous consequences for many serious disabled or incapacitated adults and children.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Finance to review the position of those people as a matter of urgency and address their grave concerns.  There is no equality for the old, widows, the sick, people with disabilities, the homeless or travellers in this budget.  Consequently, I cannot support the 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare especially in cases where there are no child dependants.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opportunity to publicly congratulate Deputy Jim Higgins on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Finance.I know he will play a very worthwhile role in that Department and an <Col N="243" /> important one as a member of the economic and budget committee of the Cabinet.He will help us reform many areas and I look forward, with enthusiasm, to working with him.</P>
      <P>I listened to the Fianna Fáil speakers, Deputies Michael Ahern and Woods. Deputy Michael Ahern quoted the Old Testament in referring to the instability of inter-party governments.  He conveniently forgot that the only instability in inter-party Governments we have experienced was under Fianna Fáil stewardship when not on one or two occasions, but on three occasions a Fianna Fáil Taoiseach succeeded in causing an election through issues of trust and inability to make a partnership Government work.  I will not be accepting lectures from Deputy Michael Ahern on the instabilities of inter-party Government.</P>
      <P>It is enough to make a cat laugh to listen to Fianna Fáil Deputies attack the social welfare provisions of the budget. It hardly escapes their memory that it was a partner in a Government that introduced the infamous dirty dozen cuts.  Only last year a Government of which it was a partner was going to means test widow's pensions.  Those matters seem to have been erased from their memory but they have not been erased from the memory of many of those who were affected by the dirty dozen cuts.  Many people have been only able to keep their heads above water due to receiving assistance with the payment of their electricity bills and they are still ruing the reforms brought in by the so-called caring Fianna Fáil administration.  To be honest Fianna Fáil are extremely grudging and it has latched on to something very small amidst the overall social welfare provisions which are very progressive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of us have long awaited reform in the area of child benefit.  It is great that a Minister for Social Welfare has taken bold steps in that direction.  I am very pleased also about the changes affecting those at the lowest end of the scale and the important reforms in the <Col N="244" /> supplementary welfare system and for people who are trying to keep their head above water in meeting their rent payments and mortgage repayments. These are valuable changes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare has made good provision for the carer's allowance and I am pleased that the means test criteria in regard to it has been eased significantly.  This is an area where many people are struggling to provide care for their elderly relatives or for their children with disability and this recognition is long overdue.  I am glad the Minister for Social Welfare has availed of the opportunity to make reforms in this area.  There are many worthwhile aspects to the social welfare side of the budget.  It is important that we not only roll on the system from year to year but introduce the reforms which the Minister for Social Welfare has had the courage to take on.  After three years we will see a much improved social welfare system which encourages people to take up new opportunities.</P>
    <P>I wish to say a few words about the enterprise and employment side of this budget.  None of us understates the challenges we face in dealing with the problems of unemployment which have dogged our country for many years.  Our unemployment rate of 280,000 is the second highest in Europe.  Of particular concern is that during most of the recent economic recovery the numbers of long term unemployed continued to grow. The most recent quarter showed, for the first time, an interruption in the continuous growth of long term unemployment.We face the continued threat of long term unemployment at the same level despite growth.  That is an issue we all have to take very seriously.</P>
    <P>Another major challenge is the number of young people who leave school without the qualifications necessary to get and sustain a job of quality.  Every year, almost 16,000 young people leave school with either no qualification or qualifications at a level insufficient to equip them for the challenges of a modern competitive economy.  Similarly, we face serious problems of unemployment <Col N="245" /> among people with a disability. Reported figures suggest that unemployment among those with a disability is as high as 80 per cent.  I do not know whether those figures stand up but clearly that is the magnitude of unemployment among those with a disability. We also have to address a serious skills gap which probably underlies many of our unemployment problems.  The recent NESC report showed that Ireland has twice as many people in the industrial workforce with no certified skills compared with other countries, particularly West Germany.  It has also shown serious defects in the management of companies in important areas such as marketing and product development and design which must be addressed and we are working to get to grips with them.  A number of measures flagged in the Programme for Government have been initiated through the budgetary provisions.</P>
    <P>The Government is determined to move from rhetoric in the area of unemployment to putting in place practical policies that will achieve change.  Our overriding aim is to secure a higher employment content from growth.  We are in a period of good growth, we must ensure we exploit that opportunity to the best of our ability and turn high growth into employment.  The Minister for Finance has addressed that issue by a series of reforms in the tax wedge.  For many years the issue that confronted employers is that to put a pound in the pocket of their worker they would have to pay out £2.70 for all the different taxes&mdash;the 48 per cent income tax and the 20 per cent PRSI.  This has been a major obstacle to employment growth in our economy.</P>
    <P>It is strange that as an economy we tax most heavily the provision of employment while we provide the lowest taxes in areas such as investment or low risk activities.  We must change that. This budget has made the first significant move in tipping that balance by encouraging employers.  There has been reform of PRSI paid by the employee. For the first time we have a very radical <Col N="246" /> reform, the introduction of a £50 allowance against PRSI.  Under the old regime the lowest paid in our community paid tax at 7.75 per cent.  This is a significant change.  It means those on the lowest rate of pay will not pay tax or PRSI on the first £50 of their earnings.That will benefit everyone but the benefit will be concentrated on those on low pay.  This change which introduces an allowance of £2,600 against PRSI will, over time, allow us to move along the path of strategic reform of the income tax and PRSI codes.  After all PRSI has become a tax.  That is the reality and we must structure it in an equitable way.  If tax is to be equitable it must be related to ability to pay.  A tax which for so many years has been levied on the first pound of earnings breaches all principles of fairness and relating tax burden to ability to pay.  I am pleased to have been a member of a Government that addressed that issue in its first budget.</P>
    <P>This change is significant for the employer who pays the tax wedge between the cost to him of taking on a person and that person's take home pay. If the three tax changes are aggregated, namely, the reform of PRSI for employees, reform of PRSI for employers and the reform of the income tax code they will have significant effects on the tax wedge.  For example, for a single person earning £12,000&mdash;a standard industrial wage earner&mdash;the effect of the three changes has been to reduce the tax wedge for an employer of such a person by £600 in one budget. We make no apology for concentrating those changes on that type of worker and that person's employer.  The reality is that people working in industry on the standard industrial wage are under threat.  They experience competition not only from Eastern Europe, which is well documented, but also from particular regions in the UK where they have the advantage of lower tax rates because they have not had an anti-employment tax system, which we have had to endure for so long, and a lower PRSI rate.  The Government has unashamedly <Col N="247" /> said it must address the needs of such employers and workers.  I am pleased we will be in a position to say it will be cheaper for those vulnerable employers to take on workers and they will send them home with more money in their pocket.  That is a worthwhile achievement of this budget.</P>
    <P>Another benefit, the effect of which we will see for a long time to come, is reform of child benefit.  For many years we have had to live with the notion of a serious unemployment trap and a serious poverty trap.  That has built up because unemployed people are subjected to different treatment from people earning gross pay from employment.That must be changed.  The change in child benefit is one of the most significant ways in which that can be achieved.  The real problem for persons who are working is that no recognition is given for the cost of rearing a family.  Up to now they received only the meagre child benefit whereas persons in receipt of social welfare get a child dependant allowance as well as child benefit.</P>
    <P>This Government has started to increase the general provision of support for those who have to rear children. They are providing such changes not only for those on social welfare, which would increase the poverty trap, but across the board.  It is clearly stated in the Programme for Government that this measure is only a first step.  The next step is to create a system of child support that balances the position for those on relatively low pay at work with that of those who are out of work.  When that change is in place it will revolutionise the poverty traps we have had to live with for so long.  This is a very important issue, the benefits of which will be evident for many years to come.  The rather grudging recognition of this measure from the Opposition benches does not do justice to a very worthwhile change.</P>
    <P>Changes have been made in this budget that will benefit small businesses which are at the heart of providing employment opportunities for our <Col N="248" /> people.  A very important measure is the change in capital acquisitions tax.  Many of us know people who have worked hard to build up a small family business and as they advance in age they face the prospect that if they hand on the business to family members a massive payment will have to be made to the Revenue Commissioners in the form of capital acquisitions tax.  Up to 40 per cent tax is payable when a person passes on a business to their family.  Nobody wants to see small family businesses treated in such a way.  In this budget the Government has significantly reformed the capital acquisitions tax as it bears on small business.</P>
    <P>Under the new provisions a small business which is passed on to a family member, instead of being subject to a 40 per cent tax bill, will be subject to only half that amount on acquisitions up to £425,000.  By reducing the interest rate payable on such taxes from the penal 15 per cent to 9 per cent, the small business person will have a chance to plan for the hand-over of their business as a going concern to the next generation.  That will be seen as a very worthwhile change and one that will support small business, which is the seed potato of the provision of employment.</P>
    <P>Another measure introduced in the budget relates to what was an irritant to certain small businesses, that is the 20 per cent surcharge payable on top of company tax in certain circumstances. This surcharge, which was seen as a penal rate of tax, was introduced as an anti-avoidance measure.  The Minister is reducing the amount of income subject to the surcharge, and that will be welcomed by the small businesses affected.</P>
    <P>Another important measure which I hope will help to change the climate in which enterprise is conducted is the increase in the annual value of shares which may be allocated to an employee under the profit sharing scheme from its previous limit of £2,000 to £10,000. When the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, slashed that allowance in the budget a couple of years ago there was widespread dismay.  Profit <Col N="249" /> sharing schemes can be an important element in building a partnership at enterprise level.  We are moving into an era where Irish business is no longer seen as &ldquo;them and us&rdquo;.  Increasingly high quality employers are willing to share information, profit and plans and to work as teams in addressing management issues.  The trend in recent times towards world class manufacturing is built on the notion of teamwork in companies to achieve quality and it is important that such team work be recognised in our tax code.  I am pleased to be a member of a Government that recognises that in a very practical way by providing tax relief for profit sharing. That measure will bear fruit for many years.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance rightly pointed to enterprise as a key theme for the budget and made a number of changes that will assist in that area.  He made changes in the seed capital scheme, a scheme whereby people in the PAYE sector who decide to set up a business of their own are refunded tax paid over the previous three years, up to a maximum of £75,000.  The Minister has increased that sum to £125,000.  That is a significant change in that it allows people previously in the PAYE system who take the risk of setting up a business to get their hands on money previously paid in tax for use as a capital base for their new enterprise.  This is an important recognition of the value of people who take such chances to start up enterprises in our economy.  I am disappointed there has not been a better take-up of that scheme.  There are issues as to the way it is being run and I hope the Minister will consider that matter. This measure is a very important change which allows a much better start-up dividend for small companies run by people who were previously in the PAYE system.</P>
    <P>We are very concerned that the difficulty in getting investment capital be addressed on a much wider scale.  I compliment initiatives from the private sector which help the start-up of business. The Smurfit Job Creation Enterprise <Col N="250" /> Fund and First Step are two organisations with whom I have had contact in the context of helping people to set up enterprises.  These are worthwhile initiatives where money is channelled to people who for one reason or another find it difficult to access equity or loans from the conventional sources of funding.The Government is very anxious to build on the success of those initiatives taken primarily due to a charitable approach by those private organisations.</P>
    <P>Under the operational programme for industrial development which I recently launched provision is made, with EU funding support, for the establishment of joint venture funds whereby the Government will put up half the money and private financial houses will put up the other half.  We hope to use that money to target the many areas which venture capital has not reached. We have seen the emergence of a venture capital industry, but it is focused on the larger projects and those with a gilt edge character.  It is our intention to put money into venture funds in areas that have not been tapped by those funds.</P>
    <P>There is a provision of £33 million for such funds, of which £6.5 million will be provided specifically for seed capital.  It is important to make provision in this area.  By getting matching finance from the private sector we will generate much more activity than with the straight provision of grants.  This is part of the shift away from the grants culture which we want to encourage.  In line with our commitment in the Programme for Government we will consider the establishment of venture funds on a very wide basis.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the changing attitude in the banking system to small business.  One of the objectives of the Programme for Government is to encourage financial institutions, including the banks, to adopt a more strategic and long term approach to financing business.  The banks have accepted that they must make changes in this area.  In the past they were not regarded as friendly to small businesses but they have begun to change that attitude.  A <Col N="251" /> number of them have set up loan schemes which offer money to small and medium businesses at a lower rate and for a longer term than was the case in the past.  I welcome these changes and intend to meet with the banks to discuss further initiatives which can be taken in this area.  I am very pleased that they have given the Minister for Finance a commitment to enhance their support for small and medium sized enterprises. I hope we can build on the developments in this critical area.  Banks must realise that by supporting the small businesses of today they are building up clients in big businesses in the future. They must be willing to sacrifice short term gain to have longer-term good secure clients and, from the point of view of the economy, good vibrant businesses.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the previous Government and, in particular, the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, and his then Minister of State, Deputy Séamus Brennan, for establishing the worthwhile loan fund scheme which provided £100 million for business expansion.  The rate of 6.75 per cent for loans under this scheme was well below the existing AA rate and there was a huge demand for funds.  We have been involved in detailed negotiations with the European Commission with a view to the introduction of a scheme which will build on the loan fund scheme and address some of its weaknesses, for example, the exclusion of the service sector and the setting of loans at £50,000 initially and then £40,000 which clearly ruled out of consideration many small businesses.  This issue will be addressed in the near future and I hope to announce a worthwhile scheme which will build on the success of the previous one.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to develop the county enterprise boards so that they will have a more dynamic role in the creation of enterprise in the economy.  Over the past 18 months county enterprise boards have put forward many worthwhile projects and approximately 5,000 jobs will <Col N="252" /> be created if the proposed projects are brought to fruition.  I would like to develop the role of those boards so that instead of just being grant giving bodies they will also create enterprise by focusing on the strengths of their regions and building up opportunities.  Having spoken to their chief executives, I am aware that the county enterprise boards are very keen to take on this role.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the services sector. When in Opposition I published a policy statement on the problems of that sector.The budget has made a start in giving the service sector a fair crack at the whip.  All of us know service sector employers who, having paid 40 per cent profits tax, 20 per cent PRSI and 21 per cent VAT, are lucky to have 3p left out of every pound to keep their businesses going.  This is the reality experienced by many service sector employers who regard themselves as victims and the poor relation in terms of incentive schemes and policies.  The Government has recognised that the service sector can no longer be treated as the poor relation.  Many of the exciting opportunities for business development are in the service sector and the Government is determined to assist that development.I will examine the industrial supports to see how the service sector can be assisted in certain areas.  The Minister for Finance has made significant changes and has begun the process of reform of the corporation tax code.  It is very strange that we would tax service business at four times the rate for manufacturing business.  This is not commensurate with the practice in other countries and it does not contribute to a good employment creating economy. The Minister has flagged his willingness to make changes in this area.  This change will be built on in future years and will yield good returns.</P>
    <P>In the coming months I will seriously examine policy so as to ensure that the Department has a coherent strategy which will span not only the traditional areas of foreign industry and Forbairt but which will also embrace the county enterprise boards, small businesses and, <Col N="253" /> very important, community employment and the role communities can play in providing enteprise in their regions.  I am glad we have reversed the very serious cuts imposed in the community employment scheme by the previous Government.  If that Government had had its way, community employment would have dropped from its present level of 40,000 to 26,000 by the end of the year.  This would have had a devastating effect on many community enterprises and schools which employ caretakers and provide useful employment and services in their communities.</P>
    <P>This is the first of three budgets which the Government will introduce.  It has made very significant reforms in important areas such as PRSI and has taken a number of steps on a much greater reform agenda.  I look forward in the coming years to describing the further progress we make in this area.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Given the nature of politics, perhaps the Government should have made all their changes in this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all hoped the Minister would introduce a radical and inspiring budget. It was said that he had £300 million or £400 million to give away and we all hoped for miracles.  Unfortunately, the budget is not very radical, particularly <Col N="254" /> in the area of social welfare.  When Fianna Fáil was in Government the then Deputies Proinsias De Rossa and Pat Rabbitte said the increases of 3 per cent, 4 per cent and 5 per cent in social welfare were totally inadequate.  I may be naïve but I expected those Deputies in Government to ensure increases of 5 per cent or 6 per cent for social welfare recipients.  The increase of 2.5 per cent for social welfare recipients is very disappointing and an insult to thousands of families on such benefits.</P>
    <P>This is the lowest increase in 30 years. Fianna Fáil in Government provided for increases of 4 per cent and 5 per cent and for extra allowances for the long term unemployed.  Provision has not been made for any such allowances this year.  Old age pensioners over 80 will receive £1.90 and those under 80 £1.80 while widows and persons in receipt of unemployment assistance will receive £1.50.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, have failed the people they claim to represent.  Different parties made different promises and failed to deliver on them in Government but one expected Democratic Left to look after the people it claims to represent.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, said that we should not be negative.  I welcome the increase in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  Any such increase should be welcomed.  Many parents find it difficult to purchase clothes and footwear when their children return to school.</P>
    <P>I would welcome any increase in the carer's allowance.  Many people are caring for elderly persons on a long term basis for little reward.  This allowance is means tested with the result that a person in employment on low wages can find themselves above the limit.  It has been said that it would cost them £500 to £600 per week to have the elderly person cared for in a hospital or home. I welcome the decision to provide a free companion travel pass to all carers.</P>
    <P>In general the social welfare increases <Col N="255" /> are derisory and an insult to those on social welfare.  They should be increased considerably in the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>The banks have made gains in the budget.  The levy of £36 million will be phased out over a period of three years while the rate of corporation profits tax is to be reduced from 40 per cent to 38 per cent.  The Minister should have been more selective.  As can be seen from the figures issued this week by AIB, there has been a massive increase in the profits made by the banks.  They would not receive any sympathy from me.  Bank charges are excessive and put severe pressure on small businesses and ordinary customers.  A person has to pay £30 to £40 to have a chat with a bank manager; an overdraft also costs money.  I do not support the Government's decision to phase out the levy of £36 million over a period of three years.  It is an insult to those on social welfare who are not being given the increases they deserve.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, also referred to the need to create jobs. Approximately 250,000 are unemployed.In some housing estates in my own community the unemployment rate is between 60 and 70 per cent.  Any measures to create employment and to help the low paid should be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the tax changes, which are a step in the right direction.  We will have to remove those on low incomes from the tax net.  The leader of my party, Deputy Ahern, suggested that there should be a special 20 per cent tax rate for low paid workers.  This should be seriously considered.</P>
    <P>There is a plethora of county enterprise boards, partnership and Leader programmes as well as FÁS schemes&mdash;there are four such schemes in Wexford.  We should seriously consider placing all these bodies under one umbrella to avoid bureaucracy and red tape.  All have made a contribution but they would be more efficient if they were operating from the one office where people with a good idea could seek finance and back-up services.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for sharing his time with me.  Unfortunately, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has left the Chamber but I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, will convey my comments to him.  In his speech he referred to the county enterprise boards.  These have been in operation for over 15 months. While I accept the Minister's claim that these boards have the potential to create 5,000 jobs, the figures I have received in the past two weeks in reply to a parliamentary question cause some concern.  Only 20 per cent of the funds approved during the past 15 months have been drawn down.  It seems that projects are being approved despite the fact that their sponsors do not have the ability to draw down the funds approved within a reasonable time span.  In August or September last year in County Mayo the moneys approved ran out with the result that genuine projects, the sponsors of which would have been able to draw down funds at an early date, were not approved for a period of one or two months until the matter was rectified by the Department of Enterprise and Employment providing additional funding.  This matter needs to be considered carefully to ensure that the approach adopted throughout the country is consistent and that the sponsors of projects have the ability to draw down funds at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also made reference to the potential of the service sector.  This is recognised by all parties in the House and the figures are there to prove it. Total employment has increased from 39 per cent in 1961 to 60 per cent at present.  It is unfortunate that the main recommendations of the report of the task force on small business that the service sector should be the engine of growth and that the rate of corporation profits tax should be reduced from 40 <Col N="257" /> per cent to 25 per cent&mdash;this has been costed by the Department of Finance at £27 million in a full year&mdash;have not been implemented this year.  It has been decided to reduce the rate from 40 per cent to 38 per cent.  This is a start but small businesses which have the greatest potential for growth will not receive the full benefit of this recommendation. Instead we have bent the knee to the banks which will record their largest profits ever, as can be seen from the figures reported yesterday by AIB.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to widen the tax bands and to increase personal allowances.  This is an ongoing process. It has been noted that the beneficiaries were not shouting on the streets last Thursday or over the weekend.  The aim is to ensure that a large number of taxpayers will pay tax at the standard rate and an increasing number will be removed from the tax net.  It has to be recognised that the total tax take is set to increase again.  Despite the concessions worth in the region of £200 million this does not mean that taxpayers in 1995 will pay £200 million less in income tax as against last year.  When pay increases and higher prices are taken into account the tax take will increase.</P>
    <P>Even allowing for increased public expenditure, as indicated, and considering that inflation and interest rates are set to remain static or, at the very most, predictable, more could have been done this year than in previous years.  That would have increased public confidence and consumer spending and Exchequer revenue returns would have been enhanced.</P>
    <P>Despite income tax concessions, this budget has been perceived by the general public as a damp squib.  Following its delivery and the ritual examination in the media, it has now been forgotten by the tax paying public.  I was in my constituency last weekend and not once was I asked by any member of the tax paying public what I thought of the budget which attempted a lot without achieving anything of significance.  The scatter gun effect ensured that the <Col N="258" /> budget lost what should have been its primary focus as an engine of economic growth.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance stated in his budget speech that the annual budget is about establishing priorities.  It reflects choices and affirms values.  I welcome the emphasis on rewarding work but I question its intended purpose to strengthen social solidarity.  All the economic commentators and others tell us that this country is enjoying sustained economic growth, falling unemployment, etc. and will continue to prosper for the foreseeable future.  This was not achieved overnight but by prudent management of the economy over the past number of years.  The fruits of this labour are not being distributed in an equitable way when large financial institutions gain more from measures in this budget than the 14 per cent of the population over 65 years of age.  Added to that number of elderly are the single unemployed and childless unemployed couples.  The 2.5 per cent increase is best described as miserly and uncaring but the spin doctors try to equate and justify the level of increase to the rate of inflation.  I question the rate of inflation and its method of calculation, particularly for an old age pensioner living in a rural area whose food is purchased from shops other than national supermarket chains and who invariably must depend on private hackney services to travel in and out of small towns and villages.</P>
    <P>This budget will be remembered as the anti-senior citizen budget which gives the smallest increase in social welfare for approximately 30 years.  Those who have contributed a lifetime of work and service to the State are the forgotten sector of society.  As the Minister for Finance said, the budget reflects choices and affirms values but in regard to social welfare, Fianna Fáil rejects the choices made and does not subscribe to the values indicated in the social solidarity portion of the budget.  I am pleased that our Leader, Deputy Ahern, will be putting down an amendment <Col N="259" /> seeking a 3 per cent across the board social welfare increase.</P>
    <P>Last year, our party provided £4 million for housing aid for the elderly scheme which ensured that the severe backlog in the scheme was tackled.  That was the usual provision and there was an additional £2 million from the proceeds of the tax amnesty.  It would have been asking much if the same provision had been provided this year.  Instead, a 100 per cent, reduction in this worthwhile scheme, in addition to the derisory level of social welfare increase, should send out a clear signal to the elderly in regard to the choices made on their behalf by the Government.  The elderly do not feature to any appreciable extent in these choices.</P>
    <P>The phasing out of the bank levy over three years and the reduction in corporation tax to 38 per cent seems perverse compared to the level of social welfare increase.  I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, stating that the removal of the bank levy was Exchequer neutral but it will certainly improve their cash flow for longer than usual.  If the Government is in the business of removing levies, why does the insurance levy of 2 per cent on all insurance products remain?  Will the Government remove it at least from the sector of society who can ill afford it, namely, those over 65 who must have home, public liability and car insurance? I am satisfied that the sum of money involved would be very little and would help to rectify the blow to this sector of our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne and Deputy Hughes for sharing their time with me.  I too congratulate Deputy Doyle on her appointment as Minister of State.  I will not outline her various responsibilities because I would use up all of the time available to me but as she comes from a neighbouring county, I am delighted about her appointment and she can keep tabs on her two senior Ministers.  Unfortunately, there is not any Minister now in my constituency.  I <Col N="260" /> also congratulate Deputy Burton on her reappointment.</P>
      <P>When I was a young fellow a local man, who was a bit of a poet, was fond of quoting an old saying: &ldquo;The mountain laboured and brought forth a mouse&rdquo;.  That is very appropriate when one considers this budget, indeed no budget in living memory received as much attention as this year.  Long before the Minister's announcement to the Dáil, the budget features were available to anyone who cared to read a national daily newspaper.  In fact, when the Minister stood up to announce the budget details, all his audience knew exactly what to expect.  This was bizarre and not the manner in which to treat the most important annual statement to the House by any Minister, especially by a Minister for Finance.  In my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, the tragic consequences of the deluge of leaks surrounding this year's budget cost our Minister of State dearly.  These issues must be of concern to all who have adhered to and upheld the traditions attached to the preparation and presentation of such a serious set of proposals affecting the lives of our citizens.</P>
      <P>As far back as January, I tabled a number of questions to various Ministers including the Ministers for Finance, Social Welfare, Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Education and Environment.I wanted to raise matters of concern and I hoped that my submissions might have been included in the forthcoming budget.  These were raised not only by my constituents and the public generally but in the many pre-budget submissions which we received.  I hoped these submissions would provide some relief for the sectors of society in need of our support at this time.  I will outline some of the proposals in due course but I will first reveal the trend of the replies I received to my questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the first two days of this month the Minister for Finance and the Minister of Social Welfare, separately, informed me that it would be inappropriate for them to give any indication or <Col N="261" /> to make any comment in advance of the budget.  In light of the revelations made to those outside the House, who have no mandate, I must question the use of the term &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; when answering the legitimate questions of elected Members of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to the provisions of the budget.  It has always been my belief that a budget must allow us provide for those who have no resources while, at the same time, ensuring that employment and productivity within the State are fostered and encouraged.  The Minister for Finance maintained that as a Labour Minister his main concern was work and those people at work.  I would remind him, since he seems to have had a lapse of memory, that while the numbers of those in receipt of wages and salary are of the greatest concern to all of us, large numbers of our people have no weekly wage or monthly salary.  Some of those people are too young to work and others are now too old and at the end of their working lives, they should have the support of a nation which they supported loyally in the past.  Others are farmers and the self employed who contribute daily to the economic life of the country and a large number, unfortunately, are unable to find work in a society where rationalisation for international market forces plays a dominant role.</P>
    <P>How have these diverse yet equally important sectors of society fared under the banner of socialism?  In spite of all the hype and hysteria, the fact remains that we have seen much ado about little. In particular, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and his party members and colleagues, who made their political careers on the backs of the poor, did not do very well in his first test.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Very little&rdquo; is the only comment we can make about the £1.80 extra per week with which old age pensioners must face the future.  The £1.60 was a very small increase for those on invalidity pensions and less still is the £1.50 given to those on disability or unemployment benefit.  Less is given to an <Col N="262" /> entire range of people whose lives depend on payments from the State. What can we say about the 10p per week increase allowed those who live alone?  There appears to be a greater willingness among the liaison of the Left to provide the media with material than there is to provide proper care for those most in need of our help.</P>
    <P>There are features of the budget which I welcome but that should be the case because we left the economy in a strong position.  There have been Fianna Fáil dominated Governments since 1987 and we should expect positive measures in this budget.  The increase in child benefit of £1.75 a week sounds better when translated into a monthly payment of £7 a month but it still boils down to a modest increase.  The changes in PRSI contributions which, coupled with changes in income tax liability, may well mean a gain of almost £300 a year to the single person on £20,000 but will mean an extra £144 a year or £2.77 a week to the person on £5,000 a year.  The £384 gained by a married couple with two children on £7,000 a year still falls far short of the £682 gained by a similar couple earning £40,000.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish law of defamation, in large measure, has been adopted from the British system without much examination as to whether it is suitable to our needs or whether, in the unique conditions that obtain in Ireland, we should have taken over the law of defamation as we found it at the time we gained our independence and applied it without much consideration as to its content or social effects and without radical reform.  Although there was in 1961 a Defamation Act which was designed to bring into Irish law many of the changes that had taken place in the English law <Col N="263" /> of defamation, there has not been at any time, until relatively recently, a critical examination of the law of defamation and a critical examination at a political level of the interaction between, on the one hand, the principle of freedom of speech and, on the other, the principle that the individual's reputation is a valuable thing worthy of legal protection.</P>
    <P>In that context the Progressive Democrats, in 1989, included in the Programme for Government a commitment that the Government would seek to amend the law of defamation.  What we had in mind at that time was to alter the balance between freedom of speech on the one hand and protection of the individual's reputation on the other with a general view to making more liberal and more free the role of the media in Irish society.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that as far as the nature of society is concerned, we are dealing with profound matters and that it is not something in which it is possible to come to a simplistic viewpoint without being conscious of the effect that changes in this area can have on the whole complexion and ethos of a democratic society.  By the same token there are very many models in the world from which to chose.</P>
    <P>One, the American model, is not particularly balanced in my view and in the view of many people in this country. The Supreme Court and the courts generally, in a series of decisions, have regarded the freedom of speech imperative set out in the American Constitution as being so far-reaching as to lay low in many respects protections which many of us would regard as natural and proper in a society that respects the individual.  It is notable that in America it is almost impossible in matters of public controversy to libel anybody.  In the celebrated Westmoreland case, the American system was shown to be one in which the capacity of an individual to vindicate his good name was put to one side and devalued compared with the capacity of a journalist to put his or her point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="264" /> Obviously expressions of opinion and a free investigative press are values which most people favour in any democracy, and they do come into conflict with the need to protect the privacy, the dignity and the reputation of the individual.The balance that is struck between those two conflicting principles &mdash; and they are conflicting principles in many ways &mdash; is set out in any society in its law relating to defamation.</P>
    <P>Most of us here would recoil from the French system just as much as from the American system under which people are criminally prosecuted for defamation and punished by the courts for saying things of others which are untrue, where in Ireland there would be no remedy, or only a civil remedy in damages, because there was nothing defamatory about the statement, incorrect though it might be.  Most of us here would regard it as unacceptable that the criminal law should be used to impose manners on people as to how they use their right of freedom of speech and freedom of expression.</P>
    <P>So, between the civil law system which permits criminal and civil punishment, effectively, of abuses of freedom of speech and the American system which, in matters of public controversy at any rate, virtually gives no guarantee to anybody of any protection of their reputation, there is a huge area of open space in which it is possible to draw lines and to establish balances which are radically different, one from another. The Progressive Democrats believe that the time has come for the Irish State to address the inter-relationship of freedom of expression and the need to protect the character and good name of the citizen in a new and fundamental way and to look to our own experience as a democratic society with a view to establishing in our own minds where the proper balance lies.</P>
    <P>We are not doing this as an exercise isolated from reality because this House has had the benefit of a considerable amount of learned comment on these precise issues.  In January 1989 the Law Reform Commission initiated a review <Col N="265" /> of the law relating to defamation and produced, first, a discussion document and, more recently, a report on the issue of defamation law and made some proposals in it which are crying out for implementation.  It made other proposals on which even the members of the commission itself were divided, and still other proposals on which they were unanimous but about which many people outside the Law Reform Commission had some reservations, to put it no stronger than that.</P>
    <P>The first and most major proposal that the commission came up with was to abolish the previous distinction between libel and slander and have a civil wrong of defamation.  That is a thing which most people who have ever practised in the area of defamation law would regard as rational and sensible, even though it is possible to see why, in terms of social policy, the spoken word should be differentiated from the written or broadcast word in terms of the damage it could do and the reasonableness of providing remedies for the abuse of freedom of speech in a spoken form compared with the other form.  Nonetheless the grounds for distinguishing between libel and slander, and the lines of distinction between the two torts is not defensible on a rational basis and seems, in all good common sense, to be one on which there should be reform and a single civil wrong of defamation.</P>
    <P>Second, the Law Reform Commission proposed &mdash; I believe most people in this House believe it is a valid criticism of the existing law &mdash; that, in addition to a right of action for damages for damage done to your character by way of defamation, there should be a right of action to have statements made about you declared wrong by way of judicial process in a summary way, a declaratory judgement as an alternative to an action in damages.  I believe most people will think that is a sensible proposal.  Third, the Law Reform Commission proposed to codify the existing defences to actions for defamation and to set out a definition of defamation which was clear and easily understood.  The proposals in this <Col N="266" /> Bill in respect of the definition of defamation and the defences to an action for defamation are largely based on the proposals made by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission came up with some interesting proposals on extending the protection of defamation to prevent defamation of recently deceased persons and to vest in their next-of-kin a right to right the record by a judicial process.  On reflection, that point of view is more fraught with difficulty than with possibilities for useful actions in courts.  At present it is possible to defame the dead with absolute immunity from action, but with a few lamentable exceptions there has not been any rash of publications of a defamatory kind concerning the dead. The social evil that the Law Reform Commission identified as a reason for extending defamation to people who are dead is probably not sufficient to warrant a departure of that kind.</P>
    <P>One of the most commonly asserted criticisms of the present law of defamation is that it is unduly harsh upon the print and broadcast media in this country.  There is undoubtedly a perception in the media that they feel themselves to be operating under a heavy onus of a legal kind with which they find it difficult to comply while being genuinely investigative and courageous in the way they handle issues.  In my view, the balance tends to favour the individual at the expense of society's right to know or right to have issues raised and nowhere is that clearer than in the sphere of politics and public affairs generally.The second last Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, was reputed never to threaten to litigate with any newspapers which wrote about him whereas the last Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, had a different approach.  I do not intend to offer any criticism except to say there is no clear tradition in Irish politics of allowing comment about you of an unrestricted kind in the press.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty, a judge of the Supreme Court, advanced the <Col N="267" /> view last weekend that there is something untoward and unfree about a society in which politicians regularly can resort to actions in libel as their remedy against the media.  I believe the media is somewhat supine when threatend by politicians.  There are very few politicians who could afford a photo famine &mdash; nobody can force a newspaper to mention anybody with regularity.  If politicans, or even a Taoiseach, trigger happy with litigation of this kind, was told by the newspapers collectively to cop himself on and not to be taking them for £40,000 this week and £80,000 next week, making substantial sums of money by threatening them with libel suits, or face the consequences of a photo famine.  I think few politicians would proceed with such a course of action or such habitual resort to the law of libel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish media in recent times were weak minded when confronted with a pattern of writs.  They should have said: &ldquo;Go ahead but do not bother hiring Bunny Carr Communications or polishing up your scripts because in a free society we cannot be forced to print your material and if you do not play by decent rules, nothing can force us to pretend everything is all right in our relationship with you&rdquo;.  Had that been done it might have brought some people to their senses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there are occasions when the media has hounded people &mdash; again I do not want to get into individual examples &mdash; and in that context there must be a balanced protection for people in public life from campaigning journalism vindictive and vicious in its tone.  Some politicians in this House might query whether it was fair that some newspapers every Sunday for weeks on end always had a new angle criticising or invading some aspect of their political career with a view to damaging them <Col N="268" /> and for which they had virtually no redress.  In that context I believe we must have a different balance.</P>
    <P>The rights of the media in Irish society are recognised in the Constitution as being important for the purpose of educating public opinion.  That may sound an arch way of putting it, but I would say they are very important in liberal democracy to act as a check on the abuse of power.  This House is not sufficient by itself to do that, neither is the judicial nor the criminal system.  We need a free, vibrant, strong, self-confident media.  We need people in the media who are investigative, courageous and truth seekers, who are sometimes fearless in their pursuit of the truth.</P>
    <P>I find &mdash; and I do not want this to be taken wrongly &mdash; that we do not have a very strong tradition of investigative journalism.  On RTE, for instance, we do not have the sharp edged or hard hitting programmes they have in Britain which has identical libel laws.  Programmes such as &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; have done more to expose Irish issues than have Irish programmes.  I am not just talking about the beef industry but issues such as the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  Foreign broadcasting companies have been more investigative, fearless and courageous in investigating these issues than native institutions.</P>
    <P>The same applies to newspapers.  British newspapers working under the same system are more challenging and investigative than Irish newspapers.  I do not think it is due to the moral character of Irish newspaper journalists or editors but rather English newspapers are that much more powerful and robust economically that they can afford to take the odd tumble in the libel courts whereas Irish newspapers cannot afford to do so.</P>
    <P>Without naming individual newspapers, virtually no weekly provincial newspaper could defend a serious libel action unless it was extremely sure of its ground.  The same applies to many national newspapers which appear from time to time to be more or less financially debilitated.  The same applies to <Col N="269" /> RTE.  In a small society with limited revenue, it does not see how it could embark on a libel case which would cost not much more than a libel case in the Old Bailey but which would have dramatically different results in terms of proportionate outcomes for the balance sheet of a broad casting body such as the BBC when compared to RTE.</P>
    <P>We should have a different balance and the media deserve a considerable degree of support from our legal system in dealing with matters of public interest and controversy.  If the balance is to be struck differently it must be as a result of a careful, cold and rational judgement of where exactly it should be struck and how much or how little it is reasonable to do in terms of changing the onus of proof and procedures in order to protect the media.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with most of the major recomendations of the Law Reform Commission regarding these matters.  It proposes that the onus of proof in defamation proceedings should be cast on the plaintiff as is the case in other forms of litigation.  In other words, if you say you have been accused of robbing a bank the very least you must do is go into the witness box and say in a credible way: &ldquo;I did not rob a bank&rdquo;.  It is amazing that under our system a plaintiff can sit in the bowels of the court and not give evidence in a case in which strong charges are made against him but simply require the media in question to prove that the article was, in essence, true.</P>
    <P>I draw a distinction between the private lives of ordinary individuals and matters of public concern.  It is wrong to expose the private individual to the necessity of coming to court and prove that a report was malicious, but it is not wrong to require a private individual to at least expose themselves to cross-examination if they want to claim damages on the basis that their reputation was damaged by a particular article or publication.  They should at least go into the witness box and give <i>prima facie</i> evidence that what was said about them was false.  No one gets compensation for <Col N="270" /> a broken leg, physical damage, false imprisonment or malicious prosecution by sitting in the court and allowing the defendant to make the running.  I do not see anything wrong in principle with establishing that the onus of proof must be discharged by the plaintiff.  I am not simply saying that a defendant must prove everything or else be decreed for libel.</P>
    <P>I apologise to the House for the fact that Members did not have more time to consider the Bill.  I also apologise for a number of errors which arose during the course of my drafting the Bill and for which I am responsible.  In section 21 two separate principles are conflated and will require to be sorted out if the Bill goes further.</P>
    <P>In section 21 (2) the purpose of the defence established in respect of certain reports &mdash; I did not mean to confine it to reports set out in the Schedule as subsection (1) appears to do &mdash; was to give to print and broadcast journalists a defence where the matter published concerns a matter of legitimate public concern, where the matter published was intended by the publisher and its author to be published for the public benefit, where the publisher and the author took every reasonable care to establish the truth of the matter published and to avoid defaming the plaintiff and that the publisher and author bona fide believed on reasonable grounds that the matter published was true.</P>
    <P>Perhaps other Members have different criteria for establishing a defence of comment and statement of fact on matters of public importance but it seems to me that investigative journalism needs that underpinning.  If it is a matter of legitimate public concern, if the article is genuinely motivated out of concern for the public good, if every reasonable care is taken in the preparation of the article to establish its truth and avoid defaming the plaintiff and the publisher and the author bona fide believed that the matter published was true, the balance of public good in terms of the right of freedom of speech and a free and <Col N="271" /> courageous media is best served by conferring a defence on people who publish such matters.  It would not be a licence to query everyone's private behaviour because it would be restricted by its terms to matters of public interest.  That provision ought to be taken on board and made part of the law relating to the freedom of the press and the right of those who are defamed to vindicate their good name.</P>
    <P>In section 26 I included a recommendation made by the majority of the Law Reform Commission though, I must confess, with some misgiving.  It is to the effect that the court should not make an award of general damages where the defendant establishes to the satisfaction of the court that before publication of the matter complained of he or she exercised reasonable care in attempting to ascertain the truth of the allegation of fact.  It seems to me that some of the misgivings expressed by the minority of the Law Reform Commission on that issue have considerable weight.  Rather than run away from the issue, it struck me it was best to include it in the Bill so that it would be raised before the House and a definite judgment made between the majority and minority position in the Law Reform Commission.  The issue could be properly debated were the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I want to deal with the question of procedure.  The Law Reform Commission had particular recommendations to make in relation to procedure for trying defamation cases and suggested originally that juries should be present in both the Circuit and High Courts but that the function of deciding damages, both general and punitive, where they arose, should be reserved for the judge.  I believe that emanates from the concern of newspapers that, in defamation cases, juries seemed to believe that very large sums, which the newspapers in particular and the broadcast media considered unreasonable, ought to be handed down in cases where there has been defamation.  I believe it <Col N="272" /> was in an effort to secure downward pressure on jury awards that the newspapers &mdash; in particular the national newspapers &mdash; advocated the abolition of jury trial of the issue of damages in its entirety.  I believe it was, as a part response to that, that the Law Reform Commission suggested the judge should carry out that function.</P>
    <P>I do not carry any particular professional baggage in this matter since I supported the abolition of juries in personal injuries claims.  I thought it was unreasonable to get 12 people together, at great cost and inconvenience to them, to decide relatively simple matters of fact, for example, whether somebody had sounded their horn before having emerged from a laneway and the like. But, in contrast, I do believe in the retention of juries in serious defamation cases and it would be a retrograde step if senior politicians, senior church men, even judges, came to have their reputations decided by a single member of the Judiciary sitting alone in a court. That would be unfortunate and an abdication of what I believe to be one of the best features of jury trial now in operation in civil matters, that is that nobody can suggest that there were wrong motives on the part of the jurors, that personal prejudice decided the matter and, generally speaking, that everyone accepts without question the decision of a jury on a criminal and a civil matter.</P>
    <P>The tendency of the Judiciary to support the establishment, be it the police establishment, the political establishment or whatever, is well known.  Therefore, it would be foolish to expect the Judiciary to perform as manifestly independently as juries can, and do, on issues of grave political or moral controversy, or whatever.  In that context I contend it is right to keep a place for jury trial.  But, within that context, it does not make sense to have a jury decide there should be punitive damages awarded, but to tell a High Court judge &mdash; who probably does not share their view at all, and possibly radically disagrees with them &mdash; that he should fix the damages the jury has just stated <Col N="273" /> should be awarded.  The proposal in the Bill to require the judge to give guidance and direction to the jury as to reasonable levels of damages and the principle of awarding damages, to allow either party in the proceedings to address a jury &mdash; where the matter is dealt with by a judge sitting alone, on the question of how much damages would be reasonable &mdash; is a sensible compromise between the two points of view which have given rise to proposed different treatments of this issue.</P>
    <P>As the Law Reform Commission suggested, the Bill also deals with the issue of criminal defamation, though it does not deal with the issue of blasphemy. The reason blasphemy was omitted was because it is required by the Constitution to be an offence and, in this Bill, we did not want to get into all of the area of what is blasphemy for one religious minority, what is not for another, and left that to one side to be dealt with on another day.</P>
    <P>In Part IV, the Bill also provides for the issue of contempt of court and protection of published information.  I note that in recent months, the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats, have proposed reforms of the law to afford the Irish media the same or even better protection than obtains in the case of the English media under the Contempt of Court Act, 1980, a limited right to protect the confidentiality of sources.  In that context I find it remarkable that a Member of this House, by virtue of recent decisions, has the right to withhold from a court the source of his or her information but a journalist has no such right not even tempered by the obligation of the court to do justice to the parties.  It has always struck me that if one wanted to give an Irish journalist now, in this new regime, some information which was untraceable, all one had to do was ring up one's local Dáil Deputy, give him or her that information for onward transmission to the media, when one would create an impenetrable wall of secrecy around where the information first came from. In its own way, that shows there is a <Col N="274" /> need, as the two Opposition parties in this House have identified, for a reform of the law to protect journalists' interests from unnecessary requirements that they should disclose their sources when others in society, with a very similar function, are afforded the immense protection which Members of this House have discovered in recent years, they enjoy in these matters, through court actions.</P>
    <P>Doubtless this Bill could do with improvement.  It represents a genuine effort to address the issue and is based largely on what was suggested by the Law Reform Commission.  Doubtless its provisions are open to criticism.  Perhaps there are Members here who profoundly disagree with its provisions &mdash; without declaring any State secrets, I think there are some members of my party who would be uneasy with some of its provisions &mdash; on the basis that perhaps it tilts the balance too much in favour of the media.  Undoubtedly a new balance must be struck but that will not be done unless this Legislature embarks on the very responsible, complex task of examining the issues involved, arriving at a new view as to whether the existing law of libel we inherited from the British is appropriate to a liberal, republican society; whether we should not look to other jurisdictions worldwide to ascertain how that balance can best be struck.</P>
    <P>Reforming the law of defamation is not a panacea for all the media's problems.We live in a society in which, like battery hens, many people in the media like to be fed with information, a society within which there is a highly sophisticated support apparatus for politicians to reduce every speech to a written form, to put a spin on this or that; there are people whose profession it is to act as consultant speech writers for the great and mighty in our society.  Indeed we have journalists &mdash; perhaps because they have learned the hard way &mdash; who have found it easier to be given information than to ferret it out, who have found it easier to avoid many controversies rather than ferret out further <Col N="275" /> controversies.  Here I am not being critical of the Irish media or Irish journalists I fully understand the <i>milieu</i> within which they all operate.</P>
    <P>I fully understand, as well as any other Member of this House, the pressures on them, the way in which public comment here is organised.  But I do say it is my profound belief that our society is not sufficiently open and liberal in relation to the balance it has struck between people's right to express their opinions and the right of the media to develop opinion and articulate criticism of the political and social establishment. We have struck the wrong balance.  The time has come when we must stop prevaricating, begin the process of recasting our law in relation to that delicate balance between free speech and the reputation and dignity of the individual in a way consonant with a society which is self-confident and trusts its judgment on how that balance should be struck.</P>
    <P>I understand the Government wants time to consider these matters and I do not grudge it that because as pointed out earlier today it has a heavy legislative programme.  If time is required to consider this and reach a worthwhile judgment on it, I am in favour of a reasonable length of time being taken. However, the issue cannot be postponed much longer.  In acquiescing to the request for further time, study and reflection, I appreciate the gesture of the Government in not indicating an immediate desire to shoot down this Bill on the basis that it may introduce its own proposals, but I understand the Minister will outline the middle course to the House.</P>
    <P>This should prove to be the year in which all parties in this House face up to the issues set out in the report of the Law Reform Commission and 1996 should definitely see the passage of a defamation Bill which fundamentally changes Ireland's law on defamation.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="276" /> To delete &ldquo;now&rdquo; and to add at the end of the motion &ldquo;this day nine months&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government favours some reform of the law on defamation.  However, we will not be in a position to deal with this subject in the immediate future.  For this reason, it has been decided to take the procedural step reflected in the amendment on the supplemenary Order Paper.</P>
    <P>We are taking this approach for four reasons.  The first is a question of priorities.With the inevitably limited resources available to me in my Department, I can neither bring forward legislation on every subject, nor provide the very considerable examination and servicing required for Private Members Bills on very subject.  I have decided to prioritise important social reforms mainly in the family law area.  However, I hope to deal with the subject of defamation within an appropriate reasonable timescale.</P>
    <P>The second reason for our approach is that I am not in a position to say that I agree with all of the central proposals in the Bill, and quite frankly I doubt that I could accept all of them.  In particular, the proposal to reverse the burden of proof comes to mind in this regard, a matter to which I will return later.</P>
    <P>A further and related reason is the fact that the law on defamation raises complex legal and constitutional issues. The competing rights to a good name, to privacy and to freedom of expression have to be viewed not only from the standpoint of the Constitution, but also from the point of view of international human rights law, in particular under the European Convention on Human Rights.  We must make sure that we get the approach right.</P>
    <P>This inevitably involves a degree of detailed legal analysis by the Government and in particular by the Attorney General.  The Government has already asked the Attorney General to examine a number of matters relevant to the task in hand.  However, I am firmly convinced that there is a real need to take <Col N="277" /> the necessary time required to examine the matter in an appropriate degree of depth.</P>
    <P>I am surprised by the speed at which proposals for reform can leap-frog to the top of the Progressive Democrats' agenda.  In July 1989, when the Progressive Democrats were entering Government, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Programme for Government stated that &ldquo;new laws ... changing the libel laws ... will be introduced&rdquo;. Deputy McDowell's Bill presumably fulfils that promise of six years ago, but unfortunately he did not motivate his party to introduce any legislation on the subject during the period when they actually held office.</P>

      <P>A final reason for our approach is that we take a realistic view of the effects of reform.  Deputies should not run away with themselves in painting a picture of the new dawn of enlightenment, openness and journalistic immunity from suit which this Progressive Democrat Bill would usher in.  Some of these reform proposals may have a value, but it should not be exaggerated. I do not think for example that abolishing the distinction between libel and slander will do very much for the journalistic community.  Nor do I believe that the option of a declaratory remedy, useful though it may be, will necessarily deter vast numbers of plaintiffs from seeking damages.  All I ask is that the House approach the question of reform with a sense of proportion, rather than with wild claims about laying the foundation of a new era of investigative journalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would now like to turn in greater detail to the Bill and the reasons we wish to postpone its detailed consideration at this time.  The Defamation Bill before the House deals with three separate areas of the law &mdash; civil defamation, criminal defamation and contempt of <Col N="279" /> court &mdash; and each of these areas has been the subject of a separate examination by the Law Reform Commission. As Minister with responsibility for civil law reform, I propose to confine my comments to the first area only, that of civil defamation.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen will deal with the criminal aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <P>This area of the law is complex.  It involves striking a balance between the competing interests of freedom of expression, on the one hand, and the citizen's right to his or her good name and privacy on the other.  It draws on influences derived from the common law, from statute, including the Defamation Act, 1961, and from the fundamental rights enshrined in our Constitution.In consequence, any reform of the civl law on defamation will not be an easy task, nor is it one which can be accomplished with excessive speed.</P>
    <P>I have noted with interest the comments of Deputy McDowell regarding the views of some members of his party on the complexities of the law in this area.  I look forward to hearing their contributions and their reservations on this subject in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will find it.  If the Deputy was listening she would have heard my proposal regarding the Bill.  In their examination of the civil law <Col N="280" /> of defamation, the Law Reform Commission examined the constitutional background against which any reform of this area should be considered.  Three provisions in the Constitution are of particular relevance.  Article 40.3.2º relates to the protection of the citizen's good name, Article 40.6.1º guarantees freedom of expression and Article 40.3.1º is the basis for the unenumerated right of freedom to communicate.  The commission concluded that these provisions leave a wide discretion to the Oireachtas in determining how best the good name of the citizen might be protected and vindicated by a properly framed, and I emphasise, properly framed, law of defamation and that it is for the Oireachtas to reconcile the competing rights to which I have referred earlier in accordance with the common good.</P>
      <P>Undoubtedly, the Law Reform Commission's recommendations are intended to form the basis for that necessary reconciliation of competing rights.  Excellent and all as those recommendations may be, I am not, unlike Deputy McDowell, in a position to accept them at face value and dress them up in the form of a fully thought-out legislative proposal.  If I were merely to regurgitate the Law Reform Commission recommendations, without first giving them proper scrutiny, I would be failing in my duty to the Oireachtas, the Government and, ultimately, the public and I am not prepared to do that.  Doing the job in that way is a luxury that falls to the Opposition but the responsibilities of Government apply otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill draws heavily on the recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission's Report on the Civil Law of Defamation.  That report embodied a large number of recommendations for change in this area under 59 separate headings.  The National Newspapers of Ireland &mdash; a group which has some interest in this matter &mdash; has also made proposals for change which, despite some points of <Col N="281" /> difference, are substantially in accordance with the Law Reform Commission's recommendations.</P>
    <P>If I were in a position to deal critically and in detail with each and every provision contained in this Bill, I would have little excuse for not bringing forward legislative proposals of my own. As I have made clear, I am not in such a position.  Therefore, I intend to confine my remarks to the broad principles which the Bill seeks to enunciate, and I stress that my comments are entirely without prejudice to further decisions which I may take in relation to the subject.</P>
    <P>Section 5 proposes to abolish the distinction between libel and slander.  In principle, I think that this may be desirable.Commentators have pointed out that the distinction between libel and slander, and between slander actionable <i>per se</i>, and slander actionable on proof of special damage only, is largely the product of historical accident, rather than of rational development in the law. However, whether or not the particular definition of defamation proposed in section 6 is the one to follow is something on which I must reserve my position.</P>
    <P>There is a very important change in the law proposed in section 9, which reflects recommendation 14.3(6) of the Law Reform Commission's report.  As indicated in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, this would be a particularly far-reaching change.  As the law stands, a plaintiff must show that the statement complained of is defamatory, but he or she is not obliged to prove that the statement is false, since the law presumes the falsity of defamatory statements.  The burden is thus on the defendant in a defamation action to establish the truth of the statement if the defence of justification is raised.</P>
    <P>In their consultation paper, the Law Reform Commission provisionally recommended that this presumption of falsity should be retained.  In their final report, a majority of the commission expressed support for its abolition, but a minority continued to argue in favour <Col N="282" /> of its retention.  From the majority perspective, it is in principle unsatisfactory that a plaintiff should not be obliged to prove all the essential ingredients of the wrong alleged, including its untruth. Furthermore, under the present law, it is felt that some defendants, particularly media defendants, may find it difficult to establish the truth of their statements in court, even when they have good reason for believing them to be true. For example, withnesses may be unavailable to testify or may be reluctant to do so.  That would be the perspective from the point of view of the media.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, the minority would contend that a situation in which the plaintiff would be required in effect to prove his or her innocence would be inconsistent with the spirit of the constitutional requirement that the State vindicate the good name of every citizen in the case of injustice done.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the purpose of the law of defamation is not to protect citizens from defamatory statements which are true, but from those which are untrue. At the same time, it is not too much to ask that a defendant should be capable of substantiating the defamatory statements which he or she is alleged to have made.  I would have to confess that I am not disposed towards this proposal and, at this stage, I would not be happy to accept the premise contained in the Progressive Democrats' Bill.</P>
    <P>Turning to the question of the remedies which might be available in defamation actions, I have to say that the present situation, where the principal remedy is one of damages, is not entirely satisfactory.  Certainly I am aware that there is a general feeling among the media, and booksellers in particular, that the current level of damages is too high.  This problem can be addressed on two levels.  First, we need to look more closely at the situation where damages might be the appropriate remedy and the matters which might inform the granting of such a remedy. Secondly, we need to examine the possibilities for alternative remedies so that <Col N="283" /> damages will not be the sole focus in defamation actions.</P>
    <P>I believe that a clear statutory statement concerning the circumstances in which an award of general damages may be appropriate, along the lines contained in section 27 of the Bill, would be desirable.  It may also be desirable to highlight clearly the circumstances in which an award of punitive damages may be appropriate.  In the context of damage awards generally, it may be useful to state clearly that the tendering of an apology should not be construed <i>per se</i> as an admission of liability, and may be considered in mitigation of damages. In general, the basic aim of reform in this area should be to secure proportionality between the damages granted and the nature of the injury sustained.</P>
    <P>I note that, under section 27, the assessment of damages in defamation cases would still be a matter for a jury.  Some would favour the abolition of juries in defamation actions which would put these cases on a par with personal injury actions.  Others, such as the Law Reform Commission, incline to the view that there is value in having a group of lay people, rather than a judge, decide whether the words at issue are capable of bearing a defamatory meaning, but that the essential function of assessing damages should be transferred to a judge.  Logically, if this view were adhered to, it could involve the restoration of juries in defamation cases in the Circuit Court also.  This question will have to be carefully considered.</P>
    <P>Reflecting the Law Reform Commission report, the Bill proposes a number of alternative remedies &mdash; applications for declaratory judgments in lieu of damages, declaratory orders and correction orders.  Statutory clarification as to when it is appropriate to grant an interlocutory injunction restraining publication of allegedly defamatory matter is also proposed.  I believe that these proposals merit examination.  I would <Col N="284" /> certainly be disposed to exploring the options for such alternative remedies.</P>
    <P>Tangential to the issue of damages is a matter which is contained in section 12 of the Bill, which deals with the anomaly which arises in defamation law whereby a defendant in a defamation action may make a payment into court only if liability is admitted in the defence.  In other tort actions, such as personal injury actions, for example, a defendant may make a payment into court irrespective of whether or not liability is admitted or denied although it must be stated whether liability is admitted or denied.  I accept that this exception to the usual rule regarding lodgments in court merits examination.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that this exception has existed down the ages in respect of libel and slander laws.  I do not know what its origin was or how this exception arose. Perhaps it may have come into the law of libel and slander for a very good reason.  The fact that it is there cannot have arisen by mere accident; there must have been some good reason for it.  It has existed for time immemorial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very conservative view of the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the matter I would be interested to ascertain its genesis.  We should at least know that before we wave it away.  As far as I know, it is the only exception to the normal rule that a lodgment in court may be made either with or without an admission of liability.  The fact that it is there makes one wonder about it.  When we discuss this matter further in detail we should perhaps try to ascertain the reasons for it.  It seems rather illogical to me but we should check its origins a little more carefully in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the defences which arise in a defamation action, the principal ones at the moment would be privilege, justification and fair comment.  It is now appropriate that the occasions on which absolute and qualified privilege apply should be re-examined.  It is also clear that the defence of fair comment has <Col N="285" /> become unnecessarily complex.  Its rationale is to protect freedom of expression on matters of public interest, but it is no longer clear that it is succeeding in this aim.  The Law Reform Commission proposal for a rejuvenated defence of comment based on fact, reflected in section 22 of the Defamation Bill, may offer the basis of a solution to difficulties which have emerged in this area and, in this regard, it would obviously be useful to distinguish between fact and comment as is done in section 23 of the Bill.  However, it will be very difficult to achieve the right balance here and the matter obviously requires very detailed scrutiny.  For now I reserve my position on it.</P>
    <P>Section 24 of the Bill provides that the defence of justification be renamed the defence of truth so that it would be a defence in a claim in defamation for a defendant to allege and prove that the defamatory matter published concerning the plaintiff was in substance true or was not in substance materially different from the truth.  In principle, I would be sympathetically disposed to introducing such a change.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides for other matters which it would be necessary to include in any Bill which purports to deal comprehensively with defamation. These include addressing the position of corporate bodies, providing a clear statement of the law as it affects printers and distributors and providing for a single limitation period for defamation actions.</P>
    <P>I note that there is one matter on which the Defamation Bill differs from the Law Reform Commission report &mdash; Deputy McDowell referred to it &mdash; and that is the area of defamation of the dead.  The Law Reform Commission has recommended that a new cause of action be introduced in respect of defamatory statements made about persons dead at the time of publication. This would be subject to restrictions as to who could bring such an action and to the period of time within which it could be brought.  The remedies available would be confined to declaratory <Col N="286" /> orders and injunctions.  The explanatory memorandum to the Bill indicates that such a provision possibly could inhibit the recording and discussion of recent history.  I would welcome the views of Deputies on this matter before making up my mind on it.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that in defamation matters jurisdiction be exercised only by the High Court and the Circuit Court.  I have always been a strong advocate of increasing the jurisdiction of the District Court.  When we come to later stages of the Bill I will consider the question of the jurisdiction of the District Court.  It might be appropriate to have such jurisdiction in certain cases, but that is a matter we will consider later and I would be interested to hear Deputies' views.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell referred to comments made over the weekend by Mr. Justice Hugh O'Flaherty.  I will not comment to a great extent on what he said except to say that I disagree with the comments he made on the position of politicians and the taking of libel actions.  He seemed to suggest that the good name of a politician should be regarded on a different basis from the good name of any other citizen.  If that was the purport of what he said &mdash; that is what he seemed to say &mdash; I take the strongest exception to it.</P>

      <P>The Bill is a genuine effort to change defamation law and is welcome to that extent.  It is fair to say that the laws on the Statue Book or the common law appears to be arcane.  Having said that, it is important to ask Deputies to think of the plight of an individual who has lost everything and is all alone in the world.  If that individual is fortunate enough to have his or her health then the only other thing which he or she possesses is his or her good name.  The good name of an individual should never be lightly taken away.  Under no circumstances should we have a liberal regime which would allow that to happen without the necessary safeguards being in place to allow for redress which, in the final analysis, is often the only punishment an individual can inflict on a multinational company.</P>
      <P>The right of an individual to his or her good name is one of the most fundamental and important rights protected by the 1937 Constitution.  That this right is protected is a clear indication that those who drafted the Constitution regarded the good name of an individual as of fundamental importance. Under Article 40.3.1º the State guarantees in its laws to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.Article 40.3.2º states:</P>
      <P>The State shall, in particular by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</P>
      <P>I do not think any Member of this House or any member of the general public would say this provision should be deleted from the Constitution.</P>

    <P>It is sometimes argued, perhaps correctly, that this constitutional provision is in conflict with Article 40.6.1º under which the State guarantees liberty to <Col N="288" /> exercise certain rights, including the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.  It is extremely interesting to look at some recent case law in connection with that provision. Interestingly, in the case of Norris versus the Attorney General, Supreme Court 1983, the Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Higgins, held that even if the right to freedom of expression existed it was not absolute.  In the case of Blake and Madigan versus the Attorney General, Mr. Justice Costello held that the newly formed right was qualified; it had to yield to common law and statute in the interests of the common good, public order and morality.</P>
    <P>It is sometimes forgotten that freedom of expression is not limited by Article 40.3 of the Constitution, the Defamation Act, 1961, and common law only.  It is also limited in other ways. Article 40.6 only guarantees the right of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions subject to public order and morality.  It is important to remind the House that the same Article goes on to state:</P>
    <P>The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema, [which no doubt was more prominent in 1937 than it is today] while preserving their rightful liberty of expression, including criticism of Government policy, shall not be used to undermine public order or morality or the authority of the State.</P>
    <P>The publication or utterance of blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>I mention these extremely important provisions in order to illustrate the seriousness with which the Constitution dealt with the protection of an individual's right to his or her good name on the one hand and the right to communicate or freedom of expression on the other.  To say the least of it, this is one <Col N="289" /> of the most difficult scales in the measurement of justice.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to update and improve the law on defamation.  The next question is whether it achieves that objective. It also seeks to seriously alter the balance which ought to exist between the rights of the media and those of the individual.  Obviously it relies heavily on the Law Reform Commission report on the civil law of defamation which was published in December 1991.  The Law Reform Commission was careful to point out that reasonable people would accept that in a democratic society the right of a citizen to his or her good name and the right to freedom of expression should be protected to the maximum degree.  In this sense, the Law Reform Commission was merely echoing the sentiments of the 1937 Constitution by stressing that both rights, and not one more than the other, needed to be protected.</P>
    <P>Having recognised that, it is interesting to note that the Law Reform Commission went on to point out &mdash; this more than anything else must indicate the enormity of the problem in balancing the scale between the rights of the individual on the one hand and the right of the media to express an opinion and communicate on the other &mdash; that in some areas one right must inevitably yield to the other.  When all is said and done and everything has been examined in detail, one has to accept that this is inevitable in the final analysis no matter how perfect the new law purports to be. The crucial question this House has to address tonight and in the coming months is how best can the correct balance be achieved.  This is a difficult but not intractable problem.</P>
    <P>Many of the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, and many of the provisions of this Bill, are without question both helpful and uncontroversial.The proposal to abolish the distinction between libel and slander is an interesting one.  In general I accept the argument that the distinction is historical and has made the law unnecessarily <Col N="290" /> more complex than it need be.  I therefore support the provision.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill which provides that plaintiffs would be required to prove that allegedly defamatory material is false is without doubt a more radical proposal.  The Law Reform Commission, as Deputy McDowell correctly pointed out, came down in favour of removing the presumption of falsity. The commission argues that a plaintiff in such cases can issue proceedings for defamation in respect of perfectly truthful statements in the knowledge that he does not have to face evidence and cross-examination.  It did not think that it is either just or in the public interest that defendants should be affected in settling such cases by the existence of an artificial presumption of law at variance with the facts.  It further suggests that the law of defamation should protect a citizen from defamatory statements which are untrue and not from those which are true, as the Minister pointed out.</P>
    <P>While the aforementioned arguments are very well made the lifting of the presumption of falsity could place a plaintiff in a difficult position.  For example, he would be obliged to prove that matter which is both false and defamatory is untruthful.  The argument could be made that this would be not only unhelpful to the plaintiff but also unfair. In summary, the question might be posed as to why a plaintiff should have to prove an untruth when he was not responsible for its publication in the first instance and when the defendant was so responsible.  This is a matter which requires further detailed scrutiny and discussion.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that publishers of defamatory material should not be liable to pay general damages where reasonable care was exercised.  Section 26 states:</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to the provisions of section 21 the court shall not make an award of general damages where <Col N="291" /> the defendant establishes to the satisfaction of the court that before publication of the matter complained of he or she exercised reasonable care in attempting to ascertain the truth of the allegation of fact.</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned about this provision.This section would prevent a court from making an award of general damages where the defendant establishes that reasonable care was taken in attempting to ascertain the truth of the particular allegation of fact.  My concern is based on the absence of any guideline as to what constitutes &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo;.  Does it involve publication based on one source only?  Does it require confirmation from a second or subsequent source?  Does it require that the disputed fact be put to the person whose reputation has been impugned by the article or broadcast?  For instance, could a court come to the conclusion that reasonable care had been taken where a journalist was to claim that the information had come from a usually reliable source in circumstances in which the journalist also claimed privilege in respect of the identity of the source?</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that section 43 of the Bill, with which I am in agreement, provides that &ldquo;no court may require a person to disclose, nor is any person guilty of contempt of court for refusing to disclose, the source of information contained in a publication for which that person is responsible, unless it be established to the satisfaction of the court that disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime&rdquo;.  A journalist would be able to say in court that they had been given the information by a reliable source, that they will not name the person or pay any general damages.  This would not be acceptable.</P>
    <P>As it stands, section 26 of the Bill would be open to serious abuse.  It would permit the unscrupulous to publish without being damned in the knowledge that the section has the potential <Col N="292" /> to embroil an unsuspecting plaintiff in an ongoing debate on journalistic ethics. If reasonable care is to be determined by the journalist on the Clapham omnibus, can we presume that the worst excesses of the British tabloid press are to attract no general damages on the grounds that other journalists and their editors might give evidence to the effect that in their experience the steps taken were reasonable?  In cases of alleged medical negligence, for example, evidence is given by doctors as to what are reasonable practices.  Negligence can be found only in circumstances in which no other practitioner of like experience and ability would have behaved in that fashion.  Is that the test that the proposers of this Bill would have us employ?  Is it right that a plaintiff should qualify for general damages only if no other journalist is prepared to say that the steps taken to ascertain the truth of the allegation of fact were reasonable? The section is an unwarranted attack on the right of any person to vindicate their good name and reputation.</P>
    <P>Truth is always a good defence to an action for damages for defamation.  This section asks us to exclude damages for falsehood on the basis of undefined &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo;.  In so far as it seeks to strike a balance between individual reputation and institutional freedom of expression it comes down on the side of the institutions.</P>
    <P>Other sections also cause concern. The same anti-individual bias can be found in section 28 which deals with punitive damages.  This section seeks to place barriers in the way of a plaintiff obtaining punitive damages in respect of a damaging falsehood.  It would place an almost immovable obstacle on the road to punitive damages by requiring that a plaintiff establish that the defendant knew of the falsity of the defamatory matter or that he was recklessly indifferent as to its falsity.</P>
    <P>Again, conspicuously, no guidance is given as to how this section should be interpreted.  There is no guidance as to whether &ldquo;reckless indifference&rdquo; is <Col N="293" /> intended to refer to subjective or objective recklessness.  A requirement of subjective recklessness would mean an effective abolition of punitive damages as it is notoriously difficult to prove in the absence of an admission by the defendant.  The wording of the section would require the plaintiff to establish reckless indifference as to falsity.  Recklessness requires that a defendant advert to the possibility of the falsity and then decide to run the risk &mdash; it does not cover situations where no thought is given to the possibility of the matter being false by its author.</P>
    <P>A similar anti-individual bias can be seen in the provisions of sections 6 and 8 which would force a plaintiff to choose between a summary and, therefore, a speedy declaratory action in lieu of damages or a full scale action for damages.It would unfairly force a plaintiff who feels, and in all probability is, entitled to damages to forego those damages or else face cross-examination as to why he did not choose to clear his reputation at an early stage.  This needs to be amended to provide for a summary procedure which would permit damages to be assessed at a later date. This would permit a person who had been defamed to clear his reputation at an early stage and seek damages, if appropriate, thereafter.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the publication of untrue matter does not injure a person's reputation but can cause considerable distress to an individual and his or her family.I am in favour of the courts having a power to review any published matter with a view to redressing wrong.  This need not occur solely on an application for damages.  Section 8, which provides for a declaratory order, should also apply in respect of the publication of untruthful and distressing material which does not or might not go as far as causing damage to a person's reputation.Serious consideration should be given to the creation of a new statutory tort which would permit courts to rectify the publication of untruths which have caused distress.</P>
    <P>The right of every person to protect <Col N="294" /> and vindicate their own good name and reputation is a fundamental one which must be protected.  Any legislation which seeks to regulate or limit the law relating to defamation must have, as its primary objective, the protection of the good name of every citizen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. I also wish to congratulate Minister of State Burton on her reappointment.</P>
      <P>The situation in Sierra Leone is deteriorating rapidly.  Widespread human rights abuses, particularly on the part of the army, have been reported.  This conflict has led to the deaths of thousands of civilians and the displacement of an estimated one million to five million people within the country, with approximately half a million people living in neighbouring countries, particularly Guinea.  In fact, more than 24,000 people have fled to the neighbouring state of Guinea.</P>
      <P>The humanitarian needs in Sierra Leone are great and medicines, food and shelter are in short supply.  I pay tribute to the agencies involved in Sierra Leone, particularly Trócaire, which has allocated funds to the diocese of Kenema where the Irish Bishop, John O'Riordan, oversees the emergency programmes.  I understand one of Trócaire's emergency officers is to travel to Sierra Leone in the near future to assess the situation there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also spoke recently to Sr. Geraldine Naughton, a native of County Galway, who has returned from Sierra Leone.  Sr. Geraldine was in the convoy which was ambushed when Fr. Felim McAllister was murdered.  She, in particular, has given me graphic accounts of what is happening there.  Sr. Geraldine, and indeed the Irish Missionary Union, have requested a meeting with the Minister <Col N="295" /> of State to discuss the situation in Sierra Leone to which I hope the Minister will respond favourably.</P>
    <P>I know the United Nations, the European Community and the Government here are doing all they can in difficult circumstances but has the Government taken any initiative recently?  What, for example, is the present position regarding the emergency evacuation of foreign &mdash; including Irish &mdash; citizens?  I understand there is transport to the airport for people wishing to leave the country which obviously will create difficulties if there is an emergency evacuation.  What is the present position on bringing about a ceasefire and an end to the human rights abuses?  Finally, what is the position on providing further emergency assistance to those affected by the conflict in Sierra Leone?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his opening remarks.  I had a lengthy meeting with the deputation from the Irish Missionary Union last Friday morning.</P>
      <P>Since 1991, a war of fluctuating intensity has been going on in Sierra Leone. It was initiated by rebels from neighbouring Liberia but has since expanded to include a number of other factions, disaffected elements of the Sierra Leone army and gangs of criminals.  In recent weeks the conflict has become more vicious and widespread than ever and has resulted in indiscriminate attacks on the civilian population, many of whom have had to flee their homes and tens of thousands of whom are now in Guinea. Seventeen expatriates, including seven religious sisters, were abducted several weeks ago and have not yet been released.  Fighting has come close to the capital, Freetown.  The latest information we have from the Consul-General there is that the situation is relatively calm but that tension remains high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time the war escalated about a month ago, there were about 70 Irish <Col N="296" /> citizens in Sierra Leone.  As the situation deteriorated we, like our EU partners, advised our citizens that if they did not have to stay in the country they should leave, at least until security improved.  More than half of them have now done so.  All Irish religious sisters &mdash; Daughters of Charity, Holy Rosary and Cluny Sisters, of which there were about 40 &mdash; have left for neighbouring countries or come home or Ireland.</P>
    <P>The number of our citizens in the country now is about 30, including ten Holy Ghost missionaries and two Christian Brothers.  Four of the missionaries are in Freetown, three are in Bo, about 140 miles from the capital, and three others are in Kenema, about a further 40 miles beyond Bo.  The Christian Brothers are in Makeni, about 90 miles from Freetown.  These 12 missionaries are aware of the risks they are running by remaining on in present circumstances but they want to stay as long as possible, in solidarity with the local people.</P>
    <P>The 20 or so other Irish citizens are in the relatively more secure Freetown area.  They include five employees of ESB International, the Honorary Consul-General and his family and a number of spouses of Sierra Leoneans and dual citizens.</P>
    <P>In addition to advising citizens in Sierra Leone to leave, we are advising people thinking of going to Sierra Leone to refrain from doing so for the time being.</P>
    <P>I am deeply concerned about the situation.Accordingly, I had the meeting to which I referred with the Irish Missionary Union and recently returned missionaries last Friday morning.  We had a lengthy discussion during which they gave me factual and full details of what has happened in the country and of the breakdown of law and order. They also mentioned the situation with regard to displaced persons and refugees.We are now considering providing emergency assistance to people who have been displaced or who are refugees.We did that last year and we are <Col N="297" /> looking at it again as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>At EU level we strongly supported a German initiative and a joint statement has been issued that includes an endorsement of the recent initiative of the UN Secretary-General, who has appointed a Special Envoy, Mr. Dirka, to work with the parties towards a negotiated settlement of the conflict.  That statement was issued today by the French Presidency on behalf of all the EU countries.  In it the EU partners express their deep concern at the ongoing crisis in Sierra Leone and at the increase in violent attacks on settlements and the country's economic assets.  They deplore the consequent suffering and widespread displacement inflicted on the civilian population, condemn the abduction of 17 foreign citizens, wholly innocent victims of the conflict, and call for their release.  The EU urges all those concerned to take advantage of the initiatives, in particular those of the UN Secretary-General and the Commonwealth Secretary-General, together with the countries of the region aimed at bringing about a peaceful solution to the conflict.</P>
    <P>The Honorary Consul-General in Freetown is closely monitoring the situation and consulting the missions of EU partners.  The British authorities have confirmed to us their readiness, if necessary, to help in the emergency evacuation of Irish citizens in the same way as their own if security requires it. I thank our British colleagues for their co-operation in this matter.</P>
    <P>The Government remains concerned about the disturbed situation in Sierra Leone and the welfare of our people who are still there.  We are all concerned that it will deteriorate dramatically into a crisis on a substantial scale.  I do not wish to refer to Rwanda but potential disaster in Sierra Leone has been forewarned and the EU must take steps to prevent it.</P>
    <P>I particularly want to commiserate with the Sisters of Cluny who have been 140 years in the country.  For the first time they now have no presence there. <Col N="298" /> On meeting the delegation, some of whom were quite advanced in years, I was very impressed by their commitment to the country and by the degree of personal pain they were suffering at seeing, in many cases, 40 years work torn up in a war that is inexplicable to most people who would like to be friends of Sierra Leone and who have good will towards that part of Africa.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me this opportunity to raise on the Adjournment a matter that I have been following for the last couple of years.</P>
      <P>Primary schools should be exempt from paying television licences where television sets are purchased by the school authorities to show educational videos and to allow school children an opportunity to view educational programmes.Many school management boards are furious because not alone have they to provide the television set from their own financial resources but they also have to pay £70 each year. Many boards of management are extremely reluctant to do so.</P>
      <P>Many financial demands are made on parents of primary school children, even taking account of the vast improvement in the capitation grant in the last year or two.  Some parents find it almost impossible to pay their contributions for necessary facilities such as playing areas, shelters, books, outings etc.  In many instances the straw that breaks the camel's back is the payment of the television licence fee.  Parents and teachers are now shouting stop.</P>
      <P>An irony is that many Government Departments, including the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Environment, Social Welfare, and the Department of Education itself frequently send educational videos to schools.  It does not make sense that small schools should be fined £70 to show such videos.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="299" /> I understand that some schools in disadvantaged areas are already exempt from such payments.  I ask the Minister to extend this exemption to every primary school in the State &mdash; that is not to say that every primary school has such an apparatus.  However, it is only reasonable and fair, that in the case of schools that have taken the initiative to buy a television, the boards of management should not be responsible for paying the television licence fee.  If ever I saw a case for exemption, it is this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan) Bernard Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Durkan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to respond to the concerns expressed by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Deputy is already aware that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has responsibility for the legislation which governs the payment of television licences.</P>
      <P>Consequently, the question of a legislative revision in order to fully or partially exempt primary schools from payment of the television licence has been raised by the Department of Education with the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I am informed that the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has not delivered a conclusive view in relation to the issues raised.</P>
      <P>I note that the Deputy has mentioned the use of television sets solely and exclusively for showing educational videos.  I am unable to envisage how a system could operate in practice whereby a school might be exempted from the requirement to pay a licence fee on foot of some condition or undertaking that the set would not be used to receive broadcasts.</P>
      <P>I should clarify, therefore, that the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has been approached on the basis of a simple derogation for schools, irrespective of the intended usage of the television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending clarification of the position <Col N="300" /> in relation to legislation it has been decided to continue the scheme whereby primary schools designated as disadvantaged have the cost of a television licence refunded to them by the Department.  The provision for this scheme is made from the special disadvantaged fund operated by the Department and is confined to schools in that category.  In all other cases the capitation grant, paid by the Department and augmented by local contributions, is intended to cover day to day running costs of the schools, such as television and other licensing charges.</P>
    <P>The policy thrust of the Department of Education is to ensure adequate funding for the day to day needs of all primary schools through the general capitation grant.  To that end considerable improvements to the grant levels have been made in recent years.  The basic grants to primary schools have been increased by a cumulative 35 per cent over the last two years and in 1994 significant improvements were made in the grant rates that apply to primary schools catering for children with special needs.  Provision has been made for further improvements in the capitation grants, details of which will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Deputy will convey his views in the correct quarter with a view to achieving some success in that area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  I would like to share the brief time with Deputy Micheál Martin who wishes also to express his concern about this matter.</P>
      <P>The question of early retirement for teachers has been perennial for as long as I can remember.  As far back as the early 1980s when I was teaching it was a highly emotive issue.  In the last two days we have seen the most extraordinary development.  Last Friday the representative of the INTO walked out of negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="301" /> The case made by teachers' unions for a more generous approach by the Minister for Education, which recognises the stressful nature of teachers' work, must be considered.  We would all agree that we need teachers to be, and teachers themselves want to be, professionals delivering a quality service in the public interest.  The Minister should know from personal experience &mdash; if she was here I could remind her &mdash; how much energy and commitment is required of teachers. That commitment is shown by the fact that many teachers choose to continue to teach until they are 65 despite the fact that it does not increase their pensions.Primary teachers are entitled to retire at 55 if they have completed 35 years service.  However, if they do this their pension is reduced.</P>
    <P>Nobody is suggesting that inefficient teachers should be rewarded by enhanced pensions.  Nor do I believe that anybody wants all teachers to leave the service at the age of 50.  The teachers unions are opposed to reducing the retirement age from 65 to 50.  It would be unbalanced to have a teaching service which did not include a wide range of age groups from the young to the elderly.If early retirement were made available to teachers at age 50 there would be no mass exodus from the profession.Few primary teachers retire at 55, although that option is open to all of them.  In the last ten years the average number of teachers retiring between the age of 55 and 60 was 46 per annum, hardly a mass exodus.</P>
    <P>At the teacher conferences last Easter the Minister promised that she would come back to the unions with realistic proposals.  Unfortunately, what she came back with was more of the same. We are now faced with the prospect of industrial action because of the Minister's intransigence.  By her actions the Minister has alienated the unions and at the same time created great uncertainty for those who are most unprotected, our students.  I am asking the Minister to be more realistic and generous in her attitude.</P>
    <Col N="302" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Keogh for sharing her time with me.  I too want to express my concern at the fact that we are facing industrial action in our schools with consequential chaos and disruption for many students.  It is totally unacceptable that the Minister for Education could not have found it possible to come to the House during the Adjournment debate to respond to the spokespersons for the Opposition parties &mdash; the Progressive Democrats Party and the Fianna Fáil Party.  In many ways it shows blatant disregard for this institution and its Members.  I want to put this matter before the Minister for Education, the person with statutory responsibility for it, and hear her respond to it in person.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Minister puts all the cards on the table.  As Deputy Keogh has said, commitments were given at various teacher conferences over two years ago and at last year's conferences a solid specific commitment was given that negotiations would be concluded by 30 September last.  As we know, no genuine offer has been put on the table and none was put on the table until last week.  The unions are concerned that what we are witnessing is a breach of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> which, in my view, is a very serious charge and has serious consequences for the social partnership that was so painstakingly arrived at.</P>
      <P>It is time to put the cards on the table and to deal honesty and openly with the union representatives.  The Minister should stop making promises that cannot be delivered on; it would be interesting to know if the promises were made without prior Cabinet approval.  It is important that the issue be resolved and that the dignity and respect which is due to the unions and to the teaching profession be reflected in the approach adopted by both the Minister and the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Considerable research has been undertaken on the provision of an optional early retirement scheme.  This is particularly disadvantageous and discriminating against second and third <Col N="303" /> level teachers.  I note that in the offer made last week, none was made to third level teachers or to members of the TUI.  That needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>I would appreciate the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, giving us the views of the Minister for Education, but I reiterate my concern that the Minister did not see fit to come into the House to debate this issue on the Adjournment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister apologies for her absence.  Unfortunately, a prior engagement took precedence but I will do my best to reply on her behalf.</P>
      <P>I thank the Members for bringing these matters to the attention of the House and for affording me the opportunity to reply on behalf of the Minister.</P>
      <P>The three teachers unions submitted a joint claim to the Teachers' Conciliation Council requesting that teachers be entitled to retire from teaching service on a pension from 50 years of age on the basis of accrued pension with ten added years.  This claim was lodged in December 1992, before the present Minister for Education took office, and replaced earlier claims from the teacher unions for early retirement.</P>
      <P>In April 1993 the Minister indicated that she was prepared to have discussions with all interested parties which would examine proposals on early retirement for teachers.  The teachers unions' claim for early retirement is appropriate for discussion by the Teachers' Conciliation Council.  It must, therefore, be considered in accordance with the provisions of the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for teachers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a statement authorised by the conciliation council in March 1994 the official side acknowledged that there is a case for early retirement arrangements for teachers in an integrated programme aimed at improving aspects of the teaching service.  As part of this process it agreed, in principle, to negotiate changes in the teachers' superannuation schemes which would allow for early retirement provisions (a) in the case of <Col N="304" /> those teachers who no longer find themselves able to function at an acceptable level of professional performance and (b) in situations where there are teachers who are surplus to requirements but who cannot readily be transferred elsewhere.  It was also agreed that all outstanding aspects of the teachers unions' claim for early retirement would be examined by a working group of the Teachers' Conciliation Council.  All parties to the council agreed that discussion in the working group would be substantive and would be concluded by 30 September 1994.</P>
    <P>The terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme for teachers stipulate:</P>
    <P>That matters within the scope of the scheme will be dealt with exclusively through the machinery of the scheme, and that the proceedings of the Council are confidential and no statements concerning them may be issued except with the authority of the Council.</P>
    <P>A meeting of the conciliation council for teachers was held last Friday, 10 February 1995.  A number of issues were on the agenda for the meeting including the joint claim from the three teacher unions for early retirement.  No statement was agreed about matters discussed at the meeting.  However, in view of public comments made on the matter, the Minister considers that a statement should be made on behalf of the official side.</P>
    <P>In line with the conciliation council agreed statement of March 1994 the official side's approach to dealing with the early retirement claim has been three-pronged in addressing major issues of concern.  These are:</P>
    <P>Teachers who because of stress and other difficulties find themselves unable to function at acceptable levels of professional performance; teachers who are surplus to requirements because of school closure, amalgamations and enrolment decline and cannot be redeployed; general <Col N="305" /> early retirement provisions for teachers.</P>
    <P>Proposals on procedure for early retirement for teachers experiencing professional difficulties were presented by the official side early last summer. This issue was tackled first by the official side because it addressed the problems caused by teacher stress. Increasing stress levels in teaching was the main argument advanced by the unions in support of early retirement. Indeed it was this factor in particular which led the Minister to indicate in April 1993 that she was favourably disposed to negotiations on this issue.</P>
    <P>Progress on early retirement arrangements for teachers experiencing professional difficulties and for surplus teachers was delayed because the teacher unions would not discuss these issues further until the official side responded to the third item &mdash; the demand for a general early retirement provision.  Due to the significance of the questions involved for public service pension provisions and costs, Government approval was necessary.  The Minister had proposals ready for Government, following careful consultation between Departments, but other political events intervened.  Government approval for an official side offer was not obtained until last week.  The official side has now responded to this item on the basis of equalising early retirement provision for post-primary and primary teachers.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the teachers' early retirement claim must take place under the terms of clause 2 (iii) of Annex 1 to the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> pay agreement.  Under option A of this clause outstanding cost increasing claims must be negotiated as a package.</P>
    <P>As provided for under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> the teachers claimed and were paid their full entitlement to date of a 1 per cent increase in pay from 1 April 1994 as a down payment on a settlement of their outstanding claims.  Having taken the 1 <Col N="306" /> per cent increase, no payment arising from a settlement on early retirement could be made until this year.</P>
    <P>Last Friday's offer on early retirement was made in the context of a positive commitment by the official side to deal with a number of outstanding claims in addition to the early retirement issue.  It was not possible to discuss these claims because of the reaction of the unions at the meeting.</P>
    <P>The Minister considers that she is meeting the commitments she made on early retirement for teachers.  However, if progress is to be made, the parties involved will have to be prepared to engage in further discussions, which the Minister would be very anxious to encourage.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I know that the House will understand that it would be inappropriate for the Minister to comment further on the matter.</P>

      <P>It is appropriate that I congratulate RTE, and in particular its &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; crew, on last Thursday night's programme dealing with the drug problem in Dublin.  It put what is a growing problem in this city, and in the country, into sharp focus.  It is now clearly of the utmost importance that immediate action is taken on this extremely serious problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a first step may I be as helpful as I can to the Minister and suggest an immediate amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977?  While possession is an offence under the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, the actual use of a controlled drug other than prepared opium does not appear to be an offence.  This problem must be tackled on two fronts, first, from the point of view of the Garda and, <Col N="307" /> second, on a medical front.  It should be made an offence to use a controlled drug and powers should be given to the Garda and health boards to detain addicts for limited periods.  It is necessary that such legislation be introduced without delay.  Not only are addicts damaging themselves but it would appear from the comments of some judges they are responsible for up to 80 per cent of the indictable crime committed in this city.</P>
    <P>A national drugs enforcement agency, a high level of enforcement policy and greater co-ordination between the Navy, Army, Garda and Air Corps are required.  I ask the Minister to implement the report on such co-ordination which I understand is in her Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Donoghue for sharing his time with me.  While not being critical of the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, I would have preferred the Minister for Justice or the Minister for Health to be present.</P>
      <P>This country is awash with illicit drugs not just in the city centres or disadvantaged areas highlighted on the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme, but in every town, village and rural area.  Drug users are to be found everywhere.  It is a national crisis requiring a national co-ordinated response.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Government's strategy committee, based in the Department of Health, which draws together representatives from Customs and Excise and the Departments of Health and Justice has met infrequently over the last number of years, particularly since I left the Department of Health as junior Minister.  If that is the Government's and the committee's response, our basis for tackling the problem is weak.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the crime in our country is drug related and arises out of the need for drug abusers to feed their habit. Godfathers recruit drug pushers in areas where the problem did not surface until recently; they wait outside schools and <Col N="308" /> recruit young abusers and pushers. When we are up against that sort of crime we need a national response which will target resources in different areas.  The Government must seek to reduce the supply of drugs and it can only do so by amending the appropriate legislation.  Customs and Excise officials must be given increased powers to detain those suspected of bringing drugs into the country, particularly those suspected of concealing them in their bodies, which happens all too frequently until the drugs are eliminated from their bodies.</P>
    <P>We must try to reduce the demand for drugs through education.  Local community drugs teams could be established in every area to educate young people about the dangers of drug abuse and taking soft drugs.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the developments in Pakistan where it is reported that Irish people are involved in the movement of huge consignments of drugs. Our representative in Beijing and our Consulate representative in Pakistan are going to the town where they are detained.  If the three individuals who are alleged to have been moving huge quantities of drugs had succeeded in getting a portion of that consignment into this country, many more young people would have become addicts.  We should not treat our citizens who are caught moving drugs in far flung cities as cult heroes.  They must be dealt with and we must take a stand on the issue as far as the law is concerned.  Drugs godfathers and pushers must be dealt with firmly and expeditiously.  We must have a national co-ordinated response; otherwise many young lives will be destroyed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for raising this matter which enables me to reply on behalf of the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The drugs problem is a complex one and requires a serious response.  The &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme provided a valuable service in reminding society at <Col N="309" /> large of the scale and extent of the problem.More than anything else, the programme showed that we need to respond on a number of fronts.  In this regard, it would be useful if I were to set out, in some detail, the Government's approach to this most serious of social problems.</P>
    <P>In 1991, the Government strategy to prevent drug abuse was published.  The strategy, recognising that the problem is a complex and difficult one, proposes a multi-disciplinary approach requiring action in the areas of supply reduction, demand reduction and increased access to treatment and rehabilitation programmes.The strategy has been accepted by successive Governments as providing the best possible framework to deal with the problem.  Much has been achieved.  Special funding has been provided for prevention and treatment services.  Satellite clinics have been established.  General practitioners are being encouraged to take on responsibility for treatment of abusers.  Detoxification facilities are being expanded. Emphasis has been put on demand reduction through education and prevention initiatives.</P>
    <P>The need for this co-ordinated effort is especially apparent to those charged with law enforcement.  The connection between drug dealing, drug addiction and crime is well known.  Addicts need money and crime is one way of obtaining it.  We must face up to the problem of hard drugs abuse which is essentially confined to Dublin, if we are to gain the upperhand.</P>
    <P>International experience has shown there are no easy answers.  Once the problem has developed it is notoriously difficult to reverse.  However, the Minister is not interested in listening to those who shrug their shoulders and say we will just have to get used to the problem. I can tell the House that she does not accept this counsel of despair.  We have no illusions about the scale of the problem which only makes us more determined to deal with it.</P>
    <P>The problem is not insurmountable; let us make that quite clear.  It can be <Col N="310" /> beaten.  We have to take control but to do so will require a co-ordinated and integrated approach.  We have to deal with the demand for drugs, the conditions which generate that demand and the supply of drugs, in parallel.</P>
    <P>What then is the Garda response?  All Garda drugs units throughout the country are co-ordinated on a national basis through the National Drug Administration Office in Garda Headquarters. In Dublin, which as I have already said is the main area where heroin is a problem, drug units have been established in each of the city's five Garda divisions and their activities are co-ordinated through the Central Drug Squad based in Harcourt Square.  This approach has enabled the Central Drug Squad to monitor the activities of drug dealers all over the city and has significantly enhanced the Garda intelligence gathering capability.</P>
    <P>The Garda have targeted the heroin trade and made a number of very significant seizures.  This month alone, we have seen important seizures of heroin at Dún Laoghaire and Dublin Airport. These seizures are a measure of the resolve of the gardaí to deal with this menace in the most resolute manner possible.  There will be no let up in the fight against drugs.  The law will be enforced in a strict, sustained and relentless manner.</P>
    <P>I would like to briefly mention a number of other measures which are being taken to deal with this problem.  First, the Department of Justice has completed a report which identifies the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem by the existing law enforcement agencies.  The Minister intends to prepare proposals for Government based on this report as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Second, the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 provides for the seizure and confiscation of the proceeds of crime, including drug trafficking.  This, as has been explained to the House at length recently, is designed to hit the parasites in our society who finance and organise <Col N="311" /> the importation and distribution of drugs into Ireland.  Third, the European Drugs Unit, which became operational in 1994, will provide a vital mechanism for the exchange and co-ordination of drugs intelligence throughout the European Union.  All these measures taken together provide a co-ordinated intelligence-based enforcement strategy designed to put the so-called drugs barons out of business.</P>
    <P>In the time available to me tonight, I <Col N="312" /> have endeavoured to set out the Government's approach to this problem. I am convinced it is through this co-ordinated approach only that we can ever hope to control the drugs problem. Much has been done and much remains to be done.  However, I can assure the House that this Government will respond effectively.  The problem is too serious to do otherwise.</P>

      <P>The back to school clothing and footwear scheme, which is administered on behalf of my Department by the health boards is designed to assist recipients of social welfare and health board payments with the cost of children's school uniforms and footwear. People on low incomes who are in receipt of family income supplement may also qualify for assistance.</P>
      <P>For the 1995 scheme, I have increased the rates of allowance from £35 to £40, for a child attending primary school and from £50 to £55 for a post-primary pupil.  It is expected that some 285,000 pupils will benefit under the scheme this year at a cost of approximately £12.9 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scheme opens for applications in all health boards in June each year.  This <Col N="63" /> is to allow adequate time to process the 114,000 applications expected.</P>
    <P>My Department's annual circular to health boards on the operation of the 1994 scheme, requested boards to ensure that the majority of payments were made by 31 July 1994 to enable parents to make the necessary purchases in the traditional back to school shopping month of August.  The health boards have advised my Department that the scheme operated satisfactorily in all boards in 1994 with families throughout the country receiving their payments in good time to make provision for their children's needs.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the scheme is to assist with the clothing needs of school children in the forthcoming school year.  A balance needs to be struck between paying the allowance too early or too late. I believe the present arrangements are satisfactory and I have no plans to advise health boards to make earlier payments.  This year's scheme circular will issue to health boards in the coming weeks to ensure the health boards can make the necessary arrangements to make the majority of payments by the end of July 1995.  I would urge parents to assist the boards by making applications as early as possible once the scheme commences.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 183 together.</P>
      <P>A death grant under the Social Welfare Acts is payable, subject to the satisfaction of certain PRSI contribution conditions, on the death of an insured person, or of their spouse or child under 18.  The amount of the grant varies with the contribution record and, in the case of children, with the age of the child. Death grants are not payable to persons on non-contributory payments.</P>
      <P>In addition, where a person dies while in receipt of a social welfare payment, the payment usually continues to be paid to his or her adult dependant for six weeks.  Payment may also continue for six weeks after the death of an adult or child dependant.</P>
      <P>There is also a funeral grant, which is unconnected with the death grant, payable in certain cases under occupational injuries provisions.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that death grants should be part of social insurance but should be available as social assistance.  In this context I want to review how best to assist people on low incomes who suffer a bereavement.</P>

      <P>Income from weekly social welfare contributory payments is treated as taxable income by the Revenue Commissioners.  Different taxation arrangements are applied by the Revenue Commissioners for the taxation of short term benefits such as disability, injury and unemployment benefit, and long term benefits such as deserted wife's benefit, old age, retirement and survivors pensions.</P>
      <P>The taxation of unemployment benefit is administered by the Revenue Commissioners.This involves tax being collected through restricting tax refunds to unemployed persons; adjusting tax free allowances on resumption of employment; and reviewing the person's tax affairs at the end of the tax year.</P>
      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised my Department that it is not necessary for unemployed persons to obtain a certificate of payments from my Department.</P>
      <P>The taxation of disability and injury benefits is also operated by the Revenue Commissioners with the assistance of employers.  In the case of persons in employment, their employers are notified by my Department of the amount of weekly benefit payable.  This amount is taken into account by employers in calculating the employee's tax liability under the PAYE system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of people in receipt of long term disability benefit (i.e. more than 12 months) my Department notifies the Revenue Commissioners of the amount of benefit a person is expected to receive in the tax year.  The Revenue Commissioners restrict the person's tax <Col N="67" /> free allowance by this amount.  The issue of a certificate of social welfare payments to these people is not necessary.</P>
    <P>People in receipt of other long term payments such as pensions are obliged to declare the amount of the payment to the Revenue Commissioners for tax purposes.  However, persons whose sole income is derived from a social welfare pension or allowance are not liable to income tax as the annual amount of such income is less than the level of the appropraite tax exemption limits. Approximately 5 per cent of people who received these payments request statements each year &mdash; for use by the Revenue Commissioners, local authorities and the Department of Education. Given the level of demand for statements, these will continue to be issued to individuals on request.</P>

      <P>Following the growth of last year's summer students jobs scheme when over 2,200 sponsors offered in excess of 11,000 jobs and over 9,000 <Col N="68" /> students participated during their summer holidays, it is my intention to continue with the scheme again this year.</P>
      <P>This scheme, which has now been in operation for two years, has been of significant benefit to both the students who took part and their local communities.It provides third level students with a significant income and valuable work experience while contributing significant benefits to their local communities at the same time.  It also helps to foster a self-help ethic among local communities and provides them with a resource which is funded by my Department. Much of the community work undertaken could not have been done without the benefit of the scheme.</P>
      <P>Because of the importance of the scheme and in recognition of the contribution made by students to their local communities, I have obtained a significant additional allocation of £1 million in the budget for improvements in this year's scheme.  This will allow me to make significant improvement to the benefit of participating students.  I propose to invite submissions from the USI on improvements they wish to see.</P>
      <P>Very positive feedback has been received in my Department from sponsors throughout the country with many looking forward with enthusiasm to the continuance of the scheme again this year.  My Department will shortly be inviting sponsors to submit projects for inclusion in this year's scheme.  Last year a very wide range of activities were undertaken by the students who took part in the areas of health care, sporting activity, youth work and general community work such as tourism, summer camps, credit unions, art centres etc.  I am confident that this year an equally impressive range of activities will be offered by sponsors.</P>

      <P>Child dependant increases are payable with invalidity pension in respect of children in full-time education up to the age of 21.  In this year's budget, I have extended the age at which child additions paid with invalidity pension and other long term payments are made, for those up to age 22 in full-time education.</P>
      <P>Child dependant allowances paid with short term payments, including disability benefit, are payable up to the age of 18 years.  However, a person who has been in receipt of disability benefit for 12 months and who is likely to remain incapable of work for a further 12 months may qualify for invalidity pension and thereby receive increases for children up to the age of 22 years in full-time education.</P>

      <P>The Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems was established in July 1993 by the former Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare.  The terms of reference of the group are:</P>
      <P>To identify the problems arising from the interaction of the tax and social welfare systems and to identify the steps necessary to achieve greater co-ordination/integration of the two systems, with particular attention to the impact on people's incomes, and to the tax code, social welfare system, budgetary and administrative implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="70" /> In addition, the group will now be asked to examine the child benefit supplement, the introduction of which is part of the Government's programme for renewal.</P>
    <P>The group was asked to prepare an interim report on measures which could be undertaken in the 1994 budget to reduce poverty traps and increase incentives to work and they presented this report in late 1993.  In this interim report, the working group made two specific recommendations for the 1994 budget.  These were the easing of the means test for lone parents allowance in order to make it more attractive for lone parents to take up work, and abolition of the arrangement whereby employers of medical card holders had to pay the health contribution and employment and training levy on behalf of these employees.  Both these issues were addressed in that budget, and the necessary legislation was included in the 1994 Social Welfare Act.</P>
    <P>The group is now preparing its final report which it is envisaged will be completed and published this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Claim forms and medical certificates received in relation to sickness and certain other schemes are treated as highly confidential.  The information is protected by the Official Secrets Act and <Col N="71" /> no information is ever released to a third party without the written consent of the claimant.  All personal information, medical certificates and medical reports are held in secure filing areas.</P>
    <P>Under the disability and other sickness schemes medical referees of my Department provide advice, by way of a second opinion to that of the client's own doctor, which assists deciding officers and the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office in determining entitlement.</P>
    <P>When a medical referee examination is arranged, the client's doctor is notified and invited to be present or to furnish a report on the medical history and current condition of the client.  The form notifying the general practitioner is marked confidential and is returnable by special pre-addressed, free post envelope to the medical referee centre where the examination is scheduled to take place.  For the medical referee's easy reference the nurse attendant on duty associates each report with the appropriate file in advance of the examination.</P>
    <P>Following the medical referee's examination all papers are returned to the Department's medical adviser for his action in the first instance and are then passed to administrative staff.</P>
    <P>My Department has received no complaints from any medical practitioner in respect of breaches of confidentiality.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 180 together.</P>
      <P>The national fuel scheme assists householders who are on long term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  A payment of £5 per week is paid to eligible households for 26 weeks, from mid-October to mid-April.</P>
      <P>An additional smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week, was introduced in October 1990, to assist people living in the built up areas of Dublin to help meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas.  This allowance has been extended to cover the Cork city and adjacent areas to coincide with the ban on the sale of bituminous coal which came into effect there on 13 February 1995. Payments will commence from week ending 17 February 1995.</P>
      <P>At present, a contributory pensioner and members of his household, can have means of up to £5 a week in addition to the social welfare pension and qualify for the fuel allowance.  In this week's budget I have increased this £5 means limit to £10 with effect from the start of the 1995-96 fuel scheme in October 1995.</P>
      <P>Increases in the overall level of the fuel allowance and the smokeless fuel allowance would have significant financial implications.  For example, an increase of £1 in the level of fuel allowance would cost approximately £7.3 million in a full heating season.  The estimated cost of increasing the smokeless fuel allowance from £3 to £5 would be in the region of £5.5 million.</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance scheme is intended to safeguard elderly or incapacitated people living on limited means in circumstances where they would have nobody who could obtain help for them in an emergency.</P>
      <P>The main qualifying conditions are that the applicants must be in receipt of a welfare-type pension and they must satisfy the living alone condition of the scheme.  The living alone condition provides that the pensioner must be either living alone or only with certain excepted persons.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Excepted persons&rdquo; includes persons over 15 years of age who would be unable to obtain help for the pensioner in an emergency.  If an applicant is living with such a person, he or she are required to get the person's doctor to complete Part 6 of the standard application form in respect of his patient. Part 6 of the application form includes questions regarding the nature and severity of the incapacity, the extent the patient is affected and the opinion of the certifying doctor on the ability of the patient to get help for the pensioner, if required, without the use of a telephone in the house.  The questions are straightforward and there is no reason why a doctor should have any difficulty in answering them.</P>
      <P>The final decision on the medical aspects relevant to a claim rests with the Department's own medical adviser.  Part 6 of the application form includes a request to the certifying doctor that the certificate be as complete and accurate as possible in order that the Department's medical adviser can satisfy himself on the merits of the case.  The system is considered to have operated satisfactorily since it was introduced in 1978.  If any general practitioner has difficulties in the matter they should contact my Department where every assistance will be given.</P>

      <P>Under existing provisions certain social insurance benefits are taken into account in assessing damages in personal injuries actions.  Section 75 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 provides that disablement benefit or injury benefit payable in the five year period from the date of accrual of the cause of the action, be taken into account in assessing such damages.</P>
      <P>Section 237 of the 1993 Act contains a similar provision in respect of disability benefit and invalidity pension.  These arrangements are designed to ensure that people are not compensated twice for loss of earnings.</P>
      <P>People who are involved in accidents and who have no entitlement to social welfare benefits can claim supplementary welfare allowance while they are unfit for work and pursuing compensation claims.  There are no provisions in legislation which would allow supplementary welfare allowance paid in these circumstances to be taken into account in assessing compensation.</P>
      <P>In 1990, an inter-ministerial study group on the question of reducing the costs of motor insurance concluded that changing the present arrangements to enable social welfare payments to be recovered from awards would increase insurance costs which would be likely to be passed on to the public. In addition, it was considered that gains could be outweighed by the cost of recovery from individual clients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The &ldquo;Liability to Maintain Family&rdquo; provisions in the Social Welfare Acts are based on the widely-accepted obligation on people to maintain their spouses and their children. Under the legislation, where a marriage breakdown occurs and a family is dependent on a social welfare payment, the person who is liable to maintain that family must contribute to my Department towards the cost of the family's income support.</P>
      <P>A total of £259,803 has been collected in contributions from liable relatives in 1994 towards the cost of the payment of lone parents (separated spouses) allowance, deserted wife's allowance or deserted wife's benefit to their spouses. Liable relatives pay either by way of regular direct contributions to my Department or through family law court orders which are transferred to the Department.</P>
      <P>In addition to these contribution payments, the operation of the maintenance recovery provisions also yielded savings on scheme expenditure of a further £133,919 in 1994.  These related scheme savings arise as a result of the withdrawal of some claims which were actively in payment.  For example, some spouses make arrangements to provide adequate support to their families once the Department intervenes.  Some people are no longer entitled to the benefit or allowance as a result of new information obtained when the case is investigated.  Certain other cases of cohabitation or concealed additional means are also discovered in the course of maintenance recovery investigations.</P>
      <P>Altogether, therefore, an overall total of £393,722 was yielded directly and indirectly in 1994 through the liability to maintain family provisions.  There are 24,500 people in receipt of lone parent's allowance and deserted wife's benefit and allowance which cost £94.6 million in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of liable relatives contributing towards this cost will continue to grow significantly as the Department concludes its investigations on the many <Col N="77" /> other cases in hand.  Changes to the liability to maintain provisions in 1992 strengthened powers of collection and enforcement.  Legal proceedings are being considered in a number of cases where the liable relative has failed to comply with the legislation.</P>
    <P>The present system for tracing liable relatives is labour intensive and slow. The new Maintenance Act, 1994, when commenced, will increase the powers available to the Department to trace and seek payment from liable relatives now resident in other countries.  It is expected that these measures will increase substantially the number of liable relatives making a contribution towards social welfare support for their separated spouses and their children.</P>
    <P>There are a number of issues which have emerged during the course of the operation of the system.  These include the lack of an appeals mechanism in the legislation; the administration rules for assessment of ability to pay, and the correlation of these to court assessment rules in family law maintenance cases; the effect of the system on existing informal maintenance arrangements, part-time child custody, provision by liable relatives of &ldquo;maintenance-in-kind&rdquo; eg VHI, mortgage repayments etc. for their spouses; transfer of maintenance from women recipients, particularly when they have mortgage commitments and other regular outgoings; the identification and pursuit of putative fathers in unmarried cases; the need to interact more effectively with family mediation services, at initial desertion/separation stage, to ensure that maintenance issues are resolved then; and the tracing of deserting spouses who have disappeared without making any contribution at all to their families.</P>
    <P>All of these issues will be considered in the context of the proposed new unified lone parent's allowance.</P>

In the case of unemployment payments these conditions include requirements regarding availability for and genuinely seeking work.  This would normally mean that they would have to be free from restrictions, which sometimes can apply to non-nationals, on their residence in this country or on their freedom to take up work.</P>

      <P>The means test criteria are broadly similar for all social assistance schemes.  Nevertheless, there are variations in the manner in which some of the components are assessed.  These relate mainly to the treatment of capital and income from employment where different levels of disregards and rates of assessment are applied across the various schemes.  Variations also exist in the definitions of assessable income while claimants of unemployment assistance living in the family home are assessed with the value of board and lodgings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of a single means test for all social welfare schemes would give rise to significant costs, particularly if implemented on the basis that existing recipients would not suffer any <Col N="79" /> reduction in their payments.

      <P>Self employed persons became insured under the social <Col N="80" /> insurance system with effect from 6 April 1988, the commencement of the 1988-89 contribution year.  Contributions at the Class S rate are payable by this group and provide cover for old age (contributory) and widow's and orphans pensions.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions to qualify for a survivors' contributory pension, which is the payment of interest to the Deputy here, is that contributions must have been paid in respect of at least 156 contribution weeks (3 years) between the deceased person's date of entry into insurance and the date of his or her death.  Entitlement is based on either the applicant's own or their late spouse's social insurance record.</P>
      <P>This condition applies to all workers paying the rate appropriate for survivors' contributory pension, as well as the self-employed.  Any employee contributions reckonable for survivors' contributory pension purposes may be combined with self-employment contributions when determining entitlement to pension.</P>
      <P>It is considered reasonable that in order to qualify for a survivors' contributory pension a person would have paid 156 social insurance contributions.</P>
      <P>In the particular case mentioned by the Deputy, the person had been self employed and paid contributions for the years 1988-89 and 1989-90.  As he reached age 66 on 16 March 1991 the 156 paid contribution condition to qualify for survivors' contributory pension could not be satisfied.  Also there is no record of any contributions recorded in respect of his spouse.  His spouse can of course apply for a widow's non-contributory pension, which is payable subject to a means test.</P>

Consequently, each individual plaintiff in the proceedings, as well as the State, has the right to insist that the confidentiality clause is respected, and for that reason also, all of the details sought by the Deputy cannot be provided in the format sought.</P>
      <P>I can say, however, that there were 1,647 women involved in the FLAC cases.  Some 1,518 women have received payments under the settlement agreement, 33 had no entitlements under the 1979 Directive and the entitlements of the remainder are being clarified.  A further 1,170 women have received payments under other settlement agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In so far as payments to women generally are concerned, the perfected judgement of the High Court in what <Col N="82" /> amounted to two &ldquo;test cases&rdquo; arising from the delay in implementing the 1979 Equal Treatment Directive was given last Friday, 10 February.  The decision of the High Court is being examined in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General.  In keeping with the commitment in the programme for A Government of Renewal, I will be submitting proposals for consideration by the Government to deal with the implications of the court's decision.  In the meantime, the Government has provided £60 million as a first step this year. This provision was announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement.</P>

      <P>The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1993 enables county, county borough, urban district councils and Town Commissioners to make arrangments for the provision of meals for children attending national schools in their districts.  The Department of Social Welfare reimburses each local authority up to a maximum of 50 per cent of their expenditure on the provision of such meals.  Approximately 72,000 children are benefiting under the scheme.</P>
      <P>The expenditure on the school meals scheme in 1994 broken down by local authority is set out in the following tabular statement which I will make available to the Deputy.  This shows that a total of £720,129 was spent on the scheme in 1994.  The legislation does not provide for participation by county councils in the scheme.  The Department of Social Welfare does not have an initiating role and it is a matter for local authorities to do so.</P>

      <i>Note:</i> The legislation enables county borough councils, urban district councils and town commissioners to make arrangements under the urban school meals scheme.  County councils are not included; however, following the abolition of the borough of Dún Laoghaire which participated in the school meals scheme the arrangements were continued in respect of Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown County Council.  Section 39 of the Local Government (Dublin) Act, 1993 provides the legislative basis for the continuation.</P>

      <P>In 1994, the means test for the lone parent's allowance scheme was adjusted.  The previous earnings disregard of £6 for each child was replaced by a flat rate earnings disregard of £24. Where earnings exceed the new disregard, the amount of lone parent's allowance payable is now reduced by £1 <Col N="85" /> for each £2 earned.  The disregard of travelling and child-minding expenses have been continued.</P>
      <P>This change was introduced in recognition of the special circumstances faced by lone parents in terms of labour force participation.  As noted in the interim report of the Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems, lone parents are likely to be out of the labour market for relatively long periods and may face greater disincentives than other categories of social welfare recipients when considering taking up employment.  The working group, in recommending improvements along the lines which have been introduced, also argued that the rationale underpinning the different treatment of the lone parent's allowances is one which recognises the difficulties which are specifically related to the lone parents.It was in this context that the improved disregards for the lone parent's allowance was introduced.</P>
      <P>The issue of extending the new means test provisions to other social welfare categories will be kept under review.</P>

      <P>Last year special arrangements were introduced designed to ensure that homemakers do not suffer a loss of pension entitlement because of time spent full-time at home looking after a child, or caring full-time for an elderly or incapacitated person.  From 6 April 1994, time spent working in the home rearing young children up to six years of age or caring for incapacitated people will be disregarded for the purpose of calculating the yearly average condition in determining entitlement to contributory old age pension.  A <Col N="86" /> maximum of 20 years may be disregarded.</P>
      <P>I announced in my recent speech on the budget my intention to increase the age of children being cared for under this scheme from six to 12 years.  This improvement will be effective from the contribution year 1995-96 onwards.  Of specific value to all families is the budget increase of £7 in the monthly child benefit payment for each child from September.  This is the first step&mdash; the provision of a base line income support for children.  The Government are committed to providing a basic income for children through the creation of a child benefit supplement, which will be payable to all families whose income is below a certain level.  Having established a good basic child benefit payment this year, we are now preparing for the introduction of the supplement in future budgets.  There are no plans to introduce a specific scheme along the lines indicated by the Deputy.  Such a scheme would have major cost implications.</P>

      <P>The Government is gravely concerned at the human rights situation in Burma since the take over of power by the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) in 1988.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of this year, the human rights record of the regime has further deteriorated.  The SLORC leaders have now indicated that Ms Aung San Suu Kyi, whose party won the last elections in 1990, and who has been under house arrest since 1989, may not be released for several more years.  The Burmese Army has also carried out a large-scale attack on the Karen minority and thousands of refugees have been forced to flee into Thailand.</P>
      <P>The serious situation of human rights violations in Burma will be considered during the 51st session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, which is currently taking place in Geneva.</P>
      <P>Ireland, together with its partners in the European Union, is preparing the text of a draft resolution for submission to the Human Rights Commission.  The resolution, which Ireland will co-sponsor, can be expected to deplore the treatment of elected political representatives and to make clear the reforms which the Burmese Government must undertake.</P>

      <P>The Government is deeply concerned at the effects of the excessive accumulation of conventional arms, including landmines, in many regions of the world.  This threatens international peace and security, frustrates the economic development of poor countries and often contributes to the repression of fundamental human rights.  In accordance with the commitment in the Programme for a Government of Renewal, the Government is seeking to focus attention at international level on the need to address this problem.  Because of its complexity, it calls for parallel action on a number of fronts.</P>
      <P>At the United Nations, Ireland has proposed the elaboration of a Code of Conduct for Conventional Arms Transfers which would encourage states voluntarily to exercise responsibility and restraint in their exports and imports of conventional arms and set out common principles to be observed in this area. At the UN General Assembly, I have advocated this approach as one which would represent an important step forward in the area of arms control and which would give expression to the shared responsibility of the international community for international security in the framework of the United Nations.  We will continue to work to this end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The particular problem of landmines, with their horrific and indiscriminate effects, is a source of special concern and is now being addressed at the United Nations.  Ireland has never manufactured or traded in landmines and refrains, as a matter of policy, from any involvement with this trade.  Ireland is an original signatory of the &ldquo;Inhumane Weapons Convention&rdquo; which prohibits the indiscriminate use of mines, particularly in areas where there is a high concentration of civilians.  The Government is currently taking steps to ratify the Convention.  Ireland is participating actively in preparatory work for the Inhumane Weapons Convention Review Conference in September 1995. <Col N="91" /> We are pressing for a strengthening of the provisions of the Convention, with particular reference to those which concern landmines.  Ireland is also associated with measures highlighting the great importance of mine clearance activities and of moratoria on mine exports; and we co-sponsored the UN Resolutions on these issues at the last UN General Assembly session.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will also be interested in action taken by Ireland at the national level in the area of mine clearance.  The Government made available under the bilateral aid programme in 1994 a sum of £300,000 to Concern for demining actions in Cambodia, which were implemented by the Halo Trust.  It also provided the sum of £73,000 to Halo Trust for a demining programme in Mozambique and a sum of £52,000 to the Holy Ghost Missionaries in Angola for the relief of mine victims in that country.  The Government stand ready to provide substantial funding for demining programmes in various countries in 1995 also.</P>
    <P>The Government is pursuing their objectives with regard to restraint in arms transfers in other fora also, notably in the framework of the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy and also in the Security Forum of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).</P>

      <P>Ireland is at present owed £10,941,000 by the United Nations.  This compares with a figure of £13.5 million around this time last year.  Substantial arrears payments by the US to the UN last year resulted in Ireland receiving significant back payments.  The bulk of <Col N="92" /> the amount owed to Ireland (£9,842,000) arises from our participation in UNIFIL, and smaller amounts are owed for the operations in Somalia and Cyprus, as well as for miscellaneous transport costs.</P>
      <P>Arrears owing to the State arising from Ireland's involvement in various United Nations peace-keeping operations have been a matter of concern for some years.</P>
      <P>When I met Secretary-General Boutros-Ghali during my visit to the 49th session of the UN General Assembly in September 1994, I stressed our concerns on this issue.</P>
      <P>While addressing the General Assembly last September I referred to the serious difficulties arising from under-funding peacekeeping operations, in part because of the failure of certain member states to pay their assessed contributions to the UN in full and on time.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I will continue to pursue this matter.  Our permanent mission to the UN in New York will also continue to press the issue with the relevant authorities.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that reliable statistics relating to the number of jobs created by the business expansion scheme are not available to enable the information requested by the Deputy to be provided.In late 1990, a general review of the scheme was conducted by my Department in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of the Marine, the Department of Tourism and Transport and the Department of Industry and Commerce. The review identified growth of <Col N="93" /> approximately, 4,240 jobs in 347 companies which has received almost £95 million investment under the scheme at a cost of some £49 million to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Since 1992 the Revenue Commissioners have been collecting figures with a view to assessing the growth in employment in firms assisted by the BES.

      <P>While there are no published estimates of the percentage of coins &ldquo;lost&rdquo; from circulation in this country every year, the Central Bank has carried out a number of internal surveys in recent years.

      <Col N="94" /> Certainly demand for 1p and 2p coins continues to run at very high levels.  I would, however, point out that changes in the coinage (new £1 and 20p denominations and new design of 5p and 10p coin) have disrupted traditional patterns of circulation.</P>

      <P>Draft guidelines for the EU structural fund Community initiative PEACE are expected from the Commission shortly. The European Parliament, Committee of the Regions and management committee on Community initiatives then have to be consulted.  Formal adoption of the initiative is expected around the end of April and the two administrations will then have four months to prepare an operational programme.</P>
      <P>It is expected that the programme will cover the following broad themes: urban and rural regeneration; employment; cross-Border development; social inclusion; and productive investment and industrial development.  The total EU funding available to the initiative will be in the region of 300 million ECU over three years.  Funding over a further two year period will be subject to a review of the situation by the Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In drawing up this operational programme full regard will be had to ensuring the optimum degree of complementarity and integration with the Community Support Framework operational programmes and relevant Community initiatives, in addition to the range of activities carried out under the International Fund for Ireland.  Furthermore, the Government has given a commitment that the existing programmes will be reviewed and, as appropriate, refocused in order to meet the new demands and opportunities presented by the peace process.  The details of this <Col N="99" /> are something to be looked at in the context of each programme having regard to what is to be proposed under the new initiative.</P>

      <P>The cost, before buoyancy, of the changes announced in the 1995 budget is estimated at £302 million in 1995 and at £612 million in 1996.  The net cost of the measures in 1995 is significantly lower at £220 million.  This reflects the benefit to the Exchequer of tax and PRSI buoyancy and of the live register improvement deriving from the budget package.  Such factors would similarly reduce the budgetary cost of the measures in 1996.</P>
      <P>The costings exclude any allocation to social welfare equality payments, for which the £60 million provided in the current year has been met from the Social Insurance Fund surplus and other savings.  As indicated in my Financial Statement last Wednesday, the recent judgment of the High Court on this matter requires careful consideration and it is not possible at this stage to identify what, if any, liability will fall to be borne by the Exchequer in respect of those costs next year.</P>

      <P>A working group comprised of officials of my Department and of the health boards is currently reviewing the operation of the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990.  I hope to have the report of this group in the near future.</P>
      <P>Article 8.1 of the subvention regulations obliges a health board to follow the procedures set out in the second schedule to the regulations when assessing the means of a person who has applied for a nursing home subvention. A standard application form is used by all health boards and copies of the subvention regulations, which describe how the assessment of means is carried out, are available at all health board offices.</P>
      <P>The average nursing home subvention per week paid in each health board area in December 1994 was as follows:</P>

    <P>The difference in the subvention rates reflects mainly the different levels of <Col N="107" /> dependency of people applying for subventions.It may also reflect the extent to which health boards accommodate the most heavily dependent patients in their own hospitals and homes. However, this is one of the issues being examined in depth by the working group to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>By the end of December 1994, 8,519 applications for a nursing home subvention had been received by the health boards.  Of this total, 4,406 applications for subventions had been approved.  Of the remainder, some have been withdrawn or are not being proceeded with. I have been informed by the health boards, that unless there is a delay due to the non-furnishing of information or lack of co-operation by the applicant or his or her family, nursing home subvention applications are processed within the eight weeks allowed under the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Disabled person's maintenance allowance (DPMA) is the primary income support scheme operated by my Department for people who, because of their disability, cannot work and are not in a position to maintain themselves in the community.  The rate of disabled persons maintenance allowance at £61 per week is equal to long term unemployment assistance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 69 of the Health Act, 1970, health boards, in assessing eligibility for disabled person's maintenance allowance, are obliged to have regard to the means of both the applicant and <Col N="108" /> his/her spouse.  I am aware of differences between the assessment of means for disabled persons maintenance allowance and for social assistance schemes under the Department of Social Welfare.Some of these are more favourable to disabled persons maintenance allowance applicants, most notably in the means assessment of people with a disability living at home where the value of board and lodgings is not taken into account.  In contrast, the value of board and lodgings is taken into account in assessing eligibility for unemployment assistance.  However, the spouse of a social welfare recipient on unemployment assistance is entitled to earn up to £60 per week, including travelling expenses, without affecting entitlement to this allowance.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme is being transferred from my Department to the Department of Social Welfare from July 1995.  I have no plans to change the regulations pending this transfer of responsibility.</P>

    <P>An additional £2 million is being made available this year for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disability services. I will shortly be inviting proposals from the health boards for priority developments including the improvement of speech and language therapy services. The Western Health Board has informed me that one of its priorities for service developments during 1995 is the creation of specialist posts in adult communication problems/physical handicap.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): Information supplied by the Medical Council indicates that on 1 April 1994 there were 9,824 fully registered medical practitioners on its General Register of Medical Practitioners. This works out at 2.8 doctors per 1,000 <Col N="110" /> inhabitants.  Statistics on the number of doctors in practice would indicate a ratio of approximately 1.9 doctors per 1,000 inhabitants.</P>
      <P>In the programme for Government, <i>A Government of Renewal</i> the Government has made it clear that health policy will develop within the framework outlined in the health strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future.  This strategy lays particular emphasis on the outcomes of health services as well as the staffing and other inputs that are required to deliver the services.  In this context the number of medical and other practitioners employed in the public health system is regarded as one of the many variables to be taken into account in framing future policy.</P>
      <P>It has been, and will continue to be the practice, that where desirable policy developments which can be funded require the appointment of additional medical and other staff, such appointments are approved by my Department. Beyond that, I do not believe that there would be any policy rationale for seeking to increase the ratio of doctors to population to the statistically measured rate in other EU member countries.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The number of patients currently on the waiting list for admission to the National Rehabilitation Hospital is 103.  The Deputy will be aware that the length of time a patient must wait before admission to hospital is based on a number of factors, the most important of which is clinical need. <Col N="111" /> Urgent cases are always given priority. The waiting time, therefore, will vary depending on the type of injury or illness and the general health status of the person concerned.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that patients on the waiting list for admission to the National Rehabilitation Hospital differ from those waiting for admission to acute general hospitals.  A large number of patients admitted to the National Rehabilitation Hospital are referred directly from general hospitals or other appropriate centres where they are already receiving in-patient treatment. It would not be unusual for patients to be placed on the waiting list for admission to the National Rehabilitation Hospital immediately upon admission to the referring hospital, in anticipation of transfer when their condition warranted such a move.  This practise can obviously have a distorting effect on the hospital's waiting list.</P>
      <P>In view of the fact that the National Rehabilitation Hospital has been treating increasing numbers of brain-injured patients, my Department recently approved plans to develop a new unit in the hospital to cater specifically for these individuals.  Building and refurbishment work on the new unit will be completed shortly and it is anticipated that the unit will be commissioned in the coming months.  In addition, a new Consultant in Rehabilitation Medicine took up clinical duties on 1 January 1995.  The new consultant has been given the task of developing the head injury rehabilitation service at the hospital.</P>
      <P>I am confident that the effect of these measures will serve to enhance further the level of services provided at the National Rehabilitation Hospital.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The admission of patients to hospital is a matter for the consultant concerned and the length of time a patient must wait is determined on the basis of clinical need.  Urgent cases are always given priority.  I understand that the person referred to by the Deputy has been given an admission date of 1 March 1995.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the failure to respond to representations made to the hospital in question about this case was an administrative oversight which the hospital greatly regrets.  In general, where a patient feels that his condition has deteriorated he should return to his general practitioner who would be in the best position to stress the urgency of his case directly to the consultant at the hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I have received representations on behalf of the Myasthenia Gravis Association concerning the inclusion of Myasthenia Gravis in the long term illness scheme and I have replied to these representations directly.</P>
      <P>The position is that the long term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain illnesses to free drugs and medicines which are prescribed in respect of the particular illnesses.  The original aim of the scheme was to ensure that persons with a long term disability or diseases which is treatable by drug therapy would not have to suffer expense in order to obtain their required drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>The needs of people with significant or ongoing medical expenses are now being met by a range of other schemes which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of ongoing expenditure on medical expenses (general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc.) due to a long term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may issue to a family member of a personal basis.  Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the Chief Executive Officer of the relevant Health Board to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="119" /> Persons who suffer from an ongoing medical condition can avail of the Drug Cost Subsidisation Scheme which caters for people who do not have a medical card or long term illness book and are certified as having a long term medical condition with a regular and ongoing requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32.  Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
    <P>Under the Drugs Refund Scheme which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the Health Board.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those with medical expenses arising from conditions such as Myasthenia Gravis. Accordingly, I have no plans to extend the number or range of illnesses currently covered by the Long Term Illness Scheme.</P>
    <P>With regard to the diagnosis of the condition, I understand that Myasthenia Gravis is a relatively uncommon disease which affects the neuro-muscular system.Where a patient exhibits symptoms or signs of a neuro-muscular condition, a general practioner would normally refer the patient to a medical consultant for confirmation of the condition and whether a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis can be confirmed.  I am satisfied that appropriate resources are available for the diagnosis and treatment of this condition.</P>

Adolescent procedures are not recorded separately.  I should point out that in addition to adult coronary artery by-pass graft procedures the Mater hospital and Cork University Hospital also perform other open heart procedures.</P>
    <P>In 1993, a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund was allocated to enable the necessary facilities to be put in place at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit, Mater Hospital to increase the annual throughout of open heart surgery at the hospital from 750 &mdash; 1,000 &mdash; an increase of 33 per cent.  In addition, in 1993 and 1994, capital funding of £2.8 million was provided to facilitate the doubling of cardiac surgery at Cork University Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.</P>
    <P>Over 1993 and 1994, in excess of £2 million revenue and £3.5 million in capital was allocated to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments.The building works which were associated with this development were completed in mid-1994 and include additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme. These new facilities at the hospital have now become operational and the additional cardiac surgery activity has commenced.</P>
    <P>Some additional resources will again be provided in 1995 to ensure that throughput in cardiac surgery in 1995 reaches the target of 1,000 open heart operations per year.</P>
    <P>The developments at the Mater <Col N="122" /> Hospital, together with the developments for cardiac surgery at Cork University Hospital which were opened in November, 1994 will have the effect of increasing the number of cardiac surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent from 950 to 1,400.</P>

      <P>I am providing £20,000 each to the North-Eastern Health Board and the North-Western Health Board in whose areas there are at present no rape crisis or counselling centres to assist with the establishment of centres/services in these areas.  This will implement one of the recommendations of the 1993 report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women that there should be a rape crisis centre in each health board area. Funding is also being made available towards the establishment of a new centre in Athlone.</P>
      <P>Additional funding is provided for the rape crisis/sexual abuse counselling centres in Limerick, Cork, Galway, Waterford, Kilkenny, Clonmel, Kerry, Mayo and in Dublin where the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre and three Eastern Health Board counselling centres operate.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> My Department has reviewed the implementation of the Charter of Rights for Hospital Patients and I am satisfied that, in general, health boards and hospitals have implemented its provisions.  This review has also indicated that there has not been any significant increase in the volume of complaints received following the launch of the charter.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> contained an undertaking by the then Government to review the effectiveness of the Charter of Rights for Hospital Patients so as to make any necessary improvements and to ensure that it provides a properly structured system of patient rights.  This work is ongoing and is now being viewed in the context of the health strategy's provisions in relation to service quality.  The strategy gives an undertaking to reorientate the health services so that they are more responsive to patients' needs.  I would like to say that this Government is committed to the whole area of service quality from clinical outcome to patient satisfaction.  This commitment is shown in a <i>Government of Renewal</i> programme which has endorsed the health strategy as a basis for Government policy in the health area.</P>
      <P>In terms of measuring patient satisfaction, the strategy requires authorities to carry out evaluations of patient satisfaction and to include their findings in the annual reports which they will be making to my Department.  In addition, health authorities will be encouraged to identify and develop quality initiatives geared towards improving aspects of quality service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another important method of increasing the consumer orientation of the services is to ensure that detailed and accurate information on entitlements is available when required.  In this regard, my Department has given a commitment in the strategy to ensure that patients and clients continue to have ready access to the fullest possible <Col N="127" /> information about their entitlements and how to avail of them.</P>
    <P>Finally, the strategy makes provision for a number of measures to give individuals an opportunity of having grievances redressed and to represent the views of service users as a group in the decision making process.  Among the measures proposed are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the establishment of advisory groups in each health authority area to provide an input to the authority from the users of the various services;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a requirement on all health authorities to put appropriate complaints procedures in place;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the introduction of a statutory function of the boards of the health authorities to act as a channel to the Minister of the views and concerns of their populations.</P>
    <P>I see the patients' charter for acute hospital services as a first step in making the health service more consumer responsive.  The question of introducing further charters is currently being examined by my Department in the overall context of the health strategy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am not aware of the specific report referred to by the Deputy.  However, the numbers of reported suicides and parasuicides, that is attempted suicides, have increased over the past 20 years.  The number of reported deaths for 1993 was 357, of which 291 were men.  From figures released by the Central Statistics Office for the first half of 1994, it would appear that there may have been a decline in the numbers of suicides, but no definite <Col N="128" /> conclusions can be drawn until annual figures are available.</P>
      <P>The factors giving rise to suicide in society have been the subject of debate for many years.  Changes in the fabric of society, depresion and social isolation are all factors which can contribute to individual distress.</P>
      <P>Investigation and detailed research into the causes of suicides has not been easy at national or international level. In the past there has been an understandable reluctance to collect accurate data on the frequency and pattern of suicide.  It is clear, however, that reliable information on the occurrence of suicidal behaviour is essential if help is to be made available to those considered to be at risk of suicide.</P>
      <P>In recognition of the need for further research on the factors which lead people to take their own lives and development of the most effective way of intervening to prevent premature loss of life, my Department is contributing towards the costs of a pilot project in Cork, carried out by staff of the Southern Health Board on parasuicide.  The aim of this project is to reduce the occurrence of parasuicide and to develop intervention skills which may be applied more widely.</P>
      <P>My Department also provided financial support towards the cost of the Fifth European Symposium on Suicide and Self-poisoning, which took place in University College Cork from 31 August to 3 September 1994.  This symposium was attended by researchers from all over Europe, working towards a better understanding of suicide and suicidal behaviour.</P>
      <P>Along with research and development it is also important to look at the services which are already in place, to look at ways of improving and making services more accessible and user friendly.  I am glad to say that the development of psychiatric services in line with the aims of <i>Planning for the Future</i>&mdash; has led to a greater level of understanding and public tolerance of psychiatric illness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> The World Health Organisation has recommended action to reverse the rising trend in suicide by the year 2,000.  It highlights the importance of early detection and treatment for depression, alcoholism and schizophrenia.  It suggests the need for improvements in the underlying societal factors that put a strain on the individual, such as family stress, social isolation of elderly people living alone and failure at school.  It emphasises the need to develop the individual's ability to cope with events of life and provide a better network of social support.</P>
    <P>The ability of people to cope with life is a crucial factor in the prevention and management of mental illness.  Health boards are already involved in a number of ways in promoting better coping skills through parenting programmes, preschool playgroups, life skills education in schools, alcohol and drug awareness programmes and social support for elderly people living alone.  The Health Strategy <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> recognises the importance of health promotion, including the promotion of mental health.  Over the next four years the health services will continue to support and provide programmes to promote mental health.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The number of patients currently on the waiting list for all open heart surgery at the Mater Hospital is at 13 February 1995 1,595.  The scheduling of surgery is a matter for the clinical judgment of the consultant concerned, is based solely on the patient's condition and not on the length of time on the waiting list.  I understand that one patient has been on the waiting list for heart <Col N="130" /> by-pass surgery since March 1988.  I also understand that emergency cases are given priority.</P>
      <P>In 1993, a sum of £1 million from the waiting list fund was allocated to enable the necessary facilities to be put in place at the National Cardiac Surgery Unit, Mater Hospital to increase the annual throughput of open heart surgery at the hospital from 750 to 1,000 &mdash; an increase of 33 per cent.  In addition, in 1993 and 1994, capital funding of £2.8 million was provided to facilitate the doubling of cardiac surery at Cork University Hospital from 200 to 400 patients each year.</P>
      <P>Over 1993 and 1994, in excess of £2 million revenue and £3.5 million in capital was allocated to the Mater Hospital for cardiac surgery and related developments.The building works which were associated with this development, were completed in mid-1994, include additional cardiac maintenance beds, intensive care facilities and high dependency facilities which are required to support the cardiac surgery programme. These new facilities at the hospital have now become operational and the additional cardiac surgery activity has commenced.</P>
      <P>Some additional resources are being provided in 1995 to the Mater Hospital to ensure that throughput in cardiac surgery in 1995 at the Hospital reaches the target of 1,000 open heart operations per year.</P>
      <P>The development at the Mater Hospital, together with the developments for cardiac surgery at Cork University Hospital which were opened in November 1994 will have the effect of increasing the number of cardiac surgery operations performed on an annual basis in the public hospital sector by 47 per cent from 950 to 1,400.</P>

      <P>Legal advice on civil law matters in general, including matters which may become the subject of proceedings before tribunals, is available under the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice since its establishment in 1979.

      <P>The subject matter of this question has been under review.  As the Deputy may be aware the Civil Legal Aid Bill, 1995 has been presented in Seanad Éireann.  The Bill provides a statutory framework for the Scheme of Civil Legal Aid and Advice and it enables me, as Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to make an order to extend legal aid to proceedings before a tribunal such as the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I propose to consider the question of the operation of that provision in due course taking into account progress on the current development and expansion of the Legal Aid Board's services and the Exchequer position.</P>

      <P>As regards the general policy issue regarding such licences, I should explain, as I already did in writing to the Deputy last week, that following from the transfer to me on 20 December, 1994, of statutory powers under the Wildlife Act, 1976, I am empowered under section 22 (9) (b) of that Act to grant licences for the hunting of penreared birds.  Generally, these licences are confined to, or are extensions of, the period of time specified in the open season order made in relation to the same species under section 24 of the Act.  The question of the time period specified in such licences is being reviewed at present and I hope to make a decision in this matter shortly so as to ensure that promoters of keepered shoots are informed of the position in good time to enable them to plan their activities for the 1995 hunting season.</P>

      <P>All wild birds, including birds of prey such as falcons, are protected under the 1976 Wildlife Act, and it is an offence, <i>inter alia,</i> to hunt, capture, kill or injure them or to interfere with or destroy their breeding places except in accordance with licences or permissions issued under that Act.</P>
      <P>Under regulations introduced in 1984 (S.I. No. 8), the taking of birds of prey from the wild is an offence.  In addition, the export and the import of birds of prey are covered by regulations introduced in 1979 (S.I. No. 235) and 1989 (S.I. No. 296) respectively.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied therefore, that the statutory controls in place to protect birds of prey are adequate.</P>

      <P>The most recent relevant data is contained in the report, by the former Environmental Research Unit of my Department, <i>Foreign Trade in Construction Related Materials, 1992</i>&mdash; a copy of which has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.

      <P>Housing Finance Agency loans have on average, over the past ten years, offered the cheapest mortgage rate available and, consequently, I do not consider that these loans have proved unsuitable for low income borrowers.In addition, the income-related nature of the payments on these loans means that they take account of fluctuations in borrowers' incomes.  The risk of never clearing the loan principal would only arise where the borrower's payments remained in the long term below the interest charged, which would normally only occur in the event of long term unemployment.  The position of HFA borrowers who are unemployed is being examined at present, in conjunction with the Department of Social Welfare, in the context of the Supplementary Welfare Allowances Scheme. Borrowers are at any year end free to convert their income related mortgage payments to an annuity basis at the rate of interest applicable to HFA loans, without penalty.</P>

      <P>I have also secured a very substantial increase in the funding available to assist schools in disadvantaged areas in the current year.  The allocation to the disadvantaged areas fund for 1995 is £3.4 million.  This represent an increase of £1.3 million on the spend in this area in 1994.</P>
      <P>Schools are selected for inclusion in the disadvantaged areas scheme on the basis of priority of need as reflected by a range of socio-economic indicators. Factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing and medical card holders among the parents of the children concerned.Account is also taken of the views of my Department's inspectorate on the relative levels of need between schools and the prevailing pupil teacher ratios.</P>
      <P>I have commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to undertake a detailed study of educational disadvantage, the criteria for selecting schools for receipt of special supports and the nature of the supports which should be provided to address the problem.

      <P>As indicated in the Minister for Finance's 1994 Budget Statement, modified PRSI will no longer apply to new public sector employees recruited on or after 6 April, 1995. Accordingly, teachers commencing employment after 5 April 1995, will be liable for the Class A rate of PRSI contribution.</P>
      <P>The application of full PRSI status to such teachers will mean that they will be treated no differently from existing full-rate PRSI contributors as far as social welfare benefits are concerned.  The occupational pension benefits and contributions of such teachers will be amended to take account of their entitlement to social welfare pension benefits.</P>
      <P>The following arrangements will apply to teachers who, after 5 April next, make PRSI contributions at Class A rate and who are members of an occuptional pension scheme: (a) no change will be made in the occupational lump sum benefits, because social insurance benefits are in pension form only; (b) the occupational pension benefits will be calculated on the basis of one eightieth of net pensionable remuneration, i.e. pensionable remuneration less twice the annual equivalent of the maximum rate of contributory old age/retirement pension payable to a single person with no dependants, per year of service; (c) the employee contribution for personal benefits will comprise 1.5 per cent of pensionable remuneration plus 3.5 per cent of net pensionable remuneration; and (d) survivor's benefits, and the employee contribution of 1.5 per cent in respect of such benefits, will be based on the former member's net pensionable remuneration.</P>

      <P>I am indeed aware of the current difficulties in relation to accommodation at post-primary level in the Drogheda centre.  As a first step in resolving these difficulties, a comprehensive review of the accommodation needs of the schools in Drogheda has been completed by my Department. Based on this review, I expect to be in a position shortly to make a decision regarding the provision of additional accommodation in the centre.  In the interim, an application from any of the schools in Drogheda for temporary accommodation to meet an immediate need will be given urgent and sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department operates a number of measures in order to alleviate hardship arising from the payment of examination entry fees.</P>
      <P>In the case of necessitous pupils, the ordinary fee payable may be reduced at the discretion of the school principal and subject to a maximum notified to each school or vocational education committee by my Department.  My Department has made £400,000 available to schools and vocational education committees for this purpose in connection with the 1995 examinations.  This amount is greater than the amount allocated in 1994 by 1.5 per cent, the estimated increase in candidature.  There has been no increase in the rates of examination entry fees since 1994.</P>
      <P>The amount allocated to each school or committee in respect of 1995 fees has been based on the results of a questionnaire on hardship issued to schools in 1994.  Allocations have been increased or reduced, taking into account the particular circumstances in each school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>School authorities are advised that, for the purposes of fee alleviation, a necessitous pupil may be defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of unemployment, prolonged illness of parent, large family with inadequate means, single parent, more than one child from the same family doing the certificate examinations, <Col N="154" /> and other circumstances that would connote a similar degree of domestic financial hardship.</P>
    <P>In addition, in the case of a candidate who remains at school to repeat the leaving certificate examination and whose parent or guardian is the holder of a current medical card the course fee of £100 is waived and the examination entry fee is reduced from £120 to a maximum of £44, (the ordinary leaving certificate fee payable by first-time candidates).</P>
    <P>Finally, candidates who are not attending school may enter personally for the leaving certificate examination under the provisions for admission of external candidates.  The ordinary fees payable by external candidates are reduced, where the candidate is the holder of a current medical card or is dependent on a parent or guardian who is the holder of a current medical card, as follows: one subject, £18, (reduced from £44); two subjects, £33, (reduced from £88); three or more subjects, £44, (reduced from £132).</P>
    <P>I should add that examination entry fees cover only part of the cost of running the certificate examinations.  It is expected that about £6 million in fees will be collected in respect of the 1995 examinations will come to about £13 million.</P>

      <P>Arising from the establishment of a specialist Garda drugs unit in Drogheda in 1993, there was a significant increase in the number of detections made there in 1994 under the Misuse of Drugs Acts. I am informed by the Garda authorities that this increase in detections is attributable more to the higher level of Garda activity following the establishment of the specialist unit than to any increase in drug abuse.</P>
      <P>Apart from the sustained enforcement of the law, I am informed that the Garda takes every opportunity to increase awareness of the drugs problem and of the need to tackle it and, to this end, meets parents, teachers, students, business groups and voluntary organisations.</P>

      <P>While specialist drugs units have a valuable contribution to make, there is a limit to the extent to which available resources ought to be allocated to them.

      <P>A free travel companion pass enables a person 16 years of age or over to accompany the pass holder free of charge.  Companion passes are available to persons who qualify for free travel as the recipients of social welfare <Col N="171" /> type payments in respect of a disability and who, on account of their disability, are unable to travel alone.  The majority of companion pass holders are either blind or mentally handicapped.  It is now also to be available to those on carer's allowance as announced in the budget.</P>
      <P>The standard free travel pass, which is available to all persons 66 years of age or over, enables the spouse of the pass holder under 66 years of age to travel free of charge when accompanying the pass holder.  The extension proposed by the Deputy whereby a third party could accompany the pass holder where the spouse cannot do so by virtue of age or infirmity would involve a significant expansion of the companion pass facility and could only be considered in the light of additional resources being made available.</P>

      <P>The persons concerned were both in receipt of the lone parent's allowance prior to getting married on 27 November 1993.</P>
      <P>He was paid at the maximum rate appropriate in his case of £89 per week in respect of himself and two child dependants.  He was also paid fuel allowance of £8.  She was also paid at the maximum rate appropriate in her case of £89 per week in respect of herself and two child dependants.  She, too, was paid £8 a week fuel allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="172" /> When they married one of the persons concerned made a claim for unemployment assistance on 13 December 1993.  He was paid at the maximum short term unemployment assistance rate of £142.30 per week in respect of himself, his wife and four child dependants.He was also paid the smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week.</P>
    <P>The rate of unemployment assistance payable in respect of the family is less than the combined amount payable to two lone parents maintaining two separate households.  The lone parent's allowance rates take account of the special needs of one parent families and the normal outgoings that arise in maintaining a household.</P>
    <P>Fuel allowance is payable to people who are dependent on long term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  The person concerned was in receipt of the short term rate of unemployment assistance and as a consequence a fuel allowance was not payable.</P>
    <P>In view of the nature of the case I am having this whole matter examined in my Department with a view to seeing what can be done to resolve the issues involved.</P>

      <P>Under social welfare regulations a claim for survivor's pension, which is the payment of interest to the Deputy, must normally be made not later than three months following the death of a spouse.  If a claim is made outside the three month period and there is good reason for the delay the pension is back-dated beyond the three months, but legally in no case can payment be back-dated more than six months prior to the date of claim.  In the case in question, the payment was back-dated for six months.</P>

      <P>I am informed that this is an IBEC programme and therefore not one in which I have a direct function.  However, I understand the programme is financed jointly by the private sector and a number of State agencies, including Forbairt, IDA Ireland, and SFADCo, agencies for which I have responsibility.  The primary aim of the programme is to provide specialist training for young Irish graduates in marketing skills in Europe.  In <Col N="178" /> general, the programme operates on the basis of each sponsored graduate spending three months with the sponsor company in Ireland followed by three months studying in a language school on the Continent and finally a work placement in a host company in the same country.</P>
      <P>I understand that in 1995, the programme organisers, IBEC, expect to place between 110 and 120 participants. Each participant will receive a bursary of £10,000, made up of £5,000 each from the sponsoring company and the appropriate State agencies.  The sponsoring parties between them also contribute a management fee of £1,100 per placement to IBEC.</P>
      <P>I also understand that a total of 73 participants started on the programme in 1994.</P>

      <P>County enterprise boards were established to develop indigenous potential and stimulate economic activity at local level, primarily through the provision of financial and technical support for the development of small enterprises.</P>
      <P>Prior to their establishment no comprehensive locally based decision-making mechanism had existed for State supports to small and micro business. Most enterprise supports were restricted to those provided by the IDA, SFADCo, ABT etc. with decision making focused at regional and national level and assistance restricted to manufacturing and internationally traded services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the operational programme for local, urban and rural development, county enterprise <Col N="179" /> boards will complement the work of existing State agencies and will not displace or duplicate local enterprise initiatives.  Their role will be to facilitate local development and to act as catalysts where no enterprise group is currently active at community level.  The county enterprise plans will help to align the range of official commitments which can directly impact upon small enterprise creation at local, sub-county and county level.  In this way the boards will provide a framework for local initiatives and complement the regional and county level services of State agencies such as FÁS, Teagasc, Forbairt, CERT, Údarás na Gaeltachta, SFADCo and the regional tourism organisations.</P>
    <P>Liaison arrangements have been established through formal structural arrangements and through the good working relationship which have developed between county enterprise boards and Forbairt at regional level. Senior Forbairt representatives are directly involved as members of the relevant county enterprise boards and Forbairt small business projects staff participate actively in the work of the evaluation committees of county enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>While these arrangements provide the basis for co-operation and co-ordination of the efforts of Forbairt and the county enterprise boards, my Department in conjunction with the interdepartmental committee on local development will be monitoring the position on an ongoing basis to ensure the adequacy of arrangements in place and access the need for any new arrangements, if necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand <Col N="180" /> from Forfás that the grant cost per job created and sustained in companies grant aided by the former IDA in the period 1988 to 1994 was £12,786.  This figure is based on the sum of all IDA grant payments over a seven year period divided by the number of first time jobs created and still in existence at the end of that period.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of this calculation, a first time job is defined as the increase in employment in a company over and above the peak employment level in the previous five years and related to a specific investment programme agreed with the IDA, or Forbairt and IDA Ireland as it is now.</P>
      <P>All grants paid by the industrial development agencies are incorporated in the calculations, including capital, leasing, training, employment, interest subsidies, rent reduction, research and development, technology acquisition, management development, and feasibility grants, as well as loan guarantees and equity.</P>
      <P>The primary role of the cost per job sustained indicator is to allow my Department to monitor over time the grant cost of job creation in industry.  As such, tax reliefs which are allowed by the State such as the BES are not included in the calculations, nor are tax revenues accruing to the Exchequer from the companies involved.</P>
      <P>The BES provides that investments of up to £25,000 per annum in a business may be made by an individual who then qualifies for relief on the investment at his or her marginal rate of tax.  The Deputy may be aware that the range of businesses which may receive BES support is considerably wider than that which is grant aidable by the industrial development agencies.  For example, certain tourism and agricultural sectors are included under the BES.  Conversely, a number of companies would be in receipt of support from both the BES support and the industrial development agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> Because of the factors outlined above, it is not possible to make a meaningful comparison between the grant cost of jobs supported by the State agencies and job gains accruing in firms which received BES funding.</P>

      <P>I met the chairpersons and acting chief executives of the county enterprise boards on 2 February and availed of the opportunity for an exchange of views on their experience in shaping their enterprise plans and assisting individuals, firms and local communities to foster, establish or expand viable businesses in all sectors of the local economy.</P>
      <P>In their first year in operation county enterprise boards have helped to support a wide range of projects relating to rural development.  In the case of the services sector, which has already attracted 36 per cent of funding approved by CEBs, boards have been requested to set out specific objectives for enterprise development, particularly where new services can be promoted which will not lead to unfair competition or cause job displacement with existing services.</P>
      <P>In some particularly disadvantaged rural areas, CEBs have highlighted the problems posed by declining services.  In response to the recommendations of the task force on jobs in services, a number of CEBs have identified in their enterprise plans the need for collaborative action with other local development initiatives to assist local service providers as a means of safeguarding and expanding employment opportunities.While ordinary retail outlets would be unlikely to satisfy the eligibility requirements for grants or financial incentives, other forms of support for business information, advice and management development might be specially tailored to suit the needs of selected rural services.  The new operational programme for local development provides scope for county enterprise boards and area partnership companies to develop packages of support for selected rural services which would include demonstration projects and other measures.</P>

      <P>The question of transferring surplus organic fertiliser to deficit areas in the country has been considered by my Department in the past.  A small transport subsidy scheme was introduced in the Lough Sheelin area of County Cavan during the early 1980s as a measure to tackle the euthrophication of that lake.  There are no funds available in my Department to finance such a scheme on a countrywide basis.  Processing facilities for organic fertiliser have not been developed to the extent that they could be recommended on the scale envisaged.  My Department is examining the feasibility of developing such facilities, possibly on a pilot basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 201 and 217 together.  I have arranged to provide relief to pig producers by (a) reducing the slaughtering levy from £1 to 95 pence per pig and (b) suspending, on a temporary basis, the statutory levy of 20 pence per pig paid by pig producers to An Bord Bia.  I have already introduced regulations to provide for the slaughtering levy to be reduced to 95 pence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the suspension of the An Bord Bia levy, which must be <Col N="186" /> effected by way of a motion passed in both Houses of the Oireachtas, the grant-in-aid for An Bord Bia is being increased by £650,000 in 1995 to compensate for the loss of revenue involved.</P>
    <P>The benefit of these measures to pig producers should be in excess of £850,000 per annum which is important in the context of tight margins.</P>
    <P>The minor delay in implementing these measures results from the need to draft legislation in respect of the pig slaughtering fee and to lay the necessary orders before the two Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I emphasise that the suspension of the levy to An Bord Bia is purely a temporary measure.  For the longer term, I am having an in-depth examination made of the pigmeat inspection service with a view to identifying measures which will improve efficiency, reduce costs and thus enable the slaughtering levy to be cut further.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the drilling, blasting and dredging project at Burtonport is considerably behind schedule and this is causing difficulties for the local fishermen.  Every effort is being made by the Department of the Marine to complete this project satisfactorily and as soon as possible.  To this end a meeting is due to be held with the project contractor within the next few days to expedite the matter.  Local fishery interests will be kept informed of developments.</P>
