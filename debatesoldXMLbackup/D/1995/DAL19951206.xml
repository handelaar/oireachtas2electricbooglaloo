      <P>It is proposed to take No. 6 and, subject to the order being made, the Report and Final Stages of the Domestic Violence Bill, 1995, and Nos. 1 and 7.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) subject to the order being made on No. 6, the proceedings on the Report and Final Stages of the Domestic Violence Bill, 1995, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform; (2) Private Members' Business shall be No. 15 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. and (3) the sitting shall be suspended from 12.30 p.m. to 2.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach give the House an undertaking to publish the Book of Estimates before the Christmas recess?  The Taoiseach may recall the publication.  A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances, his document of 14 years ago in which he outlines the unacceptable procedures he is now following. For many years Fianna Fáil in Government always published the Book of Estimates before the Christmas recess.</P>

      <P>Once again I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the media is better informed than us.  I read in this morning's newspapers that the Government will meet at 8.30 a.m. tomorrow to finalise the Estimates, yet the Taoiseach refused to tell us yesterday when the Government intends to finalise the Estimates.  May I take it that on tomorrow's Order of Business the Taoiseach will be able to tell us that the <Col N="579" /> Estimates will be sent to print and published?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of Mr. Justice Paul Carney's judgment yesterday, would the Taoiseach say whether it is the Government's intention to introduce legislation to provide for minimum sentencing in the case of recidivist sex offenders?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government, and the Minister for Justice in particular, will be studying that judgment.  I have a list of sexual offences here, four to five of which carry a maximum penalty of life but there are some that do not.  We will be studying all the relevant judgments in this matter to ascertain whether any legislative changes are required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that it is entirely undesirable that an individual who would be likely to reoffend should be admitted into society in the case of offences of this nature?</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the Taoiseach's intention to establish contact today with his counterpart, the British Prime Minister, in relation to the critical position <i>vis-á-vis</i> Irish Steel?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Some weeks ago when the Minister for Finance took the Order of Business he gave a commitment that if there was any inadequacy in the law in relation to sexual offences against children the Government would deal with it.  With that commitment in mind will the Taoiseach consider &mdash; when there is a multiplicity of heinous crimes against children, as in the case before the courts yesterday &mdash; introducing adequate legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that a life sentence is applicable to a number of cases of sexual offence.  I would not wish to comment, nor would the Minister for Justice wish to me to do so, on any judicial decision without first having had an opportunity of studying it.  Obviously, if there are deficiencies in the law, particularly in circumstances where people are released while being a grave danger to minors, we would wish to remedy them.  I would not necessarily accept that legislative change is necessary until we have had an opportunity of studying the judgment which was handed down only yesterday and founded on another judgment.  We shall have to consult both of those judgments, plus the statutory provisions, in order to decide whether further legislation is necessary.  The Minister for Finance was <Col N="581" /> quite right in saying that this Government attaches considerable importance to ensuring that the law in this area affords maximum protection to victims or potential victims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Taoiseach, in his past life, was very much to the fore in saying that the House should have adequate opportunity to discuss the Estimates for any given year, has he any proposals to put to the House regarding the Estimates for 1996? Would he adhere to his idea enunciated in the 1980s that it would be a good idea to bring forward legislation to ensure that the delay in their production will not occur?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I remember being a Member of this House for up to 20 years when most of the Estimates were hardly discussed at all in the House.  As a result of the introduction of a committee system by a Government of which I was not a member, but of which Deputy McCreevy was, we now have a committee system in place whereby every Estimate is discussed in detail in the House, which was never the case before.  It is something for which we can all take credit and a good example of Dáil reform at work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it not always the case that the Estimates for the following year were published well before the Christmas recess to allow some debate on them?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that we have been far too polite with the British Government in regard to the position of Irish Steel?  Will he give the House a commitment that he will meet the British Prime Minister to pull out all the stops in an endeavour to save those jobs in Cork?  We have been <Col N="582" /> far too polite and the Taoiseach's involvement has been lacking in this issue&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Since the Taoiseach stated in reply to questions from Deputies Harney and O'Donoghue that he would study yesterday's judgment, is he aware that since 1993 there has been in existence a Law Reform Commission report recommending legislation in areas like this?

      <P>Is it now the policy of the Taoiseach and his Government to kill off the total industrial base of Cork Harbour in addition to the closure of Verolme Cork dockyard, Fords and Dunlops?  Is it the intention to kill off the only remaining industry within the harbour area, Irish Steel?  If the viability plan for the company had been put in place, it would have ensured its survival. I note there is silence on the far side of the House.  Apparently they want to close down Cork city and county.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that by endeavouring to answer I am placing the Chair in an awkward position, but in response to Deputy Wallace and others, including Deputies on this side of the House who raised this matter with me, I am very concerned about the situation in Irish Steel.  I do not believe the attitude of the British Government is justified; it is not based on facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have conveyed this view in the strongest way to the British authorities. My office is in daily contact about this matter with the Office of the Prime Minister, and I have also asked all relevant members of the Government to contact their counterparts who are dealing with other relevant EU matters in which Britain might have an interest, to convey our deepest concern on this matter. It is a tremendous achievement by the Minister to have been able to get <Col N="586" /> such a vibrant investor to come into Irish Steel.  It is of great importance to this country that this plant which is now to be privatised should be able to do its work and add to the already very substantial economic investment taking place in Cork.  Far from being a depressed zone, as Deputy O'Keeffe described it, Cork is vibrant, and Irish Steel will add to that vibrancy in the future.</P>

      <P>I am naturally pleased that the Minister has recognised the value of the amendment we tabled on Committee Stage.  A barring order is a very severe remedy from the point of view of the person who is barred because a breach would be a criminal offence.  Consequently, we felt it was important to be precise in this regard. There can be emotional responses which stem from the difficulties of marriage breakdown, and this amendment deals with that issue by specifying the psychological aspects and removing the term &ldquo;emotional&rdquo; which was in the original section.  Welfare includes the physical, emotional and psychological welfare of the person in question.  That is a valuable improvement and I thank the Minister for making it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 5, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  In this Act, where the context so requires, a reference to a spouse includes a reference to a person who is a party to a marriage that is void or voidable or has been annulled in the State or that has been dissolved or annulled under the law of a country or jurisdiction other than the State.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is to ensure that there is no loophole regarding protection and that the same protection will be extended to someone whose marriage is dissolved or annulled in another state.</P>
      <P>At the time the Minister agreed there was a difficulty and said he would examine the issue before Report Stage.  In a reference to the Family Law Act, 1995 the Minister said it did not cover spouses who have a domestic or foreign decree of annulment of marriage.  Did the Minister examine that because I do not see any amendment relating to it?  He said at the time that it might require different legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated on Committee Stage when commenting on similar amendments tabled by Deputies Keogh and Woods, these amendments lack precision.  For example, the amendments could mean that where a party to a marriage obtains a foreign divorce, he or she could seek a barring order against the other party regardless of whether such foreign divorce is recognised in the State.  One purpose of these amendments is to provide that where a foreign decree of divorce is entitled to recognition in the State either party may <Col N="590" /> seek a barring order against the other. The recently enacted Family Law Act provides for the granting of barring orders and protection orders in such cases.  The purpose of section 21 of the Bill, as amended in Committee, is to ensure not alone that this will continue to be the position but also that the courts will be empowered to grant safety orders and interim barring orders in such cases.</P>
      <P>The reason the matter is dealt with in the Family Law Act, as opposed to this Bill, is that the situation of a person with a foreign divorce decree is more complex than that of the classes of person covered by this Bill.  The Family Law Act provides that the court must first hear an <i>ex parte</i> application to ensure that it is well founded and that the party satisfies certain jurisdictional rules.  This is to ensure that valuable court time is not wasted on spurious applications from persons with foreign divorce decrees which do not meet the criteria for recognition in Ireland.  In addition, the Act provides that where either spouse remarries, the remedy is not available.  The court must also take a number of other factors into account such as the length of time which has elapsed since the foreign divorce was granted and the extent to which the order is likely to be enforceable.</P>
      <P>A question also arises in relation to the position of spouses who have a domestic or foreign decree of annulment of marriage and wish to obtain orders under the Bill.  I examined the matter further since Committee Stage.  It is not straightforward and I am of the view that separate legislation covering nullity in this and other respects would be the more appropriate and safest way forward. In the circumstances, I am unable to accept these amendments.</P>

      <P>Our amendment related to barring orders as distinct from safety orders but the position is otherwise similar.  The Family Law Act provides for certain barring orders in these instances and the Minister undertook to examine the question before Report <Col N="591" /> Stage.  It is clear from the Minister's reply that he considers the matter to be quite complex and would rather deal with it in the context of annulment.  This may well be the case and in that event we await the annulment legislation.  Can the Minister give us any indication as to when that legislation will come before the House?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 5, lines 28 to 30, to delete <Col N="592" /> all words from and including &ldquo;during&rdquo; in line 28 down to and including &ldquo;order&rdquo; in line 30 and substitute &ldquo;or is the parent of a child in common with the respondent&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The section, which relates to safety orders, would, if the amendment is accepted, provide that &ldquo;the applicant&rdquo; is a person who is not the spouse of the respondent but has lived with the respondent as husband or wife for a period of at least six months in aggregate or is the parent of a child in common with the respondent.  This would allow a co-parent of a child to apply, regardless of the length of time the parties have lived together.</P>
    <P>The amendment recognises that common parenthood in itself creates a unit in which domestic violence may surface. It also allows the parent of a dependent child to seek a safety order to protect the child against the other parent.  There is currently no provision in the Bill which allows that.  We are concerned that a parent in this instance would have the same protection as other parents. We discussed this matter on Committee Stage and the Minister is familiar with the arguments.  We believe it is an important issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister has gone some of the way towards meeting our concern by making two changes which are intended to broaden the category of non-spouses or co-habitees who would be entitled to apply for a safety order.  The first of these removes the requirement that the couple must have lived together for six of the previous 12 months and requires only that they have lived together for at least six months.  This recognises the unstable nature of many violent or dysfunctional relationships where one partner may come and go from either a shared home or his partner's home.  The length and stability of a relationship is something a court may take into consideration when deciding to grant the order but should not be used as a threshold to exclude people from protection.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="593" /> The other matter is that of the co-parent of a child.  The parent should be able to invoke a safety order as a means of protection.  The amendment would allow co-parents of a child who do not cohabit or satisfy the criteria for cohabitees, for example, lone parents, to apply for a safety order.  It would also allow for a safety order to protect a child without involving a health board, in other words, the mother, as a lone parent, could apply.  This could be important for mothers who might otherwise be seen as incapable when the health board intervened.  Has the Minister given further consideration to this issue?  Why does he not consider it necessary to extend protection to such parents?</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>We are rehearsing many of the arguments made on Committee Stage.  This is an important and valid amendment although it may be a little convoluted.  My amendment seeks to insert: &ldquo;is a person in relation to whom another person is a dependent person, and that other person is also a dependent person of the respondent, or.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women's Aid recently published research which is valuable when dealing with domestic violence which is endemic in society.  That organisation, among others, considers it important that any person who has a child in common with a person who is abusing her ought to be able to apply for a safety order under section 2 or a barring order under section 3.  The amendment is designed to allow any person who has a child in common with an abuser to apply for an order and uses the concept of &ldquo;dependent person&rdquo;, not &ldquo;child&rdquo;.  The Minister stated on Committee Stage that the breach of a safety order gives rise to serious consequences and would render a person liable to arrest in respect of behaviour which might not otherwise constitute a criminal offence.  I am concerned about the message that might give to people.  We must emphasise the seriousness of breaches of such orders. I do not know if we should use that <Col N="594" /> argument in relation to restrictions on safety orders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I know but we should not allude to that given the seriousness of the matter.  The Minister stated the amendments would allow the right to apply for a safety order without restriction. That interpretation is too wide.  It is important to acknowledge the different types of relationships that exist. Those who are not living together should be able to apply for safety and barring orders.  There must be a way around it and the Minister should examine the amendments further.</P>
      <P>I do not object to grouping amendments but sometimes the precision of individual amendments tends to be lost when they are grouped.  It might have been more useful to deal with the amendments one at a time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not support these amendments on Committee Stage.  One effect of amendment No. 3 would be to fundamentally change the requirement in the Bill that cohabitants live together for six months in aggregate in the period of 12 months immediately prior to the application for a safety order.  The amendment would mean safety orders would be available to cohabitants who live together at any time for a period of six months in aggregate.  Former cohabitants who had split up many years ago could apply for a safety order on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Breach of a safety order gives rise to serious consequences.  It would render a person liable to arrest in respect of behaviour which might not otherwise constitute a criminal offence.  That is the legal position.  A respondent may be arrested without warrant and, for the purpose of arrest, the gardaí may enter any place where the respondent happens to be, whether in the home or any other place.  It is important that these powers, which are far-reaching even in the context of domestic violence, should <Col N="595" /> be available only in very specific circumstances.</P>
    <P>Another effect of the amendment which would also arise in the case of amendment No. 4 is that it would allow all persons who have a child in common, even where they do not reside together, to apply for a safety order.  This would depart from the main purpose of the Bill which is to protect persons residing together.  Amendments Nos. 18 and 19 propose that the period of living together by cohabitants should be six months in aggregate within the 12 months period immediately prior to the application for a barring order.  I introduced an amendment on Committee Stage which provided that the period of living together must be six months in aggregate during the period of nine months immediately prior to the application for a barring order.  As I stated then, I am advised that stricter provision is necessary in the case of a barring order than in the case of a safety order for the reason that giving power to the court to order a cohabitant from his or her home runs the risk of constitutional challenge.  To minimise the chances of success of any such challenge the provision needs to be operated under strict conditions.  I regret that I am not prepared to go any further in this regard.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 18 and 20 would allow a person who has a child in common with another person to apply for a barring order against that other person without the need to establish that they were residing together at any time.  A provision on those lines would not cohere with other essential conditions in the Bill to the effect that parties must be in some form of domestic relationship if they are to avail of the measures in the Bill.  I oppose amendments Nos. 3, 4, 18, 19 and 20.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the amendments are being discussed together but it complicates matters.  Amendments Nos. 3 and 4 deal with safety orders whereas amendment No. 18 deals with barring orders.  As the Minister stated, <Col N="596" /> there are different concepts in relation to barring orders.  Crossing from one area to the other creates difficulties in considering fully the points that need to be raised.</P>
      <P>We want to ensure that a safety order is available where it is needed in practical terms.  The Minister has a difficulty with this because he wants to ensure that the cohabitees will have been living together over a certain period.  He brought in an amendment to improve the position and we recognise that but he has not gone far enough.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 18 proposes to reduce the threshold of cohabitation from six out of the previous seven months to six out of the previous 12 months and introduces the concept of a co-parent being allowed to apply without any requirement of cohabitation. People experience practical difficulties in this area.  On Committee Stage we acknowledged that barring and safety orders may have serious consequences, but amendment No. 3 would allow a degree of protection to lone parents under a safety order.  While, in practical terms, the position of lone parents is recognised in social welfare and family law, we must recognise that one in five children are the children of lone parents and when account is taken of desertion and marriage breakdown the figure is much higher.  Therefore, under the legislation a substantial number of families will not benefit from the protection of safety orders.  We support the legislation and the introduction of safety orders but the Minister should have gone further.  I do not believe it would have had the dire consequences suggested by the Department.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 5 and 6 are closely related.  Amendment No. 6 proposes to prevent an approach or entry to a place &ldquo;where the applicant or that dependent person resides, is not residing or happens to be&rdquo; and that covers the workplace.  This matter was discussed at length on Committee Stage and we requested the Minister to table an amendment on Report Stage to meet the many genuine concerns about respondents entering, approaching, watching or besetting applicants.  He said it would be difficult to deal with the matter without affecting people's freedom of movement.  Respondents can intimidate applicants outside their place <Col N="598" /> of residence, for example, at their place of work, and this can be done by telephone or otherwise.  We are seeking the introduction of a safety order designed to ensure that people cannot be molested or harassed in any form.  What does the Minister propose to do in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 6 is a repeat of a Committee Stage amendment. It would allow the court under a safety order to prohibit a respondent from approaching, watching or besetting the applicant at any place where the applicant happens to be.  I remain of the view that the Bill is already framed in a way which meets most of the circumstances in which a person might need protection outside the home.</P>
      <P>There is provision in section 2 (2) (a) to the effect that a person may be directed not to use &ldquo;or threaten to use violence against, molest or put in fear the applicant&rdquo; no matter where the applicant is at the time.  In addition, the court may make a safety order subject to such exceptions and conditions as it may specify.  That provision would meet many of the situations which are, apparently, intended to be covered by the amendment in the name of Deputy Woods.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 in the name of Deputy Keogh is also a repeat of a Committee Stage amendment.  It is more specific in that places where persons are intended to be protected include places where the applicant works or attends for educational purposes, or any other place.  The powers the court already has under the Bill are sufficient to deal with each case as may be appropriate.</P>
      <P>Other Deputies in the course of earlier debate on these amendments raised concerns about circumstances in which the applicant and respondent may work in the same place of employment.  I also have some reservations in that connection. In the circumstances with regret I am not in a position to support these amendments.</P>

      <P>These amendments were discussed at considerable length on Committee Stage.  We are all agreed that we are trying to tie down so far as possible the criteria to be applied in considering applications for safety and barring orders.  The Minister said he would reconsider what we were trying to achieve.  While there is a need to provide protection where the two persons concerned work in the same firm I am concerned to provide as much reassurance as possible to women in circumstances in which safety and barring orders may be granted.  In this regard my amendment is both reasonable and helpful.  There must be a way around the difficulties that would arise as a result. It is not beyond the competence of officials within the Department or the parliamentary draftsman to come up with a solution.  I am disappointed, therefore, that we have been unable to tie down the criteria a little bit more.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 30, after &ldquo;section,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of my amendments is to ensure that all persons who do not have a mental or physical disability are treated in a similar manner under this Bill once they attain the age of majority, and to remove certain anomalies which have arisen in this regard.  I promised Deputy Woods on Committee Stage that I would consider certain matters pertaining to such young persons and these amendments are the result.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 15 provides that a section 2 safety order which has been made for the benefit of a dependent person will be automatically discharged when that person ceases to be a dependent person, that is, when he or she attains the age of 18 in normal circumstances. The amendment is necessary because children who are 18 years of age or older children may not come within the category of persons who can apply for a safety order.  The objective of the amendment, therefore, is to ensure that the one set of rules applies to children who have attained the age of majority and who are not suffering from a physical or mental disability.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 7, 8, 10, 11 and 12 are consequential amendments which also involve section 2.  On the basis that a safety order will be automatically discharged when a dependent person ceases to be a dependent person then provisions concerning the variation of such orders are not necessary.  The effect of these amendments is to delete those provisions in section 2.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 28 to 34, inclusive, and 36 to 42, inclusive, make similar amendments to the sections dealing with barring orders, interim barring orders and protection orders.  These amendments include amendments Nos. 29 and 32 in the name of Deputy <Col N="601" /> Woods which appear to have the same objective as my amendments.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 44 to 48, inclusive, are consequential on the above amendments and relate to section 13 which provides for the discharge of orders. There is no longer a need to provide for the discharge of orders on the application of a person who ceases to be a dependent person in view of the fact that such orders will be automatically discharged.  Amendment No. 48 in the name of Deputy Woods appears to be tabled for the same purpose.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 arose from the Committee Stage debate.  It is proposed that the safety order should last five years, unless the court specifies a shorter period, and can be renewed for a further five years.  We felt that this period, which could last for up to ten years, was too long a duration for a safety order which has, as the Minister <Col N="603" /> stated earlier, very serious consequences for the respondent because a breach of such an order represents a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>This amendment is designed to provide that the standard length of a safety order will be three years &mdash; which would be the same as the new barring order &mdash; but permits the court the discretion to make an order of up to five years in very severe cases.  The order can also be renewed.  We were concerned to some extent about this issue.  A three year period, with the option to extend if necessary, would be more appropriate for safety orders.  People have expressed concern that once the safety order is applied a register will be kept at the local Garda station and the individual involved will become a &ldquo;marked person&rdquo;. It is important that the length of safety orders be flexible in a way which is not unduly harsh.  Consequently, we suggest that the length of safety orders should be the same as that of the new barring orders, namely three years. However, the court will retain the option to lengthen safety orders if a case warrants such action.</P>
    <P>We are seeking to ensure that women are protected in these situations but not make it less likely that they will succeed in obtaining safety orders.  I accept the point, made by the Minister on Committee Stage, that the five year period is appropriate and that the court retains discretion to decide on a shorter period. However, we believe that, in practice, five years would become the norm whereas it would be sufficient to provide &mdash; within this legislation &mdash; a standard length of three years for safety orders with an option to extend if necessary. That is the purpose of the amendment. I am interested to hear if the Minister has proceeded further with his consideration of this matter.</P>

      <P>This is one of the few amendments tabled by Deputy Woods with which I do not agree.  Perhaps I am becoming somewhat draconian as a result of my knowledge of domestic <Col N="604" /> violence.  My opinion that the five year period is correct has been reaffirmed.  I appreciate the points made by Deputy Woods but, in this instance, I support the Minister's approach rather than that of the Deputy.  I understand the reasons for the Deputy's amendment but I would prefer that the legislation remain unaltered in this regard.  In fact, I might be inclined to have the duration increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments would reduce the duration of a safety order, if granted by the District Court, from five years to three years, except in very serious cases where the court could extend the period by a further two years.  I did not support these amendments on Committee Stage.  I thought they were unnecessary and remain of that view.</P>
      <P>Under the Bill, it will be open to the court to deal with each case according to the circumstances.  The period of duration of an order is not fixed.  The District Court can make an order for any length of time short of five years.  It will also be open to an applicant or respondent to seek variation or discharge of orders made by the court.  In my view, there is no need to prescribe in the Bill a period of duration which is the same as a barring order.  There are different types of orders and the Bill reflects that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not agree with Deputy Woods' statement that the five year period would become the norm.  In my view the five year period would not become the norm, it is the maximum permitted duration under the terms of the Bill.  At present, in barring order applications, for example, where the maximum duration is one year, not all such orders are granted for this period.  In many cases barring orders are granted for one, three or six months, or perhaps for only seven days on occasion.  The court has discretion in this regard and it can be safely left with that authority which, having heard the particular circumstances in each individual case, can make the appropriate order.  I feel that the widest possible discretion should be <Col N="605" /> permitted which is the reason the Bill is cast in this way.  For the reasons outlined, I am unable to accept these amendments.</P>

      <P>The purpose of amendment No. 16 is to delete all words from and including &ldquo;unless&rdquo; in line 26 down to and including &ldquo;matter&rdquo; in line 27.  The purpose of amendment No. 17 is to insert the following in page 7, between lines 27 and 28:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(8)  The Court shall not hear an application for a barring order and an application for a safety order concerning the same matter between the same parties at the same hearing.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was stated on Committee Stage that the section, as drafted, is intended to prevent the court granting a safety order <Col N="606" />&mdash; the lesser remedy &mdash; on an application for a barring order.  This is a matter of taking the easy way out unless the applicant has already applied for a safety order.  The amendment goes further and prevents the court from considering the application for a barring order and safety order at the same time. In practice, it is likely that most applicants for a barring order will also apply for a safety order in the event that they cannot establish the grounds for the more serious remedy.  Since the court is likely to have both applications before it, section 2 (7) may not have the desired effect.</P>
    <P>The disadvantage of the proposed amendment is that, if an applicant applied for both orders, two separate hearings would be required.  This amendment was withdrawn on Committee Stage to give the Minister an opportunity to consider the issue further for Report Stage.  The Minister rejected our views on Committee Stage.  The success rate in obtaining barring orders is relatively low.  It is likely that most solicitors will advise their clients to apply for both a barring order and safety order at the same time to increase the chance of success. In those circumstances the danger is that the court will take the easier option and make the safety order.  The procedure, which would be a simple one, would have to be worked out so that the second application could be heard on the same day if necessary.  The Minister is very familiar with the arguments on this issue.  I would like to know whether he has given it further consideration for Report Stage and what is his view.</P>

      <P>These amendments go against one of the Bill's principal objectives, that of empowering the victim. Under the Bill as it stands a victim or the parent of a victim may have three options.  He or she may apply for a barring order, a safety order or both a barring order and safety order.  The effect of these amendments would be to remove the third option, leaving the victim with only two options.  If a victim <Col N="607" /> wishes to ensure the court does not grant a safety order as the soft option in lieu of a barring order, which it appears the amendments are intended to address, he or she may simply avail of the first option and apply only for a barring order.  I am not in favour of the amendment.  The section as framed, which gives three clear options to the victims of violence, should remain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The effect of this amendment would be to allow relatives of any kind living with a respondent the right to apply for a barring order.  It appears the applicant, regardless of his or her age, could include any child of the respondent.  This amendment is identical to an amendment tabled by Deputy Woods on Committee Stage.  As I stated then, the amendment lacks precision. What does the word &ldquo;sibling&rdquo; mean?  Is it intended to refer to relatives of whole blood, half blood and so on?  As framed, the amendment would allow a young child to apply for a barring order whereas the Bill as it stands allows a parent or health board to apply on <Col N="608" /> behalf of a young person.  Where a young child is concerned, that is the only workable way to proceed to protect their interests properly.</P>
      <P>There are potential difficulties with the proposal to allow, say, a brother to bar another brother from the home.  The difficulty is that there may be permutations and combinations &mdash; for example, what would be the position if one or both parents live with those persons? Should they have a say in the matter? To what extent should the fact that only some of those parties have rights of ownership in the home be a factor? I am satisfied that any extension of the drastic barring order remedy to the categories of persons provided for in this amendment is not a practicable proposition. For the reasons I have given I regret I am not in a position to accept the amendment.</P>

It would also apply in circumstances where the parents are dead.  The Minister said it would be very difficult to cover those circumstances.

      <P>This amendment is similar to other amendments whose purpose is to identify specific guidelines.  The Minister did not accept the amendment on Committee Stage because he thought it was too wide.  It is up to the court to specify the parameters in that regard.  Why does the Minister believe the wording is too wide?  He said he was not favourably disposed towards the amendment but that he would consider it for Report Stage.

      <P>This amendment would be of similar effect to amendments Nos. 5 and 6 proposed by Deputies Keogh and Woods in relation to safety orders.  The amendment proposes that a respondent under a barring order may be prohibited from attending at places where the applicant works or attends for educational purposes.  Subsection (3) (a) of section 3 already provides that under a barring order a person may be directed not to use or threaten to use violence against, molest or put in fear the applicant, no matter where the applicant is at the time.  In addition, the court may make a barring order &ldquo;subject to such exceptions and conditions as it may specify&rdquo;.  Those provisions should meet the circumstances which are apparently intended to be covered by the amendment from Deputy Keogh. The section is framed in a way which meets all possible situations.  It does so on lines similar to the 1981 Act which the Bill will replace.  I do not think that a place of employment or education should be singled out for special mention and therefore oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 26:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 26 to 44 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  In considering an application under this section in respect of a person who is an applicant by virtue of paragraph (b), (c), (d) or (e) of subsection (1) the Court shall have regard to the ownership of the place where the applicant and any dependent person reside and if the respondent has a legal or beneficial interest in that place and the applicant has no such interest or if, in the opinion of the Court, the applicant's interest is considerably less than that of the respondent, then the court shall not grant the application unless it is of the view that <Col N="611" /> in all the circumstances, including the respective needs and resources of the parties and the needs of any dependent person residing in that place, it is just and equitable to do so.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that a person who has less than 50 per cent ownership in a property would still have a right to apply for a barring order.  Section 3 (4) provides that a cohabitee may not secure a barring order against a partner if that partner owns the premises in which they reside or owns a greater share of it than the applicant.  That provision is unfair as it links a person's right to be protected against serious domestic violence to his or her ownership of property and makes a financially dependent person even more vulnerable.  The proposed amendment alters section 3 (4) to the effect that a court would no longer be prevented from making a barring order in these circumstances.  The court would be obliged to consider the ownership of the property in which the parties reside and would only grant the order if in all the circumstances it is just to do so.  In particular, a court should consider the needs and means of both parties and whether there are dependent children. Presumably, the subsection, as drafted, is intended to respect a respondent's property rights which are guaranteed under the Constitution.  The amendment gives a court the flexibility to balance the respondent's property rights against the constitutional right to bodily integrity of the applicant and children, a protection from physical attack.</P>
    <P>We ask the Minister to accept the amendment although we appreciate it may pose constitutional difficulties.  Given that there is a balance of rights in the Constitution, we consider that this amendment meets the required balance and the Minister should accept it. We are concerned that the Minister's proposal could exclude a substantial number of cases in which cohabitees <Col N="612" /> would be affected.  The Minister said that, in practice, about one third of respondents do not turn up, that he would find it very difficult to deal with this problem related to property, but that he would refer the matter to the Attorney General to ascertain if our suggestion would meet the requirements. We tabled the amendment on Report Stage to hear the Minister's views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the most important amendment tabled to the Bill.  My amendment is more particular, but it seeks to achieve the same objective as Deputy Woods's amendment.  I appreciate the Minister's difficulty in accepting the amendment.  He may feel further constrained by the fact that other legislation was rejected by the Supreme Court on constitutional grounds.  I framed my amendment in such a way as to tiptoe through the Constitution.  It is terribly important that the provision in the amendment is included in the Bill and that we do not allow property rights to be considered more important than the bodily integrity of women and children. We are all on the same side on this issue and I tabled my amendment as we need to strike a proper balance in the Bill.  There are sufficient protections for property rights in the Constitution and this amendment can deal with the difficulties stated by the Minister.</P>
      <P>We have seen the devastation caused by domestic violence and read in the newspapers daily of its increasing incidence. It may be the case that the position is not disimproving, but that more women are braver and more inclined to bring such cases to court.  We need to send a strong message to those people in the legislation passed through these Houses.  This is an important matter.  I will not go into the detail of the amendment as it was covered on Committee Stage.  In this legislation we must strike a proper balance between people's property rights and the integrity and safety of women and children, as the property rights of men in the main are often considered more important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> Difficulties arise in cases where property has been signed over to the respondent and the manner in which such cases are dealt with.  I appreciate the Minister accepts this is a vexed issue, but there is a view that he has been unduly cautious in his response.  I ask him to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 26 and 27 are similar to amendments tabled by Deputies Woods and Keogh on Committee Stage.  I indicated then that the advice available to me is that amendments on the lines proposed, which would allow a respondent other than the spouse with an ownership interest to be barred on the application of a person with no such interest or with a lesser interest than the respondent, might not survive constitutional scrutiny.  That advice still holds good.</P>
      <P>Moreover, a newspaper report on our Committee Stage discussions indicated that the Bill was somehow flawed because the barring order provisions did not extend to certain categories of persons who had no ownership rights. However, the newspaper report was flawed, not the Bill, because it failed to understand that the provisions of the Bill must be framed to comply with provisions in the Constitution concerning rights of ownership of persons.  A Bill should not be described as flawed if it is framed to comply with our constitutional requirements.  Is it not strange then to find a report which states the Bill is flawed because it does not deal with something which would, in effect, be unconstitutional?</P>
      <P>I promised on Committee Stage to consult further with the Attorney General and have done so but the position is the same.  In the circumstances, I cannot accept these amendments, the effect of which would run a serious risk of infringing the provisions of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>One of the points which arise in this is that the approach being <Col N="614" /> taken by the Minister could be seen as a discrimination against married people in that the married owner of property can be barred while the unmarried owner cannot.  If the couple is cohabiting, the property rights come into play and become dominant.</P>

      <P>We suggested the Minister should give serious consideration to this and he told us he did.  It is a major issue and one on which we find it difficult to agree with the advice of the Attorney General.  The Minister made a suggestion on Committee Stage that he might refer this to the constitutional review group because it is a fundamental issue in relation to the balance between property rights and the right to bodily integrity in the Constitution. Perhaps the Minister might do that as one means of having it investigated further.</P>
      <P>We are concerned about this because we feel it could mean a large number of cohabitees could be removed from the protection of the barring orders.  Hence, we have regarded it as an important issue.  We believe amendment No. 26 is constitutional and feel it should be pressed.</P>

      <P>In page 10, line 5, to delete &ldquo;an immediate and serious risk of significant harm&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;a serious risk of harm&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister show a little empathy in relation to some of the amendments we put forward?  What I am trying to do here is say that if there is a serious risk of harm, then action should be taken.  I could not understand why we must use the words &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; and &ldquo;significant&rdquo; because we are talking <Col N="617" /> about degrees of harm here.  One cannot talk of degrees of harm.  People can be harmed by threats, never mind by acts of violence.</P>
    <P>We were pedantic or, at least the Minister was, towards this amendment on Committee Stage.  We are talking about interim orders here and I know the Minister said this related to extreme circumstances.  I have no quarrel with that but one can have extreme circumstances in relation to &ldquo;a serious risk of harm&rdquo;.  How immediate does the Minister want it to be?</P>
    <P>When we speak of women who are terrorised, in particular, I do not think there is a necessity to be pedantic about it.  We should live with &ldquo;a serious risk of harm&rdquo; and say if that is the belief of somebody, then it is good enough to warrant an interim barring order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This is similar to an amendment tabled by Deputy Keogh on Committee Stage.  Section 4 provides for the making by the court of an interim barring order pending the determination of an application for a barring order.  Such an order can be made <i>ex parte.</i> One of the conditions with which the court must be satisfied is that there is an immediate and serious risk of significant harm to the applicant or any dependent person if the order is not made immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of Deputy Keogh's amendment would be to dilute that condition. In other words, the court would not be required to examine either the immediacy of the risk or the significance of the harm.  As I pointed out on Committee Stage, the power to bar the respondent from the home, under this section, can be exercised on an <i>ex parte</i> basis.  In other words, a person could be forced to leave his or her home without being given the opportunity to be heard in court or to answer to the complaint or to say whether it is true or false.  It is obvious that such a power can only be exercised in the most extreme situations. The Law Reform Commission <Col N="618" /> acknowledges, in its report on child sexual abuse, that removal of an alleged abuser by a barring order made on an <i>ex parte</i> basis could only be contemplated in the most extreme circumstances. The present working has been framed with this in mind.  For this reason I am unable to accept the Deputy's amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept what the Minister is saying.  What has to happen? Do I have to be threatened with being killed in order to achieve a barring order in these circumstances?  Is it not much better to err on the side of protection of people rather than on the side of somebody being barred from their home, no matter for how short a period that might be?  I cannot believe the Minister is actually saying this.  He has accepted many of the points made by groups involved in the whole area of domestic violence.  It is extraordinary that we should be more concerned that somebody would be barred from their home than we would be with the threat of harm to a person.  If there is a serious risk, that is good enough.  I cannot accept the Minister would take that view.  I have praised him for his handling of this Bill but I am very disappointed with his response to this amendment.  It is not a huge amendment.  We have to remember what we are trying to achieve here.  We have to say to the 18 per cent of Irish women and their children who suffer from violence that they are the people who need to be defended, not the abusers.</P>

Obviously, the Minister listened to what was said on Committee Stage. <Col N="622" /> While we did not get all we wanted certainly he was prepared to make amendments. This has been one of the characteristics of this Minister.</P>
      <P>I thank the staff who worked with the Minister.  One of the amendments, as Deputy Keogh pointed out, resulted in 24 consequential amendments.  The draftsperson had a good deal of work to do in meeting some of the points made by us earlier.  This Bill is important and coming at a very important time.  It is sending out a special message which is wider than the content of the Bill itself. It is that Dáil Éireann will not accept domestic violence, the extent of which is far greater than was anticipated previously, and that we are determined to provide safety for spouses &mdash; in most cases for women &mdash; who find themselves in situations of domestic violence.  For that reason we have pleasure in supporting the Bill.  It was a good Bill in the first instance but is now a better Bill having completed the different Stages in the House.  I wish the Minister every success in the Seanad.</P>

I thank also his officials for the enormous work they have done. Because of this legislation and the work of Women's Aid, domestic violence is now recognised in Irish society as a reality and we have to face up to it.  To a great extent, this Bill helps us to do that.</P>
      <P>While I said I was disappointed with some aspects of the Bill, we can leave that for another day.  I congratulate the Minister on this important Bill and hope it will be speedily enacted.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 11, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The twin track approach, launched yesterday week, is designed to lead to all-party negotiations on an agreed settlement based on consent.  Both Governments had devoted a sustained effort over a considerable period to agree the Communiqué.  Nevertheless, the visit of President Clinton helped to give a more focused intensity to our efforts because both Governments understood the opportunity inherent in the visit to advance matters on the road to all-inclusive dialogue.</P>
      <P>The Communiqué constitutes an intergovernmental response to the sensitivities and concerns that existed in both traditions with regard to participation in, and commencement of, such negotiations.  The two Governments, therefore, have sought to reassure all sides through agreement on a process designed to make progress in parallel and simultaneously on preparatory political talks and the decommissioning issue.  We have honestly accepted the differences that exist between us at this stage and put our trust in the twin track process to achieve the necessary progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="625" /> On the political track, the two Governments have set the firm aim of achieving all-party substantive negotiations by the end of February 1996 and we have committed ourselves to working with others to achieve that.  With co-operation between both Governments and the Northern Ireland parties in both tracks, that objective will prove achievable. The period until then will be characterised by intensive preparatory talks and, in order to achieve speedy forward momentum, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs invited the Northern Ireland parties on Friday to participate in exploratory talks with the Government.  Parallel invitations were issued by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew. The intensive round of political contacts flowing from these invitations needs, of course, to be complemented by a similar level of dialogue between the Northern Ireland parties.  I, therefore, very much welcome Monday's meeting between the SDLP and the UUP.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the preparatory talks will be to put in place, on the basis of widespread agreement, firm foundations and procedures for subsequent substantive negotiations, thus maximising the prospects for an agreed outcome based on consent and in both phases all relevant relationships will be addressed in an interlocking three-stranded frame.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 3 of the Communiqué states that the preparatory talks may also extend to all steps required to establish the necessary circumstances to bring the parties together at the negotiating table in accordance with paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration. In that regard, the Government has believed since the ceasefires that the necessary circumstances were in existence but, of course, others have not shared our trust and confidence.  It is in that context that the second track to deal with the decommissioning issue has come into being.</P>
    <P>In parallel with the political track, the Governments have agreed to establish an international body to deal with the decommissioning issue.  Its remit and <Col N="626" /> terms of reference are fully set out in paragraphs 5 to 8 of the Communiqué. Paragraph 8 makes clear that it will be for the international body to determine its own procedures.  That will include the body deciding whom to invite to submit their analysis of matters relevant to the decommissioning issue.  The two Governments expect that the chairman, Senator George Mitchell, and the other two members, General John de Chastelaine and Mr. Harri Holkeri, will consult widely.  We have not placed any restrictions on the body in regard to whom it may consult in order to fulfil its mandate. The Irish Government will, of course, submit its views on the decommissioning issue to the body.</P>
    <P>As the international body will determine its own procedures, it will thus be a matter for it to decide how much publicity to give to its work.  I would encourage all parties to co-operate fully with it and apply themselves with all necessary commitment to the preparatory political talks.  The Governments have not set any limits on the extent to which parties may contribute in either track and we have agreed that we will consider constructively any practicable suggestions that could help to bring all parties into negotiations on the basis of the Downing Street Declaration and we will do so in the light of discussions in the political track.</P>
    <P>The Communiqué has given the peace process the necessary space and momentum.  Everyone concerned, particularly the political parties in Northern Ireland, has responsibilities to build on this opportunity for substantial forward movement.</P>
    <P>Regarding my next meeting with the British Prime Minister, it is likely that I will have discussions with him at the European Council meeting in Madrid on 15 and 16 December.</P>

      <P>I think it is important to study the full text of the statement made by the Ulster Unionist Party.  It is clear it has reservations about discussing certain matters with the Irish Government but has not excluded discussion of other matters.  In a process of this kind it is important to put the accent on the positive elements of the position of any of the relevant parties so that we can move forward rather than seeking to highlight certain negative elements, undoubtedly present, in the approach adopted by the Ulster Unionist Party at this early stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not quite accurate in saying it has ruled out any discussion with the Irish Government, it has ruled out discussion within the terms of the invitation &mdash; as it interprets it &mdash; from the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs who will be replying and who, I believe, will allay some, at least, of the concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to make the point that the first meeting between the leadership of the Ulster Unionist Party and the leadership of an Irish Government took place after a gap of many years and obviously there is ground to be made up in building trust and understanding between the relevant parties.  I believe the Tánaiste's approach and the response of the Ulster Unionist Party, when studied closely, leave room for expanding dialogue within the overall context of the twin track approach between the Irish Government and the Ulster Unionist Party.  I particularly welcome the discussions that took place earlier this week between the Ulster Unionist Party and the SDLP and compliment both parties because it has opened up a new channel of discussion <Col N="628" /> between them which is extremely important and needs to be built upon. It, of course, needs to be reinforced by North-South and east-west contacts.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach not regret the Ulster Unionist Party's refusal to meet the Irish Government? Is it not a serious step backwards from the meetings which the Taoiseach had with Mr. Trimble after his election?  Is it not the position that the preparatory talks outlined in the communiqué cover all strands and that Mr. Trimble is effectively challenging the validity of Strand II?  Assuming there is no misunderstanding, is Mr. Trimble not calling into question the validity of the twin track approach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of the position adopted by Mr. Trimble &mdash; obviously it is better that he should state his own position &mdash; is that he is not willing to discuss Strand I matters with the Irish Government.  The previous Government reluctantly accepted that position in the approach it took to the talks that ended in 1992.  I believe that is still the position of the Ulster Unionist Party but obviously there are very many matters we can discuss with it in Strands II and III.  It has legitimate interests in Strand III, the east-west dimension, and may have constructive ideas to put forward. My view, which I am sure Deputies Bertie Ahern and Harney share, is that it is best to discuss all three strands together because they tend to mutually reinforce one another but at the same time we should not exaggerate the extent of the difficulties that exist.  It appears that the Ulster Unionist Party which previously was unwilling to talk directly to the head of an Irish Government is now willing to talk to an Irish Government, at least on Strands II and III issues.  Hopefully we can expand on that in the process of building trust to include all the relevant relationships.</P>

      <P>It has not appeared to be necessary up to now to seek any such assurance because no such suggestion has been made.  I have, in response to Deputy Harney's question today, indicated my view which is that in matters of sensitivity for either community, the two Governments should act in concert rather than unilaterally.  That is not to say, of course, that both Governments within their own respective spheres of legal competence do not have powers to do certain things, but it is in the exercise of those powers that we need to show a willingness to act in concert.</P>

However, does he agree that unless the Ulster Unionist Party is prepared to accept an Irish dimension &mdash; Strand II &mdash; both for sound economic reasons and as a matter of respect for the Nationalist community, there will be no agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How does the Taoiseach see matters moving, particularly commitments to change the Constitution?  The Downing Street Declaration and the Framework Document are evidence of our bona <Col N="630" /> fides on so many issues.  If Mr. Trimble believes there is no Irish dimension, the Taoiseach should set the other side of the record straight for him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ulster Unionist Party did enter talks on the basis of the statement in the House of Commons by the former Secretary of State, Peter Brooke which involved three strands. By entering into talks on that basis it clearly accepted there was a Strand II, in other words a North-South dimension. Clearly it has different views about the content of Strand II from those of the SDLP, Sinn Féin or the parties in this House but accepts there are three strands to this approach.  While it might wish to add further strands it at least accepts there are three strands to this approach, one of which has a North-South dimension.  It has put forward certain proposals which some Members of this House might not regard as fully adequate, in regard to Strand II, the North-South strand.  Therefore there is not a case to be made that it does not accept the concept of Strand II.  It is simply a question of entering into constructive dialogue with it on those matters to expand its proposals and allay its fears.</P>
      <P>I agree with the implication in the Deputy's question, that the Unionist parties need to be more adventurous and trusting in their approach to all the others who live on this island.  None of us wishes them any ill; all of us wish to build a structure within which we all can live in an atmosphere of justice, peace and respect for our respective allegiances.  It is simply a question of working out together, in conjunction with the British Government, arrangements whereby that objective can be attained.</P>

      <P>While agreeing with an earlier comment made by the Taoiseach &mdash; that wherever and whenever we can we should try to move the peace process forward and endeavour to look at the constructive elements &mdash; it is my duty, as leader of the Opposition, to raise <Col N="631" /> issues that do not appear to be consistent with that line.  Certainly we cannot allow the attitude of the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party &mdash; which appears to be different from that of his predecessor &mdash; go unquestioned, assuming he has some agenda he is not putting forward openly and in respect of which nothing he has said in the past few days has given me or my party any confidence.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that Northern Ireland will never win the support of the Nationalist community as long as the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, or his party members, continue to engage in insulting language <i>vis-a-vis</i> the Irish Government, describing it as a foreign Government contending that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is impudent and using other insulting language, saying they will not engage in any dialogue with the Taoiseach? Does the Taoiseach agree it is simply childish to describe the Anglo-Irish Agreement, registered with the United Nations, as an illegal document? As far as we on this side of the House are concerned Mr. David Trimble is wrong in British law, when he describes the Irish Government as a foreign one &mdash; which fact he should know as a lawyer &mdash; and we can place on record the reasons pointing to his being wrong.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree to all that has been said, since clearly Mr. Trimble does not propose to adhere to the three-strand talks process, will not co-operate in Strand II and has engaged in a barrage of insults about the Irish Government, contending there is no prospect of his engaging in talks?  To be frank, as far as Mr. David Trimble is concerned, to where are the contents of the communiqué moving us?  Would the Taoiseach agree that we have an obligation not to assume that he has some positive contribution to make given what he is saying?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <P>It would be the easiest thing in the world for Members of this House to criticise statements made <Col N="632" /> by the Ulster Unionist Party, pointing to flaws and how it is inconsistent with internationally recognised law and so on.  I would make the point to Members that in the past 70 years we in this House have engaged in this type of dialogue with unionism, when we have been able, at least to our own satisfaction, to &ldquo;win the argument&rdquo; with them.  That type of argument, which frequently involves the two traditions on this island talking past one another rather than talking to one another, is not particularly constructive.  While I would not quarrel with any of the points Deputy Bertie Ahern has made, in terms of their strict truth, they are not ones that advance the position we seek to advance at this time.  We should concentrate on expanding the area of agreement rather than accenting disagreements which undoubtedly exist.</P>
      <P>I have no problem in acknowledging disagreement.  Anybody who watched the press conference given by the British Prime Minister and me in No. 10 Downing Street on 28 November will have recognised that both he and I acknowledged that we disagreed on certain points.  If we spent every day of every week simply reciting our areas of disagreement we would not move very far forward.  In the relationship between Unionists and Nationalists on this island we need to concentrate on expanding the area of agreement.  It is also very important that Unionists should come to recognise that the challenge for them, as Unionists, is not to recite the Unionist case but rather to devise structures for government that can win the allegiance of Nationalists, and the challenge for Nationalists is to devise structures for government that will win the allegiance of Unionists.  It is not a case of either of us reciting the merits of our own case or the demerits of the case on the other side; it is a case of both of us seeking to win the allegiance of the other side.  I say: let there be a context for inclusiveness rather than exclusiveness in this area.</P>

That, at least, caused confusion, as many members of the public having heard that comment believed this Government was not totally committed to Strands II and III. Will the Taoiseach comment on that and reassure the public that he will talk to his Ministers so that one voice will be seen to emanate from this Government, thus abolishing any impression of division within Government?</P>

It is his view, mine and that of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, a reasonable view shared by the Government that such a settlement can be obtained only within the context of a three-strand relationship, in other words, a North-South relationship, an east-west relationship and an internal relationship within Northern Ireland.  Of course one must recognise that, at the end of the day, what all of us are working toward is an arrangement that satisfies both communities in Northern Ireland; that is our view, the wish of the British Government and all the relevant parties.  Within the context of a three-strand approach, we are seeking a settlement that will satisfy the two communities in Northern Ireland.</P>

Does the Taoiseach accept that it is legitimate for us on this side of the House to advance in an honest way the idea that there is disagreement between Mr. Trimble and this side of the House and the people of the South generally?

I certainly do not question the appropriateness of the Deputy raising questions of this kind, nor do I question Deputy Ahern's very careful statement of the number of differences that he has, and which many of us might share, with the position adopted by Mr. <Col N="636" /> Trimble.  My general proposition is that while it is reasonable to make a point as far as these are concerned we should concentrate our efforts on expanding the area of agreement rather than highlighting the area of disagreement. I answered Deputy O Cuív's questions exactly as he put them.  I share his concern in general terms about the position of Irish prisoners in Britain.  Furthermore, I have invited him to come to see me to discuss these matters in greater detail because I acknowledge that he, with Deputy Mary Flaherty, Senator Dan Neville and a number of other Deputies, has taken a particular interest in this issue.  In so far as he mentioned in his questions today a number of specific cases which I have not raised with the British Prime Minister &mdash; I have admitted it freely &mdash; I will be happy to receive briefings from him and raise those through the appropriate channels.</P>

As I have said on a number of occasions, I believe the British Prime Minister is deeply committed to finding a solution to this problem.  Obviously he has entirely valid concerns which he has to take into account which are different from any that I or any Member of this House has. His commitment is undoubted in this area.  While one could be critical of the approach of certain parties in Northern Ireland, they also recognise that, at the end of the day, they have to live with their colleagues of a different religion who share the same streets and townlands with them and that until the people of each tradition come to a political accommodation with the people of the other tradition, they will not feel fully secure and safe, nor will their children or grandchildren.  Everybody realises now that there is an opportunity between now and the end of February which all must seize.  I urge everybody in Northern Ireland, whatever their political persuasion and however strong their previous political convictions have been, to make a move towards the other side, not to be the last but rather the first to make a concession to a contrary point of view as far as this issue is concerned. I know the entire House supports me in expressing that sentiment.</P>

There is a North-South dimension and I point that out to the Unionists and others as often as is necessary.  There must be a North-South dimension and it must have substance if both communities in Northern Ireland, particularly the Nationalist community, are to feel that they are being governed under an arrangement which respects their allegiances and traditions.  However, it equally behoves those of the Nationalist tradition, wherever they live, to understand that the Unionists have a strong sense of British allegiance which must also be respected.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that making progress on the prisoners' issue has been like trying to pull elephant's teeth?  Has he been given any indication or assurances by the British Prime Minister that there will be a radical change of policy in relation to prisoners because no response has been forthcoming to date?  I accept that the Taoiseach made a representation but there seems to be no general response on the question of prisoners.  Can the Taoiseach give us more information as to the assurances or indications he has been given on this matter?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in response to the Deputy's earlier question, I discussed many of these matters with the British Prime Minister.  I raised the question of Mr. Kelly as well as remissions, conditions in prisons, visiting provisions and all related matters when I met the Prime Minister in Majorca.  We had quite a substantial discussion on the matter and he listened very carefully to what I said.  There has been movement since then on a number of those points including remissions and the position of certain prisoners with particular difficulties who wished to be transferred back to Ireland.  Of course there is room for further movement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the tremendous hardship involved in being in prison.  No matter how heinous one's offence, imprisonment is a serious penalty but it is worse if one is imprisoned far from one's family and friends because of the cost involved in visiting.  I raised that issue quite strongly with the British Prime Minister and will use every reasonable opportunity to do so. <Col N="640" /> One must recognise that there is a sensitivity in any area of imprisonment. The question of imprisonment was raised earlier on the Order of Business when the perspective of victims was mentioned in the context of the length of sentences.  Victims exist in all jurisdictions, not just in Ireland.  We must be mindful of the sensitivities of victims whether they reside in Britain or Ireland.  There is not just a sense of being a victim because one is Irish. Many British people feel they were victims of problems in the past.  While one could never advance that as justification for anything other than compassionate treatment of prisoners, one must also recognise that there is a balance of concerns here.  While I commend Deputy Ó Cuív for the work he is doing, I urge him and others to take the opportunity when in Britain to have discussions with people who may be representative of those who have been victims of crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It has, but I worry when I hear the Tánaiste saying he feels that Mr. Trimble may have taken him up wrongly. In the statement of aims policy document approved by the Ulster Unionist Party last week Mr. Trimble said he agreed that what he was doing was reducing the three-strand talks concept to just two-one concerning internal Northern Ireland relationships and the other concerning relationships between the UK and Northern Ireland.  He went on to say that he always believed the three strands were artificial and that we should only have two strands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach will take the opportunity to assure the House that the Tánaiste, in his reply to Mr. Trimble, will mention that the Irish Government does not accept that.  The Ulster <Col N="641" /> Unionist Party stated quite publicly last week that it now sees the process as being two stranded.  Mr. Trimble's reply to the Tánaiste is a direct challenge &mdash; being diplomatic, the Taoiseach may not want to acknowledge it &mdash; to the three strand process for which we negotiated long and hard.  I ask the Taoiseach to assure the House that the issue will be clarified in the Tánaiste's letter.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the following area of agreement.  The motivation for the proposal is presented by Mr. Trimble as being compatible with a North-South and east-west dimension and a means of overcoming the decommissioning roadblock.  Those two reasons have been advanced by Mr. Trimble in favour of his proposal and are ones with which I agree.  I acknowledge however that there are serious reservations about the proposal on the part of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also acknowledge that there is a risk, which I believe could be overcome, that this could be interpreted as approaching <Col N="643" /> the matter in terms of an internal settlement. I do not believe an internal settlement will work and is the proper approach.  We need a three-strand approach.  Any initiative of the kind suggested by Mr. Trimble should properly be discussed by him and his party with the SDLP and the other parties in Northern Ireland.  They can then reach an agreement on the best way to proceed rather than passing one unilateral resolution, however well founded.</P>

      <P>The Unionist parties represent a majority of the people in Northern Ireland.  All the people in Northern Ireland have benefited enormously from peace.  They have an opportunity to live normal lives, attract investment and tourism on a scale previously unthought of.  There is a heavy responsibility on those representing the majority and minority in Northern Ireland to do everything possible within their power to guarantee not just the continuance of peace in the form of an absence of violence but a true reconciliation between the two communities in Northern Ireland so that there will be an atmosphere that will attract more investment and tourism and release the untapped resources of initiative within the people which the division in Northern Ireland has prevented them from expressing fully.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach and I am sure he will agree that we need to clarify where both sides stand.  It is no good thinking there is agreement where there is clearly major disagreement.  Last weekend Fianna Fáil congratulated the Government and welcomed the fact that the peace process was moving forward.  We made some critical remarks about the communiqué. In particular I was unhappy with the last sentence of paragraph 3 which stated that the preparatory talks may also extend to all steps required to establish the necessary circumstances to bring the parties together at the negotiating table in accordance with paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration.  We regard that sentence, which is a change from the Downing Street Declaration, as a serious diplomatic blunder.</P>
      <P>Paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration states that the two Governments alone are the judges of whether the conditions in paragraph 10 are fulfilled. The position of the Irish Government has always been that they were. That has been the position for the last 15 months, certainly since the Forum was established.  Not only does the Taoiseach appear to side with the British position that the requirements of paragraph 10 are not satisfied but it is in breach of the Downing Street Declaration by allowing other parties, especially the Ulster Unionist Party and DUP, to judge whether Sinn Féin is complying with paragraph 10.  Does this not open the way for indefinite stalling on the position?  It was quite clear in the Downing Street Declaration that the British and Irish Governments would judge where and when people were accepted to participate in democratic talks.  Now the Taoiseach has brought in people who in our view are unlikely ever to agree to Sinn Féin's mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident that there are divided opinions in Northern Ireland between the political parties on <Col N="645" /> whether certain parties have met the conditions of paragraph 10. They have a legitimate right to express those opinions.  Where better to do so than in the political track so that they can give their opinion to the two Governments? The Deputy is correct that the two Governments have the final say in the matter.  They have set themselves the firm aim of starting talks by the end of February.  That is stated in the communique. It is reasonable that in the lead up to the end of February the two Governments should be able to hear, in the political track, the views of all parties in Northern Ireland on whether all the other parties have complied with paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration.  I remind the Deputy that I did not invent paragraph 10.  It was agreed by my predecessor.</P>

      <P>Is the Taoiseach satisfied, given the information released in the House of Lords last night about punishment beatings, that Sinn Féin and the other political allies of paramilitary organisations are doing everything they can to bring punishment beatings to an end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that on Monday, 21 November 1994 the Sinn Féin president, Mr. Gerry Adams, called for an end to all IRA punishment beatings.  It is very important that he should continue to say this.  Those who have influence over loyalist para-militaries should do likewise.  This is a barbaric practice and an attempt to interfere with normal legal processes in Northern Ireland.  It represents an attempt to intimidate people in their daily lives and is a form of arbitrary justice which has nothing to do with any reasonable concept of either republicanism or loyalism.  The concept of a republic is based on equality before the law.  There is no equality before the law as long as punishment beatings occur. Loyalism is based on loyalty to the British constitution.  That constitution also encompasses the idea of equality before <Col N="646" /> the law.  To condone punishment beatings is entirely contradictory to a true understanding of loyalism or Unionism. Punishment beatings are an aberration and an appalling practice.  They have no place in a democracy and are inconsistent with democratic politics.  I welcome the fact that Gerry Adams has so firmly condemned them on behalf of Sinn Féin.  In many cases these actions are taken on a freelance basis.  I cannot say for certain that they all are but many are not undertaken with the support of any organisation.  I urge those with influence in the areas where these are occurring, whatever political party they may belong to, to use that influence to stop them and bring the perpetrators to the notice of the relevant authorities.</P>

Paragraph 3 removes paragraph 10 from the position it occupied for the last year and moves it to one where Unionists have a veto.  That is how it is interpreted.

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 14, 20, 21, 26, 29, 35 and 62 together.</P>
      <P>I am naturally pleased that, in the referendum of 24 November last, the people voted in favour of the proposal that those who experience the trauma of marriage breakdown should have the right to divorce and remarry within this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>Those of us who have the good fortune to be in happy marriages can only guess at the feelings of separated people who wish to have ended a marriage that is well and truly dead and, in some cases, have legal status given to a second relationship which has, until now, been denied recognition within our society.</P>
      <P>There were many who assisted in the realisation of this result, both in this House and outside it, and I want to take the opportunity to thank them for their efforts.  Leaders on all sides of the House showed the courage to seek to shape public opinion and argue the case for a more inclusive society.  Throughout the country, individuals and groups campaigned passionately for change and gave freely of their time in so doing.  By our combined efforts, we ensured that there were few in this country who remained indifferent to the issues and, when polling day arrived, people were very conscious that each individual vote mattered and was of significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity to say my belief that the result vindicated the Government's approach in putting before the people a proposal which enshrined in the Constitution the conditions upon which a divorce would be granted.  For many, this was the necessary safeguard which enabled them to <Col N="652" /> vote yes since they could be sure that the fundamental law governing divorce could be changed only if the people willed it.</P>
    <P>I intend to advance the Family Law (Divorce) Bill with all possible speed although, as Deputies will appreciate, the fact that the referendum result is now the subject of a legal challenge may impact upon my intended timetable. While I acknowledge the right of individuals to institute such a challenge, it raises the possibility of a period of uncertainty before it is clearly determined whether the Government can go ahead and introduce the legislation which is a necessary prelude to the introduction of divorce here.  It would be improper of me to comment further on this matter but it is my strong hope that the referendum result will stand.</P>
    <P>The concerns of those who voted no in the referendum will not be ignored. In many cases, their vote reflected deeply-rooted fears about the effect divorce would have on family life and worry about the likely financial position of vulnerable spouses and children.  I hope the legislation which the Government is committed to introducing will serve to allay some of those fears and worries.  In that context, I would of course be happy to consider any submissions interested parties might wish to make on matters related to that legislation.</P>
    <P>I would also like to emphasise again the commitment of this Government to support both marriage and the family. A Commission on the Family was appointed in October last to make recommendations on how families can best be facilitated in the support and development of their individual members and that commission has been asked to make its final report to the Government by June 1997.  Its conclusions will help us to deal with the needs of families in a rapidly changing social and economic environment.</P>
    <P>With regard to the five year strategic action plan proposed by Fianna Fáil, I am not in a position to go beyond what I have already said in this House in reply to questions on 25 October last, <Col N="653" /> namely, that its recommendations will be examined carefully within my Department.  However, many aspects of the plan are already in the course of implementation.  For example, significant improvements have been made in counselling and mediation services in recent years.  My main concern is to ensure that the welfare of spouses and children caught up in marriage breakdown is protected and it may well be that our focus should be on developing existing structures rather than on embracing rather sweeping plans which, in essence, turn out to be little more than old ideas dressed up in new clothing.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods also asks how the integrity of a farm or business can be maintained in the event of divorce and how this will operate in practice.  I can only say that the provisions intended to govern this matter are contained in the draft Family Law (Divorce) Bill and these are substantially the same as those which now apply in the case of judicial separation.  The courts have a wide range of options at their disposal when it comes to regulating these matters and I would not propose to interfere with their broad discretion in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his extensive reply which covered many of the current issues.  Those who voted in the referendum want an action plan to support families, irrespective of the outcome of the court case.  The Minister would like to assume that the people have spoken and that their decision stands, but it is important to produce a plan of action to be implemented immediately to provide support for families along the lines suggested earlier.  It should provide, for example, for the appointment of a commissioner for children to be attached to the courts and additional family court judges.  The Minister failed to mention that an additional 17 judges are being appointed.  Will he, at least, give an assurance that actions such as these will be taken immediately and that the matter will not be put on the long finger?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="654" /> I was slightly concerned when the Minister mentioned the provision of support for the family in the context of the conclusions of the Commission on the Family which is due to report by June 1997 at the latest.  A great deal of water will flow under the bridge in the meantime.  While I am sure that will be an excellent and valuable report there is a need to take the actions which we know are necessary and may be taken in the meantime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Every possible action will be taken to support the family.  The important steps which have been taken will be underpinned and strengthened. These include the extension of marriage counselling and mediation services, free legal aid, social welfare supports and the appointment of additional judges the legislation for which is being drafted. The final report of the Law Reform Commission in connection with family courts is due for publication shortly and will receive the urgent attention of the Government as soon as it is published.</P>
      <P>The proposal that a commissioner for children should be appointed is being examined in the Department and will be considered if it is found to be a useful additional weapon in the interests of children.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on the hard work he did to ensure a successful conclusion to the referendum campaign.  Does he agree that there are many lessons to be learned the first of which, highlighted by the campaign waged against it, is that there was a dearth of information?  This allowed those campaigning for a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote to disseminate misinformation.  This matter needs to be considered immediately to ensure the public is made aware of the services available through the Civil Legal Aid Board and the provisions of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act.  I hope the Domestic Violence Bill will be passed by the Seanad before Christmas.  What plans does the Minister have to extend the counselling <Col N="655" /> and mediation services currently available? It is not appropriate to await the conclusions of the Commission on the Family which is not due to report until June 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of the Government awaiting the report of the Commission on the Family.  It did not await the establishment of the commission, it has been working for the past year, and its predecessor for the previous two, to make major improvements in all areas to provide support for the family.  These include the extension of marriage counselling services, the funding for which was substantially increased in the past three years enabling the marriage counselling agencies to institute new programmes, particularly in the area of pre-marriage counselling, and extend their services throughout the country.  ACCORD in particular is doing remarkable work nationally with the aid of increased funding made available by the Government and its predecessor.  The same applies in the case of mediation and free legal aid services.  This work is ongoing and will be strengthened in every possible way.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Keogh that there are lessons to be learned from the referendum campaign.  The first lesson that the Deputy and her party may have learned is that it was important to write the conditions into the Constitution. That was universally regarded as a key and important matter during the course of the campaign.</P>
      <P>The question of information has to be addressed with great care.  The Government did its utmost to disseminate information in every way possible.  Some aspects are now the subject of a legal challenge.  Although the overwhelming bulk of the material circulated provided information about judicial separation, counselling and mediation services and all aspects of family law, there is always a demand for more information and every way open to the Government to disseminate it will be used.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13, 15, 23, 41, 46 and 47 together.</P>
      <P>I intend to bring forward two pieces of anti-discrimination legislation &mdash; the Employment Equality Bill dealing with discrimination in the workplace and the Equal Status Bill covering non-employment areas.  Both Bills will prohibit discrimination in their respective areas on the grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, colour, nationality, national or ethnic origin and membership of the travelling community.</P>
      <P>The Equal Status Bill is now being prepared and I hope to bring it forward in 1996.  Any relevant recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities will, when available, be considered in the finalisation of that legislation.</P>
      <P>There has been considerable consultation on the proposed Equal Status Bill and a discussion paper was circulated to 80 outside bodies in July 1993.  Among the bodies in the service sector with which I or my officials have had meetings in relation to this Bill are the Irish Business and Employers' Confederation, Irish Insurance Federation, Licensed Vintners' Association, Vintners' Federation of Ireland and Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.  When the Equal Status Bill has been approved by the Government and published, there will be an opportunity to debate how relevant issues should be addressed.</P>
      <P>I would like to draw the Deputies' attention to the following passage from the report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While legislation alone will not put an end to the discrimination faced by the traveller community, it will make an essential contribution to this task. It will provide a catalyst for changing the context within which conflicts and stereotypes are generated.  It will give travellers a legal means of redress against discrimination.  It will be a statement of significant weight from <Col N="658" /> Government of the travellers' status in Irish society and of the unacceptability of discrimination.  In the Irish context, it is important that equal status legislation in specifying its protection of ethnic groups would also specifically name the traveller community as being protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister confirm that the insurance industry has been given a guarantee that it will be granted an exemption on economic grounds and, if so, has he considered exempting the licensed trade which argues that the Bill may in practice be unworkable and create great difficulties for publicans given that they have to maintain an orderly house, deal with those who distribute drugs, troublemakers and those who have had too much to drink?  The trade should produce its own proposals to deal with the problems involved.  It seems that the Minister's proposals would prove to be unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that a guarantee has been given to any organisation or body in connection with the equal status legislation.  The equal status legislation heads were approved by the previous Government, of which Deputy Woods was a member and no one knows its broad parameters better than him.  When the Bill is published, and the particular conditions formulated, there will be time for discussion on this matter. Any steps that the vintners or anyone else might take in the interim, to alleviate complaints in areas of discrimination, would be welcome and helpful in making progress on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Woods discusses exempting groupings, what is the connotation of his argument?  Does an exemption mean granting a licence to discriminate? If all parties in the House wish to introduce legislation to outlaw discrimination in certain circumstances, that is a worthwhile and necessary objective.  It is the policy of the Government &mdash; and of the previous administration which adopted the draft legislation.  Exactly how it will be achieved, and within what <Col N="659" /> parameters, is a matter for detailed discussion. The House will have every opportunity to debate the matter in due course.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that all sides of the House will support the elimination of discrimination.  When one approaches the detail of achieving this &mdash; under one Bill, for example people are commanded, at the risk of losing their licence, to maintain an orderly house &mdash; we must inquire how it might be accomplished with the type of proposals put forward by the Minister. The Minister raised the question of travelling people.  As I understand it, the issue in relation to travelling people represents a proportionately small percentage of the problems most people in the licensed trade, supermarkets and various other areas have with the Minister's proposals.  Far greater problems are being experienced with the current levels of shoplifting in supermarkets and stores.  The security industry is experiencing difficulty in maintaining security in these areas.  They can, however, pinpoint people about to break into cars.</P>
      <P>The way the system works at present is that thieves are identified by means of video equipment.  Proposals have been put forward to place cameras on the main streets of our cities to identify people about to, or likely to, commit offences.  These people could be moved on by the relevant authorities in the interests of maintaining order.  Supermarket owners and managers are very concerned about this issue.  I believe the Minister could find a practical, workable solution to this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's contribution was more of a statement than a question.  However, the legislation will contain nothing to inhibit a commercial firm from excluding shoplifters, troublemakers, drug dealers, etc., from their premises.  The legislation will have no impact on that kind of situation.</P>

    <Title>Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.  The thrust of the Bill is to prepare the VHI for the Single Market and to update the legislation by which it is governed.</P>
      <P>Our private medical insurance market is undergoing considerable change at present arising from implementation of the EU's Third Non-Life Insurance Directive, which is intended to create a single market in insurance.  The Directive permits an undertaking, once authorised in a member state, to sell insurance in another member state on an establishment basis or by way of freedom of services throughout the Community.</P>
      <P>The implementation of the Directive at national level here took the form of the enactment of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, which sets down the regulatory framework within which the private health insurance business would operate and develop.  It enshrined in law certain principles which had distinguished our system and had served our people well over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> Under the Act a health insurance undertaking has to comply, <i>inter alia,</i> with the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover. Accordingly, the Act ensured that the public will continue to benefit from those attributes inherent in the system and applied over almost 40 years with very positive effect.  These guiding principles have kept private medical insurance within the reach of the ordinary person and particularly those who are vulnerable to being priced out of a risk-rated system, such as the elderly and chronically ill.  I am fully committed to preserving this highly equitable and successful system in the interests of all our people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the possible advent of competition into the private medical insurance market.  It will reshape and enliven the business of health insurance, particularly in terms of the marketing, design and choice of products.  It will provide an inherent impetus for development and improvement in the provision of services to the public. However, there is nothing to suggest that the opening of the market will necessarily produce lower premiums; the fundamental problem here is the ever increasing rise in medical costs which is faced universally by Governments and insurance companies.  It may be that undertakings will tend to compete more on services and products than on price.</P>
    <P>Companies which have considered entering the market here are awaiting completion of the health insurance regulatory framework in the form of regulations under the 1994 Act, before finally deciding on the matter.  I hope to be in a position to sign the health insurance regulations shortly.  With the implementation of the provisions in this Bill, the VHI, with its extensive knowledge and experience of the Irish market, should be better placed to meet the challenge of competition.</P>
    <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board was established, and currently <Col N="707" /> operates, under the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957.  While the scale and extent of the VHI's operations has massively progressed over almost 40 years since its establishment there has not been any parallel or complementary progress in the legislation by which it is governed.  The operation of the 1957 Act has seen the VHI develop in a way that reflected a highly protected market. It has nevertheless provided a solid service and has been responsive to public need through the provision of an extensive protection to its members against the cost of hospitalisation for serious injury or illness.  It has been particularly successful in achieving and retaining such a high proportion of our population in private medical insurance.</P>
    <P>Even when one allows for the special market conditions prevailing in the past, it remains a worthy and laudable achievement that the VHI's membership has increased up to the point where it covers over one-third of our population. A debt of gratitude is owed to the VHI for the service it has done in pioneering the concept of private medical insurance and expanding its boundaries with such great effect among our people.  However, with the advent of an open market, the VHI will have to develop and vigorously maintain those characteristics which define a successful commercial undertaking, such as a strong marketing focus, dynamic product development and adaptability to change.  It must therefore shift radically from the somewhat mechanistic organisation it grew to become in what was a highly stable environment.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House for consideration represents a significant step in the process of modernising the basis on which the VHI performs the very important function of making available private health insurance to a significant proportion of our population. It will strengthen the position of the VHI in a number of key respects which I will elaborate on in the course of this statement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> In the context of understanding the principles underlying the Bill, it is useful and relevant to consider, briefly, the origins of the VHI.  Its establishment was recommended by an advisory body on the Voluntary Health Insurance scheme which reported to the Minister for Health in 1956.  The key objective set for it was to provide insurance against the cost of major and unforeseeable medical costs in circumstances where a large percentage of the population was not eligible for public health services.  The VHI was established under the umbrella of the State &mdash; as a not-for-profit body &mdash; because at the time the private sector appeared unwilling or unable to operate a scheme of voluntary health insurance.</P>
    <P>The 1957 Act provided that anyone wishing to engage in the business of making available private health insurance in the State had to obtain a licence from the Minister for Health and the operation of this provision over the years saw the VHI develop as the main provider of private health insurance to the public, apart from some occupational-vocational based schemes.  The growth of the VHI has been such that its membership now comprises 1.3 million people or 35 per cent of the population.</P>
    <P>Measured in terms of retained premium income, the VHI is now the second largest commercial insurance operation in the Irish market.  The change in scale of the VHI's operations can be readily seen when one compares some of its current key financial indicators to those of 15 years ago.  In 1980 it had a subscription income of £25.2 million and claims of £19.6 million.  The corresponding figures for 1995 are £232.6 million and £233.1 million.</P>
    <P>During the 1980s the VHI experienced considerable cost pressures due to a number of inter-related factors such as high out-patient claims; rapidly rising in-patient hospital charges; increased claims payments due to steeply rising volumes; major new facilities coming on stream and declining investment income.  In 1988-89 the VHI incurred operating deficits of between £11 million and £12 million which necessitated <Col N="709" /> the implementation of a programme of financial recovery.  This was successful in arresting the adverse trend in the organisation's finances but necessitated the reduction of benefits available to members and increases in premiums.</P>
    <P>While the VHI's financial position is not so precarious as it was at the end of the 1980s, it must strive towards significant improvement particularly as regards enhancing its reserves.  While the board recorded a small operational surplus in its accounts for the year ended February last, the continuing underlying trading position gives cause for some concern.  In common with health insurers generally, cost containment is a perennial problem for the VHI.  Excluding high out-patient claims, which were controlled by reducing benefits in that area, the factors previously mentioned which drive cost increases are still very much in evidence. There is also a heightened expectation on the part of the members for ready access to health care services which are ever-increasing in sophistication. In addition to this the VHI has an ageing membership profile which generates greater demands for health services, particularly those services which are covered by the VHI.</P>
    <P>VHI has played a very significant role in the development of health services in Ireland.  Its contribution towards maintaining the public-private mix has been fundamental to the growth of health services. Ireland has benefited from an overall system which has provided a vigorous private sector and has created an environment whereby consultants provide service on the public hospital site not only for their own private patients but also for public patients.  Both the public and the private sector benefits from the mix allowing for greater co-operation and collaboration in the provision of the best possible service to patients.</P>
    <P>The considerable degree of interdependence between those involved in the delivery of health services represents fertile ground on which to improve relationships and develop consensus. <Col N="710" /> The health strategy document recognised the potential to foster understanding between the various healthcare sectors through the exchange of information, the co-ordination of approaches and the maintenance of uniform standards.  A Healthcare Consultative Forum was identified as the vehicle to tackle these objectives.  I will make arrangements in the new year to establish the forum as it holds the potential to positively influence the understandings and approaches on which the future delivery of our health services will be based.  The VHI has a significant contribution to make to this process.</P>
    <P>The VHI is going through a period of significant change.  In 1994 the VHI review group established by the then Minister for Health, Deputy Brendan Howlin, reported on the strategic and operational capacity of the VHI in the context of the changing market environment. The group identified and recommended the clear need for radical change in the VHI's business culture and approach.</P>
    <P>It identified the appointment of a chief executive who could provide leadership and who would be allowed the freedom to transform the organisation and its business culture to one of innovation, imagination and customer responsiveness as the key element in initiating and sustaining a process of change within the organisation.  It laid emphasis on the fact that it regarded the appointment of a chief executive with the requisite experience and qualities as central to the entire thrust of what it considered should be done to effect improvements in the VHI.  Mr. Brian Duncan, formerly of Irish Life plc., was appointed chief executive of the VHI last February.</P>
    <P>The chief executive's appointment has in turn promoted further change in terms of a revamping of the structure of the VHI's top level management and candidates to fill four new director posts &mdash; sales and marketing, operations, finance and business development &mdash; have <Col N="711" /> been sought by means of public advertisement. These initiatives are clear evidence of the drive towards heightening the business orientation of the VHI which is fundamental to it operating effectively and successfully in a competitive environment.</P>
    <P>The review group also recommended that the board of the VHI be enlarged in order that it would comprise skills and experience commensurate with those of a modern major commercial insurance undertaking.  Provision to enable enhancement of the board is being made in the Bill.  I am not, however, at this stage addressing in the Bill the review group's recommendation about changing the corporate status of the VHI to that of a limited company with a 100 per cent State shareholding. I will set out later my position regarding this recommendation and my reasons for not embarking on a conversion of corporate status at this time.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier our health services constitute a mix of private and public care.  Obviously, the VHI, both in terms of its size of membership and annual financial outlay, is a major stakeholder in our healthcare system.  The role played by the VHI over the years, as the private health insurer, has served to support the essential balance between public and private medicine which is at the very core of access to, and quality of, healthcare in our closely integrated system.  Consequently, the Minister has maintained a broad practical interest in the strategies and policies devised by the VHI.  In addition to this the Minister is the 100 per cent shareholder by virtue of which he or she has a duty to be satisfied as to the financial well-being of the VHI and that it is publicly accountable in the performance of its statutory functions.  Clearly, this latter dimension involves the Minister in such matters as determining membership of the board and ensuring that the business of the VHI is being well handled, including premium or product changes.  However, it does not involve the Minister in operational matters or <Col N="712" /> the board's day-to-day management and commercial decisions.  Both in terms of the shareholding position and the impact of private health insurance on the health services generally, the Minister's relationship with the VHI is very much concerned with the broad thrust of its proposals.  It is not my intention that there should be any greater degree of involvement by my Department in the affairs of the VHI than there has been up to now.</P>
    <P>Given what I have said, it is vital that the VHI becomes a more market driven organisation which welcomes change and adapts to new challenges including competition.  It must also be equipped legislatively to control its costs and claims experience and have a board which can, with a greater range of expertise, fully act on behalf of subscribers.</P>
    <P>The Bill will support the VHI's efforts in the exercise of cost containment.  It is imperative to the retention of the system of mixed public and private healthcare that private medical insurance features strongly in how services are funded.  Rapidly rising claims costs, reflecting increased medical costs and greater volumes, mean higher premiums which in turn exert a squeeze on the number who are able to afford cover.  This is what happened in Australia where the upward pressure on premiums forced many, particularly the young whose participation is vital to a community-rated system, out of medical insurance cover.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the main provisions of the Bill.  Section 2 deals with arrangements with providers.  The first of these concerns schemes of voluntary health insurance contained in that section.  This replaces section 4 of the 1957 Act but retains the provision that defines the VHI as a &ldquo;not-for-profit&rdquo; body which has served the Irish people so well. Under the new section a significant omission from the provisions of the 1957 Act is being addressed.  This involves the board being given specific powers in relation to making arrangements with health service providers who make <Col N="713" /> available treatment and care to its members.  The 1957 Act did not deal with this important aspect of the board's operations.  Accordingly, a gap has existed in its capacity to arrange for the delivery of quality healthcare at sustainable cost to its subscribers.  The VHI is therefore being given explicit powers relating to the making of arrangements with health service providers for the care and treatment of its members.</P>
    <P>What is intended is that the VHI should be put on a footing corresponding to that of commercial enterprises generally in the conduct of its business arrangements with providers.  It is critical that the VHI have these powers as otherwise it will have no basis in law on which to make prudent cost containment measures.</P>
    <P>It is in the interests of the members of the VHI that it should have powers to contain costs as failure to do so could quickly lead to premium levels escalating beyond the reach of most.  Health insurers worldwide are constantly struggling to contain costs and it is unacceptable that the VHI would be expected to operate in a vacuum where the issue is one that could jeopardise its very survival.  Clearly, there is a common interest between provider and health insurer as regards the optimum provision of services to the member patient.  In that context there is no reason providers and insurance companies would not be prepared to be transparent and accountable about the services they provide.  Providers' interests are closely intertwined with the continued existence of a strong private health insurance market.  In the financial year ending February 1995 the VHI paid out £107 million to private hospitals and £60.3 million in respect of consultants' fees.  The amount paid out to public hospitals in the year was £57.2 million &mdash; giving a total payout of £224.5 million to hospitals and in respect of consultants' fees.  Developments in other countries show an acceptance on the part of providers and insurers to work together in taking new approaches <Col N="714" /> to how care and treatment are delivered.</P>
    <P>Section 2 also makes provision for the VHI to undertake schemes of health-related insurance which will give it wide flexibility for innovation in the product design area.  Traditionally, the VHI provided schemes which specifically indemnify the member, in whole or in part, against actual medical costs incurred in the treatment of injury, disease or illness.  The success of the VHI in terms of its market penetration of 35 per cent of the population, as against 12 per cent approximately of those with private medical insurance in the United Kingdom, can be partly attributed to the medical indemnity product it provides. This is indicative of the sense of security and reassurance it offers the insured person against the uncertainties of serious illness and injury.  While this will remain the VHI's core business, it needs to have the capacity to compete against companies which are offering forms of cash based insurance such as hospital cash.</P>
    <P>The Bill will enable the VHI to develop diverse packages of insurance, in the form of a combination of indemnity and cash cover, thereby putting it in a position to be more responsive to the needs of its members and the market generally.  A key target constituency for new products should be young people and the VHI will be able to tailor packages to attract them into private health insurance.  Their participation is vital to the maintenance of a strong community rated system.  The Bill provides that schemes of health insurance shall be subject to the consent of the Minister.  I am certainly favourably disposed towards supporting the VHI in developing attractive and imaginative products aimed at enhancing its membership and revenue position; however, indemnity insurance will continue to be the main business of VHI.</P>
    <P>The Bill is about empowering the VHI to adopt and pursue a more commercial approach to how it does its business. That having been said there is <Col N="715" /> another dimension which cannot be overlooked.  This concerns my position as Minister with a 100 per cent shareholding in the VHI.  In that context I am accountable to the Oireachtas and, therefore, must have an input into the policy and strategic considerations of the VHI, and all other bodies under my aegis, in order to satisfy myself as to the appropriateness and soundness of any particular direction being taken.</P>
    <P>Section 3 puts on a formal footing the practice which has operated until now whereby the VHI consulted the Minister in regard to proposed premium increases.  The section now places a duty of notification on the board; it provides that the board can apply increases automatically after a specified short period has elapsed unless the Minister expressly issues a reasoned direction against implementation of the increases. It is entirely appropriate that the Minister should have the capacity to have some real input in relation to premium increases which can impact on 1.3 million of our population.  The fact that the VHI has a near monopoly in the market means that it is in order for the Minister to reserve the power to intervene should circumstances warrant.</P>
    <P>The VHI review group considered it appropriate for premium levels to be subject to regulatory approval for so long as the VHI continues to enjoy a virtual monopoly of the health insurance market.  The response by the Minister to notification of proposed premium increases under the section will be prompt.  In effect, this section brings clarity and structure to an informal arrangement that has been based more on custom and practice in the past.</P>
    <P>Section 4 recognises the widely accepted view that the size of the board needs to be expanded.  The limit of not more than five members imposed under the 1957 Act has outlined its relevance in terms of the contemporary needs of a national commercial undertaking.  Formerly, the board had the luxury of presiding over a State monopoly in a stable market.  As the trading environment has <Col N="716" /> become more demanding, complex and volatile over time, especially with the opening of the market to competition, the board must change with the times and circumstances.  Section 4 provides for the size of the board to be extended to not more than 12 members.  It will therefore be possible for me, as Minister, to ensure that there is available at board level the depth and range of knowledge and experience appropriate to the modern VHI.  It is my intention that the board's composition should reflect the level of skills and expertise appropriate to that of a major commercial insurance undertaking.  It is also, in my view, desirable that it should have an effective consumer input.  There have been recent developments in regard to the consumers role and I will refer to these later.</P>
    <P>Section 4 also provides that the number of board members who are health service providers is to be limited to two persons.  Subject to the provisions of the law, it is the prerogative of the Minister to select board members.  While the VHI is about the business of healthcare, it is first and foremost an insurance undertaking.  The skills and expertise it needs to thrive are those relevant to the insurance sector generally &mdash; actuarial, financial and marketing &mdash; as well as expertise in the healthcare industry. Against this background, I am satisfied that the law should place an acceptable upper limit on the number of board members who come from a provider background.  I want to make it clear that those from a provider background, employer or medical, who have served on the board have done so always with the best interests of VHI members and subscribers central to their contributions and actions.  It is not in question that a person's health service expertise and specific knowledge of the area enables him or her to make a valid and positive contribution to the work of the board.  The issue is rather one of the appropriate balance to be struck in providing the VHI with the composition of skills and expertise at board level which will best serve the organisation's needs. <Col N="717" /> I consider that not more than two persons who are health service providers out of not more than 12 members overall represents an appropriate balance.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate at this point to place on record the debt of gratitude which is owed to board members, past and present, who have worked so selflessly for the betterment of the organisation and in the interests of its members. Their contribution is one of distinction and honour in giving generously of their time and energy for the public good. One must also recognise the very great and effective input which the members of staff of the VHI make to the organisation on an on-going basis.  Their industriousness, commitment and dedication is certainly one of the strong cards the VHI holds in whatever competitive battles may lie ahead.  It is a great credit to the organisation that, at 6 per cent of premium income, the VHI's administrative costs stand very favourably in comparison to those of other like companies.</P>
    <P>Section 5 gives a statutory basis to the position of the chief executive of the VHI and in so doing underlines the crucial leadership role attaching to the position which the VHI review group regarded as vital to effecting change in the organisation.  As I said, the group identified the chief executive as a key agent of change and set out principles under which the chief executive should have total responsibility for the efficient direction of all operations.  The Bill provides that the chief executive, under the authority of the board, will be the person responsible for carrying on and managing and controlling generally the administration and business of the VHI. The Bill puts the chief executive on a par with counterparts in other commercial bodies in terms of carrying through the task of effecting and managing change for the good of the organisation.</P>
    <P>Section 6 relates to the conditions which will apply where a board member or a member of VHI staff is nominated or elected to membership of either House of the Oireachtas or of the European Parliament.  It supersedes section 9 <Col N="718" /> of the 1957 Act which dealt with Oireachtas membership only.</P>
    <P>Section 7 relates to the terms and conditions of service of members of staff of the VHI.  It obliges the board to have regard to prevailing Government policy or nationally agreed guidelines in determining the remuneration or allowances to be paid to staff.  This is now a standard provision in the legislation of such bodies.</P>
    <P>Section 8 provides for a prohibition on the unauthorised disclosure of information. This recognises the sensitive nature of the information which the VHI holds, both in terms of the business of health service providers and the health of individuals.  It prohibits the disclosure of confidential information unless duly authorised by the board. This also reflects the need to protect commercially important information in a new and competitive market environment. The prohibition applies not only to board members and the staff of VHI, but also to those who act as consultants and advisers to the organisation.</P>
    <P>Section 9, which replaces section 21 of the 1957 Act, enhances the accountability of the board to the Minister by reference to the information which it is obliged to furnish at his or her request. It does not however require the board to make available information about an individual member of the VHI or a particular health service provider.</P>
    <P>This represents the first Bill prepared in relation to the VHI since it foundation. It has been welcomed as effecting essential amendments to the 1957 Act and as a valuable start in the process of legislative change governing the VHI.  It has been said, however, that the Bill should deal with such matters as exempting health insurance from the scope of competition law, changing the corporate status of the VHI and providing specifically for a consumer input into the operations of the VHI.  I wish to address these aspects of the matter and inform the House of my position in relation to each of them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="719" /> The application of competition law, which reflects the position in European law, is a key economic policy of Government which cannot be set aside in respect of any one sector of business activity.  The exemption of health insurance from the scope of the Competition Act, 1991 would have a detrimental effect on the integrity of the Act. Such a step would be wholly inconsistent with the thrust of Government policy to foster an open, competitive and efficient business environment both for the benefit of the consumer and the better operation of the economy generally. The Government's current initiative is to strengthen competition law by increasing the powers and resources of the competition authority and there is legislation currently before the House in that connection.  It is open to the VHI to consider seeking to avail of those protections which the Competition Act, 1991, provides for in terms of the rules of competition.  It is a matter for the VHI to formulate and implement procedures for dealing with providers which would be demonstrably fair and reasonable to counter possible claims of an abuse of dominant position.</P>
    <P>On the matter of a change in the corporate status of the VHI, I have an open mind and am prepared in due course to recommend to the Government what is best for the organisation.  I have clearly set out the considerable change which the VHI is undergoing at present.  This I feel is consistent with the approach recommended by the VHI review group who, first and foremost, advocated a change in the business nature, culture and approach of the VHI and identified the chief executive as the catalyst for this.  The group was of the view that the appropriate corporate structure for the VHI in the future would be that of a limited liability company with 100 per cent of the shares held by the Minister. It considered the conversion to a limited <Col N="720" /> company to be part of a process of radical change to encourage the development of a more innovative and commercial approach.</P>
    <P>I consider that the retention, for the time being, of the VHI's present status does not represent an obstacle to the establishment of a working relationship with the Minister which gives the VHI operational autonomy while making it more transparently accountable.  I am satisfied, however, that a change in the corporate status of the VHI, while it would remain 100 per cent State owned, should be further explored.  I am of the opinion that this would be most appropriately and effectively undertaken when the proposed new arrangements to enhance the expertise of the VHI at board and top level management have been effected.  I will be requesting the enlarged board to give detailed consideration to the matter of a change in corporate status and to submit to me such developed proposals as it may deem appropriate in that regard. Accordingly, this may be a matter in respect of which the House will be asked to consider legislation at a future date.</P>
    <P>I said in the House last March that a greater participatory role should be created for the consumer in the area of private medical insurance.  I, therefore, welcome the recent decision of the VHI to establish a members' advisory council under the chairmanship of Mr. Finbarr Flood.  I am confident that this will provide a valuable and effective forum through which members of the VHI can contribute to the work of the organisation. An advisory council, properly structured and resourced, would not need to be legally based to make a genuine and valuable input into the operation and development of the VHI. The fact that such a council is being established on the VHI's initiative demonstrates the commitment of its board to take account of the views, criticisms and suggestions of the organisation's consumers in a direct and meaningful way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="721" /> The Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill, 1995, represents a balanced and measured answer to those questions most immediately being asked of the VHI.  I recommend it to the House as a significant step in the process of modernising this major State commercial enterprise which plays such a direct part in the lives of our people, particularly at crucial times of serious sickness and injury.  I am confident that, together with the momentum for change already started within the organisation, it will enable the VHI to adjust to, and take best advantage of, a changed market environment.  I am working towards a VHI that is financially strong; adaptable and market driven; dynamic and innovative in the area of product development; having good working relationships with providers and a good customer relations base.</P>
    <P>The objective of this Bill is to make the VHI a more vibrant commercial undertaking which is appropriately resourced, in terms of its governing legislation, for the era of competition ahead.  This Bill puts the VHI on the right course to maintain its position as the main force in private health insurance here for the years to come.</P>

I hope we will have an opportunity in the Select Committee on Social Affairs when we debate Committee Stage next week to put forward a number of amendments and to consider possible areas where the Minister could be helpful in accepting our amendments or, alternatively, by introducing similar amendments which would achieve the same purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> In preparing for the debate on this legislation it was interesting to go back 39 years to 8 November 1956, when the Minister, Mr. T.F. O'Higgins, the Minister's predecessor at that time, said, as reported at columns 829-30, Volume 160 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Some Deputies expressed concern as to the necessity for providing this new body with what, in effect, may be almost a monopoly.  Frankly, I could sympathise with the Deputies who expressed such a doubt.  My original concern, as will appear from the Bill as drafted now, was to provide that this body should be able to meet any competition from any other groups or syndicates that might wish to engage in this business.  I found, however, on closer study of the matter, there was a danger that certain groups outside the country who were still entitled under our Insurance Act of 1936 to operate here, might, in fact, decide to engage in such health insurance business.</P>
    <P>They could do so for a time, but during that time they could so operate a policy that this new board would find itself unable to compete.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that 39 years later we are doing what that Minister said might happen.  I am delighted we are availing of the opportunity to ensure a level playing pitch in terms of competition being faced by the VHI, in so far as that is possible, for anybody who might be inclined to come into the market, or somebody who is in the insurance market here.</P>
    <P>Although feminism in my political party and in others is under enormous strain, it is interesting to note that, 39 years ago, two of my former colleagues &mdash; I was not in the House with either of them &mdash; seemed to be tremendous feminists: one was the grandfather of Deputy Eoin Ryan, Dr. James Ryan, and the other was the father of Deputy Ray Burke, Deputy P.J. Burke.  At that time they were very concerned and cross at the idea that the Minister was allowing the VHI to decide whether <Col N="723" /> maternity benefit should be available and paid by the VHI.  I am pleased that 39 years later we are living up to that policy of feminism within the party.</P>
    <P>As the Minister often said in the past, everybody thinks at some stage in their lives of joining the Voluntary Health Insurance, not necessarily for themselves but for ageing parents or young children.  Membership of the VHI is usually one of the matters which is discussed when a couple are planning to have a child.</P>
    <P>Health insurance is highly regarded by the people as is evident from the fact that over one million of our people, or 35 per cent of our population, have membership of the VHI.  Membership is an important security when something serious goes wrong or when someone has to visit hospital.  Membership in itself can be a great comfort in times of illness as the VHI helps to relieve some of the financial pressure and ensures speedy access to treatment.  However, the VHI, as its own staff and board members would concede, is not perfect. Since I took on the health portfolio no other issue has generated more comment or letters &mdash; apart from the hepatitis C controversy &mdash; where members of the public have expressed such anger. Any time I give an interview about the VHI, speak in the Dáil about it or comment in the media, people approach me and relay their own difficult experience with the organisation.</P>
    <P>Their problems can be broken down into three categories: the VHI's failure to properly communicate cover and cost details; concern about ever increasing premiums at a time when inflation was at its lowest in many years and frustration with the VHI in that members have had no independent forum to which to bring their complaints.  The Bill does not address these issues in the detail that is necessary.  It also appears to be a limited and, in part, faulty upgrading of the law and the issues concerning health insurance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="724" /> Given that there has been no other legislative change in the VHI's operations since its establishment 39 years ago and that the health insurance market is going through unprecedented change, this Bill takes little account of those developments.  The VHI's role has changed considerably in the intervening years.  Originally it was to provide health insurance to those not entitled to free services under the Public Health Acts.  Its other aim was to encourage people who did have such entitlements but who could afford to provide for themselves to do so, and to thus alleviate the burden of health care on the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Nowadays there is full cover in hospital so that the VHI's role is largely encouraging people to provide for themselves.  This is done by supporting speedy preferential access and treatment at a hefty premium.  The preferential treatment extends from private rooms.  Premiums also appear, according to many members of the public, to be supporting what could be referred to as excessive creature comforts.  Despite luxuries being provided, the VHI does not cover important basics, such as dental treatment, unless hospitalisation is required, the cost of spectacles or homeopathic treatment.  Maternity benefit, to which I referred earlier, is limited and psychiatric cover, including treatment for normal psychiatric cover, addiction, eating disorders and so on, is to be restricted.  Optional treatments, such as necessary cosmetic plastic surgery and infertility treatment are not covered.</P>
    <P>The VHI pays only a portion of out-patient services and then only after annual excesses, currently £250 for an individual and £450 for a family.  The provision of excessive luxuries and the absence of some basic cover raises serious questions about the VHI's priorities.  The trend towards excessive preferential treatment, combined with the rise in medical costs, has resulted in the VHI getting into serious financial difficulties.  Last year it had to draw down its entire age reserve fund to make up the shortfall.  In 14 months the <Col N="725" /> company has had to raise premiums by 18 per cent with another 3 per cent rise expected early next year.  With the 18 per cent increase, the company expects to break even this year.  What about next year?  Will there have to be another raft of increases?  Will the remaining £60 million of VHI reserves be eaten up in trying to match expenditure with income?  Given that approximately 10 per cent of VHI subscribers end up in hospital and 90 per cent appear to be paying the price for their preferential treatment, it will only be a matter of time before some members opt out of the scheme and avail of other cover such as permanent health insurance, critical illness schemes and hospital cash plans. While these schemes are limited, fuller health insurance competition is on the way.  The arrival of the British group, Hospital Savings Association, appears to be hurting the VHI in the corporate sector.  It is time for a fundamental reexamination of VHI business and the health insurance market.</P>
    <P>It would be better if the Bill had been preceded by a White Paper on health insurance and I suggest to the Minister that it still may not be too late for the publication of such a document.  This White Paper could look at many important issues and measure the rate of increase in doctors and consultants' fees in recent years and how these negotiations are conducted.  It could also look at the latest round of staff and management changes in the VHI and examine if cost controls have been loosened recently with a resulting increase in premiums.  International comparisons could be made on health insurance. While it is impossible to make an absolute comparison it is worth researching how Denmark, which admittedly has a national health service, manages to offer cover for £160 after public service expenditure cuts.</P>
    <P>A White Paper could throw up suggestions as to how all hospital consultants could be included in the VHI's full cover scheme without any further increase in premiums.  At present 84 per cent of consultants are members and <Col N="726" /> while the level of participation is increasing it is doing so at too slow a rate.  Too often people have to pay bills because some consultants remain outside the scheme.  People can choose the consultant to perform the surgical procedure but when they are on a trolley in a theatre they have no control over the consultant anaesthetist on duty.  People who have full cover under the VHI for the consultant surgeon get very annoyed when they get their bill and realise that the consultant anaesthetist, pathologist or radiologist is not in the scheme and they have to pay the charges.  These people are already paying enough and they should not have to pay unexpected bills merely because of commercial difficulties between the VHI and consultants.</P>
    <P>A similar examination is required in relation to the cost of new facilities provided by the VHI for its members.  In some instances there appears to be too much of one type of technology and not enough of another.  I think the VHI shares this concern.  Most consultants recommend that patients have an MRI scan.  There is an enormous difference in the charge for this scan between hospitals in Dublin and Cork.  The technology is the same so why should there be a difference in the cost?  This issue could be addressed in a White Paper on the health insurance market generally.</P>
    <P>A White Paper could facilitate the important debate about public and private health insurance.  A review could examine if the current ratios are sufficient, if the system is coping and whether better hospital administration would make a significant difference to VHI premiums.  Most importantly, a broad review could look at how the VHI would survive in a deregulated market.  It has been structured as a virtual monopoly offering insurance cover on a community rating basis.  It is fair to ask if this community rating will survive in the new marketplace.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of the VHI recently stated that the VHI would have to look seriously at charging higher premiums for older people who join the <Col N="727" /> scheme.  When I raised this matter on the Adjournment some weeks ago the Minister said that this was against the law, he did not support this proposal and he had no plans to change the law. The members of the board of the VHI feel equally strongly about those remarks.  However, it is always dangerous for someone in that position to think out loud as it can create concerns in the marketplace.  One has to wonder if the chief executive officer was making an opening shot in negotiations about community rating.  That form of operation must have a limited life span given the EU regulations.  The Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies reported on the VHI in 1994 and concluded that community rating would be driven out by competition.  If that is the eventual outcome then there must be a debate on these matters.  No one in this House would like to see such an outcome.</P>
    <P>Another important matter relates to what will be contained in the final health insurance regulations.  Earlier this year there was a storm, so to speak, about the eventual outcome of the Minister's renegotiations with the EU.  There has still been no outcome and the Minister kindly said yesterday he was still in negotiations with the EU and that these would be difficult.  A White Paper could have dealt with this issue and supported the Minister.  I hope the points made by Deputies on this side of the House about the changes in the health regulations have been helpful to the Minister in his negotiations with EU officials.</P>
    <P>A White Paper could also examine the reasons for the slow increase in the level of out-patient cover and the rate of refund for general practitioners.  At present the system seems to operate a perverse incentive for people to go to hospital rather than to avail of out-patient care and stay in the community.  The Minister has often agreed with us that people should be encouraged to have various treatments as out-patients rather than to present at the casualty department or admissions office of a hospital.  The VHI has been moving in <Col N="728" /> this direction but at a slower rate than some of us would like.  The cost of premiums sometimes encourages people to have procedures carried out in hospital rather than as out-patients.  Very often members of the VHI say that they will not be covered for dental treatment as out-patients but they will be covered if they stay in hospital overnight.  This encourages people to take up beds in hospitals for procedures which could be carried out by the out-patient department.</P>
    <P>High premiums in any insurance business encourage people to make claims, if only to recoup costs.  A White Paper could examine the potential for expansion of the VHI, given that so many healthy young people subscribe to the company.  It could also examine the impact of tax changes on the VHI and whether there is a need to look at these changes.  My party was in Government when some of those tax changes were introduced and I know it is difficult to juggle tax relief in the budget so that it will have the most impact and help the already hard-pressed PAYE worker. There is still a matter of whether young people entering the employment market will decide to join the VHI.</P>
    <P>This legislation follows from the enactment of the Health Insurance Act, 1994, and the implications of a Supreme Court judgment in an action taken by a private hospital against the VHI.  While I accept the necessity that these matters be reflected in law I have difficulty with some elements of the Bill.  Section 2 is designed to enable the VHI to influence and control costs.  However, legal advice appears to differ on these provisions which could, in fact, be challenged under the Competition Act especially as the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, proposes major changes in competition law.</P>
    <P>It is important, if possible, that the Minister states the Attorney General's advice on this section either when responding to the Second Stage debate or on Committee Stage.  We need to know the Attorney General's view on <Col N="729" /> the section as it stands as to whether health insurance providers could be challenged under competition law and if not, on what basis the advice was given. The VHI is concerned about section 2 and it makes the point it is important that it and other health insurance providers are excluded from the scope of the Competition Act, 1991.</P>
    <P>The VHI says it would find it very difficult to exercise the reasonable powers it needs to achieve the aim of keeping premium increases at affordable levels if it were exposed to the constant threat of legal proceedings under the Competition Act.  Perhaps the Minister may be able to allay the fears of VHI and others on this matter.  From the legal advice we have received and what the VHI has represented to us, the VHI or any health insurer entering the market could be open to challenge if it limits the number of providers of services in certain areas.  Without a limit, proprietors of hospitals and the medical profession would have a significant financial incentive to encourage an increased demand for services with health costs shooting up and those disappointed will, as the Bill currently stands, bring the VHI to court.  I do not believe anyone would like to see a constant procession of court proceedings against a State company and would not like to see it in this instance against the VHI.  All health insurance companies will find it difficult to keep premium costs down if constantly threatened with proceedings under the Competition Act.  The Minister said that he would not consent to an exemption for the VHI or any other health insurance company but I ask him to reconsider that point and we can discuss it in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There are precedents in other jurisdictions for special consideration for health services.  In Britain, NHS contracts do not give rise to contractual rights and liabilities and in the United States certain activities of health service providers may be exempt from antitrust laws where those activities are regulated by other legislation.  The EU <Col N="730" /> Court of Justice has recognised explicitly the need for insurance providers that are obliged to offer cover to all applicants, regardless of age or health, to be able to limit their outgoings even if this has a negative effect on trade in goods and services.</P>
    <P>Section 3 addresses the increases in VHI subscriptions.  Up to now the Minister for Health had some control over the VHI premiums and reserves but as he said, this was not stated in law, it operated more as custom and practice. I wonder if this practice continued in recent times, if so perhaps the Minister might tell us if he was consulted in the past year about the 18 per cent increase. Under the provisions of this Bill the VHI will have to seek the formal approval of the Minister for increases and if he or she refuses an explanation must be given.  I welcome this.  Given the spate of rises, the Minister should consider seriously using his veto to stop the planned 3 per cent increase in VHI subscriptions next year.  The Minister should ask the VHI if it can achieve cost savings as opposed to raising premiums. I know the VHI is not happy that it will under Statute have to notify the Minister but I do not support the VHI on this.  While welcoming this section I have a number of questions.  If other full health insurers enter the Irish market, will they be required to go through the same procedures?  If this is not the case would it not be discriminatory since VHI would be the only insurer offering in this country whose premiums would be subject to ministerial control.  Will the Minister extend this provision for increases to be subject to ministerial sanction to all the other insurance companies offering health cover of various sorts, including critical illness schemes and hospital cash plans?  Would he consider introducing a set of regulations to deal with this matter?</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with the constitution of the VHI board.  The expansion of the board is very welcome but the conditions put on the board are questionable. A limit has been put on a number of health service providers who can be <Col N="731" /> on the board.  I know the Minister makes a very strong point on the reasons for this limit but why has no limit been placed on the number of actuaries, accountants, lawyers or other service providers?  Why is it necessary to write into the legislation the limit on the number of health service providers? Originally I thought the Minister might have had a problem with having health service providers on the board but from his speech today it would appear that he has no problem and that he appreciates the fact that a company involved in health care must have experience available to it from the people involved in such a service.  I question whether it is preferable to have a lawyer &mdash; with respect to Deputy O'Malley &mdash; on a company board rather than a health service provider.  Will the Minister respond to this point?</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the powers of the chief executive.  Does the Minister intend to continue the practice which has been in evidence in the past number of years of appointing the chief executive as a member of the board?  Perhaps he could tell us the logic behind section 5(5).  Subsection (3) requires the approval of the Minister for Health and the consent of the Minister for Finance for the chief executive's contract of service. Such a contract would normally provide for the payment of allowances for expenses, especially if the salary was being topped up to overcome the Gleeson guidelines.  Therefore, subsection (5) sounds as if permission must be sought for the cost of the air fare if the chief executive has to travel to the European Union.  I am sure that is not the Minister's intention but it would be very bureaucratic and cumbersome if the Minister for Health, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, were to sign every expense docket for the chief executive of the VHI.  I appreciate and expect in legislation that there should be accountability and openness but if this were the way we were to go perhaps we might be going over the top.  I hope that it is not the Minister's intention that he <Col N="732" /> would sign every single expense docket but different officials interpret the legislation in a particular way that makes it cumbersome and bureaucratic.</P>
    <P>Section 7 sets out the terms and conditions of service of the staff of the VHI. As the VHI is facing competition its staff will probably be poached so the company has to be in a position to sufficiently remunerate so that it can recruit and, very importantly, retain employees.  Section 7 puts serious restrictions on the VHI which, it must be noted, is a commercial company not funded by the State.  Restrictions on the VHI are in contrast to the freedom of other agencies such as the National Treasury Management Agency which was established specifically to get around the pay guidelines of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was published I was very disappointed to discover that no provision was made for the VHI's users' council even though the Minister for Health had promised that one would be established.  As he knows, I have been calling for the establishment of such a users' council for the past year as I believe that the 35 per cent of our population who are VHI subscribers must be given a say.  At present they have no say and are not consulted about premia or the operations of the company.</P>
    <P>When the Bill was published I said I would be proposing an amendment to provide for a statutory users' council. No sooner had I done so than the VHI decided on a pre-emptive strike and announced it was establishing its own voluntary council to be called the Members' Advisory Council.  This I perceive to be an attempt to stop the statutory council from being established. This is something I should like the Minister to examine and in respect of which we shall table an amendment on Committee Stage.  I remain of the view that it should be a statutory council.</P>
    <P>I must agree strongly with the Minister in paying tribute to all the staff of the VHI who over the past 38 or 39 years have worked with great dedication <Col N="733" /> and commitment to deliver a service in the private health care market for people who could afford to provide such service for themselves.  I should also like to pay tribute to the many board members who have given selflessly of their time and energy to put forward improvements and changes for the betterment of health care insurance.  When the Minister talks about expanding the board I hope he has no intention of relieving present board members of their services, which he has applauded so much in this House, and that expansion of the board will mean exactly that.</P>
    <P>We support the Bill and shall be tabling amendments which we hope will be favourably received by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to this Bill and will be perfectly happy to see it passed.  However, I am amazed at how short it is, how little it contains.  To my knowledge a Voluntary Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill was discussed with the Department of Health four or five years ago.  When it finally saw the light of day, I had thought it would be major legislation.  It is not.  The only sections proposing anything new, to some extent, are sections 2, 3 and 4, which are included by way of clarification. The remainder cover provisions of a type inserted from time to time in relation to any State company, stipulating that Members of the Dáil or European Parliament are not eligible for membership of the board of the VHI. There is nothing very new.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 2 simply attempts to clarify the powers of the board <i>vis-à-vis</i> health service providers and make it easier for them to come to arrangements.  While I am sure that is helpful to the board it is not particularly new.  I am aware that two or three years ago, when I had a lot of negotiations with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board about what might or might not happen in the Limerick region, its great concern was that it would itself be allowed by statute to provide health care which it had not been allowed do under the provisions of the 1957 Act.  It was very hopeful that <Col N="734" /> when this Bill was introduced it would allow this.</P>
    <P>Section 3 covers notification to the Minister of increases in subscriptions or premiums charged by the board.  Here the Minister's ability to prevent or deter an increase is nothing new either.  While he may not have had the statutory power in the past, he was the 100 per cent shareholder.  Clearly the board could not impose any increases without his consent.  That section merely formalises the actual position.</P>
    <P>Section 4 increases the membership of the board from five to 12.  What can 12 people do that five cannot?  My experience of boards has been that the smaller they are, the better.  The worst aspect about a large board is that everybody serving on it will be seen as being there in a representative capacity, there only to argue the point of view or self interest of their own group, profession or particular commercial or health interest.  I question the advantage of increasing the membership of a board from five to 12 because five well-chosen, good people will be perfectly effective and will render all the service and advice one may require.</P>
    <P>Under section 5 I note that the position of the chief executive is put on a more formal basis.  Hitherto he was described as the general manager which apparently nowadays is not a sufficiently high-sounding title.  It is amazing that the personal requirements of individuals must be reflected in legislation. As far as I am concerned, it is immaterial what he is called, whether that be general manager, chief executive or whatever.</P>
    <P>I want to make some more general remarks relating to health insurance. There have been tremendous developments in recent years in the financial services industry, in the insurance sector in particular, the two main clearing banks each having established their life assurance subsidiaries.  Both those companies are well established and highly successful operators in that field.  Some of the leading building societies have <Col N="735" /> also moved into the life assurance business through acquisition.  Other companies in the financial services sector have entered into various joint venture arrangements in order to be able to offer a range of insurance products to their clients.  Nowadays cross-selling is the name of the game.</P>
    <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board seems to have been something of a bystander in the midst of all this activity, having a valuable client base of 1.3 million customers and a strong financial relationship with all of them, some would say too strong.  Many of them pay the premia through direct debits.</P>
    <P>I submit that the Voluntary Health Insurance Board has not exploited its market potential to the full.  The organisation should recognise that it is part of the financial services industry and that the firms with which it will soon be competing are dynamic and aggressive players in that industry.  The VHI should be aiming to improve its efficiency.  One way of doing so would be to pursue joint ventures or formal linkages with other companies in the financial services area, whether they be banks, building societies or finance houses, to ascertain whether it can generate additional income from its existing cost base. There are any number of initiatives the board could have taken without incurring any major financial risk but it appears to have displayed very little enterprise or marketing flair in the manner in which it has gone about its business. It is essential that the newly constituted board be given the autonomy to pursue whatever commercial initiatives it sees fit.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not really address the question of ownership of the VHI; it appears to be accepted that the board will remain a State-owned entity. However, in the context of a deregulated market, open to European competition, at the very least we should be discussing if this is necessarily the best course of action.  Continued State ownership of the VHI will put the State <Col N="736" /> in the position of being an operator in the health insurance market while at the same time being the regulator and effective manager of the health care sector. This situation will cause problems once foreign health insurance companies establish a significant presence in the Irish market.  If the VHI is to be a social service, there is a clear argument in favour of continued State involvement. However, if the board is to be given a commercial mandate and the freedom to compete with much larger rivals from abroad, consideration will have to be given to releasing it ultimately from the burden of State ownership.</P>
    <P>The next few years will see the VHI competing against foreign insurance companies in its own market.  Will the board be content to confine itself to the very small Republic of Ireland market, or will it seek to pursue a more ambitious corporate development plan and expand outside this State, perhaps into the Northern Ireland market or the British market or both?  Any expansion of that kind will almost certainly require additional capital, but will the taxpayer be required to provide that capital as it was required in the case of a legion of troubled State enterprises?</P>
    <P>If the VHI is to expand in this way it will have to do so as a private company outside of State ownership.  The British authorities are likely to take a very jaundiced view of a State-owned company entering their market.  A couple of years ago they held up for more than 12 months a proposed British acquisition by an Irish company simply because a French State owned company had a majority shareholding in the Irish firm. We know the attitude of the British to an Irish wholly State-owned steel company.</P>
    <P>At the very least the Bill should for a start put the VHI on an independent commercial footing as a semi-State body.  The proposed legislation provides for a kind of halfway house which is unsatisfactory.  Effectively, the Department of Health will control the destiny of the VHI which will be little more <Col N="737" /> than an executive agency of the Department. The mere fact that the VHI is reporting to the Minister for Health poses a conflict of interest.  The Minister is, in effect, the largest health service provider through the public hospital system. He and his Department supply private rooms in those hospitals to clients of the VHI.  This means the Minister negotiates terms with the VHI as a supplier of services while controlling its activities as the effective sole shareholder in the organisation.  This often involves the public hospitals undercutting private suppliers by charging uneconomic rates for their services.</P>
    <P>The job of the Minister for Health and his Department is to provide for the health care of the nation.  In a competitive deregulated market he should not be directly involved in the operation of a health insurance business any more than he should be involved in the manufacture of pharmaceutical products.  The rest of the insurance industry is regulated by the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  It seems only sensible that the VHI, which will now be a commercial insurance business like any other, should report to that Department and be regulated by it and not by the Department of Health which is its sole shareholder.  This conflict arises in other areas of activity too where the regulatory body is also the shareholder.  While this may have been the norm in this country up to now, it is a very different situation in the Single Market of which we are now part in the post-Maastricht period, and competitors will not put up with it.  They will challenge it and, even if they do not succeed in the Irish courts, they have every prospect of succeeding in the European Court.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a 12-person board at the restructured VHI company compared with a five person board at present.  I have already expressed my view on the need for that, about which I am not convinced.  I hope that whatever additional places are created are not used simply for the purpose of political patronage and that a very important board like this is peopled only by those <Col N="738" /> who have a definite contribution to make in terms of their knowledge of some aspect of the business.</P>
    <P>The question of whether the chief executive should be a member of the board will also have to be looked at. There are arguments for and against it. I am against it from my fairly long experience of these on promotional boards or non-commercial boards, but it is a different situation in a commercial board.  If this is to be a commercial board; the chief executive might properly become the managing director.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes no provision for the regulation of the health care market or the health insurance market which, presumably, will be carried out by the Department or the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  For several years the VHI has been in the unfortunate position of being a price taker in the market in which it operates. To a large extent it was forced to accept the prices charged by hospitals and by consultants.  Major disputes arose in this area, giving rise to the balanced billing procedure whereby the VHI refuse to reimburse their clients fully for charges levied by certain consultants.  Balanced billing is perhaps the single biggest grievance among VHI subscribers.</P>
    <P>As we move into a deregulated market with several different firms offering health insurance services in competition with the VHI, disputes over pricing are likely to increase.  There will have to be some form of regulation to ensure the smooth working of the market and arbitration in disputes between insurers and providers.  A small unit staffed by people with the necessary expertise in the field of health care finances should be sufficient to carry out this role.</P>
    <P>There is also a need for much greater transparency in the whole area of health care pricing.  At present, we have no published information on how the cost of a particular medical procedure varies from one hospital to another or from one consultant to another.  If there are wide discrepancies between costs in different hospitals, for instance, they <Col N="739" /> should be investigated through the regulatory mechanism I suggested.  The objective should be to ensure that the consumer, in this case the ordinary individual who pays health insurance premiums, gets the best deal possible.  The more information that is publicly available the better it is for the working of a competitive market.</P>
    <P>At present, there are three main conditions set out in the Health Insurance Act, 1994 for any company seeking to enter the health insurance market in Ireland.  These are not specifically referred to in the Bill, but they are germane to the subject under discussion. The conditions specified are community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover.  Effectively, they mean that any insurer cannot cherry-pick clients from the healthiest sections of the population offering the lowest risk.  These conditions mean that policies must be available to all who want to take them up and that there can be no discrimination against elderly people or against very young people either by charging them higher premiums or by cutting them off from cover once they reach a certain age.  These conditions have ensured that the VHI has traditionally offered a fair and equitable service to its subscribers.</P>
    <P>I note now that several of the major British insurance companies contemplating entering the Irish market are unhappy with these conditions and are protesting to Brussels seeking to have them overturned.  To do this would be a retrograde step.  If the conditions were relaxed the long-term effects would be very serious indeed.  In an unregulated competitive market many elderly people would be effectively disbarred from private health insurance as they could not afford the weighted premiums they would be charged, or they might be cut off from cover altogether.  With an ageing population, which we have, many more people would be forced into reliance on the public health sector, greatly increasing the strain on an already hard-pressed system.  It is imperative that the Government states <Col N="740" /> its case firmly in Brussels on this issue. If any significant relaxation of the present conditions is forced upon us the consequences would be very damaging.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister's remarks on the application of the Competition Act.  This is a matter of great concern to the VHI which sends circulars to Deputies stating that its omission is a disastrous aspect of this Bill.  The Competition Act applies to every State company operating commercially.  Enormous efforts were made in 1991 to get me to exempt all or a number of State companies on the grounds that they had never been subject to rules and would be unable to cope with normal competition as does every other company and person.  I refused all applications, including one from the VHI.</P>
    <P>The VHI was sued under the Competition Act shortly after it came into operation by an order of nuns in Mullingar. The nuns won their case, a victory which established an important principle. The VHI regards it as perhaps the greatest setback it ever received but I was extremely gratified that the order of nuns and their hospital won the case. The VHI will have to learn to live in the real world, particularly now that it will for the first time be subject to competition from other insurance companies. The Mullingar case was of great importance because it demonstrated that the VHI would not be allowed, under the 1991 Act, to continue to abuse its dominant position.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will take my comments on board because we have a common interest in the following point.  Notwithstanding that judgment, the VHI are still abusing their dominant position in the Limerick region by refusing to allow the establishment of a private hospital in Limerick.  The mid-western region is the only region in Ireland without a private in-patient hospital, to the great detriment of a large number of people living in the region.  Many people have tried to establish one but could not get cover from the VHI.  There is no point in establishing a hospital for private patients unless it is covered by <Col N="741" /> the VHI.  Refusal is an abuse of a dominant position.</P>
    <P>If the decision in the Mullingar case had been set aside in this Bill, it would have been disastrous.  The Minister's view of the application of the Competition Act is correct.  The consequences of the Mullingar decision should be brought home to the VHI.  It cannot continue to deprive people, who happen to live in one region of facilities available in every other region.  At present, people who do not hold medical cards are forced to go to a variety of places, including Galway, Cork, Waterford, Kilkenny and Dublin, for operations or certain treatments.  It is not fair to 350,000 people living in a particular region that they are disadvantaged as a direct result of the policy pursued by the VHI acting in a discriminatory way.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that it set out to act in a discriminatory way.  It assures me it will not support or recognise any private hospital in the mid-western region because costs are so great in certain private hospitals which it named.  It says it must draw the line somewhere and cannot see a further proliferation of these hospitals.  I pointed out that it is, in practice, discriminating against people who live in a particular region, that it cannot be supported and should not be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I spent much of my time dealing with the 1992 directive.  It was to be transposed into national law at the end of December 1993 and came into force on 1 July 1994.  This is December 1995, two years after the time it was to be transposed. The necessary regulations, as far as health insurance is concerned, have not yet been made.  The Minister said they will be made shortly.  I hope so, and that by shortly, he means a week or two and not another six or 12 months.  The sooner they are made and companies throughout the Union can assess the precise terms on which they can write business the better.</P>
    <P>Even though the VHI is the subject of a great deal of criticism from many people, as Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said, we should also recognise that it has <Col N="742" /> provided a very good service for a large number of people.  Many medical services the State is unable to provide were availed of by people who would not have been able to afford them.</P>
    <P>In this country health insurance is seen as being totally different from public social security health provision.  This is not the case in other countries, particularly in continental Europe, where there is a large overlap.  We seem to think what happens in Britain, where there is a distinction between BUPA and the national health service, is what happens in the rest of the world. However, there is a heavy insurance element in public health provision on the Continent.  There is an interesting insurance element in public health provision in Canada which is quite different from the United States.  Many people would argue that it is much more satisfactory than the United States.</P>
    <P>If we had time we should develop some thoughts on this issue because the solution to the difficulties encountered in the provision of public health because of escalating costs lies somewhere in the insurance field.  I do not have time to develop that point now but if we do not do something we may, in the future, see on the streets of Dublin, Cork and Limerick something akin to what we witnessed on the streets of Paris, Lyon and Toulouse yesterday and today.  French costs have gone out of control.  The French Government, however belatedly, is trying to get a grip on things and is running into the most horrendous problems.  I can see a future Irish Government being in the same situation. When the embargo on recruitment in the public service was at its height between 1987 and 1990 there was an increase of 3,000 in the number of people employed in the health services. Since then there has been an even greater increase.  The cost of public health is mind-boggling and seems to be out of control.  If we do not control it and look at some form of insurance in respect of it we might face a spectacle similar to that in France.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill which is a first step in reforming and changing the health insurance market and the role of the VHI.  It is surprising that it has taken so long to introduce such a Bill.  The change in the Single Market and in competition policy prompted us to make these changes which I welcome.</P>
      <P>I was struck by Deputy O'Malley's scenario.  No one expected any Deputy to draw conclusions from what is happening on the streets of France but it is an interesting point and I agree that the future in terms of providing high quality health care will not lie in a simple private or public model but in a mix of both.  It is the variety of packages that can be created by mixing the two that will give the public a better service with a greater choice.  That will be the reality as Governments grapple with rising health care costs.</P>
      <P>The fact that so many people chose to be members of the VHI says a great deal about their concern for health care and their willingness to support a private insurance model if they can do so.  This could be positive in providing the kind of health care service everyone needs.  If those who can afford to do so support private insurance at the end of the day we will be able to provide a better public health service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VHI operate in a changed environment. The Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies stated in its report last year that the advent of competition will dramatically change the environment in which the VHI will operate.  From a monopolistic enterprise it will have to become a fully competitive, market oriented organisation.  Very often we do not think about health in this way.  We tend to have a purist view of it.  It brings us down to earth to think of the challenges that must be met in providing health care.  What we are demanding from the VHI is similar to what is being demanded in other semi-State companies.  We are talking about an efficient, market driven organisation <Col N="744" /> developing attractive packages for people at competitive rates.</P>
    <P>Irish people have an ambivalent relationship with the VHI.  On the one hand they appreciate it when they go into hospital and need money.  On the other hand, there is underlying anger at increased premiums, the unpredictability of what will be covered and top up fees.  We must try to ensure that consumers are clear on what they are buying into and that costs are predictable. With new technological advances, research and higher expectations, it is difficult to predict costs.</P>
    <P>The VHI adopted a radical programme of recovery and must be congratulated on doing so.  The battle is not over yet and more work needs to be done on the finance side which will be demanding.  The VHI operate in a radically changed environment.  Consumers have increasing expectations and hospitals compete to provide services. Everyone wants to provide the best in their own neck of the woods.  There is limited finance available and we are trying to give value to taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The VHI play an important role in holding the mix between public and private health care.  It is interesting that young people are well represented proportionately. The Minister should reach out to young people and the VHI should have advertising campaigns targeting them.  It needs to adopt a consumer oriented approach.  It deals with its consumers and health care providers all the time.  One of the key reasons for greater demands being made on the VHI is our ageing population.  This is not unique to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Bill amends the 1957 Act.  The VHI now has the possibility of developing new health insurance products and activities beyond its present business of strictly indemnity based insurance to areas such as cash schemes in respect of serious illness.  This could include optional products such as GP primary care, dental, hospital cash schemes, etc.  This will allow for the generation of additional revenue and consolidation of the customer base.  This is <Col N="745" /> important but the VHI cannot take its eye off its core business of health insurance.  That must remain the primary vision and focus.</P>
    <P>In developing policy there must be creative positioning between the emerging understanding of health care needs &mdash; the need to provide at primary level and move away from in-patient care to out-patient care as much as possible.  It is important that the VHI keeps pace with such developments.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn made the point that if people are hospitalised overnight the VHI pays their expenses but if they attend hospital as a day patient or out-patient their bills are not met in certain circumstances.  We must ensure the changes we introduce are supportive of our general health policy and of the approach to make less use of hi-tech hospitals.  They must also support general practitioners and promote health care.</P>
    <P>If the VHI is to contain costs it must make economic arrangements with its providers and the Bill makes this possible. However, this will not be straightforward. Many political decisions will have to be made in respect of various hospitals.  Ministers and politicians will have to examine the matter carefully and support the VHI in tackling these issues.  We must ensure that a properly planned health care service is provided throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Health care costs are increasing for two main reasons, the technological costs of providing services and the age profile of our population.  Until now the VHI did not have the power to tell a hospital it would not pay for unnecessary technology.  It could not claim that enough technology was in place or that the efficacy of new technology had been demonstrated.  I welcome the power this Bill will give to the VHI in this regard.</P>
    <P>I disagree with Deputy O'Malley that five members is sufficient on the board. The VHI is a complex organisation with wide ranging responsibilities and a 12 member board is necessary.  The Minister referred to financial, insurance and market experience being important for <Col N="746" /> membership of the board, but people who work in the services must also be represented on it.  The Minister has limited the number of health service providers to two.  Consumers should also be represented on the board.  I welcome the establishment of the Members' Advisory Council.  If that council were established earlier it could have dealt with the ambivalence surrounding the attitude to the VHI.  Increasing board membership to 12 will provide an opportunity to include wide ranging expertise and this is essential in a complex organisation such as the VHI.  Millions of pounds are paid in subscriptions and hundreds of millions of pounds are paid out to the providers.</P>
    <P>Since the year ending February 1993 the VHI has reported deteriorating underwriting losses.  In February 1993 it reported losses of £7 million, but £6 million after investment income.  In February 1994 it reported losses of £13 million, but £6 million after investment income and in 1995, £15 million which should have resulted in an overall £5 million deficit, but when an ageing reserve is taken into account it allows for a break-even situation.  Those are challenging figures and I am sure next year's figures will also show a loss.</P>
    <P>Escalating costs present a major problem. Consultants' fees increased from £36 million in February 1992 to £41 million in February 1993, £51 million in February 1994 &mdash; a 23 per cent increase &mdash; and £61 million in February 1995 &mdash; a 22 per cent increase.  The projected increases for next year are also very high.  I am not placing blame for those increases on those who provide the services, but if we want the VHI to be viable then agreements, involving complex negotiations with all concerned, must be put in place.</P>
    <P>The VHI is a valued organisation.  Its net membership continues to increase by approximately 2 per cent per annum. It is vital to the State's twin track approach to health care provision.  In view of the difficult financial position facing the VHI and the demands placed on a modern health insurance market, <Col N="747" /> attention must focus on acute care whether in in-patient, day care or out-patient services.  We must maintain community rating, as outlined in the Bill, and strong contractual partnerships with VHI doctors and hospitals on services, pricing, technology and overall cost must exist.  We must maintain the affordability of the VHI for the people and this is becoming more difficult. Many people on the margins who would like to buy into the service cannot afford the premiums.  I hope under this legisaltion the VHI will be able to devise creative packages, using groups of private and public hospitals and their consultants.</P>
    <P>The traditional categorisation of public, private or hi-tech luxury is now redundant.  Our public hospitals are to the forefront in care and medicine.  We must maximise what is already in the system, provide incentives for a mix of hospitals and doctors to work together and offer choice and keener prices for non-traditional plans.  It will be difficult for the VHI to get this across to the public and to ensure that people purchase what is best for them and their families.  If it fails to do this, other competitors will do it but I am confident the VHI will face up to these challenges.</P>
    <P>A board comprising membership with wide expertise will be required to focus on the finances and future of the VHI. Consumers want health care to be affordable and predictable when they face unpredictable injury or illness. They want to know what they are covered for and to be provided with a sufficient range of coverage.  Some of the expectations about what core health insurance covers, for example routine visits, must be examined.  It may not be possible for certain forms of private health insurance to cover such matters. It should be confined to the higher cost, unanticipated acute medical conditions, injury, illness and associated treatment, whether in-patient, day care or out-patient. If people can afford it, they can buy into packages which cover other services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="748" /> I welcome the legislation.  I have no doubt that as the market evolves in the years ahead more complex legislation will have to be introduced to evaluate what the changes in competition policy have meant for our private and public health care sector and on that basis further changes may be necessary.  This legislation is a good start.  It places the VHI in a better position to tackle the difficult and challenging tasks facing them as the market opens up and other competitors offer services to our consumers.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity of discussing some aspects of health insurance when we are facing the prospect of competition from abroad in an area which up to now has been the sole preserve of the VHI board.  Many people fear that competing companies may be allowed to concentrate on limiting cover to the areas which are most profitable.  This cannot be described as fair competition.  If these companies demand fair competition, it should be made clear to them that they must provide the level of cover provided by the VHI for more than 40 years.  It must not be akin to the bank manager who offers his umbrella to a customer and demands its return at the first sign of rain.  In health terms, this would run contrary to all the VHI has stood for since its inception &mdash; no penalty should apply because people are getting old.</P>
      <P>Recently the VHI chief implied that people who join at older ages may have to pay higher premiums.  While I can understand the economic reasoning behind this I would like to know how he defines &ldquo;older ages&rdquo;.  We must ensure that someone who has been a member of the VHI since an early age is not penalised once he or she reaches some arbitrary birthday when it is reckoned the health risk is greater.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> As in the case of all other types of insurance policy, the costs of benefits have to be continuously monitored.  In the case of the VHI, the profit motive has not entered the equation in the same way as in any commercial company. Until recently it has managed its affairs well as a general rule and done its utmost to negotiate the best possible terms for its members.  Its current financial problems arise from the rapidly escalating costs of newly developing medical techniques.</P>
    <P>A phenomenon in recent years is the insurance costs incurred by all members of the medical profession, consultants and general practitioners alike.  There is a chain reaction which begins in the GP's surgery in many cases.  If there is the slightest doubt in the doctor's mind regarding his diagnosis or treatment, the spectre of being sued for negligence comes immediately to mind and the patient is referred to a consultant who, in turn, is also terrified at the prospect of legal action and so ensures that every conceivable test under the sun is carried out.  This pushes costs up, even though it could be argued in many cases that many of the procedures are unnecessary.</P>
    <P>In the course of my medical practice I am frequently asked about the published costs by the VHI board of certain medical procedures.  I am not questioning their accuracy, but it would be of help if a breakdown was provided.  For example, £10,031 is required for a coronary bypass, £4,024 for a hip replacement, £1,473 for a cataract extraction and £2,040 for a prostatectomy.  In the interests of the public, will the VHI provide a breakdown of these costs?</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;young and healthy&rdquo; are often referred to as subsidising the &ldquo;old and sick&rdquo;.  That is the basis of all insurance cover.  I doubt whether any young person would view his parents in this manner in the certain knowledge that he, too, will grow old and hope his children will subsidise him in turn.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="750" /> The Minister and the VHI board should seriously consider promoting co-operation with the authorities in Northern Ireland in the health sphere.  I refer especially to the 1992 Ballyconnell agreement between four health boards, two in the North and two on this side of the Border.  The areas concerned have a population of one million.  The main objectives were identified as follows: to improve the health and well being of the population; to exploit opportunities for co-operation in the planning and provision of services; to assist Border areas in overcoming the special development problems arising from their relative isolation in the national economies and within the European Union as a whole through the promotion of Government and European Union awareness and support for this process; to exploit all opportunities for joint working or sharing of resources where this would be of mutual advantage and to take up funding which may be available from the European Union or other third parties.</P>
    <P>Under those headings the co-operation sought can be promoted in various parts of the country, not just the Border areas.  For instance, a few hundred hip replacement operations were carried out in Belfast by arrangement with the health authorities here.</P>
    <P>On the unique problems affecting County Donegal, as the House well knows, following partition, County Donegal was surrounded almost entirely by the Atlantic on one side and by the Border on the other.  For many years the establishment in Dublin tended to regard it as a far flung outpost and treated it accordingly.  I would like to think this attitude has changed and that in the sphere of health care there is an obvious example of how special attention could be given to this area.</P>
    <P>The Inishowen Peninsula is part of the natural hinterland of County Derry and the closest hospital is Altnagelvin in Derry.  The cost of full cover from the VHI is prohibitive and along the lines of that required for the Blackrock Clinic and the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin, one has to be in either plan D or E. <Col N="751" /> Patients from north Inishowen have to travel to Letterkenny General Hospital bypassing Altnagelvin, a round trip of about 100 miles.  Most accept this without question, but for certain specialist services they have to travel well over 100 miles to Sligo or 170 miles to Dublin although most of these services are available in Derry.  For example, where a colposcopy is required when a positive result is shown in a smear test the woman concerned has to wait two to three weeks before being referred to Dublin.  This is considered a routine procedure at Altnagelvin.</P>
    <P>There has been co-operation between the North Western Health Board on this side of the Border and the Western Health Board in Northern Ireland and between the hospice services in counties Derry and Donegal.  I would like to see a more formalised system developed whereby various services could be shared in both directions where this is desirable and the VHI board proceed as a matter of urgency with negotiations with Northern health boards with a view to including hospitals such as Altnagelvin on its list of providers at a reasonable cost.  I am well aware that this may not be as easy as it seems because of the differing entitlements of patients to hospital care in the respective areas, but I hope a line can be drawn from the cross-Border tax arrangements that already exist.  The people living in north Donegal especially should be entitled to cross-Border hospital care without having to pay the top rates in VHI premiums.</P>
    <P>There is great discussion of cross-Border co-operation and reconciliation. What I have been talking about affects the lives and well-being of people on both sides of the Border.  I refer the Minister to the submission made to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation last December by my colleague, Dr. Daniel McGinley of Moville in north Inishowen.  That submission contains excellent proposals for co-operation along the lines suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  This has been described as modernising legislation. Given that it is the first legislation to be introduced in 38 years, that it runs to 12 sections most of which, as Deputy O'Malley said, form part and parcel of every Bill produced and only two of which could be described as radical, have the Minister and the Department not missed an opportunity?</P>
      <P>I strongly support the suggestion, made by my party's spokesperson on health, that the Bill should have been preceded by a White Paper on the health insurance market.  The Minister might still take on board that worthy suggestion. Such a White Paper would allow for debate, inside and outside this House, involving the various interests with an input to this matter.  I appeal to the Minister to take on board the most worthy suggestion made in relation to the Bill during this debate.</P>
      <P>While the VHI is to be commended for the establishment of its Members' Advisory Council &mdash; which was prompted by my party's suggestion that a users' council be set up &mdash; my party will table an amendment which will have the effect of establishing a users' council.  The 35 per cent of the Irish public who are members of the VHI subscribe in excess of £200 million per year and have no representation within that organisation.  While the enlargement of the board from five to 12 members is welcome, it is necessary to make statutory provision to establish a users' council to reflect the widening range of consumer interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VHI is solely in the business of selling insurance and the insurance companies already have a voluntary insurance ombudsman who is working very successfully in this area.  The sale of savings and pensions policies in particular has attracted considerable criticism of the industry by consumers.  The people responsible for the sale of policies have examined the value for money aspect from the consumers' viewpoint. The insurance ombudsman is playing a <Col N="753" /> valuable role in ensuring the entire savings market is not eroded by a lack of confidence.</P>
    <P>During this debate concerns have been expressed with regard to people's continued confidence in the health and welfare of the VHI.  I am sure the VHI itself would welcome strong consumer representation and attention being paid to customer needs.  If a person buys a product &mdash; be it an electrical product, a financial product or a service &mdash; the Director of Consumer Affairs is available, under statute, to give effect to the consumer's rights as enshrined in law.  I ask the Minister to take on board the amendment which my party will be tabling on Committee Stage.  I believe it will be a worthwhile amendment and we cannot wait a further 40 years for legislation to give effect to this matter.</P>
    <P>The accounts for the VHI's last financial year make for stark reading.  They show that claims paid increased by a figure in excess of 10 per cent while subscription income increased by a similar amount.  Accumulated reserves have decreased to £57.5 million from £66.4 million and are now less than 25 per cent of what is paid by subscribers each year.  It makes for stark reading when one considers that the accumulated reserves of the VHI &mdash; which has been in existence for 40 years &mdash; represent only 25 per cent of what is paid out in any one year.  With investment income anticipated to grow at a lesser pace than the norm in times of high interest rates, the pressure on premiums to increase &mdash; at a rate considerably higher than inflation &mdash; will continue.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of subscribers, on receiving their annual renewal form, ask themselves if it is worth their while to pay for private insurance cover for benefits which appear to constantly change on a biannual basis.  Will these people have to rely on the public health service instead?  It is critical that the VHI retains its 35 per cent share of the population who subscribe to its schemes at present.  A wholesale desertion of the VHI by these people will place huge pressure on public health finances.  The <Col N="754" /> tolerance point is fast approaching for many people as a result of an increase of 18 per cent in the cost of premiums in the past 14 months.  A further 3 per cent increase is anticipated next year. With the whittling away of tax relief &mdash; which was carried out by my own party while in Government &mdash; and the improved delivery of services in the public health sector, many people may feel that critical or permanent health cover is sufficient for the most serious of situations which might be forced on their families.</P>
    <P>During the past number of years a plethora of insurance companies have entered the market offering permanent health and sickness insurance.  Daily advertisements, in newspapers and on radio, illustrate the attractiveness of purchasing such sophisticated products to cover times of serious medical crisis. This Bill will permit the VHI to expand its range of products.  However, the VHI must engage in a close examination of itself, as an organisation, if it is to be successful in facing up to the competition which will eventually enter the Irish market.  If such competition does enter the market, it will do so on a playing pitch levelled to a position which will ensure that it must compete with the VHI on the same terms that organisation has offered to the Irish public for 40 years.</P>
    <P>The Health Insurance Act, 1994, ensures that any overseas competitor contemplating entering the Irish market must be prepared to contribute to a risk equalisation fund if it is judged to have a preponderance of low risk subscribers. As party spokesperson for the elderly, I strongly support this notion.  I will be prepared, at all times, to fight &mdash; up to European level &mdash; to retain this worthy principle.  The aforementioned Act also invites any new competitor to use the community-based ratings system which ensures that younger members joining the VHI cross-subsidise older members. This means that everyone pays the same premium.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="755" /> With our population demographics showing, as in all other European countries, an upward graph of elderly people, in the next ten years this will place increasing pressure on premiums which will easily exceed the rate of inflation and the market for young subscribers will contract.  The market is currently increasing at a miserly rate of 2 per cent per year.  We must make it attractive for young, taxpaying subscribers to join the VHI.  The return of full tax relief is an absolute prerequisite if we are to continue to attract young subscribers to the VHI market.</P>
    <P>On the passing of this Bill, I ask the Minister and the VHI to consider introducing long-term care insurance products. BUPA, Britain's largest private medical insurance group, recently stated that it is considering a number of ways to provide funds for elderly people who can no longer look after themselves and are obliged to pay for their own care. Claims usually depend on a fairly severe level of disability involving the failure to perform a number of specified tasks. This includes the ability to carry out four of the following activities without assistance: washing, dressing, feeding, visiting the lavatory, controlling bladder or bowel functions or moving around a room.  In the case of cognitive failure such as Alzheimer's disease, policies are paid regardless of these conditions. Offering tax relief on long-term care insurance, or changing the rules governing pension plans, would be necessary if such a product was to be successfully launched.</P>
    <P>The recent budget in England made certain provisions in this regard to respond to the clearly identified need for the provision of long-term care. With a decreasing number of long-term beds available in public hospitals &mdash; private nursing homes have taken up the slack in recent years &mdash; and having regard to the fact that subventions are paid to 40 per cent of people housed in private nursing homes, a market exists to provide permanent health and sickness cover.  The younger members of <Col N="756" /> society, to whom the Minister referred in his speech, are the most likely people to be attracted to this market.  I believe this matter is worthy of examination. Consideration should be given to providing a policy whereby people could perhaps, on reaching 60 years of age, pay a lump sum and as these people grow older the VHI might respond by paying out a suitable level of remuneration to those providing care services. This would ensure that the elderly are not forced to sell their principal private assets, namely their homes.  We should follow the example of England in that regard and provide such a service as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill which gives us an opportunity to discuss the VHI and its work to date.  It would be remiss of me not to commend the Minister, Deputy Noonan, on introducing the Bill.  Even though he has been in office for less than a year, he and his Department have done tremendous work.  He is capable of progressing issues, as is evident in this case.</P>
      <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board was established in 1957 and, from very small beginnings, has grown to a membership of approximately one-third of the population.  Members' subscriptions for this year amount to £230 million, a substantial amount of money. People talk about the need to provide certain services and extra cover, but it must be remembered that any expansion of the VHI services must be met by a substantial increase in the membership or subscription base of the VHI. This year the VHI paid £60 million to consultants, £60 million to public hospitals and in excess of £100 million to private hospitals.  If any of those sectors increase their spending, subscriptions must be increased.  The VHI is a non-profit organisation and we are not trying to impose extra services and commitments on it because that would have the long-term knock-on effect of putting membership beyond the reach of members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="757" /> The main purpose of the Bill is to enable the VHI to develop new health insurance products and activities and I welcome that.  I would, however, be adamant that the VHI should not expand to own or run its own hospitals.  That would be a great mistake because it would be outside the expertise of the VHI and would not be within the terms under which it operates.  There are a number of private hospitals which generally do a good job and I would not like to see the VHI go into competition with them.  It would not be healthy for the organisation or its membership.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Hughes on the need for an ombudsman or arbitrator within the VHI system.  That was one of the recommendations of the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies, of which I was a member, in its report in 1994.  The committee consulted many of the people involved, including consultants, private hospitals, the board of VHI and the public.  In the light of those discussions we felt there was a need for an arbitrator who could adjudicate on the various difficulties within the VHI system.</P>
    <P>Today I had reason to ring the VHI on behalf of a constituent who is receiving radium treatment at a private hospital in Dublin.  That person travels on a daily basis from home, which is a considerable distance from the hospital, at great expense.  The person was concerned that the cost of daily treatment will not be met entirely by the VHI, and on making inquiries I discovered that is the case; the VHI will not cover the cost of daily treatment and obviously it will not pay towards travel costs.  If that patient remained in the hospital for a month, the duration of the treatment, the full cost would be met by the VHI. It is remarkable that a person who chooses to travel to the hospital daily, at considerable cost and stress, rather than take the easier option of checking into hospital, is penalised.  That matter should be considered.  With whom can one raise such a problem and who will adjudicate on it?  The VHI rules on <Col N="758" /> these matters and there is no intermediary with whom one can raise the matter. There should be an independent person such as an ombudsman to adjudicate on such issues.</P>
    <P>The ombudsman could also intervene in disputes such as that which constantly arises between consultants and the VHI about remuneration for facilities and services.  In recent years there has been confrontation between these two groups, leading to much bitterness, but thankfully many of these problems have been resolved.  An ombudsman would be in a position to arbitrate between the two groups and help them reach an amicable agreement.  Such disputes are not helpful and do not benefit the VHI members.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies had long discussions with consultants about rates of remuneration for various procedures and the balanced billing system.  We were anxious to publish a list of consultants and doctors within the VHI system who do not operate a balanced billing system but we met with great resistance.  Nonetheless we published a list which received some coverage at the time.  I am not sure whether a more comprehensive list has been published since.  VHI members should be aware of the medical practitioners who operate within VHI cover and those who operate outside it.</P>
    <P>A third role for an ombudsman within the VHI system would be to mediate in disputes between hospitals and the VHI. Deputy O'Malley referred to a very unseemly development in the past three or four years at a hospital in my area, St. Francis Medical Centre in Mullingar, which lead to a long, bitter dispute between that hospital and the VHI.  The dispute led to a High Court case that continued for several days and to a Supreme Court hearing.  It resulted in the imposition of major costs on VHI subscribers.  Not only must colossal legal bills be picked up by VHI members &mdash; in this instance they may be up to £1 million &mdash; but a substantial compensation payment must be made by the <Col N="759" /> VHI to the hospital concerned as it won its case.</P>
    <P>The hospital brought a case under the 1991 Competition Act and won it despite the most ardent efforts of the VHI and its legal team, but such legal proceedings need not have arisen.  I was involved with that hospital at the time that dispute arose.  I spent much time talking with officials of the VHI. representatives of the hospital and the then Minister who gave me short shift and was not interested in trying to solve that dispute which will cost VHI members millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>Having had discussions with the various groups and learning that the case might go to court, I put forward the sensible proposal that a mediation forum should be set up to hear both sides of the case and adjudicate on it.  I suggested that such a forum should be made up of three people, one with medical experience, one with legal experience and one other who should act as chairperson.  That formula was acceptable to the hospital, but the VHI did not accept it.  It ruled it out of order and was not prepared to sit around the table with representatives of that hospital or an arbitration group to sort out the problems.</P>
    <P>The outcome of that dispute has resulted in the imposition of major costs on VHI members because its board was not prepared to listen to a reasonable proposal.  That case demonstrates the need for the appointment of an ombudsman or the introduction of an arbitration system to enable VHI members have disputes arbitrated on and mediated upon.  That would allow ordinary members the right to be heard, would provide an arbitration system for hospitals which would ensure they would not have to resort to court action and consultants could have their disputes settled.  That scenario should be borne in mind and on Committee Stage the Minister should provide for the appointment of an ombudsman to deal with such cases.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> There have been tremendous developments in medical technology in recent years.  Advanced medical technology is available in many private hospitals particularly those in the Dublin area.  I ask the Minister or the VHI to discuss with hospitals contemplating it, the purchase of new technology, which imposes a major cost on VHI members.  There is duplication in the provision of advanced technology in some Dublin private hospitals with one competing against the other.  The Minister or the VHI should intervene and advise that if certain equipment is available in a Dublin hospital it will be the only such equipment that will be funded in Dublin and that other such equipment to be located in a private hospital should be located in Cork or Galway to ensure a greater spread of service.  It does not seem reasonable that such equipment should be gathered together in one city so that people have to travel long distances to gain access to it.  Deputy McDaid referred to the long journeys Donegal people must make to gain access to such equipment and I appreciate the difficulties that poses for them.  Perhaps the VHI have a role to play in ensuring that such machinery is more evenly distributed among hospitals.</P>
    <P>Competition from foreign insurance companies was mentioned.  The VHI have a community-rating system. Whether a new member is 25, 45 or 65, he or she is quoted the same rate and must pay the same premium.  We hope that system continues to operate, but we must be cautious of potential competition from foreign insurance companies. A large number of the elderly form a substantial proportion of the membership of the VHI.  If a foreign insurance company offers health insurance, it can claim it operates a community-rating system, but if it advertises in, say, only a magazine read by young sporting people for whom it quotes rates, such a company will attract healthy young people and will be able to cherry pick that market and offer cheap health insurance.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="761" /> We should be cautious about claiming that the VHI's maintenance of a community-rating system will enable it compete on an international basis.  We should monitor the position.  The Minister should consider the Australian system of health care.  It provides that if an insurance company is providing health insurance, it must provide details of its membership to the Government or an arbitration group.  On the basis of a company's membership, whether aged, middle aged or young, and the risk factors involved, the company must pay in to a central fund, and such moneys are disbursed to different insurance companies depending on their risk rating. That seems to be a fairer system and it works extremely well in that a company does not run the risk of providing cover for a group weighed down with the elderly and the sick.  The Minister must be the watchdog in this area and monitor competition to ensure that the VHI is not undermined.</P>
    <P>The VHI has provided a tremendous service to the people for almost 40 years.  People who would not have been able to avail of health care were able to do so through their membership of the VHI.  Many private hospitals have been able to provide employment because they operate under the VHI system providing a much needed service to VHI members.  The public health service has gained immensely from the VHI.  A sum of £60 million of VHI money was put into the public sector hospital system last year.  That money has been a valuable subsidy to the public health service, allowing hospitals to provide much needed services.</P>
    <P>On the discussions which were held in the national media some time ago on the regulations which might limit the VHI cover for patients receiving mental treatment, I am glad the Minister seems to nave shelved the recommendations made to him in that regard and that cover for patients receiving mental health care will not be restricted in any way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>More than 1.3 million people are members of the VHI and, <Col N="762" /> consequently, have more than a passing interest in this Bill.  Our health is our wealth and if the VHI does not become more competitive, it will be only the wealthy who will be able to afford cover with that organisation, thereby making more people dependent on the public health service and, consequently, putting more pressure on that already overburdened sector.</P>
      <P>The Bill will help the VHI to compete in the open market on more favourable ground, especially in regard to the control of claim costs.  As my party's spokesperson on mental health, I am worried about the VHI psychiatric cover, especially having regard to the mooted regulation of 40 days in total compared with 180 days for psychiatric patients in hospitals.  In regard to substance abuse, 40 days for every five years was to be allowable compared with 90 days previously.  Statements have been made on this issue but the issue has not been cleared up.  I do not want to see psychiatric patients being discriminated against.  They should be treated in the same way as people who have physical illnesses.  Will the Minister give the up-to-date position on this because people are still worried about the proposed changes in the treatment of psychiatric patients?  I know these regulations were not mooted by the VHI <i>per se</i> but the situation has not been cleared up to everyone's satisfaction.</P>
      <P>The VHI is a non-profit health insurance provider.  It has no share capital and is therefore vulnerable to multinationals and even national insurance companies who have unlimited wealth. Therefore, it is not unreasonable for the VHI to ask the Minister for Health to change its status from statutory corporation to public company so that it would be easier for them to act swiftly in any given situation.  I note the response of the Minister; he will review this request later when the full board is <i>in situ</i> but procrastination is not good, especially in the private sector.  One must act swiftly, especially if there is competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="763" /> There are exemptions from certain regulations in the Competition Act, 1991.  There is no doubt that health care insurance is different from other insurance and the VHI has made a good case in that regard.  I note the Minister's response and, especially, that of Deputy O'Malley.  Nevertheless, that factor should not be dismissed out of hand as there are precedents in the UK and the US for similar exemptions to health care insurers.  Perhaps another look at this would be considered.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation, the VHI will be able to get involved in other health care insurance, such as critical illness cover, chronic care cover, holiday health insurance and long-term disability.  I hope these will not be hived off into high cost plans.  They should be provided at commercial rates if the VHI is to get involved.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see community rating is the cornerstone of VHI policy rather than risk rating, which would only suit young people.  A White Paper on the VHI was suggested by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn who argued cogently on this in her contribution.  Her suggested approach would provide a mechanism for looking at the whole voluntary health insurance sector in an open manner and I am sure valuable information would be thrown up if it were discussed.</P>
    <P>Many problems still arise with VHI cover.  Full cover is still only 90 per cent cover and this causes many problems. People are still unsure of what they must pay when undergoing any procedure. They do not know whether their surgeon, physician, anaesthetist, pathologist, haematologist, etc. is participating in the VHI scheme and the sooner we get all those health providers involved in the full care cover the better for the VHI and subscribers.</P>
    <P>Serious problems exist between a number of the organisations which represent health providers, the Irish Medicial Organisation, the Irish Hospital Consultants' Association, the Independent Hospitals' Association and GPs. People are of the opinion that doctors <Col N="764" /> are making an enormous amount of money.  Those who work with their hands will never make huge amounts of money and, in the long run, most of this money &mdash; if they earn even between £100,000 and £200,000 per annum &mdash; will, in turn, go back to the Exchequer by way of taxation.  People should not be unduly worried about the earnings of consultants or doctors.</P>
    <P>The VHI should make a special effort to come to a reasonable agreement with all health care providers.  The doctors are not that difficult to agree with.  The reason they suggested the change of status of the VHI from statutory corporation to public company is that it would help the organisation in its dealings with providers of health care, institutions and doctors.  It would give it other mechanisms which it does not have at present. It is a method that should be examined. The VHI has been reticent to get involved with GPs and the care they provide.  The time has come for the VHI to look afresh at this because GPs should be considered as health providers. The VHI would be well advised to have consultations with GPs on the provision of health care.</P>
    <P>The VHI should consider providing more money for out-patient procedures because, with modern technology, many procedures which heretofore had to be carried out in hospital no longer require hospitalisation.  We should bear in mind that keeping people in hospital costs a great deal of money.  Procedures such as CAT scans, MRIs, colonoscopies, endoscopies, etc. can all be carried out on an out-patient basis and the VHI is not moving in the right direction in that regard.  There is still a large disclaimer where one has to spend £250 or £450 in the case of a family before one can make a claim in respect of outpatient procedures.  If more emphasis was put on that aspect of care the VHI might be in a position to reduce costs.</P>
    <P>I note that the composition of the board will be increased to 12 members, only two of whom will be medical personnel. It is peculiar that there is always room for lawyers, actuaries, accountants <Col N="765" /> and other people who have little knowledge of the whole area of health care. Nevertheless, the Minister sees fit to nominate to the board only two people from the medical profession.  The medical profession will not be happy about this but, I suppose, they will have to put up with it.  Generally, all consultants have a good knowledge of health care and their opinions should be sought and, perhaps, some others should be nominated to the board.</P>
    <P>In regard to taxation, the relief should be allowed again at the higher rates of tax in order to induce young people to join the VHI.  Tax relief is an inducement when people are joining any health care plan.  An idea mooted by our spokesperson, Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, was that we should have a statutory users' council.  She feels very strongly about this, it is worthy of detailed consideration.  Naturally, users have a great interest in the VHI and would keep the board on its toes.</P>
    <P>The Bill will help the VHI to compete in the open market.  While it may not meet all the requirements of the VHI or of health care providers, it is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the debate on the monitor during the past few hours and I deliberately sat in early to hear the other contributions. The VHI means different things to different people and is complex in many ways.  It is the organisation which deals with people when they are most vulnerable and in need of support and care. The VHI does not provide us with health care but as members it provides us with the wherewithal to acquire that health care.  We need to be careful about how we define it and where we put it in the scale of things.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are inclined to lose the run of ourselves when we come to describe people who are members of the VHI.  I have no doubt but that some VHI subscribers are extremely wealthy.  Equally, I have no doubt but that the majority of the over one million subscribers are people <Col N="766" /> who would have been, like myself, from a one income family.</P>
    <P>In the mid-1970s free health care was removed when one's income exceeded a certain limit.  In other words, those in the position of having to pay most tax did not qualify for health care funding.  I always found this peculiar.  I would have thought the State should provide for everyone equally whereas it provided less to those who contributed most. People with young families must have some form of health care.  That was the reason I became a VHI subscriber and I assume it is the reason the majority of people do so.</P>
    <P>As one who has enjoyed good health and, therefore, not have had to avail of the VHI, the question that comes to mind is why should one continue to pay the contributions, could one do without the cover but there might come a time when one would need cover and then one would be grateful for having continued to subscribe.  We all need health insurance whether we are in our teenage years, our twenties, our child-bearing years or when we are old and infirm.  We are vulnerable and we need a support mechanism.</P>
    <P>If we equate the VHI with a health care provider, which is a more accurate description than health provider, it gives us the wherewithal to choose who will treat us and, to choose the timing in the case of elective surgery.  The benefit of an efficient, affordable and accessible medical care system is essential to a civilised society which provides for the needs of all its citizens.</P>
    <P>The VHI is not just another product in another market, yet that is precisely what the European Union's third non-life insurance directive makes of it.  It provides for a single market in health insurance among all member states.  If left unregulated, such an unrestrained health care market would lead to the kind of chaos with which the US is currently grappling.  In conjunction with the 1994 Health Insurance Act, this Bill proposes a regulatory framework which ensures that the vulnerable &mdash; children, the elderly, those suffering from chronic <Col N="767" /> illnesses or certain other illnesses which may not be chronic or urgent but which we elect to have rectified will not simply be priced out of the private insurance market.  These two items of legislation will ensrue that outside companies cannot engage in a form of medical cherry-picking. Both the Opposition and the Government have made that a priority. The legislation also ensures that the management structures are appropriate to a modern insurance provider, plying its wares in an open and extremely competitive market.  It ensures that the VHI will remain accountable to the Minister and through him or her to Dáil Éireann and, ultimately, to the consumer.</P>
    <P>While welcoming this legislation, I emphasise that Democratic Left remains committed to the principle of a universal health care system free at the point of delivery.  In its document &ldquo;Proposals for a National Health Care Strategy&rdquo; published at the beginning of 1994 the party proposed that the GMS should be extended to cover 50 per cent of the population in the short-term rather than the current 35 per cent.  This is a debate for another day but I am sure people who have an interest in the medical area and, in particular, the GMS would be very interested in the figure of 35 per cent.  It also proposed that the scheme should be extended to cover all people over the age of 65 with the ultimate aim of extending it to all people by the year 2000.  At our conference earlier this year it was proposed that eligibility for the GMS scheme should be calculated on net rather than gross income.</P>
    <P>It is important not to confuse aspirations with the current reality which is that more than one million people are dependent on the VHI for health cover. This must be borne in mind at all times. These people must be guaranteed a service which is both accessible and affordable. We demand regulations in all other areas and it would be a crime not to regulate the method by which one million people provide for their health care.  Middle income people who depend on the VHI are the same PAYE <Col N="768" /> workers who are financially squeezed on all sides.  In recent years they have been especially hard hit by what seems to be a never ending succession of premium hikes.  The most insidious charge of all is the top up bill for medical treatment. People know when there will be an increase in the premium and they can decide whether they want to stay in the scheme, but they never know when they will receive a top up bill.  This matter needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I hope the powers being given to the VHI under the legislation will enable it to provide a more consumer orientated service and to exercise more independence in the conduct of its negotiations. This should be to the ultimate benefit of patients.  I also hope that costs will not be cut at the expense of patient care.  In this context, the implementation of the legislation should be carefully monitored in future years.  I welcome the safeguards built into this Bill and the 1994 Act but I am conscious of the disarray caused by the market led approach to this matter in the UK where the national health service has been run into the ground, with managers much more concerned about the demands of the market than with the needs of the patient.  Any move in that direction here would be retrograde and would mitigate against the eventual introduction of a universal health care service to which my party remains committed. It is our ultimate aim to introduce such a service in this country.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that over the past 40 years the VHI has provided health care insurance for people in an exemplary way.  It is a non-profit making organisation which is dedicated to the service of the public in the same way as other health care agencies and it deserves the powers being given to it under this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>If people were asked for their opinion of the VHI the unanimous view would be that the premia are very expensive and the basic cover does not indemnify them in full in <Col N="769" /> that very often they are asked to pay top up bills to meet the charges of consultants, anaesthetists etc.  Having said that, it is important to point out that some years ago the VHI experienced major difficulties in balancing its accounts and meeting the needs of the board and the demand for insurance and the costs multiplied by a factor much greater than any of us anticipated.  Those demands arose from the requirements of the medical sector and the introduction of technology which was absolutely essential for good diagnostics.</P>
      <P>The public perception is that VHI prernia are extremely costly and members are not covered for all the costs associated with medical care.  As a result they are dissatisfied with the level of cover provided.  There is also a perception that the cost of medicine is excessive.  These costs arise from consultants' fees and the use of technology which is absolutely vital for the detection of disease etc.  The problem in the past was that while the costs escalated the VHI had very little powers and could not say, &ldquo;enough is enough, you cannot increase your costs further&rdquo;. This gave rise to a dilemma in that the costs kept escalating and the premiums had to be increased.</P>
      <P>This is a timely Bill in that it gives the VHI an opportunity to look at the structure of the costs charged by those who provide medical and health care services. While competition is to be welcomed the consumer should be warned that there is no assurance it will lead to a reduction in premia in the future, that it will not be the panacea for all the ills in this area.  Many people will be disappointed if it transpires that the competition relates mainly to the services and products provided by the health care service as opposed to the real cost of the services to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The VHI provides cover for approximately one-third of the population.  On the appointment of the chief executive officer, I was interested to hear the Minister say he wanted to see a successful commercial undertaking, a strong marketing force and strong dynamic <Col N="770" /> development.  Those of us who have dealt with the public sector and know the cost to the State of providing services welcome these objectives.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Common Agricultural Policy: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Cowen on Tuesday, 5 December 1995:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the importance of the Common Agricultural Policy to the economy in general and the rural community in particular, demands that the Government enunciate a cogent and focused response to the EU Commission proposals for change, and that this response be based on an interpretation of the national interest that seeks to maintain as many viable farm holdings on the land as possible.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;approves of the Government's policy in relation to negotiations on the future development of the European Union and in particular their intention to protect the interests of the Irish agriculture, food and rural sectors.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry).</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an opportunity to look at agriculture post 1999.  We are aware that the Common Agricultural Policy has worked to the benefit of the farming community.  We owe a debt of gratitude to my former constituency colleague, the former Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. MacSharry, whose reforms met with scepticism from the <Col N="771" /> agricultural community, but proved successful. Brussels is taking very unusual steps in dealing with the agricultural industry.  The recent cuts in export refunds should sound a warning bell to all those involved in beef production. The cuts have had a drastic effect on farmer confidence and the sheepmeat industry is in crisis.  In spite of the best efforts of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, it would appear he has not been able to secure the top-up premium of £8 per ewe, the amount needed to increase the price to an acceptable level.  In a reply to my recent parliamentary question the Minister referred to a top-up premium of £2-£3 which will mean a continued exodus from sheep farming.  This would be to the detriment of the sheep industry because we would no longer be able to guarantee a continuous supply and would not be able to compete in the French market.</P>
      <P>This year there will be a shortage of home grown grain.  It is time to look to the prospect of allowing land to be used for grain production.  Following the CAP proposals of 1992 it was felt that feed prices would drop but they are now rising.  This will have an adverse effect on intensive producers, especially those involved in winter fattening.  On top of the loss of export refunds they will have to bear increased feed prices.</P>
      <P>We are seeking the restoration of refunds to their previously agreed level. I am aware that at the Council of Ministers' meeting, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry tried to reverse the recent cuts.  While there has been some reversal, it is far from the level necessary to restore confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Milk quotas need to be examined and we will have to put a mechanism in place to allow farmers to expand to a viable level.  We recognise that 40,000 gallons is the minimum that will sustain a dairy farm family.  I hope this debate will give the Minister an opportunity to plan with his colleagues in Europe for post 1999.  There is no point trying to see what we should do in 1998 and then <Col N="772" /> making hasty decisions.  We need long-term planning for expansion within the timeframe.  If we knew the timescale we would be better able to set about drawing up a proper programme.  When we see the level of confusion in the Commission there is a definite need for decisions to be taken as quickly as possible. Commissioner Fischler does not appear to have a plan as to how agriculture will proceed in the future.  I find that worrying because he who hesitates is lost.  From his recent publication he appears to be going three different ways, (1) to maintain the <i>status quo;</i> (2) to carry out a radical reform of CAP; (3) to develop and build on 1992 reforms.  The Minister and his colleagues will have to influence Commissioner Fischler's thinking and will have to point out the need to maintain income on family farms at a level that will maintain rural society as we know it.  We would not like to see a situation develop where the small family farms have disappeared and we have large farms without families.  That would be to the detriment of rural society and the country.  As one third of the population lives in the greater Dublin area it proves the need to ensure there is no further reduction in the rural community.</P>
    <P>The expansion of EU membership to include the Eastern European states must be planned.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and his colleagues need to set the agenda from an Irish point of view during our Presidency in 1996.  The need for effective action to protect family farms and smaller units is very important and I know the Minister will try his best to do that.  He will be judged on how he guides Commissioner Fischler on agricultural reform.  The need to maintain small family units should be made clear, whether by means of an extra quota, the continuation of the support system or some other mechanism.  It is imperative that the Minister makes his colleagues in Europe aware of our grave concern about the future of the CAP.</P>

      <P>The motion before us is about the first sign of life I have seen from Deputy Cowen for quite some time in his position as Opposition spokesman on agriculture.  The way it has been formulated constitutes a very poor effort indeed.  I do not blame Deputy Hugh Byrne, Deputy Ellis or Deputy Nolan.  I blame Deputy Cowen because he is in a position to know more of what is behind the matters raised in this motion than he appeared to pretend here last evening.</P>
      <P>The motion even misunderstands the nature of the documents to which it refers.  The Minister, in a well focused contribution last evening, made that very point, pointing out quite rightly that what the motion describes as proposals in fact are discussion documents, of which there are two, which merit much deeper consideration than Fianna Fáil Deputies have given them so far. I was very impressed by the difference between the Minister 's treatment of the issues last evening, when he examined them and addressed them with some shape and direction to what he said, in stark contrast to what members of the Opposition said when they, and particularly Deputy Cowen appeared to be more interested in throwing political sheafs than in doing anything concrete to assist Irish farmers.  It is interesting to note also that, although Deputy Joe Walsh, who was here a moment ago, is a former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and still a member of the Fianna Fáil front bench, his name does not appear on the motion.  I wonder why; perhaps it is because the Deputy, decent man that he is, recognises that he failed utterly to prevent the very thing about which Deputy Cowen complained and warned of last evening.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is because Deputy Joe Walsh is rightly ashamed to put his name to a motion for debate on agriculture when that very motion and the contributions to the debate so far by members of the Fianna Fáil Party are critical of the Deputy in what he failed to do as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  So well he might be ashamed to put his name to the motion: Fianna Fáil's record since 1989 on changes in the European Union's agricultural policy and the Uruguay round of GATT negotiations has been pathetic, vacillating and shameful.</P>
      <P>I will catalogue its shameful record. The Fianna Fáil Party demurred only very feebly when the Commissioner, former Deputy Ray MacSharry, first opened the European Community's flank to attack by the United States. Again that party demurred very feebly when the Commissioner MacSharry went on to sign the Blair House Agreement, the terms of which rendered it more like a document of surrender by the European Community than an agreement between two negotiating parties.</P>
      <P>Subsequently Deputy Joe Walsh spent much of his time, as Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, endeavouring to convince us that the Blair House Agreement did not hold any terrors for us, when we all knew perfectly well &mdash; including people like Deputies Hugh Byrne and Nolan, although they had to hold their peace at the time &mdash; what road the European Community, in this instance under the guidance of Commissioner Ray MacSharry, was setting out on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993, very belatedly, the then Taoiseach. Deputy Albert Reynolds, announced to an avidly expectant world that he had formed a strategic alliance no less, with the then President of France, Monsieur Francois Mitterand, to oppose the MacSharry proposals. Unfortunately, that alliance suffered the <Col N="775" /> same fate as all of Deputy Reynold's other alliances &mdash; it turned out to be a temporary little arrangement and the strategic partner upped and walked out on him.</P>
    <P>Throughout 1992 and 1993 I warned consistently of the dangers inherent in the MacSharry proposals on CAP reform and in his approach to the Uruguay round of negotiations.  I attended meetings in different parts of the country, wrote newspaper articles and spoke in this House about the problems the MacSharry proposals would cause Irish farmers.  I am happy to say I was not alone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There were other people in my party who held the same view, as did the IFA and the ICMSA but apparently all of that proved to be absolutely unfathomable to the then Government and Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Indeed, in the course of 1993, it proved almost impossible to get the agreement of the Government to discuss any of these issues in the House. The Government then consistently ignored warnings in the House and outside it from the farming organisations. When I warned of these dangers now coming to pass &mdash; to which I will revert in a moment &mdash; I was accused by a prominent member of one of the then Government parties, no less a person than my good friend, Deputy Jim Kemmy, of fomenting a trade war with the United States.  In fact a war did take place.  What happened in the course of the negotiations on the Uruguay round was a war, when &ldquo;General&rdquo; MacSharry retreated, the European Community lost and the United States and its allies in the Cairns group won.  The result was a seriously biased agreement that placed enormously onerous obligations on the farmers of the European Union and handed all of the gains to the United States.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="776" /> What happened then?  Once the GATT agreement had been signed Fianna Fáil went into raptures of ecstatic praise of Commissioner Ray MacSharry and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Joe Walsh; no praise was too high for them, no compliment too overblown for those two heroes.  Fianna Fáil presented the results of the Uruguay round, the GATT agreement, as the be-all and end-all, contending it would sort out all of our problems; we had a grand new agreement on world trade, everything in the garden was rosy and the Blair House Agreement was not a bogie man at all.</P>
    <P>Again what happened?  We can now see the very concrete results.  The recent reduction in export refunds for beef is a direct result of what Commissioner MacSharry agreed to and which Deputy Joe Walsh, the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry failed to oppose.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Cowen complain about reductions in the beef refunds.  I might have had some belief in his sincerity if I did not also remember that he was a member of the party and of the Government that acquiesced in the rape of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>It has not all been entirely dark. Although the predictions I made in 1992 and 1993 transpire to have been broadly right &mdash; it gives me no pleasure whatsoever to say that &mdash; some people were lucky.  Our tillage sector was fortunate this year: what saved it from the full rigours of the Uruguay round agreement was the coincidence of a good harvest in much of Europe and a bad harvest in north America.  Deputy Cowen certainly had nothing to do with it, nor had Deputy Hugh Byrne or Deputy Nolan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The paper on strategy produced by the European Union Commission last week identifies three possible options for the Common Agricultural Policy in the context of <Col N="777" /> enlargement of the Union.  As the Minister pointed out last evening, that is an excessively narrow context within which to examine these issues; there are wider issues involved which we must ensure are fully taken into account.  The three options identified by the Commission are the <i>status quo,</i> radical reform and the third is described as developing the 1992 approach; in other words, developing the policy lines set out by former Commissioner MacSharry, praised to the skies by Fianna Fáil, now beginning to cause Irish farmers enormous problems.</P>
      <P>Reading that document it takes no great sagacity to see where the Commission is heading.  First, significantly, it does not want the Agriculture Ministers to discuss these documents before they go to the Madrid European Council. Ask yourself why and you will immediately come up with the answer: they do not want the Agriculture Ministers to shoot down any of these documents before they unleash them on the Heads of State.</P>
      <P>The Commission then says that, while the <i>status quo</i> now appears to be the logical option, it would present major, long-term market and budgetary problems &mdash; that is one of them shot down. It goes on to say that it does not advocate the radical reform approach &mdash; number two option shot down, and concludes that a resolute continuation of the 1992 reform approach would cause less economic distortion than the other two options.  As I have said, it does not need any great sagacity to see that the Commission will push that approach, that of continuing with the MacSharry reforms, with the Uruguay round approach, which Fianna Fáil first failed to oppose with any vigour or commitment, and which the Fianna Fáil Party, including Deputies Joe Walsh and Cowen, praised to the skies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this motion Fianna Fáil is complaining about the direct, the inevitable and the predicted outcome of their incompetence and neglect.  I submit, Sir, <Col N="778" /> that they would serve Irish farmers better if, instead of putting down nonsensical motions like the one before the House, they were to take themselves off to some suitable place of retreat, cover themselves in sackcloth and ashes and pray for forgiveness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share the fraction of time I have with my colleague, Deputy Penrose.  This debate is welcome. It is important that we should have an opportunity to consider the changes which are likely to occur not just in the Common Agricultural Policy but also in Europe generally in the next few years and how they will impact on the Common Agricultural Policy.  The one thing we cannot ignore is that change is inevitable.  It is inevitable because of changes in development and technology, particularly in the area of animal and plant genetics.  This gives huge potential for increasing the capacity for agricultural production. There are developments relating to manipulation and enhancement of growth and the production of different types of meat products from animals through the use of chemical agents and through genetics.  While many consumers would be appalled at the prospect of these developments, there is an inevitability about some of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second reason change is unavoidable in the Common Agricultural Policy relates to what is about to happen in Europe.  Nobody would doubt that there will be quite a number of new entrants to the European Union in the next ten, 15 or 20 years.  Most of these entrants' agriculture is quite underdeveloped. When they join, their agricultural output will grow considerably and that will have a huge impact on the Common Agricultural Policy.  At present, some of the countries applying to join the European Union employ about 25 per cent of their workforce in agriculture.  The corresponding figure for the EU generally is about 5 or 6 per cent.  Agriculture <Col N="779" /> accounts for a much bigger fraction of the gross domestic product in these countries than it does in the European Union.  Inevitably, production will increase and that will create pressure on prices and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dukes mentioned the options outlined in the report.  The first relates to the objective of maintaining the <i>status quo.</i> It is unrealistic, foolish, simpleminded and naïve to believe for one second that maintaining the <i>status quo</i> is an option.  It is not an option because of the developments in technology and the state of the economies in the countries that are lining up to join the European Union.  This can be crystallised in the expression &ldquo;let the market rip&rdquo;; in other words, let EU prices go to world market prices.  That would not be desirable from the point of view of this country because of the difficulties it would create for many people here.  At the same time it would be unrealistic not to understand that there is a strong force driving in that direction and, to some extent, that force will be felt in the developments that take place in Europe.</P>
    <P>The third possibility is the one that appears to be favoured by the Commission, that is, the development of the present system of income supports.  One of the alarming aspects of this is the suggestion that the income supports for people involved in agriculture should come from individual countries.  It would have serious consequences for this country if that were to happen.  It is highly desirable that the Minister should hold out strongly for the provision of income supports, if they are provided, from central European funds rather than placing an obligation on individual countries to provide them.</P>
    <P>Let me reiterate what I said regarding change.  There is no point in thinking we can resist change.  We have to accept it and make the most of it.  It is imperative, if we are to make the most of change, that we be prepared to innovate, to alter the way we do things to accommodate <Col N="780" /> to that change and exploit the opportunities that are there.  There is no doubt that there are huge opportunities for us if we are prepared to invest in research and development and science and technology and, above all, if we are prepared to innovate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to say a few words in this debate.  This is an opportune motion as it focuses our minds on the type of policy formulation response that we in Ireland must put forward to EU proposals for change.  Our response in the past has not always been the optimum one from the viewpoint of the national interest.  When the farm modernisation scheme came into being on our accession to the EU, we focused on price support and were driven by the price variable.  As somebody who worked with farmers on a practical level, I do not believe that was the correct approach: it certainly did not help the small farmers.  It widened the differential in the price of meat in countries like Holland and huge yields and cheap manioc and tapioca coming into the ports at Rotterdam, and it took us many years to catch up.  That is why it is important that we should focus on our response at this stage.</P>
      <P>The recent EU White Paper on the future of the Common Agricultural Policy is a document of immense importance not just to farmers but to Ireland. The document, while primarily a discussion paper aimed at the Madrid Summit, puts down a number of markers for future policy decisions.  The proposals contained in the paper, if adopted, together with the CAP reforms in 1992 and the GATT agreement could amount to a complete altering of our membership of the European Union. The maintenance of the CAP is of vital national importance to Ireland, and the Government should defend it with all the political power at its disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section of the White Paper dealing with developments in Eastern European agriculture contains suggestions that these countries be given greater <Col N="781" /> access to EU markets and that subsidised exports from the EU should be reduced in these countries.  We all recognise the need for trade for these development countries in Central and Eastern Europe, but there is a price to be paid, and it should be paid by the European Union as a whole, not by regions such as Ireland which are heavily dependent on agricultural exports. Ireland could pay on the double by being undermined in our development markets within the EU and being forced out of the markets in Central and Eastern Europe.  Concessionary imports from Central and Eastern Europe in the livestock sector has a direct and immediate impact on Ireland.  Ireland should be continuously on its guard to ensure that any concessionary imports into the EU do not impinge unfairly on Ireland's interests.  Furthermore, the EU should seek a corresponding increase in the EU-subsidised export quota under GATT.  In other words, every 1,000 tonnes in concessionary imports from Central and Eastern Europe would lead to a 1,000 tonnes increase in the subsidised quota recently negotiated under GATT.  This would ensure that the solution to the Eastern European problem was not paid for solely by European farmers and, in a disproportionate way, by Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>The CAP rules are not written in stone, but it would be no exaggeration to say that the CAP was and continues to be the economic cornerstone of Ireland's membership of the EU.  We should never allow it to be diluted or changed without full assessment of the short-term and long-term economic consequences.  If there are losses arising from any change, they must be fully compensated for and the compensation should be guaranteed.  Ireland should resist any attempt to renationalise the CAP.  This trend towards renationalisation is contrary to the Single Market and is totally inconsistent with the drive for European Monetary Union.</P>
    <P>Ireland needs to further develop its agri-food industries to bring about <Col N="782" /> greater rural development and to stabilise the population decline in the rural and smaller urban areas.  The CAP is vital if this is to be achieved.  Research work done by the ESRI has shown that if the CAP reforms in 1992 were implemented without compensation they would almost totally offset the positive economic development arising from the Structural Funds.  This is the challenge facing Ireland.  Ireland should never allow any discussion of or changes in the CAP to be divorced from the overall economic and monetary discussions at European level.  I am particularly concerned about the impact on rural areas which have been ravaged and decimated by depopulation, one cause of which is the buying up of land under EU accession schemes when elderly farmers die.</P>
    <P>The drift from rural Ireland is contributing to rural degeneration.  The consequences is the loss of post offices, churches, schools and Garda stations. Some rural areas which traditionally had football teams are unable to field teams.  There are areas in north Westmeath suffering a 33 per cent reduction in population.  The focus should be on rural regeneration and policy initiatives should be pursued to ensure the retention of the maximum number of viable family farms.  These are areas where high levels of unemployment are endemic and family members drift to the large urban areas to seek employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>I propose that the Government consider putting in place rural renewal incentives which would permit significant tax write offs over a set period for small companies or entrepreneurs setting down roots in these areas.  If we do not pursue some initiative of this nature we will preside over the death of rural Ireland.  This type of scheme could be similar in design to the BES scheme, the section 32 relief for films or the urban renewal schemes.  We have to consider <Col N="783" /> this because rural Ireland is at a crossroads. I ask the Government to ensure that initiatives of this type are considered carefully in formulating a response to the challenges ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I recently prepared and published a report on economic, social and educational disadvantage on Cork's northside.  The frightening statistics in that report are mirrored up and down the country, whether in Southill, Neilstown or Coolock.  There are approximately six areas which have the same inherent problems.  After publishing that report I learnt in reply to a parliamentary question that 160,000 farmers will receive £0.75 billion in direct payments this year which is an average of £4,699.  However, the Common Agricultural Policy has not benefited all farmers equally.</P>
      <P>Large ranchers have gained immeasurably from the CAP.  However, according to the Central Statistics Office 1987 household budget survey, 23 per cent of the poorest farm families had a gross household income of under £5,000.  They are surely the farmers who should be targeted under any national or European agricultural policy in the same way that industrial policy should but does not focus on our urban unemployment blackspots.  A fundamental reform of the Common Agricultural Policy combined with massive affirmative action and measures aimed at the poorest farmers is long overdue.  Of course, this is political dynamite and it will require considerable courage for politicians throughout Europe to say to the large farmers, who have fed at the CAP through for decades, &ldquo;so far and no further&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, with the exception of programmes such as the subsidised milk quota restructuring scheme, the Common Agricultural Policy operates on a simple principle &mdash; the more one has, the more one gets.  Direct payments <Col N="784" /> such as headage and setaside have disproportionately benefited large farmers and this will continue to be the case unless CAP is subjected to a root and branch overhaul.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy was devised in the aftermath of the World War II when mainland Europe's economies had been devasted and large parts of the Continent were threatened with starvation.  CAP was aimed at making Europe self-sufficient in food production. It succeeded beyond its architects' wildest dreams.  Not only has Europe become self sufficient in the past few decades but we have witnessed the obscenity of beef mountains, wine lakes, mountains of butter and seas of milk at a time when half the world's population goes to bed hungry.</P>
    <P>CAP has undoubtedly succeeded in making Europe self-sufficient.  It has not however succeeded in reducing farm poverty.  The cohesion which we hear on the lips of the EU's politicians and Eurocrats has passed Europe's smallest farmers by very swiftly.  I would argue that CAP has been the single most important mechanism in driving a wedge between large prosperous farmers and smaller marginal farmers.  It has been estimated, for example, that the top 17 per cent of farmers, those with over 100 acres, captured nearly 40 per cent of price support expenditure.  Far from effectively addressing the issue of declining agricultural income, the CAP experiment has failed dismally.</P>
    <P>Between 1973 when Ireland joined the EEC and 1985, real farm incomes remained static while over 60 per cent of farmers were forced to survive on less than half the average industrial wage and a high proportion received less than a quarter the average industrial wage. The average income for the top 25 per cent of EU farmers is 20 times that of the bottom 25 per cent while in Ireland the ratio is 8:1.  These are staggering figures. When we talk about overhauling CAP we should look at those figures <Col N="785" /> rather than the argument put before us. Some 40 per cent of gross income for farm families with holdings of under 30 acres is accounted for by social welfare. These are small farmers in Ireland who did not benefit from CAP.  In effect the Common Agricultural Policy facilitates transfers from small farmers, consumers and taxpayers to larger wealthy farmers. CAP is the story of Robin Hood in reverse and is robbing the poor to help the rich.</P>
    <P>The reforms introduced a couple of years ago attempted to address some of the problems inherent in CAP and in particular attempted to halt surplus production. However, I would argue that they merely addressed the symptoms of over production and over cultivation rather than tackling the fundamental flaws inherent in CAP.  Let us look at the setaside scheme where farmers are in effect paid for leaving their land fallow. Again the more acres one had the more one gets.  In 1993 the average setaside payment received by farmers was £2,455.  In 1994, this had jumped to £3,292 with some farmers receiving bonanza payments of between £25,000 and £50,000.</P>
    <P>The principle behind the scheme, like the principle behind so many EU schemes, is a good one.  In an attempt to avoid the environmental consequences of over farming, the use of setaside land for any purpose other than the production of non food crops is prohibited. However, the Irish experience is that little use has been made of setaside land for the designated non food purposes. With some notable exceptions, such as the 484 hectare oil seed project in Leinster, large farmers have simply left their land fallow and reaped thousands of pounds in direct payments.  Setaside could have provided us with an opportunity to develop bio-fuel and other non food crops, develop market niches in these areas and become market leaders.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="786" /> Since the Common Agricultural Policy was first introduced, farm production and non-production has been subsidy rather than market led.  It is ironic that the very parties who for ideological reasons &mdash; despite the fact that they deny they have any &mdash; argued fiercely against interventionist policies should also be so vociferous in defence of CAP, which is surely the mother of all interventions.  CAP is already costing us dearly.  Irish consumers pay around £20 over the odds each week in taxes and higher food bills.  With EU enlargement, which is both inevitable and desirable, the burden on taxpayers will increase further.</P>
    <P>The draft Commission report which will be submitted to EU heads of Government rightly concludes that the artificially high prices guaranteed to farmers under the CAP are unsustainable, with or without EU expansion. The report suggests a series of reforms which would eventually largely return control of agricultural policy to national Governments.</P>
    <P>It will require considerable courage for EU Governments to face down the big farmers and argue for a reformed agricultural policy which will encourage market rather than subsidy led production. It will require courage for them to argue for a policy which will reduce the burden on consumers and taxpayers while shifting supports from big farmers to small farmers who are currently barely able to scratch a living from their fields and who are forced to take up part-time work in order to make ends meet.</P>
    <P>Former Agriculture Commissioner. Ray MacSharry, whose name was bandied around during this debate, began the process of CAP reform.  I hope that the Irish Government will take a lead next month in Madrid and argue for a root and branch overhaul of a system which has become unworkable, unsustainable and inefficient.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Walsh and Clohessy.  Having listened to the sterling performance of Deputy Lynch I am sure she will vote with the Opposition.  It is timely that the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Agriculture should put down this motion.  It is a number of years since the CAP was reformed by Commissioner MacSharry who took a courageous stand at the time in tackling that reform.</P>
      <P>We cannot debate this matter too soon and it is important it starts when there is conflict between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture on where the EU is going and the proposed involvement of a number of Eastern states.  Until that is sorted out it is difficult to see how any commissioner can agree an agricultural policy for the EU.</P>
      <P>There are three proposals, the first is to maintain the <i>status quo.</i> I do not believe that is feasible or possible and will be rejected.  The second is for a major overhaul of existing policy and that Irish farm prices should move towards world market prices, which would be unsustainable.  We are left with the third option which is to extend the existing scheme.  The Commissioner and the Council will tinker with the various schemes and that is probably what will happen.  It will have implications for Irish farmers and agriculture.</P>
      <P>Since our accession to the EU in the 1970s there have been major changes in Irish agriculture.  We have seen structural changes in farm sizes and in employment.  It is unfortunate that the numbers employed in agriculture have fallen dramatically since then.  The propulation outside Dublin is predominantly rural and the maintenance of rural population numbers is a national policy goal.  It follows, therefore, that any development is inextricably linked with countering widespread unemployment in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One area which is highlighted is the agri-food sector and, to an extent, this <Col N="788" /> has been highlighted by those in the food industry.  A number of major players bought factories or took over existing operations in the UK and Northern Ireland because of exchange rate difficulties. No later than today the ICOS stated the strength of the IR£ at £1.035 is putting jobs at risk.  Many food manufacturers and exporters are unable to sustain that level of exchange rate.</P>
    <P>The IFA called today for a major debate on the single currency.  It is time this matter was examined.  If something is not done soon problems will occur in the labour market.  It is not just that manufacturers receive a lower price for their products in the UK but English food producers who export produce to Ireland are at a distinct advantage because of the weakness of the £.</P>
    <P>EU agriculture policy will tend to reflect global trends towards more reliance on markets.  Various measures such as compensatory or direct income payments exert a certain holding influence on agriculture labour but the movement of labour out of full-time farming is expected to continue.  This is an unfortunate reality that we must face up to.  Previous speakers dealt with the problem of set aside.  We are delighted that the problems in the 1980s with butter mountains and milk lakes have been resolved and we no longer have ships off the Cork coast holding Irish beef for eventual sale to Russia at huge costs to the EU taxpayer.  However, it is difficult to explain why we pay Irish farmers to leave the land fallow.  The Government must examine this matter.</P>
    <P>There was a debate in the media on biofuels.  In Carlow Teagasc carried out major work in this area.  There is a problem with the economic production of biofuels which the Government should examine.  Present estimates are that fossil fuel reserves will run out within five or six generations.  Someone must examine the matter.  Why do we not take up the challenge now instead of leaving it to our grandchildren?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> The Government must examine the food sector if it is serious about maintaining jobs there.  CAP reform will become more important as the years go by.  It is unfortunate that it was left to the Opposition to begin the debate in this area.  A number of agricultural sectors are doing well, for example, dairying. There is still a shortage of home grown grain although production has increased.  The Minister should look at these problems as sufficient lip service has been paid to the various sectors. Unless something is done for sheep farmers many of them will give up sheep farming.  The problem is there is no alternative for them as they cannot go into dairying because of the quotas, nor can they go into beef or grain production. The CAP must be examined now rather than in four years' time.</P>

      <P>I support the motion on our concern about the draft policy document on the Common Agricultural Policy, the study on alternative strategies for the development of relations in the field of agriculture between the EU and associated countries with a view to their future accession.  Draft documents tend to become future policy and it is right that Fianna Fáil, being associated with the negotiation of the present position of agriculture in Europe, should raise this matter and warn that we must be mindful of the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were not sufficiently alarmed before I came into the House I would have been by Deputy Lynch's speech. She stated that fundamental reform of CAP is long overdue.  It needs a root and branch overhaul, it is Robin Hood in reverse and has failed.  Is that general Government policy or the policy of one of the parties in Government?  Deputy Lynch stated that conservative parties &mdash; I assume she is referring to those on the right &mdash; support this policy and that CAP was the mother of all interventionist policies.  I doubt if that exchange <Col N="790" /> would go down well at a farmers' meeting in Wexford or west Cork.</P>

      <P>Trying to simply maintain the <i>status quo,</i> even after 2000, would not appear to be a good policy choice in this context, although it might be a feasible option for a limited number of years.</P>
      <P>Under option 2 it states:</P>
      <P>Options for a new and radical reform of the CAP have been presented by a number of high ranking agricultural economists, inside and outside the debate on CEC accession.  For them, the CAP as it stands now is still too inefficient, too distorting and too bureaucratic to present a sound basis for the future and in particular for enlargement to Central Europe.  Although there are a number of nuances as far as the details are concerned there is a large consensus among them on the following features of a new CAP: &mdash; no support prices &mdash; further decoupling of compensatory payments &mdash; direct income support payments &mdash; and payments for environmental services on a national basis with or without Community co-financing.</P>
      <P>Under option 3 it states:</P>
      <P>Following the logic of the 1992 reforms compensatory payments are meant to compensate farmers for significant price support cuts.  However, to a limited extent, the 1992 reforms already link environmental and social considerations to the direct income payments.  For the longer-term it may deserve consideration to develop this approach further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="791" /> This draft document has been presented by the Commission for consideration in Europe.  A Government Deputy has applauded it, the Tánaiste supports enlargement and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry does not. Those in our agricultural sector should be extremely concerned about this.</P>
    <P>If all or some of this proposal is adopted support prices and quotas will be eliminated.  Premium headage payments, which amounted to the payment of in the region of £750 million to approximately 160,000 farmers this year, will also be eliminated.  Deputy Lynch stated that this means an average of more than £4,000 per annum per farmer.  The elimination of three quarters of a billion pounds in direct income to farmers would be catastrophic and sound the death-knell for farmers.  As these payments were painstakingly negotiated they must be protected. Alternatively, it is claimed that premium payments could be made by national Governments.  One can imagine the difficulties that would create for our finances and the Minister for Social Welfare.  The Government is having enough difficulty agreeing the Estimates without allocating an additional £750 million to the Agriculture Estimate for next year.  The document states that we are inexorably heading towards world prices which are between one-third and one-half of our prices.  I do not need to spell out the implications of such prices for Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>It appears the European Union consulted many prominent economists on this matter but their deliberations did not extend to Dublin or the Minister's office.  We were not briefed on the position and when the Minister was presented with the bombshell at the last meeting of the Council of Ministers he stated he would raise the matter with the Taoiseach.  That is a rather lame way to address the matter.  I do not know of <Col N="792" /> any previous Minister for Agriculture who attempted to pass his responsibilities in that manner.</P>
    <P>A number of Members referred to exchange rate difficulties, in particular with sterling.  For the past six or seven months our food produce has had to compete unfairly on the UK market because of the weakness of sterling and various organisations representing Irish agriculture have issued statements about this.  ICOS stated that:</P>
    <P>...the Irish Pound has been trading at above parity for almost six months now and there is no sign of any change in this position.  This exchange rate has reduced the competitiveness of Irish exports to the UK.</P>
    <P>It went on to state:</P>
    <P>The strong Irish Pound against Sterling has reduced returns for all Irish food sales to the UK and cheese is particularly hard hit.  For each 1p change in the exchange rate, the return to Irish exporters is reduced by over 1p per gallon of milk equivalent.</P>
    <P>What has been our response to this? Have proposals been submitted to Government?  Have there been suggestions for a contingency proposal? Nothing has been done about the matter. ICOS went on to criticise the Government's failure to take steps to reduce the cost of doing business here and stated that these cuts must be reduced to the lower levels which apply in the UK because of the damage they are doing to the Irish food industry.  The difficulties of farmers are being ignored.</P>
    <P>The increase in the importation of lamb into the European Union from New Zealand and Argentina almost went unnoticed at a time when thousands of Irish farmers marched in desperation in this city to get the Ministers to do something about the matter.  A recent press release from the IFA states:</P>
    <P>Last Friday's meeting, at which <Col N="793" /> Minister Yates had his representatives, agreed to allow in an additional 8,850 tonnes from New Zealand and an additional 2,000 tonnes from Argentina.  These combined increases of 10,850 tonnes are the equivalent of almost 600,000 head of lambs.</P>
    <P>The appallingly high and drastic cuts in export refunds are of major concern. While the Minister was in New Zealand on a little junket, the eye was off the ball&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that export refund on beef is costing our industry dearly.  Members may have read in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal</i> that this was only a temporary measure and that it would be restored.  This has not happened, the 35 per cent cut still applies and anybody who visited a mart during the week will know that the price of cattle has reduced.  There is major cause for concern because of the lack of support for hard won rights for farmers.  This does not augur well for the future unless people pull up their socks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies Walsh and Nolan for giving me the opportunity to express my party's viewpoint on this issue.  The agriculture industry has done exceptionally well under the Common Agricultural Policy.  I welcome the motion as it provides the House with an opportunity to discuss agricultural matters in depth and chart the way forward as we approach the turn of the century with regard to our rights in and the contributions we receive from the European Union.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Political developments have dramatically changed the map of Europe in the past five years and are likely to have an equally dramatic impact on the workings of the Common Agricultural Policy during the next five <Col N="794" /> years.  Plans are well advanced to expand the European Union eastwards. This process of enlargement could result in up to ten new member states joining the Union extending it from the Baltic to the Balkans.</P>
    <P>Most of the aspirant members are countries with substantial food production and food export industries, Poland and Hungary being notable examples.  If the benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy were extended to all these countries, the cost of maintaining the present array of price supports would rise dramatically.</P>
    <P>Recent studies indicate that bringing the five Central European countries into the European Union would increase the overall Union budget by well over £20 billion per year.  Of this, agricultural spending would account for up to £10 billion.  This forecast is based on the assumption that the Common Agricultural Policy would continue to offer the present level and range of price subsidies and income supports.</P>
    <P>For the people who have to pick up the bill, the taxpayers of Germany, this is not an attractive prospect.  It is unrealistic.  The Germans contribute about 80 per cent of the EU budget or roughly £10 billion per year.  With reunification already putting a strain on their public finances, the German authorities are likely to think twice before extending the benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy as currently constituted to the dairy farmers of the Central European countries.</P>
    <P>It is estimated, for instance, that the former West Germany is currently channelling about £85 billion in Government aid into what used to be East Germany. Something will have to give and that means a cut in EU agricultural spending.  In other words, the entire process of enlargement will accelerate moves towards a comprehensive reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. This is due for reform before the end of the century while a further round of GATT changes will inevitably push <Col N="795" /> Europe towards a more market-based pricing system for all agricultural produce.</P>
    <P>Any change in the operation of the Common Agricultural Policy would have major repercussions for this country. Ireland receives almost £1.5 billion in payments each year, a huge sum for a country of its size.  Any major reform of the Common Agricultural Policy would, therefore, pose a major threat to that important stream of income.  Given the scale of the moneys involved, it is highly unlikely that any significant shortfall in receipts from Brussels could be made up by the Exchequer.  To put the matter in context, the cash we receive is roughly equal to about 10 per cent of total annual Government spending.</P>
    <P>If the Common Agricultural Policy is to be reformed, it is vital that we do everything we can to ensure that our interests are protected and that this country does not become an innocent victim of the enlargement process.  At the very least we should look for the gradual phasing in of any new regime so that the economy would have time to adjust to the considerable financial shock that could be involved.</P>
    <P>We have a fight on our hands and it is up to the Minister and the Department to lead that fight on behalf of our farmers and taxpayers.  That fight must begin now.  We cannot wait until the end of the century to start defending our corner because if we do, we will have left it too late and will be swamped.</P>
    <P>The drive towards enlargement is unstoppable and there is no point in opposing it.  The eastward expansion of the European Union is in Germany's strategic interest and, as the EU's paymaster, the Germans are well positioned to face down any opposition to enlargement.</P>
    <P>We must concentrate our efforts on ensuring that a revised Common Agricultural Policy does not penalise our agriculture industry or erode the living <Col N="796" /> standards of our farmers.  The Government should get its act together and signal clearly the kind of agricultural regime it wants to see in place in 2001.</P>
    <P>One possible route that reform could take is the delinkage of supports from production.  In other words, farmers would no longer be paid production-related subsidies, but would be compensated directly by way of income supports. Other alternatives include paying farmers for acting effectively as guardians of the natural environment.  I would like to know what the Government's views are on &ldquo;cheque in the post&rdquo; farming regimes of this type and how they would affect us here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Whatever changes take place, our agriculture industry must be given some freedom to expand and develop.  In the dairy industry, for instance, the present quota regime would probably be unsustainable against a background of falling prices.  Farmers would want to increase output to compensate for the reduction in milk prices.  This may mean the end of the quota system as we know it by the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>Our farmers are probably the most efficient milk producers in Europe and our grass-based system means that our costs of production are well below those of our European rivals.  It has been said by some industry experts that Ireland is the only European country capable of matching New Zealand in terms of milk production efficiency.</P>
    <P>Milk is an industry in which we enjoy a significant competitive advantage.  A relaxation of the quota regime could offer significant benefits to the economy. What we might see emerging is a two-tier A and B quota system.  Farmers would enjoy guaranteed prices for their A quota and would be free to produce as much milk as they wanted as part of their B quota, but this milk would have to be sold at world market prices without any EU supports.  As Europe's most efficient milk producers, we would be free to increase our output substantially. <Col N="797" /> This would be good news for existing dairy farmers and for those seeking to enter the milk business for the first time.</P>
    <P>Reform of the quota system would also halt the continuing decline in the number of dairy farmers in the country. A recent study by Teagasc forecast that the total number of dairy herds in Ireland would fall from 47,000 at present to just 28,000 in ten years' time. Away from the farm, reform of the quota system would also be good news for our processing industry which could improve its economies of scale by increasing its volume throughput.</P>
    <P>Neither the Minister nor the Department has had much to say so far about the major changes which are imminent in the European agricultural regime. The Minister should lead the debate on this issue, not follow it.  He should set out clearly his objectives and the kind of agricultural industry he wants to see in place in this country in five years' time.</P>
    <P>A reformed Common Agricultural Policy need not necessarily be a disaster for Ireland.  It could even have positive consequences for this country.  We must, however, get our act together now if we are to have any influence on the important decisions that are imminent in this area.  We cannot afford to let this issue drift.  I ask the Minister to tackle it with urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to discuss the recent European Commission's communication on the effect of enlargement and the accompanying agricultural strategy paper.  It is useful that this debate is being held at this time because it is clear from the trend and tone of the debate that there is a misconception on the Opposition Benches in relation to the nature of the Commission paper.  The debate, therefore, gives an opportunity to clearly indicate <Col N="798" /> what the paper contains and to set out the Government's position on it.</P>
      <P>The Commission documents are discussion papers only, although admittedly very important ones.  The papers do not contain any firm proposals although they identify three possible options for the Common Agricultural Policy in the context of enlargement. The first formal discussion on the papers will take place at the Madrid European Council next week.</P>
      <P>Detailed decisions on the terms for enlargement will be made in the long-term rather than very soon.  The European Council decided some two-and-a-half years ago in Copenhagen that &ldquo;the associated countries in Central and Eastern Europe that so desire shall become members of the European Union&rdquo;.  That position was subscribed to by the previous Government and it is also the position of the present Government. It is clear that a period of economic modernisation in these countries will be necessary before membership can be envisaged for any of them.  There is a major job of transition still to be completed before all of these countries will be ready to meet the terms set down in the conclusions of the Copenhagen European Council meeting.  It is instructive to reflect on those terms.</P>
      <P>As agreed at Copenhagen &ldquo;accession will take place as soon as an associated country is able to assume the obligations of membership by satisfying the economic and political conditions required&rdquo;. More specifically, the European Council went on to state that &ldquo;membership requires ... the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the union&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is likely that the accession negotiations with the applicant countries will coincide with the next round of international trade negotiations under the World Trade Organisation, the successor to the GATT.  Each of these <Col N="799" /> developments will obviously have a bearing on the other.  It is clear that these complex negotiations will require careful and lengthy preparation at both national and Union levels.  For this reason also early decisions, other than on broad principles, are a long way off.</P>
    <P>One of the requirements the Minister indicated yesterday evening should be met, is for a comprehensive study and debate within the Union institutions on the effects of enlargement on each of the agricultural sectors to ascertain what problems may lie ahead and satisfactory solutions will have to be found and agreed for these.  The ACC Bank, the Farmers Trust and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry have already commissioned a study entitled: &ldquo;Implications of possible adjustments to CAP on the agricultural economy in Ireland in the light of emerging pressures and in particular those arising from further eastern enlargement of the EU&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The results of this study, which are expected within the next two months, will aid our detailed policy formulation on enlargement.  The Government has been planning ahead, and will continue to plan, for what will be a major development in the history of the European Union.  I assure the House it is determined that Ireland's vital interests will be fully secured in the enlargement process.  An essential feature of any negotiations on enlargement is that there can be no renationalisation of the CAP.  That is very important and has been stressed by Members on this side of the House.  It is vital for us that there is common financing of all CAP expenditure. In these circumstances I recommend the alternative motion to the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh made a point on the importation of 8,000 tonnes of sheep from New Zealand and 2,000 tonnes from Argentina.  It was beef, not mutton, that was imported to the EU.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="800" /> The enlargement of the EU will represent major changes for everyone.  It is very important &mdash; I am glad Deputy Cowen raised the point earlier &mdash; that we should all unite in the national interest to ensure that we recognise the challenges ahead.  We in this House must proceed as a unit to share common ideals.  I thank the Deputies who raised this Motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate on this issue is the first major public discussion to take place on a matter of vital consequence to our economy.  I welcome the statement made by the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, that the issue should be brought before this House. Deputy Dukes suggested that the Fianna Fáil Party was being ridiculous in bringing it before the House.  There appears to be some dispute on the Government benches as to what is correct and desirable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes informed the House that he was aware in 1982 and 1983 that the problems we now face would eventually appear.  Given that he had access to such knowledge, it is surprising that no one, not even the Taoiseach who left him on the sidelines took notice of this great messiah.  Members who contributed to the debate, with the exception of Deputy Deenihan, seem to have&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;failed on this issue. They have developed an attitude of defeat before the enemy has been approached.  The Minister of State suggested that there is a misconception on this side of the House with regard to this issue.  Members on the other side do not have a monopoly on wisdom and neither do I nor my colleagues.  Those of us who are active in agriculture &mdash; some of us are farmers &mdash; are well <Col N="801" /> aware of what is proposed.  There should be no doubt about that.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State informed the House that the Commission's documents are discussion papers.  I sincerely hope so because discussion papers often become policy, with very little change involved.  Fianna Fáil is determined to ensure that CAP and reform is a matter of public debate.  Our aim in bringing this motion was to seek a focused and cogent response from the Government, not the piffle we have had to listen to tonight.</P>
      <P>A cogent response is required from the Minister and the Minister of State on the proposals for CAP reform suggested by Commissioner Fischler last week.  It has been confirmed by this debate, that Government policy on agriculture under the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, is entirely reactive.  Our ambition is to shake the Minister from his apathetic approach to the process of CAP reform.  If we in Fianna Fáil have not been surprised, we are very disappointed. It is increasingly apparent that if Irish interests are to be served we must be policy makers, not policy takers. It is a national imperative that our priorities for the next round of CAP reform be articulated.  The farming community &mdash; not unnaturally &mdash; looked to the Minister of the day to lead the debate.  Not only has the Minister not led the debate, it is now evident that he has very little to contribute to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In preparing for this discussion, I listened carefully to the Minister's contribution last night.  I carefully read that contribution today because I could not believe my ears.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has absolutely nothing to say on the vital process of reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.  When praise comes from his chief opposition on the Government benches, Deputy Dukes, it is time to worry.  Not one of the many specific <Col N="802" /> points raised by the Fianna Fáil spokesman, Deputy Cowen, was answered.  As a consequence of the furious row between the Tánaiste and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry on CAP reform the Government is in chaos.  The Tánaiste stated that EU enlargement is not only a political necessity but would present new markets and opportunities for Ireland, while in contradiction Deputy Yates stated that backward eastern states would never be compatible with membership of the EU.  It is against that background of in-fighting and incompetence that the vital issue of CAP is being publicly debated for the first time.</P>
    <P>As if that was not sufficient trouble in the camp, tonight a member of Democratic Left, in typical fashion, made an outrageous attack on the right wing parties. I presume she was in some measure referring to the Fianna Fáil Party, but in large measure she was speaking about Fine Gael.  We all know that coalition governments of two parties experience difficulties, but when there are three parties in coalition matters are even more difficult.  When the three parties discuss an issue of vital national importance, with each one taking a different view, Mr. Fischler is laughing up his sleeve.  The Minister, Deputy Yates, is complaining on the one hand, the Tánaiste's statement is in total contradiction and on the sidelines is the loose cannon, the maverick the Democratic Left, slating the farmers and Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>The only point of fact the Minister offered was the semantical caveat that the document produced by the EU Commission is a discussion paper, not a proposal &mdash; we have heard that time and again.  The Minister conceded that a debate has begun, a debate to which he has made little or no contribution to date.  Everyone must contribute to this debate, the IFA, the ICMSA, Macra na Feirme, the UFA, business interests, unions unemployed organisations and ICOS, all of whom will be affected by <Col N="803" /> the proposals put forward by Mr. Fischler.  If we are successful in bringing about such a debate it will be a good day's work.</P>
    <P>If Irish interests are to be protected there must be a clear vision of what our future holds.  Are we prepared to continue a system that does little to secure the future of more than half our farm families?  On current trends, more than 12,000 dairy farmers will be out of business in five years &mdash; we are talking here about the sector that appears to have fared best in these difficult times.  If 12,000 farmers leave the dairy sector, how many will leave other sectors? What will happen to the farmers who leave the land?  Sheep farmers are leaving the land at an enormous rate.  Are they to compete for the scarce resources, unemployment benefits, housing and other services thereby putting pressure on all services?</P>
    <P>I was amazed the Minister last night ruled out seeking extra quotas for Ireland.  We must have a clear and cogent vision of the desired position in 20 years' time.  Fianna Fáil firmly believes that the focus of our energy must be devoted to smaller and marginal enterprises.  Given the importance of the milk quota to our economy, I was flabbergasted to hear the Minister say last night that he sees no point in pursuing what is a very strong case for additional quota.  We have a strong case, as has been recognised time and again, and our peripheral location is its strongest plank.</P>
    <P>The Minister said, before he meets Mr. Fischler, that he is defeated.  We have a strong case and I ask the Minister to believe that.  Otherwise, the losers will be the tens of thousands of marginal farmers who depend on a new deal at EU level.  My colleague, Deputy Cowen, put it very well last night when he said that Deputy Yates is a typical X generation kid.  There is no instant gratification in long-term planning, therefore <Col N="804" /> Deputy Yates is not interested.  Lateral thinking does not make a good photo opportunity.  The Minister is to be commended for his mighty PR machine.  We see beautiful pictures in newspapers every day of the week, but the farmers cannot cash a photograph; that is the bottom line.</P>
    <P>Last month when the crisis in the sheep sector was debated in the Dáil, not in Government time but in Private Members' time at the request of Fianna Fáil, I remarked that the Minister is a very lucky politician.  He has the knack of being in the right place at the right time.  No Minister for Agriculture came into office at a better time &mdash; the tillage sector, beef sector, dairy sector and pig sector fared well, and Deputy Yates reaps the benefit.</P>

I will be watching, like every farmer, the direction the Minister will take tonight and whether he will link Democratic Left through the lobby.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Hearing of Family Law Cases.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this important matter.  I raised it previously by way of parliamentary question, on 8 February and on the Adjournment on 17 May.  Regrettably, nothing has been done in the meantime.  The Government is nevertheless proceeding to put divorce legislation on the Statute Book and is doing so in the full knowledge that this will further exacerbate a situation which has already become well nigh intolerable.</P>
      <P>From the standpoints of both personnel and resources, family law hearings are in a state of crisis.  For family law clients, justice is both delayed and, therefore, denied virtually on a daily basis.  Family law business has expanded since the passage of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 and the new business triggered by this legislation was simply grafted on to the existing workload without any commensurate increase in funding.</P>
      <P>In the 1988-89 legal year, the year which preceded the introduction of that Act, there were 68 applications before the Circuit Court for divorce a <i>mensa et toro,</i> to which judicial separation now corresponds.  In the 1993-94 legal year, there were a staggering 2,806 judicial separation applications under the 1989 Act.  What does the Minister imagine the situation will be when the divorce legislation is used?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Limerick, local Circuit Court <Col N="809" /> Judge Kevin O'Higgins was recently presented with 80 family law cases to resolve on a single day and a similar number in Ennis.  He sits until 10 p.m. each night in an effort to reduce the waiting time for justice.  Like every other Circuit Court judge however, he is swimming against an ever rising tide.</P>
    <P>Family law clients, who are mostly women, suffer cruelly during these extended waiting periods.  Many are literally living in dread and feel if they apply for a barring order, it will not be granted.  Those who are not living in physical fear often are suffering great mental cruelty and distress.  Many have been forced to flee to the relative safety of women's refuges.  Many have inadequate resources and, both they and their children, are living from hand to mouth.  That is not all.</P>
    <P>Because of the pressure of business, judges are forced to make the impossible choice between brief and hurried hearings or intolerable delays.  In many cases hasty judgments are made after the briefest hearing.</P>
    <P>It would be an abuse of language to describe the physical conditions of many courthouses outside Dublin as appropriate for family law cases.  Most Circuit and District Court venues outside Dublin do not have adequate space or facilities to accommodate family law clients. On many occasions, opposing spouses are left seated opposite each other on benches in cold and draughty corridors. Adequate facilities for consultations between lawyers and their clients are the exception rather than the rule in most venues.  Many Circuit Court houses have insufficient lighting, leaking roofs, ill fitting windows, inadequate heating and many do not even have basic toilet facilities.  It is small wonder that the Law Reform Commission in its consultation paper on family law hearings described the entire system as &ldquo;a sad parody of justice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Government recently asked the people to show their sympathy for those in dead marriages by voting in favour of divorce.  Where is the Government's sympathy for people in dead marriages who have to wait for as long as three years to get into court for a judicial separation hearing?  What about sympathy for those aggrieved family law clients who have to make do with a slot machine system of justice because of the pressures to which judges are subjected? What about sympathy for those who have to wait a minimum of one year for a family assessment when a district justice seeks one in order to determine custody? What about sympathy for those family law clients who consult their lawyers in the open air in all weathers or, alternatively, in a crowded hallway, a few feet away from where the other party is consulting his or her lawyer about the same business?</P>
    <P>Unless we hear tonight that the Government has definite proposals to address this unchristian and unconstitutional position in terms of accommodation, facilities and personnel then the verbal commitments so freely given by the Government to the most vulnerable in society will be exposed as hollow rhetoric.</P>

      <P>Some people can give it but they have great difficulty in taking it.</P>
      <P>The hearing of family law cases in our courts is a matter of great concern to the Minister and she is committed to ensuring that these cases are dealt with in the most effective and efficient way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Social changes in recent years and developments in the family law area had led to a major increase in the number of persons coming before our courts on family law business and this has placed a severe strain on the resources of the courts.  There are problems in some courts with regard to delays in the hearing of family law business and with the <Col N="811" /> accommodation available for persons having recourse to the courts on such business.</P>
    <P>Delays in the hearing of family law cases in the courts is a serious matter having regard to both the personal and complex nature of such cases and to the fact that the decisions in them have life long repercussions on all members of the families concerned.  The Minister is addressing the problem of delays in the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995, which is currently before this House and which provides for effective measures to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>A key feature of the Bill is the provision to allow for the appointment of 17 additional judges, seven of whom will be Circuit Court judges.  Since the introduction of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, the majority of family law cases are dealt with by the Circuit Court and it is this court which is experiencing the worst delays in hearing family law cases.  The Minister understands that the President of the Circuit Court intends to use the proposed additional judges specifically to eliminate delays and ensure the prompt disposal of cases in the future. However, there is no way of knowing if the introduction of divorce legislation will increase the level of court business to an extent which will require further additional judicial resources.  As the Minister is committed to ensuring the prompt disposal of court business the situation in the future will be monitored closely with a view to taking whatever measures are necessary to prevent delays recurring, including further judicial appointments, if necessary.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision of suitable court accommodation for the hearing of family law cases, the Minister readily acknowledges the need to provide facilities to enable family law business to be transacted with the delicacy it requires in private and in confidence and she would like to assure the Deputy <Col N="812" /> that the provision of such facilities is a matter of priority in all courthouse refurbishment projects.  The Minister is happy these facilities are available in a growing number of courthouses and will continue to be provided through the Department's courthouse refurbishment plan.  This plan will ensure that all our principal courthouses will be refurbished to a high standard in the next few years.</P>
    <P>This Government has given a commitment to take the steps necessary to strengthen family courts and, in this context, the Minister is awaiting with interest the report of the Law Reform Commission which will examine the type of judicial or court structure most appropriate to deal with family law business. This is a matter which may also be considered by the working group on the Courts Commission which has been established by the Minister to carry out a major re-appraisal of the organisation and structure of the courts to ensure that they are equipped to handle modern day demands and pressures and are able to keep pace with the ever changing and increasing demands which will be placed on them in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not give me any pleasure to have to raise this tragic case.  At the end of September 1995, a Dundalk restaurateur was jailed for three years for killing a mother of six and a taxi driver through dangerous driving.  The accused was also disqualified from driving for six years by Dublin Circuit Criminal Court.  At the time of the accident his car was found to have three bald tyres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This desperate tragedy occurred on 27 March 1994 on a clear stretch of road in mid afternoon in County Louth.  Evidence was given to the court that the road was 32 feet wide and was dry at the time of the accident on a bypass road around Dundalk.  Eye witnesses put the <Col N="813" /> accused's speed at somewhere between 50 and 60 miles per hour.  The taxi was driving at approximately 30 miles per hour which was the speed limit for the road.  The trial judge agreed to a request that the sentence be reviewed on the first day of December 1995.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately &mdash; and this is the crucial point &mdash; the review of the case went ahead without the Garda involved in the original case having been formally informed that the review was to proceed on 1 December 1995.  My information is that the first the Garda heard of the review was when his superintendent called to ask him why he was not in Dublin for the review hearing.  The Garda informed his superintendent that he had noted the review in his case diary as being December 1996.  Clearly there was either a breakdown in communications or a complete lack of communication in this case.</P>
    <P>The very least that could have been expected was that the relevant authorities would have ensured that the Garda involved in the original case was present in court for the review of the case last week where the sentence was quashed and the accused released.  Had the Garda been formally informed of the review and notified of the date, my information is that the review may well have had a different outcome.  It is apparent to everybody now even from recent cases which have received considerable publicity that the communication path on cases must be strengthened so as to ensure that all relevant information on a particular case is adequately aired.</P>
    <P>I understand that the families of the people killed in this tragic accident were not advised of the review date.  The time has come for provision to be made for formal compulsory notification of the gardaí involved in the original cases when they come up for review.  As a matter of humanity and compassion the families of the victims in such cases <Col N="814" /> should at the very least be advised of the date of the review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with many of the points made by the Deputy about this tragic case.  It might be helpful to him and the House if I set out the circumstances surrounding this matter which had its source in a most horrific road traffic accident near Dundalk on 27 March last year.</P>
      <P>The Garda report into the accident shows that it was carefully and fully investigated.  In accordance with normal procedure, a file was submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions as to what charges, if any, should be preferred. Such evidence as was disclosed by the Garda investigation file as capable of being presented before a criminal court was assessed in that office and the appropriate decision as to charges was taken.  The case was listed for arraignment in the Dublin Circuit Criminal Court on 24 March last and at the arraignment hearing a trial date of 26 July 1995 was set.</P>
      <P>On 26 July last a jury was empanelled but the accused subsequently pleaded guilty before Judge O'Connor who sentenced him to three years' imprisonment and disqualified him from driving for six years, with a review of the sentence on 1 December 1996.  Literally as the judge was getting up from the bench, Mr. Mohan, BL, for the accused applied for the review of the sentence to be brought forward from 1 December 1996 to 1 December this year.  The judge granted this application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The review of the case was, accordingly, listed for 1 December last and was heard on that date.  Judge O'Connor suspended the balance of the sentence. Neither the prosecuting garda nor the families of the victims were present in court.  I might mention that the decision of the court and the sentence imposed is a matter on which I may not comment as the Judiciary is independent in the exercise of its functions.  However, it is clear that the State side did not exercise the degree of vigilance and attention necessary to ensure that its position on <Col N="815" /> the issue of review was presented to the court on 1 December last.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice has informed me that she is pursuing further inquiries with the Garda Commissioner and the Chief State Solicitor's office on this matter and that she will write to the Deputy when she has all the information she needs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise on the Adjournment the problems experienced by tomato growers, the majority of whom are located in the Rush, Lusk and Skerries areas of my constituency.</P>
      <P>This has been a disastrous year for the tomato industry which has already gone through a period of change.  In 1977 approximately 400 acres of tomatoes were grown in glasshouses.  By 1992 this had been reduced to 136 acres and by 1994 it had been further reduced to 122 acres.  There are approximately 55-60 tomato growers in the country and approximately 45 of these are located in the Dublin region.  There are approximately 300 people in this industry which earns £5 million in sales.  The efficient core producers produce approximately 11,000 tonnes of tomatoes annually, half the consumption rate of 22,000 tonnes. The word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; is much abused but in this case it is very much a reality for those employed in the industry and their families.</P>
      <P>It costs approximately £4.50 to produce a box of tomatoes.  This is broken down as follows: £1.60 for labour; 50p for the box; 25p for fertiliser, £1 for plastic, packaging and twine and £1.15 for gas.  This year growers received approximately £3.50 per box.  It is absolutely essential for the Government to take action similar to that taken in Belgium where £7 million was made available to the industry this year to compensate it for currency differentials, particularly as regards Spain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="816" /> I ask the Minister to provide assistance to this industry and to save the 300 jobs.  This would amount to a subsidy of 50p per box for the 1.3 million boxes produced this year.  I also ask him to look at the gas prices paid by tomato growers here as compared with the prices paid by growers in other countries. For example, Irish growers pay approximately 30p per therm while growers in the UK pay approximately 15p per therm.  The producers need assistance if they are to buy the seed and fertilisers and to continue in production in 1996.  Finally, I ask the Minister to agree to the meeting requested by the IFA so as to ensure we have a stable and efficient industry which will give a good return to those people who invest and work in it in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have met the tomato growers on two occasions since I came into office.  I brought in the supermarket people, retailers and wholesalers, to meet them and to encourage them to buy more Irish produce.  I have been available to meet them at all times during that period.  I recently set up a horticultural forum which for the first time has brought together the producers, farming organisations, retailers and wholesalers to discuss ways of ensuring that more Irish produce will find its way on to the shelves in supermarkets.  I hope this will lead to an increased demand for Irish produce, including tomatoes, and will help to secure the 300 jobs in this industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tomato market throughout the European Union has been in a depressed state for some time because of over supply of product and consequent low prices.  As Deputy Burke knows, Dutch tomatoes were finding their way to our market and that certainly affected the price.  Spain is bringing in a large quantity of tomatoes from its colony, the Canaries.  The Spanish were encouraged by European Union policy to produce more tomatoes and that is one of the reasons the Dutch are finding it difficult <Col N="817" /> and have suffered casualties in the industry.</P>
    <P>Tomatoes are one of the products covered by the common organisation of the market for fruit and vegetables and member states are precluded from assisting the sector other than in accordance with the terms of that regime.  The provision of a subsidy as Deputy Burke suggests is not permissible.</P>
    <P>I recently met representatives of the industry and explained the position to them.  I listened to their problems and I would like to do something to help.  This resilient group faces tough competition but wants to stay in business and it has my sympathy.</P>
    <P>Grants at very generous rates have been payable to the protected crop sector in recent years.  Over £200,000 was paid in grant assistance under the greenhouse grants scheme 1989-94.  Under the operational programme for rural development 1991-93 almost £100,000 was paid in grants to the sector at the rate of 40 per cent with a 50 per cent rate in disadvantaged areas.  Under the first tranche of the Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99 (OPARDF) approvals for a total of £20,000 have already been approved for the sector.</P>
    <P>In addition the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, recently reintroduced the farm improvement programme for horticulture at an enhanced rate of grant of 35 per cent.  These may seem small measures but an effort is being made to help this sector.  Deputy Burke raised the question of the price of gas but I had already taken this matter up with the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and I hope he may be able to do something.  I am prepared to meet the tomato growers at any time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I protest at the absence of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  I say that with no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, who will kindly take this matter.  However, I fail to see what the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has to do with the serious matter I am raising this evening and I trust my protest will reach his ears.</P>
      <P>I wish to discuss the mounting concern about the Government's handling of negotiations at Telecom Éireann in its search for a strategic ally.  One company, United States West, has withdrawn from talks and it is reported that another company, British Telecom, is considering pulling out of the negotiations with the Irish authoirities.  The withdrawal of these two potential partners is most disturbing and reflects the concern of major telecommunications multinationals at the manner in which they are being treated by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. The companies lack confidence in the Minister's handling of the negotiations which are clouded in secrecy. The Minister has delayed the process unnecessarily.  After 18 months, the short-listed companies have still not got the memorandum of information outlining the terms of an alliance.  How can an alliance proceed when the relevant documentation has not reached potential partners 18 months after the announcement?  Can you blame two potential partners for walking away?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Problems have arisen because the Government has been pulling in three different directions.  It is widely known <Col N="819" /> in Telecom Éireann that the delay on this matter is because the Labour Party has a different view from the Democratic Left Party on how to sell off 35 per cent of a State company.  I have noted on many occasions that if this side of the House attempted to sell off one-third of a State company, the Democratic Left Party would be apopletic but now we have silence &mdash; perhaps the few bob for social welfare is the pay off for that silence.  The Fine Gael Party and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications are pulling in another direction.  There has been no resolution of these difficulties and as a consequence we have seen the withdrawal of United States West and the threatened withdrawal of British Telecom.</P>
    <P>This three way political tug of war is bad for Telecom Éireann and the country because good telecommunications are central to the national interest.  Any more delay in advancing the Irish telecommunications system will cost this country thousands of jobs as companies simply will not locate here.  This delay has already cost us jobs.  Last week Stream International, a major multinational announced a 500 job facility for Derry city, whom I heartily congratulate for winning that project.  The company is publicly quoted as saying that if Telecom Éireann had an international partner the plant would have come to the Republic.  The key to Derry's success was that it could supply the essential telecommunications network through British Telecom's deal with the United States carrier MCI.  Stream International has warned that another 200 jobs which it is considering locating here could also be lost if Telecom Éireann does not make up its mind in the next four months on its strategic partner.</P>
    <P>I have been concerned at the way the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications handled these negotiation and those for the second mobile phone licence.  The Minister is trying to do his work behind closed doors and has refused to publish consultants' reports <Col N="820" /> which I have demanded consistently from these benches.  He has refused to give me position papers and time and again he has refused to come into this House and debate the issue in any serious way.  I call on the Minister to lay out clearly what his Government's position is on the strategic alliance for Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>There is urgent need for the production of a White Paper on the semi-State sector so that we can have a coherent, integrated strategy for these companies rather than the <i>ad hoc,</i> week by week, policy shifts that prevail.</P>
    <P>We need some clarity on where Telecom Éireann is going; two companies were in negotiation, one has pulled out and another is in the process of doing so.  There is too much secrecy.  Arguably Ireland's largest company is not being told where it is going and its subscribers do not know whether they will have a role to play in its future.  There is total confusion, no clear strategic vision and that is not good enough.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan) Jimmy Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise for the unavoidable absence of the Minister this evening &mdash; he has been present for adjournment debates on several occasions over the past 12 months.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael was the first party in this House to suggest a strategic alliance with Telecom Éireann and that was opposed by Deputy Séamus Brennan's party at the time.  I remember some of its councillors bringing deputations into Kerry County Council, of which I was a member, to oppose any such alliance.  It is great to observe that party coming around to our way of thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The process of selecting a strategic partner for Telecom Éireann is well under way.  The Minister welcomes this opportunity to outline the current position in this process.  The Minister would like to emphasise at the outset that major progress continues to be made. <Col N="821" /> At the same time we must recognise that this issue is complex and it is vital that we get it right.  Arguably this is the biggest single transaction affecting a State-sponsored body in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>To put things in context I would like, to outline briefly the background and the steps that have been taken to get us to where we are.  First, it has been generally accepted for some time that a strategic partner is vital to Telecom Éireann's future.  The right partner will bring many benefits, including management, marketing and technological skills to Telecom Éireann.  In addition, a partner will help provide access to a world-wide network platform.  This is essential if Telecom Éireann is to protect its international customer base and sustain and grow revenues from a sound financial base.</P>
    <P>These changes are necessary so that Telecom can thrive, and be a major player in the future competitive environment. Given the critical importance of telecommunications to economic development, this is vital, not just for Telecom but for Ireland's future competitiveness.</P>
    <P>The first step in this process was taken with the release of the mandate for negotiations approved by the Government in July of this year.  This document cleared the way for the commencement of the process of choosing the right partner.  It addressed a number of key policy issues the most important of which sets our our national policy objective for telecommunications.  This is to achieve a telecommunications sector which is in the upper quartile of OECD indicators on price, quality and availability.  This is an ambitious target but one that we believe is achievable.  In addition the mandate states the Government's intention to achieve a fully competitive market by the year 2000.</P>
    <P>The mandate lays down that an incoming partner must help us achieve our overall objective.  The partner must <Col N="822" /> show long-term commitment and assist Telecom in being a major player while remaining in majority public ownership. To cement the relationship between the partners up to 35% per cent of equity of Telecom may be issued to the right partner and a further 5 per cent may be set aside for staff, subject to certain conditions.</P>
    <P>Since the release of the mandate document the selection process has formally commenced.  This process will be totally fair, impartial and objective while at the same time ensuring that the State gets the best possible deal.  To guarantee that these objectives are met we have appointed, through a competitive process, a top class consortium of consultants headed by Morgan Stanley to advise the shareholder.  This consortium provides the necessary financial, legal and telecommunications expertise to carry out this assignment.</P>
    <P>In addition, a management structure under the auspices of the Minister's Department has been established to carry out the selection process and this includes, representation from the Department of Finance and Telecom Éireann.  The top layer in this structure is the project management group which is responsible for the overall direction of the project and for the final recommendation of a partner to Government.</P>
    <P>The day-to-day management of the project will be the responsibility of a joint project team.  The Minister has also requested Telecom Éireann to ensure effective and open communications with its staff representatives on the alliance process.</P>
    <P>The two Departments and Telecom, together with their advisers, have been-working towards the first milestone in the selection process which is the issue of the information memorandum to the potential partners.  This document will provide a comprehensive description of Telecom and will set out the shareholder's and the company's objectives from the alliance.  It is intended to issue <Col N="823" /> this document shortly and this will signal the effective commencement of the selection process.  Potential partners will be given some weeks to consider this documentation and to respond with preliminary proposals for an alliance.</P>
    <P>A shortlisting process will then take place leading to detailed negotiations with a number of companies.  Overall the process could take about nine months to complete.  The Minister is hopeful that we will have identified the successful partner by the middle of next year.  This is not unusual for a process of this type and the Minister is committed to ensuring that the process continues to move smoothly and without delay.</P>
    <P>I have given this detail about the process in order to demonstrate the progress that has been made not withstanding the complex issues which need to be considered and the overall importance of this project to telecommunications in this country.  All of the potential partners have been contacted and are aware of the current position.</P>
    <P>Reports that British Telecom is reviewing its position as far as the Minister is concerned are speculative.  As Deputy Seámus Brennan said, there is no evidence to suggest any imminent decision by British Telecom to pull out.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not received any information or indication that these reports are true.  British Telecom, like all the other potential partners, is fully aware of the progress that is being made and fully understand the nature of the process.  Indeed, the Minister is very satisfied with the quality of the interested companies.  All are major telecommunications operators with significant potential to contribute to Telecom Éireann's strategy and operations.</P>
      <P>The Deputy quite rightly recognises that jobs are a factor in this overall process. Indeed, the mandate states quite clearly that the capacity of the partnership to give access to additional business development and job opportunities will be an important consideration.  The Minister would like to make it clear that this process is on track and that the objective in the mandate relating to jobs has not been put at risk.</P>
      <P>The Minister is satisfied that this selection process, vital both to Telecom Éireann and the telecommunications sector, is on target and making significant progress.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 December 1995.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 24 together.</P>
      <P>The availability of child care facilities for working parents is one of many factors which affect the attainment of equality for women in the workplace.  Its influence on the wage differential between male and female employees is described in a report by the ESRI, last year, which was commissioned jointly by my Department and the Employment Equality Agency and which was entitled Male-Female Wage Differentials: Analysis and Policy Issues.</P>
      <P>The report notes that the average labour market experience of female employees reflects, in large measure, the fact that many women tend to leave the labour market during the years of child-bearing and child-rearing and that the availability and cost of child-care are relevant to women's labour market decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Competitiveness and Work also recognised the contribution which child care provision can make in promoting equal opportunities and a number of the programme's <Col N="661" /> undertakings in this area are being pursued by my Department.</P>
    <P>For example, in so far as child care facilities can aid the attainment of equality both for working parents or parents seeking access to employment, training or educational opportunities I took early action on the establishment of my Department to ensure that the National Development Plan included a child care element.</P>
    <P>As a result of the National Development Plan, the human resources operational programme of the Community Support Framework has set aside a total of nearly £8 million to support equal opportunities measures, including child care initiatives, over the period of the programme.  As part of this FÁS, in its contribution over the next few years, has committed £1.5 million to child care training measures and will supplement this with support for child care facilities for its trainees.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department also launched a national initiative to develop pilot child care projects in disadvantaged areas.  Following on the £250,000 issued in 1994 my Department had issued a further £800,000 up to the end of November 1995 towards the cost of approved projects under the pilot child care initiative launched last year.  This scheme is assisting child care projects in disadvantaged areas.  Over 70 projects have been approved for assistance.</P>
    <P>Over and above these measures the State is also involved in child care provision through the health boards.  In 1992, the latest year for which data is available, over 300 centres catering for 9,000 children countrywide were supported by health boards.  Although these services are essentially for children whose parents are experiencing difficulty in caring for them undoubtedly some of these parents are in employment or seeking employment or training.</P>
    <P>Primary responsibility for child care policy resides with my colleague, the Minister for Health, under the Child Care Act, 1991.  Full implementation of that Act is promised by the end of next <Col N="662" /> year, when provisions relating to the regulation, supervision and inspection of child care standards and facilities will be introduced.  This will ensure the necessary regulatory infrastructure for child care services to develop.  It will also enable better monitoring of the capacity and standards of such services.</P>
    <P>Provision of child care facilities is not solely or primarily a responsibility of Government.  While Government may need to encourage the provision of such facilities by its activities and policies, there is a responsibility on employers and workers to work with local development and community interests from both voluntary and public authority sectors to develop child care provision in response to local needs.</P>
    <P>As child care provision enables employers to retain in employment experienced workers who would otherwise be lost to the enterprise and to avoid the concomitant costs in recruiting and training new staff, there are considerable gains to be achieved by active pursuit of a partnership approach with worker and community interests here.</P>
    <P>This partnership approach suitably complements the Community Support Framework and child care pilot scheme measures which my Department has been promoting.</P>
    <P>The Department's contribution to the impetus achieved in promoting the development of child care services will continue and I will continue to review the recommendations of the working group of the Second Commission on the Status of Women on child care support for working parents in progressing further provision in this area.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 22, 36 and 59 together.  Expenditure incurred by my Department under its subhead in relation to the referendum on divorce for which invoices have been received amounts to £23,694.  It is estimated that the total expenditure will amount to, approximately, £480,000.  The provision in the subhead of my Department for the expenditure is £500,000.  The main heads of expenditure are in relation to press advertisements, information leaflets which were distributed to each household and post offices, an information booklet on the legislative context and administrative measures under which divorce would operate, which was made available for sale through the Government Publications Sales Office, and three MRBI polls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The MRBI polls I have mentioned are the only polls for which my Department has had responsibility.  I arranged to have the polls carried out as background research for the information of the Cabinet sub-committee on divorce which had been established by the Government to make recommendations <Col N="664" /> on the form of the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill and the Government's programme of information on divorce and to identify issues in the divorce debate which needed to be addressed.  The research helped to inform discussions in the Cabinet sub-committee and the decisions taken by it. The research elicited information on the attitudes of people on divorce laws which might or might not be acceptable; what kind of information people sought in the debate and what action needed to be taken to allay their concerns.</P>
    <P>There are no official procedures specific to such research reports and no fixed rules about their publication. However, I would agree that, where publication does arise, it should be arranged with the minimum of delay.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 31, 38 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The development plan for the Legal Aid Board is already at an advanced stage of implementation.  Funding of the services of that board has almost doubled over the period 1993-95 with the allocation of £3.266 million in 1993 being increased to £6.2 million in 1995. The number of full-time law centres has increased to 26 against 16 in 1993.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the increased Government funding, the board, as part of its plan of development, expanded its services in County Tipperary in the last year with the result that the county now has a full-time law centre in Nenagh and a part-time centre in Thurles and Clonmel. The board's services in County Tipperary will continue to be monitored by the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="666" /> Funding for the family mediation service has more than doubled since the 1993 allocation of £134,000.  The sum of £300,000 allocated in 1995 is designed to implement a development plan.  Heretofore the service has operated from its Dublin-based office.  As part of the development plan a new centre in Limerick has been established.  The plan allows for the employment of additional mediators, including the employment of private mediators on a contract basis, which will enable the service to be provided at other locations throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Reviews of the level of services provided by the family mediation service and the Legal Aid Board are ongoing by those organisations in consultation with my Department to ensure that needs are being met.  The developments taking place in those organisations on the basis of the major funding provided should help to put them in a position of strength to meet new demands.  Their position will continue to be reviewed in the light of experience and having regard to budgetary considerations.</P>

      <P>The Fourth Medium-term Community Action Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men 1996-2000 was considered for adoption by the Council of Social Affairs Ministers yesterday and will follow on directly from the third programme in the series, which ends on 31 December 1995.  My Department has <Col N="667" /> been fully supportive of the proposed programme in discussions at official level preparatory to the Social Affairs Council meeting.</P>
      <P>The fourth programme is of course primarily a Commission initiative and has been drawn up following an extensive consultation process.  This has included consultations with the Advisory Committee on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men on which the Employment Equality Agency is represented. Furthermore, it has drawn on the submissions of member state Governments in the preparation of the recent EU Green Paper and White Paper on the Future of European Social Policy.</P>
      <P>The objectives of the programme are: to promote the mainstreaming of equal opportunities, promote equality in the changing economy, reconcile family and working life, promote a gender balance in decision making, and make conditions conducive to exercising equality rights.  As part of the consultative process in member states on the development of the fourth programme, the Employment Equality Agency last February hosted a workshop of equality experts in Dublin Castle, to consult on what national priorities should be included.  The workshop assessed the experience of the implementation of the current Third Action Programme on Equal Opportunities for Women and Men by the Commission.  The broad consensus was that the fourth programme should include a firm legal foundation: be a framework document which furthered equality under a partnership model within the individual member states; recognise the demands for dependant care and combat occupational segregation.  All these factors have been incorporated into the programme now agreed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 33, 40 and 61 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report of the Task Force on the Travelling Community which had a brief to examine, advise and make recommendations on the needs of travellers and on Government policies generally in relation to the travelling community, was presented to me by the task force on 20 July 1995.  I thank the <Col N="670" /> members of the task force for the work undertaken by them.</P>
    <P>The report provides a comprehensive analysis of the needs of the travelling community and makes recommendations in relation to three principal areas, namely; key issues of relevance to travellers including accommodation, access to health services, education and training provision and economic development and employment including the co-ordination of approaches by the relevant statutory agencies whose services impact on members of the travelling community; relationships between travellers and `settled' people; the experience of travellers with a particular focus on culture, discrimination, traveller women and travellers with a disability.</P>
    <P>As the report impacts on a wide range of policy areas which are the responsibility of a number of Ministers, the Government has established an interdepartmental working group of officials to consider the implementation of the report, including in particular, the costs involved.  The Government will determine what action is called for in relation to the recommendations contained in the task force's report as soon as the report of the working group is available.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies will be aware, the task force published an interim progress report in January, 1994.  When I received that report, I examined it to see to what extent its recommendations could be implemented immediately pending receipt of the final report of the task force.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I consulted the Minister for Education and also the former Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, with responsibility for housing, to identify the recommendations on which progress could be made. Since these consultations, progress has been made in relation to a number of recommendations in the interim progress report.</P>
    <P>On 18 March, 1994 the former Minister of State at the Department of the Environment announced that the special grant for travellers purchasing their first house for their own occupation had been increased from £1,500 <Col N="671" /> to £3,000 and in addition, with effect from this year, funding for new group housing schemes for travellers will be provided by the Department of the Environment separately from the general local authority housing allocation.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Minister for Education that provision for children with special needs is being considered in the context of the report of the Special Education Review Committee, published in 1993, and, in the specific case of traveller children, the interim progress report of the task force.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific recommendations concerning education provision for travellers, contained in the interim report, I understand that the following developments have taken place: (i) In April, 1994, the Minister for Education published guidelines entitled &ldquo;The Education of Traveller Children in National Schools &mdash; Guidelines&rdquo;.  (ii) The capitation grant for traveller children attending national schools was increased from £76.20 in 1993 to £130 in 1994 and to £137 with effect from September, 1995, for those children under 12 years and from £316 in 1994 to £331 in 1995 for children over 12 years of age. (iii) A school record system for traveller children is now being operated on a pilot basis by the visiting teacher service. (iv) The pupil teacher ratio for traveller children at primary level, has been reduced by one unit from 15:1 to 14:1 for special schools and classes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the recommendations in the final report of the task force in the area of discrimination, I can confirm that I am committed to taking initiatives to end discrimination against members of the travelling community and to ensure that they are provided with opportunities for equal participation in all aspects of Irish society.</P>
    <P>The preparation of employment equality and the equal status legislation is proceeding.  At present, I envisage that, when it has been approved by the Government, the Employment Equality Bill would be published early in 1996. The drafting of the Equal Status Bill, <Col N="672" /> which contains some interrelated provisions, would then be completed and following Government approval, would be published some time later.  The proposed legislation will provide protection generally against discrimination, including discrimination on grounds of membership of the travelling community.</P>

      <P>I should like to make it plain to the Deputy that I regard the philosophy which informs the granting of church annulments as a matter peculiarly within the competence of the church authorities.  They have no validity in civil law and I do not intend to comment further on this matter.</P>
      <P>With regard to the civil law of nullity, the principles which are pertinent to this area of the law have been developed and extended by the courts in recent years and may be regarded as well settled at this stage.  While the question of statutory intervention often arises where the legal principles on such an important matter are largely the result of judicial decision-making, I have an open mind as to whether such intervention is either necessary or desirable in this particular case.</P>
      <P>I would emphasise, however, that the question of whether the parties to a marriage which is annulled by the courts should be in a position to apply to those courts for maintenance and other orders in support of their welfare, including orders in relation to the home, would require specific legislation which, in view of the constitutional complexity which surrounds this issue, would require very careful consideration indeed.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has for a review of the law in relation to householders who find themselves having to confront an intruder, find themselves with personal injury claim incurred during a robbery in view of the spiralling crime levels; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>Legislation which was passed earlier this year &mdash; the Occupiers' Liability Act, 1995 &mdash; contains a provision to the effect that, where a person enters premises for the purpose of committing an offence, or commits an offence while there, the occupier will not be liable for injury or damage unintentionally caused to that person unless a court determines otherwise in the interests of justice.  That Act governs the liability which an occupier of premises may have in relation to dangers due to the state of the premises only.</P>
      <P>Where it is an act by the householder which gives rise to a claim, the discharge of a shotgun, for example, the matter is largely governed by common law principles. In broad terms, the use of force is lawful for the necessary defence of oneself, of others or of property but the force used in such circumstances must be reasonable and in any action for damages it would be for the courts to determine, having regard to the facts of the matter, whether it was or was not appropriate to impose any liability on such a householder.</P>
      <P>I have no immediate plan to change the civil law in this area and, indeed, any change along the lines of restricting court access in such cases could well be problematic given that the right to litigate or to have access to the courts is a personal right which is guaranteed under the Constitution.</P>

Ireland became State Party to the Convention on 22 January 1986, i.e. 30 days after the date of the deposit of the instrument of accession.  I propose to circulate the text of the remaining Irish reservations to the Convention with the official report.</P>

      <Col N="675" /> Remaining Reservations to the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women</P>
    <P>Article 13 (b) and (c)</P>
    <P>The question of supplementing the guarantee of equality contained in the Irish Constitution with special legislation governing access to financial credit and other services and recreational activities, where these are provided by private persons, organisation or enterprises is under consideration.  For the time being Ireland reserves the right to regard its existing law and measures in this area as appropriate for the attainment in Ireland of the objectives of the Convention.</P>
    <P>Article 15 (3)</P>
    <P>Ireland reserves the right not to supplement the existing provisions in Irish law which accord women a legal capacity identical to that of men with further legislation governing the validity of any contract or other private instrument freely entered into by a woman.</P>
    <P>Article 16.1 (d) and (f)</P>
    <P>Ireland is of the view that the attainment in Ireland of the objectives of the Convention does not necessitate the extension to men of rights identical to those accorded by law to women in respect of the guardianship, adoption and custody of children born out of wedlock and reserves the right to implement the Convention subject to that understanding.</P>
    <P>Article 11 (1) and 13 (a)</P>
    <P>Ireland reserves the right to regard the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 and the Employment Equality Act, 1977 and other measures taken in implementation of the European Economic Community standards concerning employment opportunities and pay as sufficient implementation of Articles 11.1 (b), (c) and (d).</P>
    <P>Ireland reserves the right for the time being to maintain provisions of Irish legislation in the area of social security <Col N="676" /> which are more favourable to women than men, and does not believe that this is in contravention of the Convention. Irish legislation in the area of equality complies with the highest standards of European Union law.</P>

      <P>I welcome the research study produced by Women's Aid on the subject of domestic violence. The more studies there are of this kind the more informed we can be on this subject as a society, as members of support groups, as public representatives, as legislators and as administrators.  I commend the work of Women's Aid not only in having this document published but also in being to the forefront as an organisation that is action-orientated and is daily working on the ground to help the victims of violence.</P>
      <P>My Department's responsibilities in relation to the problems associated with domestic violence are largely confined to the legislative aspects which impinge on the civil law.  My policy regarding what legislative provisions should be in place are as set out in the Domestic Violence Bill, 1995.  My Department also of course has responsibility for other important pieces of legislation which deal with the consequences of domestic violence such as maintenance of spouses and children guardianship and separation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Domestic Violence Bill, which the House is discussing today, is the product of detailed consultations with interest groups such as Women's Aid. Indeed the Women's Aid document <Col N="677" /> acknowledges that many of the recommendations it has made for reform of the law are incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In addition my Department has important responsibilities in relation to the scheme of civil legal aid and advice and for funding of organisations which are engaged in counselling of persons who have marriage problems.  Matters concerning health, child care and the funding of women's refuges are the responsibility of the Department of Health; the provision of housing is a matter for the Minister for the Environment; and matters concerning the courts and the Garda are a matter for the Minister for Justice.  Considerable co-operation, as necessary, already exists between relevant Departments and strategic management plans are being operated and developed in Departments to ensure that objectives are being met.  That is not to say that perhaps more can and should be done about the problems of domestic violence and we are prepared as a Government to continue to address the problems. In this context, I should mention the recent establishment by the Government of the Commission on the Family. That commission will, among other matters, examine the effects of legislation and policies on families.  Any proposals for further change which emanate from the commission in so far as my Department is concerned will be given priority attention.</P>

      <P>Guidelines for dealing with sexual harassment in the Civil Service were introduced by the Department of Finance in December 1990.  I understand from that Department that public sector organisations generally operate these guidelines or adapt them as required to suit the particular requirements of the individual organisations.  The code of practice on <Col N="679" /> sexual harassment issued by my Department last year also acts as a guide in determining policy in this area in the public service.  In this context I understand that the Department of Finance has commenced discussions with the Civil Service unions concerning the revision and updating of the current policy in the civil service with a view to incorporating elements of the code into the guidelines.</P>
      <P>The current Department of Finance guidelines define sexual harassment, outline the responsibilities of supervisors, provide advice on the steps to be taken by an individual who considers that he or she is being subjected to sexual harassment and details the procedures for investigating allegations and handling complaints of sexual harassment.</P>
      <P>Government Departments and the bodies under their aegis are encouraged to adopt procedures which best provide a structure for employees to report incidents of sexual harassment and in which they can be sure their complaints will be treated seriously and in the strictest confidence, with due regard to the sensitivities of the complainant.  The Department of Finance also provides training courses on the subject of sexual harassment for personnel officers and employee assistance officers and it is intended to extend these courses to supervisors in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said last week at the inauguration of the IMPACT seminar &ldquo;Progressing Equal Opportunities &mdash; the next steps&rdquo; procedures already exist for dealing with sexual harassment in the public service and it is generally accepted that these procedures have proved satisfactory, although they are of course always kept under review.  Where people feel that an alternative avenue of redress is necessary, they can contact the Employment Equality Agency, the leading experts in the field, where they will receive a confidential, personal and sympathetic hearing.  The agency will advise people of their rights and, if necessary, may represent or arrange for <Col N="680" /> them to be represented in proceedings under the employment equality-legislation.</P>
    <P>Given the diversity of public sector employments and the availability of existing procedures a sexual harassment telephone helpline for public sector employees is not proposed.  The assistance of the Employment Equality Agency to both employers and employees will of course continue to be readily available.</P>

      <P>The two additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions, <Col N="681" /> of June 1997 were signed by Ireland on 12 December, 1977 subject to ratification. The Protocols are important components on international humanitarian law.  Protocol I is a comprehensive code for the treatment of the civilian population in time of war and it also limits the use of certain conventional weapons. Protocol II applies the Geneva Conventions to &ldquo;non-international armed conflicts&rdquo;.  Ireland, by signing, is therefore committed to refraining from acts contrary to the object and purpose of the Protocols and to proceeding to ratification.</P>
      <P>As the Government considers the realisation and respect of international humanitarian law to be of high importance. I am pleased to confirm to the Deputy that it is the Government's firm intention to ratify both additional Protocols to the Geneva Convention as early as possible.</P>
      <P>The fact that it has not been possible to ratify the Protocols to date is a source of regret to the Government.  However, owing to the length and complexity of the provision of the Protocols, a necessary step in the process leading to ratification is the in-depth examination of the Protocols in relation to existing Irish legislation.  This examination is under way.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Geneva Conventions of 1949 were implemented in Ireland by three Acts of the Oireachtas: the Red Cross Act, 1954; the Prisoners of War and Enemy Aliens Act, 1956; and the Geneva Conventions Act, 1962.</P>
      <P>To proceed with ratification it will be necessary to consider the relationship between these statutes, as well as the relationship of each of them to the Protocols and, of course, the relationship of the Protocols to the Convention.  In order for Ireland to give legal effect to the Protocols, therefore, it is expected that additional legislation may be required or that it will be necessary to amend a number of existing statutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is anticipated that the ratification process will take some time but the importance of the Protocols precludes a <Col N="682" /> treatment of the matter which is anything other than exhaustive.  Ratification of the Protocols is viewed as a priority by the present Government and it is hoped that measurable progress can be reported in the near future.</P>

As the Deputy is aware, the matter of a further appeal must be pursued by the prisoner's legal representatives or by others acting on his behalf.  I understand that the case is at present being reviewed by the British authorities. I have asked the Embassy to maintain contact with the legal representatives in this regard and I will consider, in the light of reports, whether there is any further action the Government can appropriately take in this case.</P>

      <P>I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the majority of agricultural services are in fact liable for VAT at the reduced rate of 12.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>Agricultural services qualifying for the reduced VAT rate include field work such as reaping, mowing, sowing and planting etc.; stock-minding and rearing; disinfecting and ensilage of agricultural products; destruction of weeds and pests and dusting and spraying of crops and land; lopping, tree felling and similar forestry services, and farm relief services and farm advisory services.</P>
      <P>I am further advised that the combined supply and sowing-planting of seeds-plants etc. for the production of food is zero rated for VAT purposes, as is the combined supply and spreading of fertilisers.</P>
      <P>Certain other services availed of by the agricultural sector such as accountancy services, transport and storage, are liable at the standard rate of 21 per cent. This is also the rate applicable to such services when supplied to the non-agricultural sectors.  To extend the application of the 12.5 per cent rate to those services when supplied to farmers would be inequitable as it would be contrary to the principle that similar goods and services should be treated in like manner for VAT purposes.</P>
      <P>A farmer who is registered for VAT in respect of his farm business is entitled to claim credit on his VAT return for all VAT incurred on his purchases in relation to the business, in the same way as is any other VAT registered person.</P>
      <P>A farmer who is not registered for VAT and who is therefore not entitled to obtain credit for the VAT he has paid on his purchases is compensated for this by payment of a flat-rate addition of 2.5 per cent to the price he receives for all his agricultural produce and services sold to VAT registered persons.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In line with the recommendations of the report of the study group on the development of the psychiatric services, <i>Planning for the Future,</i> which was published in 1994 and which has been accepted as policy in mental health by successive Governments, the Eastern Health Board has been restructuring its psychiatric services with the twin policies of (a) developing a comprehensive range of community psychiatric services, and; (b) rehabilitating and discharging <Col N="686" /> patients from its various institutions to community housing.</P>
    <P>In 1981 St. Brendan's Hospital transferred the patients from Ward 4, St. Brendan's Hospital, to the Weir Home, and since then it has been utilised as a ward of St. Brendan's.</P>
    <P>St. Brendan's Hospital is now focusing on the rehabilitation of the residents there to prepare them for transfer to housing in the community in line with existing policy.</P>
    <P>The rehabilitation process involves the assessment of each patient's needs, including training needs and appropriate supports necessary for continuing care.  The process also involves personal consultation with patients regarding place of residence, choice of colleagues, etc., and also involves full consultation with patients' family, friends, and advocates. A number of houses have been identified in the community and the most suitable will be selected in consultation with residents and their families.</P>

      <P>The south inner city area has been identified by the board as one where the abuse of drugs is a cause for concern. The board recognised, that as part of its response to the problem the provision of a community drug treatment centre was necessary.  The Weir Home was identified for such a centre because of its location and suitable facilities.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="687" /> I am aware of unease among local communities about the provision of community drug treatment centres in their areas.  I have asked the Eastern Health Board to approach the development of such centres with the utmost sensitivity and with the fullest consultation with local communities.  I would also appeal to such communities to help facilitate the provision of treatment facilities for drug misusers in their own areas.  I am aware that consultation, both with the wider community in the south inner city and interests in the immediate locality of the Weir Home have been taking place for the past six weeks, and are continuing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific questions raised by the Deputy, he will recognise that proposals such as the one in question very often emerge following a process of deliberation at various levels within an organisation such as the Eastern Health Board.

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is not available.  As part of the birth notification system, statistical information is collected on each birth and includes specification of congenital birth defects.

Approximately 20 regions throughout Europe <Col N="689" /> are involved in this survey.  For the Eastern Health Board, a number of sources of information are used to ensure that reporting is as complete as possible. These include the birth notification system, which is the principal source, as well as hospital discharge data, death certification, liaison with directors of community care and information from individual pathologists and paediatricians.

      <P>The present urban renewal scheme commenced in August 1994 and will operate for a three year period in 35 centres throughout the country.  A comprehensive review of the impact, effectiveness and cost of the urban renewal schemes which have operated to date is currently under way.  This will assist in the formulation of future policy.  Pending completion of the review, it would be inappropriate to indicate what areas might be included in any future scheme.</P>

As type approval matters generally come within the remit of my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, I propose to ask him to advise the Commission of my concern that the review is completed quickly so that a decision can be made on the issue of amending the directive in relation to bull bars.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1985, the Commission on Social Welfare made a number of alternative estimates of the minimum income required for one adult which they termed the &ldquo;Main Rate&rdquo;.  All of the estimates were in the range of £50 to £60 weekly in 1985 terms, equivalent to between £66.60 and £79.90 in 1995 terms.</P>
      <P>The current rates of payment for old age contributory pension and retirement pension have reached the lower end of the main rate range, as updated to 1995 values.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rates of payment for other social-welfare entitlements are currently between 91 per cent and 99 per cent of the lower end of the main rate range. The question of making further progress towards implementing the main rate for <Col N="695" /> these social welfare entitlements will be considered in the light of the resources available and in the context of the commitment in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to maintain and develop the social insurance system.</P>
    <P>I consider that the basic rates of social welfare entitlements need to be greatly improved and that considerable progress still remains to be made in this area.</P>
    <P>The programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> also includes a commitment to commission the Economic and Social Research Institute to review the minimum adequate income rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare, with a view to recommending new rates in the light of improvements in social welfare and other changes since the report of the commission was published, and taking into account changes agreed in the programme.</P>
    <P>The review will be completed by mid 1996 and, along with other reviews of the social welfare systems, such as that of the expert working group on the integration of tax and social welfare, will form the basis for the formulation of proposals for improvements in the social welfare system in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>Child benefit is payable at double the normal rate in respect of each child, where three or more children are born together.  A special once-off grant of £400 is also payable where four or more children are born together, £300 on the birth of triplets and £200 in respect of twins.  These arrangements are designed to give recognition to the special nature of such births and the additional costs associated with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is committed to improving the child benefit scheme as <Col N="696" /> demonstrated by the significant improvements in the 1995 budget.  This year, the monthly rates of payment were increased from £20 to £27 for each of the first two children and from £25 to £32 for the third and subsequent children. The benefit was also extended to include eighteen years olds who are in full-time education or are physically or mentally handicapped.</P>
    <P>The cost of paying double rates of child benefit in respect of twins would be £8 million in a full year and could only be considered in light of available resources and the competing demands for such resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 84 to 86 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I replied to a large number of questions on this matter on 22 November. Only one aspect of the questions today was not replied to then.  The evaluation included a thorough scrutiny of both the proposed financing arrangements and financial analysis of the business plans contained in the six applications.  In addition to the independent consultants the project team included two professional accountants representing my Department and the Department of Finance.  I am fully satisfied as to the financial capability of the successful applicant to undertake the necessary investment and that the associated business plan is sufficiently robust.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>in view of his reply to Parliamentary Question No. 191 on 21 November 1995, if he will give details of the contractors commissioned by Telecom Éireann, outlining their names and experience in this highly specialised field; if their detailed reports submitted to Telecom Éireann can be made available; if his Department will request Telecom Éireann to commission a monitoring test on the base station referred to in the question in view of its location in a highly populated area; if he is concerned at the reports that emissions in the gigahertz frequency range can cause brain tumours; and the evidence, if any, there is to suggest that magnetic radiation as low as 0.5 milligrams at power levels of 1.0 watts can contribute to carcinoma.</Quest>

      <P>The independent monitoring tests to which I referred when I answered the Deputy's <Col N="702" /> question on 21 November last were carried out by Forbairt, the national standards body who do this sort of testing on a commercial basis.  Forbairt's reports to Telecom Éireann are confidential and are made available only to the appropriate parties-agencies.</P>
      <P>As I said in my reply on 21 November, Telecom Éireann is satisfied that these base stations are designed and operated in compliance with IRPA guidelines.  I have no function relating to the health aspects of radio transmissions other than to see that facilities are operated in conformity with best international practice.  I have no evidence before me that the IRPA guidelines are in any way deficient in that respect or that the facilities in question are operating outside them.</P>
      <P>While I am happy to give this kind of information to the Deputy, it does seem to me that a decision to have tests done in any particular case is a matter for the day-to-day administration of its affairs by Telecom Éireann and I have no function in such a matter.  Perhaps the local residents association in the case mentioned by him should approach the company directly.</P>

      <P>A fishery harbour development programme in respect of 1996 is being prepared by my Department at present. The proposals for Pallas Pier are being considered in that context.</P>
      <P>I should caution, however, that funding for fishery harbour development under the Fisheries Operational Programme is very limited and that only projects which can demonstrate a significant potential return from the fisheries perspective context will be successful.</P>
