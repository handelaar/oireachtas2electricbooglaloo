      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy O'Rourke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to request leave under Standing Order 30 to move the adjournment of the Dáil to discuss a matter of national importance, the commercial circumstances of Shannon Aerospace and in particular the future of the 750 jobs, approximately, within the company.  In so doing I wish to complain bitterly about the attempts by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment to muzzle me on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow the Deputy to deviate from the text of the notice.  Having considered the matter fully, it is not considered to be one contemplated by the Standing Order and therefore I cannot grant leave to move the motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of information, what does one do when one reads about a matter in the daily newspaper and cannot be heard on the <Col N="686" /> matter in the Dáil?  Can you give me any advice?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>May I seek your advice?  What can one do if one cannot move a motion under Standing Orders <i>ad infinitum?</i></P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, ran to the newspapers. He is a &ldquo;scaredy pants&rdquo; and will not answer questions in the Dáil.  He is afraid to face hard questions.  He is the Minister for unemployment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1 and 8.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of legislation, the House is now almost redundant although we will continue to co-operate in discussing the business for next week.  Can the Tánaiste give us any indication of what legislation is likely to be introduced?  At the start of the session we were given a list of 49 Bills of which we have seen two, the legislation providing for the appointment of the two unnecessary extra Ministers of State and the Social Welfare Bill.  We have also dealt with one Bill which was not on the list, the abortion information legislation introduced by the Minister for Health.  Yesterday the Tánaiste <Col N="687" /> kindly informed me that the Finance Bill will be taken in the next session.  Is there any other legislation which is likely to be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Much legislation is being prepared and will be brought before the Dáil as soon as possible.  I am sure the Whips will have an opportunity to discuss this at their meeting today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday the Tánaiste referred to at least one Bill which apparently has been agreed to by the Government, the Bill dealing with sanitary services. In this regard wholesale confusion has been created for individuals, local authorities, residents and community groups.  When will the Opposition and the public see this Bill, which has been the subject of leaks, rather than press releases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy will tell us where he stands on the matter.</P>

      <P>We heard the Deputy say last night that he wants to shed 3,000 jobs in the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>I am at a loss to understand why the Leader of the Opposition is confused on this matter.  Perhaps if he was in the House yesterday for the day he would have seen the notices and heard the announcements.  A circular will issue from the Minister for the Environment to local authorities next week and legislation will be presented in the House within a matter of weeks. There is no confusion about the decision made yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised a matter with the Tánaiste yesterday and I thank him for contacting my office with the details. On the question of the crazy legislation being proposed by the Government which will not satisfy anyone's needs, is it proposed to appoint more District Court judges to reduce the huge backlog which will pile up in the District Court?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation has been promised but we cannot debate the matter at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislation will be forthcoming.  There will be no need to appoint extra District Court justices to deal with this matter; the numbers we will be talking about will be few.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>While the Tánaiste has endeavoured to be helpful, will the Government give some thought to prioritising the legislation which will be introduced in the next session?  The list of 49 Bills we have been given is of no use to us as we have been given no indication as to when these Bills will be introduced.  Will the Bill dealing with sanitary services contain any proposals to establish a small claims court to deal with the many people who will not pay their water charges as a result of the Government's decision and who will have to be taken to court&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJacob" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle Joe Jacob">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking people to court for the sake of £100 will cost the local authorities at least twice that figure, and the Tánaiste knows that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the proposed sanitary services legislation, I, like other Deputies, have had many <Col N="689" /> queries from constituents on the question of water charges.  Will the Tánaiste answer a question on behalf of all the parties in Government?  Do people have to pay these water charges?  Is he inviting them to pay these charges?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  I would like Deputy Kitt to swear an affidavit in relation to the queries on service charges he received yesterday from Dublin South County.</P>

    <Title>Minerals Development Bill, 1995:    Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This Bill is essentially a technical precautionary measure which has been prepared in response to legal advice.</P>
      <P>Its main purpose is to give specific statutory cover for certain long-standing practices for renewal of minerals prospecting licences and for charging fees for applications for certain State mining facilities.  Its purpose is also to update the original penalties in the Minerals Development Act, 1940 and apply them to offences by companies and other organisations so as to maintain an effective deterrence against illegal mining and other offences.</P>
      <P>Since the detailed explanatory and financial memorandum, which was published with the Bill, deals with all provisions of the Bill in quite some detail. I propose to concentrate my remarks on the general background to the Bill and on the reasons why, with the assistance of this House, the Bill should be enacted as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Minerals Development Act, 1940 came into operation thousands of minerals prospecting licences have been granted by successive Ministers following public newspaper advertisement of the intention to grant the licence and consideration of any representations made.  Representations are very rare indeed, which is hardly surprising given <Col N="700" /> the responsible way in which holders of minerals prospecting licences generally conduct their business.</P>
    <P>Many of those licences were renewed, in some cases a number of times, by successive Ministers, in good faith, including hundreds of licences currently in force.  The long-standing practice of renewals and successive renewals has not given rise to any difficulty or challenge. Legal advice, however, has drawn attention to the lack of specific statutory provision for licence renewals and put the case that fresh licences should have been granted after the term of the original licences expired.  Therefore, there is pressing need for legislation to validate all renewals to date and to specifically empower the Minister to renew any of those licences and any other licences granted in the future, where the Minister considers that renewal is justified in the particular circumstances of each case.</P>
    <P>I draw the attention of the House to the fact that, in the interests of transparency, section 2 imposes the same obligation on the Minister to publicly advertise the intention to renew a minerals prospecting licence as applies when such a licence is to be granted for the first time in all cases.</P>
    <P>There are currently 486 minerals prospecting licences in force of which about 300 would fall due for renewal in 1995, and the rest would fall due for renewal in 1996 or later.  Details of minerals prospecting licences in force are given in the statutory report for the six-months to 31 December 1994 which I presented to this House and to Seanad Éireann on 2 February 1995.  Clearly, without the legislation now proposed to effectively safeguard the <i>status quo,</i> there would be very considerable disruption to the renewal process for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The essential focus of minerals prospecting activity is to identify as quickly as possible all commercially viable minerals deposits which could be developed and holders of minerals prospecting licences are encouraged to <Col N="701" /> undertake minerals prospecting in a very active and systematic way.</P>
    <P>Renewals of minerals prospecting licences are considered strictly on a case by case basis.  Thus, whether the licence will be renewed in a particular case will depend, first, on whether the licensee seeks renewal of the licence.  About 100 licences are surrendered each year by licensees some of whom seek licences for other areas perceived to be more prospective.  If renewal is sought, the exploration and mining division of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications would give particular attention to actual performance to date by the licensee including the submission of required work reports and compliance with the other conditions of the licence and with undertakings given and, if those were satisfactory, the licensee would have to enter into a commitment to undertake a specific further programme of exploration in the area in question before renewal of the licence would be agreed.</P>
    <P>Geologists from the exploration and mining division of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications closely monitor exploration activity by licensees and conduct many site visits throughout the State.  Licensees are obliged to give to the division at least two weeks advance notice in writing of proposed borehole and shaft sinking to a depth of more than 20 feet below the surface and to obtain the division's written approval, at least 20 working days in advance, for proposed trenching operations; these requirements provide opportunities for the division's geologists to conduct particularly focused and detailed site visits, the outcome of which could have a direct bearing on whether the particular licences in question &mdash; or other licences held by the particular licensee &mdash; ought to be renewed.</P>
    <P>Subject to meeting the requisite technical, financial and environmental criteria, and certain specific procedural requirements where privately-owned minerals are involved, a successful licensed minerals prospector would be <Col N="702" /> favourably considered by my Department for the grant of a state mining facility.  Every encouragement is given by the Department to licensees at minerals prospecting stage to work assiduously so as to identify viable deposits for development.  The Department also assists licensees in identifying as early as possible all steps needed to be taken by the licensees to secure the necessary permits for the development from the relevant authorities, that is, the Department itself, the relevant local planning authority and the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, as national licensing authority, must ensure that all proposals for mine development are thoroughly and expertly examined before permission is granted to proceed with them.  The Minister must ensure that valuable national minerals resources are effectively and efficiently developed, and State revenues therefrom assured.  In addition, in accordance with the obligation of each Minister to protect the environment, the Minister must also be satisfied, before permitting the development of national minerals resources that the development will cause as little harm as possible to the environment.  Furthermore, the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, stipulate that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications must receive a copy of the environmental impact statement, prepared by the developer of any mine project, at the time the developer submits an application for planning permission to the relevant planning authority.  Staff of the Department's exploration and mining division and of the Geological Survey of Ireland, which operates under the aegis of the Department, are directly involved in examining all proposals for mine projects.</P>
    <P>In the case of small mine projects, involving minerals such as coal or industrial minerals generally, the engagement of external consultants would not usually be necessary.  In the case of larger <Col N="703" /> mine projects, however, the Minister needs the best possible independent advice.  This is particularly so in cases involving base metals &mdash; such as the major proposed zinc-lead mines at Galmoy, County Kilkenny, and in my constituency at Lisheen, County Tipperary &mdash; which would have major infrastructural and financial considerations as well as possible implications for the environment.  In such cases the Minister requires the best mining practices and minimising, if not avoiding, all important long term negative effects of the mines if they were to proceed to be brought to his attention.  This means the Minister has to call for advice from suitably qualified and experienced external consultants from relevant disciplines and having the required international standing.  Because of the small number of mines in the State, independent expert advice of the required level would not ordinarily be available from within the State except in relation to some limited aspects of mine projects.</P>
    <P>Where applications for a State mining lease or licence are successful, the practice has been to recoup handling costs as part of the fees for the State mining facility for the project.  There is no mechanism in place to recoup handling costs necessarily incurred by the Minister in considering applications which turned out to be unsuccessful or are later withdrawn for any reason.  Section 5 is designed to fill the gap in the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1979, by specifically requiring all applicants for State mining leases or licences to pay an appropriate fee with their applications. As heretofore, the handling fee will be kept as low as possible consistent with a thorough independent assessment of each application.</P>
    <P>The need to legislate for renewal of minerals prospecting licences and for application fees to be charged for State mining facilities gives me the opportunity to legislate also for updating the original penalties in the 1940 Act for a variety of offences.  The penalties have become derisory through the fall in the <Col N="704" /> value of money.  The offences relate to illegal working of minerals, obstruction of authorised persons and failure to provide required information to the Minister. Clearly, there is continuing need to deter would-be offenders by having updated penalties which can be applied specifically to offences committed by individuals whether acting alone or acting behind a corporate veil.  Sections 6 and 7 will allow the courts to impose penalties fitting particular offences and circumstances if such should arise in the future.</P>
    <P>I am determined that, with the proper application of modern technology and mining techniques, the mineral resources of the nation will be developed with proper safeguards for the environment.  These are national assets which must be developed actively and responsibly to achieve the maximum benefit in terms of job creation, increasing national wealth and underpinning industrial growth.  It is vital that every effort be made to locate all commercially viable mineral reserves and, having done so, to bring them into production as efficiently as possible.  My aim is to support as strongly as I can the principle of sustaining development for the benefit of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>As this House will be aware, the previous Government established a review group under the chairmanship of Peter Quinn to undertake a fundamental review of national minerals policy and the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1979.  I requested the group to report to me with recommendations early next month.  I shall arrange to have copies of the report presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>My intention is to seek Government decisions on the review group's recommendations as quickly as possible after I have received and considered the report.  It is not possible to say now whether there will be a further Minerals Development Bill in 1995 or what such a Bill might contain.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House does not prejudice the fundamental review of <Col N="705" /> national minerals policy or of the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1979, which is in progress.  Rather, the Bill is required to fill as quickly as possible important gaps in the Minerals Development Acts which have come to our attention.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>While I welcome the Bill it has been hastily prepared and I cannot understand the reasons for introducing it at this time.  I listened with interest to the Minister and he has not made it obvious to me, nor I am sure to the House, that there is any urgency pertaining to the Bill.  I welcome the Minister to the House and his presence here is evidence of his commitment to mining.  It is obvious that a man based in Tipperary close to the Lisheen and Galmoy sites should not alone be here but be seen to have an interest in mining because it is obviously important to his local area.  However, I am baffled by the team of Ministers of State and their responsibilities in his Department.  A recent reply to a parliamentary question indicated that Minister Stagg had responsibility for mining matters.</P>
      <P>I queried that yesterday with the Ceann Comhairle's Office as I was aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, attended an international mining conference recently and I was told no responsibilities had been allocated to her.  I cannot understand how a reply to a parliamentary question indicated that Minister Stagg has responsibility for mining, the Minister introduced the Bill and the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle is present, yet I was informed by the Ceann Comhairle's office that she has no responsibilities.  That baffles me and I would be grateful if the Minister would clarify the position before the conclusion of the debate.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="706" /> The legislation in place prior to the publication of this Bill ensures that mining operations in Ireland must now conform to the highest enviromental standards, among the strictest in the world. At least 15 Acts of Parliament affect mining in Ireland.  These include the Minerals Development Act, 1940 to 1979, the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965, the Wildlife Act, 1976, the Fisheries Consolidation Acts, 1959 and 1980, the Public Health Acts, 1879 and 1907, the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, the Local Government Planning and Development Acts, 1963 and 1990, the Local Government Water Pollution Acts, 1977 and 1989, the Local Government Air Pollution Acts, 1987, the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992, and various other Acts which have a peripheral effect on mining here.</P>
    <P>In addition to those statutory controls, the incorporation into Irish legislation of the European Community Directive 85/337 on environmental impact assessment requires that any mining project must complete a comprehensive environmental impact statement which is submitted to the relevant local authority as part of the process for planning permission.  That ensures full consideration must be given to environmental issues before a planning decision is finally made.  The environmental impact statement is studied by the relevant local authority, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Mining Board and various outside experts nominated by those bodies to ensure that the proposed mining development meets the most rigorous environmental standards.</P>
    <P>Professional mining companies in Ireland are committed to carrying out all exploration activities and to planning and constructing mineral projects in compliance with all Irish and EU legislation. Those professional companies willingly accept the responsibility to ensure that mineral deposits are developed in a way which is compatible with the needs of the environment and <Col N="707" /> we have a good record on this in comparison with other countries, some of which I visited.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Energy in the former Government, I set up a consultative process between the mining industry and the exploration and mining division of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications in relation to a proposal for a Bill to amend the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1979.  The Department sought the views of the mining industry on those proposals submitted to the Department before I left office prior to last Christmas.  During the discussions I had with the industry at that time it became clear that there was a need for a fresh approach to mining in Ireland.  I felt that the public fears which often arise when mining development is proposed should be further considered.  We must all realise that it takes many years from the time a mineral deposit is identified to bringing forward a development proposal.  Many professional studies are carried out including feasibility, environmental and marketing studies, financial projections etc, before a deposit can be considered for development.</P>
    <P>When a mining exploration company considers that a proposed mining project is commercially viable, it must submit a planning application, with an environment impact statement, to the relevant local authority.  It is also required to give proper public notification of its intention to apply for planning permission.  At that stage any member of the public is entitled to communicate in writing with the planning authority setting out any concerns he or she may have about the proposed mining project which must be taken into consideration by the relevant planning authority before it makes a final decision.  If it makes a positive decision allowing the mining development to proceed, that decision can in turn be appealed to An Bord Pleanála by any member of the public within 21 days.  In the event of such appeal the proposed <Col N="708" /> application will be assessed independently by the Planning Appeals Board and treated as a basic new planning application to another authority.  When the National Mining Board, the local authority or the Planning Appeals Board have made decisions on applications any individual is entitled to bring such a matter to court.</P>
    <P>As the former Minister for Energy, I considered there was a major need to streamline and put in place a clearly defined public minerals policy.  I considered that the mining companies who carried the risks should be aware of what was required of them.  I considered that the public should be aware of the State's position pertaining to mining and the environmental considerations on which mining impinges and which must be protected at all times.  I also consider that the financial services which will underpin future mining development should be aware of the conditions required in Ireland before a mining licence is made available.  Above all, I saw the need for a national policy to ensure that mining was carried out to the highest professional standards in accordance with the most detailed environmental criteria, so that anybody involved in any aspect of mining would know exactly what was required.  A national policy should show clearly an opportunity for investment in our natural resources which should serve the needs of our people and make a positive contribution to our national economic well-being.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I recommended to Government that we establish a national minerals policy review group, which the Government accepted.  I established the National Minerals Policy Review Group in April 1994 which was given a mandate to report by the end of that year.  Were it not for the interruption in Government last year this report would have been published a few months ago.  I cannot understand the reasons for the delay.  However, the Minister has confirmed that it will be published next month.  I asked the review group to produce a report <Col N="709" /> addressing all the issues of consequence to our minerals industry, in order to place it on a secure footing into the next century and, specifically, to increase its competitiveness in attracting investment to create wealth and employment. These were fair, achievable, sustainable and practical goals.  I look forward to receiving a copy of that report as soon as it is published.</P>
    <P>Since that report should have been available at the end of last year &mdash; and we are told now it will be published next month &mdash; I cannot understand why this Bill was introduced so quickly.  Suffice to say I have my suspicions and, unless the Minister is able to allay my fears when replying to this debate.  I shall be confirmed in those suspicions until I have had an opportunity of reading the report of that National Minerals Policy Review Group.  I will be in a position then to confirm the precise position.</P>
    <P>The overall purpose of this Bill is to make express statutory provision for the renewal of minerals prospecting licences and validate licences renewed since the enactment of the original Minerals Development Act in 1940.  I have no difficulty with those proposals.  However, I am satisfied from my knowledge of the provisions of the 1940 Act there should be no doubt about the capacity of the Minister and his Department to grant or renew minerals prospecting licences.  If there is any doubt it is better that such be eliminated in any new Bill, which I welcome.  Also to be welcomed is the fact that the Bill proposes that any renewal of a prospecting licence be published in at least one newspaper circulating in the locality in which it is proposed to grant or renew the prospecting licence.  That is only fair to everybody.</P>
    <P>I am very surprised at the inclusion of section 5 (2) which gives the Minister and his Department, in consultation with the Minister for Finance and that Department, power to charge such fees as both Ministers and their respective Departments shall determine.  I consider that to be an excessive step which constitutes a total disincentive to mining. During my time as Minister of State in <Col N="710" /> the Department I cannot recollect ever having discussed this proposal with the industry, nor do I remember departmental officials at any time suggesting this to me or the industry.  Therefore, I cannot see how it arises, which leads me to wonder whether this is the real reason for the rushed introduction of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The last mining licence granted by the former Minister and his Department was to Arcon Mines Limited for a major development of a zinc and lead mine project to take place at Galmoy in Kilkenny over the next ten years.  The former Minister and I were deeply involved in this application during our tenure in the Department and left no stone unturned to ensure that every detail pertaining to that application was fully considered.  The former Minister and I became the victims of our efforts as a result of hypocritical comments by members of the various parties now comprising the multi-party coalition Government.  As soon as they assumed office, they were very quick to forget and have not yet acknowledged that we were always motivated by hard work and dedicated effort to ensure that the resources in the south-east would make a major contribution to local, regional and national economic development.</P>
    <P>The experience gained from dealing with that application confirmed for me the necessity to have a clearly defined, public national mining policy.  For the benefit of those who may not have full knowledge of our mining industry, it is important that I put on the record the detailed process involved whenever an application for a mining licence is received.  In the case of Arcon Mines Limited, the applicants were obliged to complete a comprehensive environmental impact statement, to be submitted to Kilkenny County Council, forming part of their planning permission application and they appointed eminent consultants to undertake that environmental impact statement.  In turn, Kilkenny County Council employed highly qualified professional consultants to assess that EIS. The Department of Transport, Energy <Col N="711" /> and Communications employed yet another group of consultants to take a third look at that environmental impact statement and the application overall.  In addition, that application was scrutinised by An Bord Pleanála and the Environmental Protection Agency, both statutory bodies having their resident professionals, who gave the application further detailed consideration.  Finally, the National Mining Board had to consider the application and hear all objections.</P>
    <P>I believe in the law and in the democratic process and that consultants and professionals have a role to play. However, I believe there comes a time when the same type of qualified people acting on behalf of different agencies on the same matter merely confuses the overall position.  Consequently, I do not understand how the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, within which there are eminent professionals in the exploration and mining divisions, as in the Geological Survey office, a subsidiary statutory body attached to that Department, should be obliged to employ another group of professionals to third guess the original application already handled by at least two other consultancy groups and subsequently by two State bodies. The Department propose to charge the cost of its professional staff and the consultants to the applicant company.  I consider this to be unnecessarily bureaucratic and cumbersome.  It does not take cognisance of the high standards of professional advice available to the Department and relevant State bodies whose statutory role it is to deal with such applications.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 5 allows the Department latitude to third guess applications for mining licences by employing other consultants and to charge exorbitant fees for those services. I cannot accept that as fair, equitable or necessary.  Consequently, I shall be tabling a substantial amendment to this section which I shall expect the <Col N="712" /> Minister to address in a positive manner. This section appears to infer there is a long-standing practice to charge, in advance, a non-returnable handling fee of up to £200,000 for an application for a mining lease or licence.  As everybody knows, there is no such long-standing practice.  It is important that the provisions of this section be put in context. An application for planning permission by a mining company to a local authority carries a mandatory maximum fee of £10,000 whereas an application to the Environmental Protection Agency by the same mining company carries a maximum fee of £16,000.  A handling fee of up to £200,000 charged by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, which is supposed to encourage investment in and development of the extractive mining industry, is a definite disincentive to investment, ruling out small, indigenous companies which have been the pioneers of mining projects in this country.  No other business or industry is required to pay up to £200,000 in addition to the normal statutory fees, charged by the planning authorities and the Environmental Protection Agency with which I have no problem.  The composition of that change is not itemised.  From my knowledge of the mining industry, I am confident they would have no problem with a reasonable handling charge.  However the recoupable handling fee the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications proposes to charge is disproportionate and over and above the normal charges levied on any other business.  This is unfair and discriminatory and a disincentive to the exploitation of our natural resources.  I cannot understand how the Department staffed by the relevant professionals whose function is to ensure these resources can be exploited to the highest standards would now make the most negative proposals that has come before the House in my time here.  In dealing with natural resources and the risk takers involved in the industry whose success or failure depends on their companies carrying <Col N="713" /> these risks surely there is an onus on the State to acknowledge the position.</P>
    <P>Since May 1994 the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications was specifically excluded from environmental considerations by section 98 (2) and 98 (3) of the Environmental Protection Agency Act.  As a consequence, that Department has been spared the costs that would arise from such a scrutiny. Such considerations arose only once in relation to the Arcon application. This scrutiny was a duplication of the Kilkenny County Council scrutiny and a quadruplication of the efforts of both the Environmental Protection Agency and An Bord Pleanála.  Consequently, section 5 is almost unnecessary but I am prepared to adopt a positive attitude to it provided the Minister is prepared to take on board a substantial amendment which I propose to table on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 6 proposes to increase the penalties in the Principal Act by updating them and I have no difficulty with this.  Section 7 proposes to ensure that bodies corporate fall into the same category as the individual and that they cannot evade their responsibilities under any of the Acts and I agree with this also.</P>
    <P>Section 8 allows the Minister to expend the relevant moneys under the Act, in consultation with the Minister for Finance but I do not see much expenditure on the Minister's side as a result of this Act, apart from advertising costs.  It is only proper that these should be regulated but they will not be a major drain on the resources of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    <P>While I welcome this Bill, I sincerely regret the Minister and his Department did not have more patience and ensure that consideration would be given to all aspects of mining once the national minerals policy review group reported. There is a danger that this report will be allowed gather dust on the basis that a Minerals Development Bill has been published prior to the arrival of the review group's report.  I am baffled by <Col N="714" /> this lack of coherence.  I do not regard it as either professional or politically wise to deal with our natural resources in this piecemeal fashion.</P>
    <P>Nationally and internationally, the minerals industry has a history of serious litigation.  It requires detailed consideration and ultimate agreement between the State and the professional mining companies, taking into account existing legislation, the history of mining and the desire of the public at large to ensure that economic progress is based on equality of opportunity and the highest professional and environmental standards at all times.  I hope this Bill will make some contribution to this. I look forward to the report of the national minerals policy review group. Subsequently, I hope we will be back in this House again to discuss a detailed mining Bill when all aspects of mining in Ireland can be considered and legislated for in the interest of the people.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the officials in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, in particular, the exploration and mining section and the Geological Survey of Ireland.  I found them to be positive and dedicated officials with high professional standards. I have no doubt they have the capacity to do the job.  It is unnecessary to call in other professionals to deal with matters which have already been dealt with by them.  I hope the legislation will be reasonable and equitable and that professionals will not get involved unnecessarily.  I wish the Minister, his Department and the mining industry every success.</P>

      <P>Aontaím leis an méid a dúirt an Teachta Treacy, is é sin, go gcuireann sé ionadh air, agus cuireann sé ionadh ormsa chomh maith, an fáth go bhfuil an Bille seo os comhair na Dála faoi láthair.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil grúpa curtha le chéile ag an Rialtas ó Aibreán 1994 chun scrúdú géar a dhéanamh ar thionscal na mianraí sa tír seo agus chun moltaí a chur os comhair an Aire, na Dála agus an phobail.

      <P>I am absolutely amazed this Bill has been brought before the Dáil this morning. All of us who have an interest in the mineral industry are aware of the minerals policy review group established by the Government in April 1994. I recently tabled parliamentary questions about the work of this group and was informed it was about to report. The people appointed by the Government to examine the minerals industry are eminently qualified to make recommendations on what is needed to ensure greater efficiency in this industry at departmental level and GSI level, with a view to achieving the maximum benefit for the economy in an environmentally sustainable way.</P>
      <P>Far be it for any Member of this House, former Ministers for Energy or otherwise, to seek at this stage, when the Minerals Development Bill is before the House, to make proposals on what may or may not need to be done by way of legislation or amendment to this Bill when we are about to get the views of an outstanding review group appointed by a previous Government.  These people have practical experience and academic and administrative knowledge of this industry.  I asked for the names of the members of the group and I note it has a widespread representation.  I would be pleased to see its recommendations.  It is essential that the Government follow on from the report of that group with legislation to give effect to the main recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is much dissatisfaction in this industry that the level of activity is not higher.  Ministers who quote the current number of prospecting licences believe the general public think there is a great deal of activity in the mineral prospecting area.  The reality is that the number should be higher.  In 1989 there were 770 current prospecting licences.  I am not sure what the level is today but it is <Col N="716" /> down substantially on that figure.  The Minister in his speech gave a figure of 486 mineral prospecting licences currently in force.  Yet in reply to a parliamentary question yesterday, I was told there are 516 validly held prospecting licences.  That is confusing and it confirms the allegation by Deputy Noel Treacy that this Bill has been rushed through.  I do not understand how we can get such conflicting information in reply to a parliamentary question on Wednesday 29 March 1995 and in a speech by the Minister on Thursday 30 March.</P>
    <P>It seems the Government does not have a legislative programme to bring before the House and that this Bill was hastily put together to fill in the time of the House coming up to Easter because there appears to be a paucity of legislation from this rainbow coalition. Whether it cannot agree on proposals &mdash; the Leader of the main Opposition party, Deputy Bertie Ahern, referred to it this morning and my Leader has referred to it &mdash; the public is coming to the conclusion that something is going on behind the scenes between the three coalition partners and they are not able to agree.  This morning we had the unseemly carry-on of the Tánaiste having a change of heart on the legislation imposing compulsory water charges on all local authorities which he introduced when he was Minister for the Environment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Members of the Labour Party have consistently opposed the legislation at council meetings.  Democratic Left went into Government on the basis that certain things would be done and now that party is prepared to accept something else.  This does not augur well for the future of the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have been told that the report of the review group will soon be published and that legislation will be required to <Col N="717" /> implement some of its recommendations. Instead of waiting for the report the Minister has introduced this legislation which will give statutory effect to something which has been the practice for many years under the minerals Acts. When I was Minister I granted and renewed prospecting licences under the existing legislation and I do not recall ever being informed by the legal advisers in the Department that there was a doubt about the licences I was signing.  Deputy Treacy was in the same position and he has expressed the same view.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that certain matters had arisen which required the legislation to be brought forward quickly. Yet he has not given a full explanation. He said:</P>
    <P>Many of those licences were renewed, in some cases a number of times, by successive Ministers in good faith, including hundreds of licences currently in force.  The long-standing practice of renewals and successive renewals has not given rise to any difficulty or challenge.  Legal advice, however, has drawn attention to the lack of specific statutory provision for licence renewals and put the case that fresh licences should have been granted after the term of the original licences expired.  Therefore, there is pressing need for legislation to validate all renewals to date...</P>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that the Minister has not substantiated this claim with facts.  He may be wasting the time of the House by bringing forward the legislation at this time and he seems to be treating the minerals industry in a very offhanded manner.  I am surprised that he should do this.</P>
    <P>What has given rise to the need for the legislation?  What is the legal advice which has indicated the absolute pressing need to introduce the legislation at this time?  I am not aware of any such need and the person who succeeded me in the Department has confirmed that he is not aware of it either. <Col N="718" /> In order to fill a gap in the Government's legislative programme a pressing need for the legislation has been concocted. I do not know why we are being asked to debate the Bill today when there has been no legal difficulty in the past and there is no evidence of any new pressing need.</P>
    <P>The level of prospecting is much less than the industry would like and there is a pressing need to update all of the administrative arrangements so as to ensure that the industry is given greater encouragement to expand its prospecting activities.  In 1989 there were 770 prospecting licences.  The information given by the Minister in reply to parliamentary questions from me conflicts with the information he gave to the House this morning.  If the figure of 486 is correct then this is a reflection on the level of activity in the industry.</P>
    <P>I would prefer to make my points about the mining industry in general in the context of the overall review.  There is no point in debating this matter in any great detail at this time given that my contribution would be more valuable if I had the benefit of the opinions of the group set up by the Government.  I would prefer to have an opportunity to study the report &mdash; I thank the Minister for confirming that it will be published &mdash; and to consult with the industry before making any comments.  This legislation fills a gap in the Government's legislative programme.  This is a most unsatisfactory way to deal with this important industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister is well aware of the potential of the mining industry &mdash; very valuable ores have been discovered at Galmoy in his constituency.  An application for a mining licence has been made for this discovery but the discovery in Lisheen has not yet reached this stage.  A number of issues have arisen which have slowed down the process for bringing that development to mining licence application stage.  I do not want to go into the details of any particular application but all environmentally friendly sustainable mining <Col N="719" /> operations should be given every assistance not only under existing legislation but under new legislation which deals with issues which may not have arisen in the past.  There is an obligation on the Government to introduce such legislation so as to benefit the economy and bring forward the day when people will be able to secure gainful employment in the industry.  Happily many of these finds are in areas of high unemployment where there are few employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>I have no major objections to the legislation which will merely give statutory effect to something which has been the practice in the past.  However, I reserve my right to table amendments on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support this Bill.  A clear legal framework is vital for mineral prospecting and development generally.  The three Minerals Acts, 1940-79, have served us well but need to be continually reviewed to ensure that they continue to serve national policy.  A review of those Acts is one of the tasks allotted by the previous Government to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications with recommendations covering all of the issues of importance to mineral prospecting and development in the State.  I look forward to the report of the review group which is due to be published shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General and the Government's legal advisers have identified serious gaps in the 1940 Act.  Therefore, the Minerals Development Bill, 1995, must be enacted and this will not prejudice the work of the review group.  The Bill is designed to provide clear statutory backing for long standing arrangements for renewal of mineral prospecting licences and for charging fees to examine applications for State mining leases and licences.  In any case, <Col N="720" /> the fees would relate to the specific nature of the individual project and the issues to be addressed by the Minister to satisfy the statutory obligation that the public interest is served by granting a State mining lease or licence in that particular case.  I am sure all Deputies agree that there should be effective penalties to stop illegal mining and that bringing the original penalties in the 1940 Act up-to-date is necessary and long overdue. That is dealt with in section 6 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>I referred to serious gaps in our existing mineral development Acts that the Bill is designed to fill.  In sections 2 to 4 the Bill expressly provides for the renewal and successive renewals of mineral prospecting licences which has been the practice since the 1940 Act came into operation, but without statutory cover.  I do not need to spell out in great detail the chaos that would ensue in the industry when it became widely known that renewal of mineral prospecting licences over the years had been carried out without statutory cover.  Many licences fall to be renewed in 1995 and 1996.  I am sure the implications of the legal advice are abundantly clear to all Members, particularly those who held Ministerial posts in the Department. Those implications were obvious to the last Government and the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, was preparing to bring this legislation before the House before the fall of the Government.  He was not going to wait for the report to be published.  When one considers the implications of the legal advice, the facts are obvious.</P>
    <P>Application fees for State mining leases and licences to provide a clear statutory basis for securing the Minister's costs for considering such application, through engagement of external consultants and otherwise, are dealt with in section 5.  Fees have been deducted from successful applicants, but there has been no statutory procedure for reclaiming expenses in investigating and getting the advice the Minister requires from unsuccessful applicants.  A great deal of time, effort and expense <Col N="721" /> must be invested by the State in analysing each application that comes before it.</P>
    <P>Offences by body corporates, such as companies and other organisations, as well as offences by individuals which are already provided for under the older Act, are introduced in section 7, the provisions of which update the offences to make them more relevant in the present cost climate.  The Bill provides an opportunity to increase the original penalties for a wide variety of offences to deter would-be offenders and protect State royalties.  The remaining sections are standard features of Bills, namely, the definition section, provision for ministerial expenses in administering the Bill when enacted, the short title and its collective citation and construction with existing Mineral Development Acts, 1940 to 1979.</P>
    <P>The main question by the two previous speakers was why the legislation could not wait until the Government is in a position to make decisions on the recommendations of the national minerals policy review group, in a report we expect to be published next week.  I accept that is a reasonable question. When the Bill was presented to me and as the report is imminent, I asked why we could not wait.</P>

As the matter has been brought to the Government's attention by its legal advisers and the Attorney General, there could be a field day for those who would be of a mind to abuse the position.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy adverted to the fact that he was informed in a parliamentary question he tabled last week that there were 516 prospecting licences.  In his speech today the Minister stated there are 486.  On 22 March there were 516 prospecting licences.  Many have not been renewed and many fall for renewal at this time.  Today, there are only 486. The correct facts were given by the Minister last week and today.</P>

    <P>The engagement of external expertise by the Department was also criticised. The Department and the GSI are not involved in day to day mining and, therefore, are not in a position to assess at first hand what should be proper state-of-the-art technical approaches to long term development of national <Col N="723" /> resources.  The Minister must have independent advice on, for example, the nature and quantity of ore reserve and the financial robustness of the project in which no other authority is interested. It is only in the case of major projects that the Minister would consider seeking expert advice outside the State. Small to medium-term projects are handled by experts within the State.  To safeguard the interests of our reserves in this area and the resources which belong to the people we seek up-to-date state-of-the-art advice, particularly in the case of large projects and I do not believe that approach should be criticised. A similar approach was adopted when Deputies Molloy and Treacy were Ministers.</P>

      <P>The two previous speakers referred to handling fees for examining applications for State mining leases and licences covered in section 5 of the Bill.  The section merely puts into clear statutory format what has always been the practice, but legal advice pointed out that it needs to be nailed down in a statutory format and this is what the Bill is doing.  In the case of Arcon, the fees ran to a substantial figure and were paid as decided by the then Minister, Deputy Cowen.  Any proposals which Deputies may make regarding section 5 will be carefully considered on Committee Stage.  We look forward to hearing the views of Deputies at that time and amendments will be carefully considered. Fees are decided on a case by case basis.  The £200,000 fee is for the Lisheen project only, which is the only one of its size under consideration.  It is not true there is a standard fee in all cases, and this must not be implied.  For <Col N="724" /> example, in the case of a small coalmine, the State might have to pay a few thousand pounds for expert advice before deciding if it is in the public interest to grant a State mining lease or licence.  There is no standard fee; applications will be decided on a case by case basis.</P>
      <P>Recently I represented the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications at the annual conference of the Prospecters and Developers Association of Canada held in Toronto.  I was greatly impressed by the level of interest in Ireland by the mining industry around the world, as Deputy Treacy was when he represented the Government at the same conference last year.  I was impressed also by the effort other countries put into promoting their own prospects. We must not be found wanting in this regard.  Our own display stand, staffed by members of our exploration and mining division in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications was extremely well received and served as an excellent focal point for industry contact with the current situation here.  I commend the division for the excellence of their display and the communication they opened up with the mining industry worldwide, keeping Ireland on the map as a prospective area for mining.  We must capitalise on the interest in Ireland shown in Toronto and encourage greater participation from major international players as well as our own domestic companies in the mining industry here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Above all, there is an urgent need to put what I term the &ldquo;feel good factor&rdquo; back into the mining industry.  Given the controversies and court cases, not least the Croagh Patrick issue, I can understand why the public have backed off in their appreciation of the importance of extractive industries generally but particularly what we refer to as the mining industry.  We need to give much more consideration to how the regulatory authorities in this country interact. When a foreign company comes to town, as it were, we should try to provide as close as possible to a one-stop <Col N="725" /> shop service to give the impression that we are interested in their investment, their expertise and the state-of-the-art technical know-how they can bring to the mining industry in Ireland.  At the moment there is a perception &mdash; it may be a little unfair but we must face up to the fact that it is there in the worldwide industry &mdash; that if one comes to Ireland it is the survival of the fittest in getting through the myriad of State regulations, planning and environmental regulations and revenue considerations.  There are interested, very important companies around the world, who may have prospecting licences; they are not prepared to move further but are watching to see how the industry develops here and how our regulation of the industry develops on a statutory basis.  They continue to watch rather than come and invest.  We must ask why that is so, why when we have some very interesting potential extracts, they are not actively engaged in Ireland at the moment.  I suggest that we do not make life easy. We should protect our natural reserves, our environment and the interests of the people, but they do not exclude proper development of our natural resources, our mining resources.  We must have a system whereby potential prospectors and developers can get advice and information on the statutory requirements, the total regulatory picture and on how to proceed.  If we give a prospecting licence to a company, it implies that if it finds mineral or ore of commercial value we will give it a further licence to develop that mine when our requirements are met.  I feel strongly that the delivery of a prospecting licence indicates that an area is suitable for mining provided there is a commercial ore present.  That is not the way we have operated and there have been many controversies &mdash; some not of our making &mdash; that have soured international interest in Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the current practice in the Department.  The Minister should have made it statutory by putting it in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>There are examples.  We will not open the controversial examples where that was not the case.  Witness the gold rush and where that ended.  That has not always been the case, and for understandable reasons.  We must encourage international and domestic investment and, before we deliver prospecting licences, iron out all the possible problems in an area or rule the area out.  If we are asking companies to invest millions of pounds in investigating the possibility of a commercial find, there is an obligation to allow them to develop it when they abside by the statutory regulations of that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important issue.  The one clear message I got from my visit to Toronto, where 3,000 exhibitors and mining companies from all over the world gathered for a week's annual conference, was that they are still unclear about the regulatory climate here.  That may be because our PR in terms of what we have available is not as it should be.  It may also be because we have not honed the system to make it user friendly.  Making the regulatory system user friendly does not make it easier for a company to desecrate our environment in any way.  We will have strict environmental requirements. However, companies should know the rules of the game so that we can make them abide by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today's Bill is only the tip of the iceberg. We need an in-depth debate about whether we should encourage the industry far more than we do.  I happen to think we should do that and have the right safeguards in place because this industry is underdeveloped and not providing the number of jobs or the amount of wealth it should without threatening our beauty spots and heritage areas.  We need to get our act together.  Everyone is afraid and there has been a slight backing off since the controversies and court cases over many years.  The &ldquo;feel good factor&rdquo; is not there.  The people <Col N="727" /> are distrustful of mining as an industry. There is no need for that.  We must look to what is needed to restore faith in this industry; I urge the Government to think along those lines.</P>
    <P>There cannot be development without some impact on the environment &mdash; it need not always be adverse or permanent. For too long developers of all kinds have denied responsibility for the environment, and environmentalists have denied the need for development. Philosophies which are anti-development are simply not sustainable and we cannot avoid all environmental impact because to do so would mean opting out of the industrialised world.  If we do not grow it, we must mine it.  It is as simple as that.  Everything we use in the modern technological industrial world, the world we hope to hand on to our children, a world which will provide jobs and the quality of life they should have is either grown or mined.</P>
    <P>We know where we are with what we grow.  Let this Bill be the opening of the debate about putting the &ldquo;feel good factor&rdquo; back into our mining industry. That means sustainable development for the mining and extractive industry. It means not feeling our environment is threatened by properly regulated extractive industries.  It means having a user friendly regulatory system, that will attract overseas investment to give a good return to Ireland and will encourage sustainable development.  Let us open the debate today and treat mining and the extractive industry as a positive one which has much to contribute to our community.  We have been afraid to do that but it is time we started.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's contribution, particularly her off-the-cuff comments.  The policy review report, which will be issued shortly, will be read with interest within this House but, more particularly, outside this House.  I agree it is time for a public debate on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to Toronto in Canada which has a long established <Col N="728" /> mining industry.  I sincerely hope the work of the review group takes on board the procedural and phasing processes built into Canadian legislation. The extreme precautionary approach taken in Canadian legislation encourages mining but on a phased basis from application stage to production.</P>
    <P>The mining controversies in west Mayo, which perhaps took the &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; factor out of mining, may have encouraged people to take a more cautious approach to an industry which can cause untold damage.  People who practice caution are not necessarily anti-mining.</P>
    <P>I have no difficulty with the principle of the Bill.  If there is a lacuna in the law it is only right that it should be remedied with this straightforward legislation rather than waiting on the report of the review group which, I hope will be comprehensive and will contain many recommendations to be debated both in this House and by the industry. If we were to wait for legislation to come before the House in respect of any changes which will arise from it, we might have to wait a considerable period.</P>
    <P>Any delay, I would have thought, would be on the question of section 5 and the application fees being charged for mining facilities as against prospecting application fees.  That critical matter should have been discussed in detail by the policy review group.  I am not aware of the membership of the committee but I presume it includes people involved in the industry.  I presume their views on the costing of proposals etc. are being expressed.  They are now being prejudiced by a statutory provision but it is not a fatal flaw in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Exploration and prospecting for minerals has a chequered history in Ireland.  For years we were told there were no minerals but extensive prospecting has proved Ireland has an increasingly rich geological inheritance. In the 1980s and 1990s, however, parallel with increased and extensive prospecting and exploration, two issues fortuitously arose.  First, there is greater <Col N="729" /> public awareness of the necessity to protect our environment and to build renewable and sustainable developments based on local resources. There is substantial public education and awareness of the absolute necessity to protect what we have rather than risk part or all of our natural inheritance for the elaborate promises and expectations conveyed by mining executives when they move into a locality.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether much prospecting has taken place in the Minister's constituency &mdash; some of my colleagues were formally charged with the development of policy in their constituencies &mdash; but when mining executives come into a town in my area they make all types of elaborate promises.  Local people are not aware of their rights or entitlements.  Their thinking is clouded by the fact that our legislation gives absolute rights to mining companies who have either an exploration or a prospecting licence which allows them to do whatever they want.  That is not to say that both cannot go hand in hand but I will develop that point later.</P>
    <P>Second, a substantial legislative and administrative framework was implemented in the 1980s and 1990s to protect our citizens in planning terms. Our courts have also exercised their powers of interpretation in considering the rights of citizens and where rights are infringed, having regard to the fundamental rights in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that people have been empowered through educational and legislative developments and legal and judicial interpretation to ensure that their personal and property rights are developed.  This will ensure that their quality of life, livelihoods and environment are not unduly impinged upon and it is recognition that the Legislature has a responsibility to encourage and support developments which can create job opportunities and add to our national wealth.</P>
    <P>On a weekly basis we read and see on <Col N="730" /> our television screens and in our newspapers news about environmental disasters which occur in developed and undeveloped countries.  The United States, Canada, Australia and South Africa &mdash; countries which have a corpus of legislative and environmental protection &mdash; have suffered gross pollution, disasters and many minor incidents which have permanently scarred their environments. Those countries also have their success stories in mining exploration and we are fortunate to be behind them in terms of the development of our mining industry because we can learn from their mistakes and build on their successes.</P>
    <P>Our mining policy must never be underpinned by the philosophy of jobs for jobs sake, despite high unemployment levels in rural areas.  It must never be a case of short term gain as against long term loss and environmental degradation. The State has the right and authority to maximise its natural resources and to ensure that Government policy encourages this.  It must ensure also that those from a pro-mining culture who maximise their positions &mdash; be they mining and exploration companies or their shareholders, either local or foreign, and the property owners on whose land valuable minerals are found &mdash; are not entitled to trample on the rights of a local community and ignore its genuine concerns.</P>
    <P>Our legislation allows for objections, appeal hearings and judicial review procedures through our courts, but where genuinely based objections are raised, the appetite to follow through on them is often measured in terms of the high legal and consultancy fees, which can amount to hundreds of thousands of pounds, that small rural community groups must pay.</P>
    <P>Rural communities, many with sparse populations, are ill equipped to fight the might of well resourced mining companies because, invariably, the forum in which to express their genuine concerns is statutorily based and frequented by <Col N="731" /> lawyers, barristers and specialist engineers whose charges are great for one day's representation.</P>
    <P>In my professional role as a solicitor I have employed barristers whose fees for one day's attendance at an oral Bord Pleanála appeal hearing are £10,000 per day.  That puts the beef tribunal and other fees into context.  This is not uncommon and is the norm for a small group of specialists who are usually retained in major planning and environmental disputes.  What small group can afford to ensure its right are fully protected? People are entitled to explore fully and use the legislative framework to which we constantly refer to get the maximum protection.</P>
    <P>In west Mayo we will never accept anything other than the maximum protection of our fragile environment to which we look for its potential to create real jobs which are so necessary in our tourism, health care and the newly expanding mariculture and aquaculture industries.  We are ever mindful of the irreparable long term damage that can be caused to the foundation stone of the west's economy, namely agriculture, by polluted water courses and streams and wind blow from poorly maintained slag and spoil heaps of worked minerals.</P>
    <P>There have been consistent and prolonged campaigns of opposition to certain mining ventures in my constituency. These campaigns were fought purely out of concern to protect what we already enjoy and depend upon for our livelihood and not to put it at measurable or immeasurable risk.  Those involved in these campaigns want to be able to sleep at night knowing that what they are doing is ensuring they will pass on their inheritance of a beautiful landscape and a quality of life to the next generation rather than have the next generation settled in an area which tourists and environmentalists visit only to see what they got wrong.</P>
    <P>I am coming from a position of not being opposed to mining <i>per se.</i> However, where recoverable resources <Col N="732" /> are identified the highest possible standards should be maintained at all stages of the project's examination and on no account should the prospects of a few hundred jobs for a period of five, ten or 20 years cloud and convolute the thinking and rationale of our public administration and those charged with responsibility for formulating mining policy or the examination of the various stages of a mining application from prospecting, planning and construction to final exploration and transport of the product from the region to downstream further development.  One's views are fashioned from life's experiences. Among the first prospecting licences of recent times, which eventually caused a widespread public outcry, was that which involved one of our national monuments, the Reek, better known as Croagh Patrick, a place of national and international pilgrimage.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with slight adjustments to the procedural aspects of granting mining licences and clearing up any possible lacunae in our legislative framework.  When a company is interested in searching for minerals in an area it applies to the Department of Energy for a prospecting licence, completing an application form stating the area in which the licence is sought, a description of the proposed project, expenditure estimates and the relevant qualifications of the explorers.</P>
    <P>The reference in section 5 to charging fees needs clarification.  It refers to certain situations where fees can be charged to cover handling costs.  The explanatory memorandum refers to it in more detail.  Do the four situations referred to in section 5 (1) cover the payment of fees for the consideration of an application for an exploration licence?  I understand that until recently the application fee for a prospecting licence was only £50.  What fee is charged at present to lodge a prospecting licence application?  We have heard of fees of £200,000 at maximum but usually it is in the region of £2,000 to £3,000.  What is the fee to cover the <Col N="733" /> officials time in examining an application for a prospecting licence?</P>
    <P>Recommendations are prepared by the exploration section of the Geological Survey of Ireland and the mineral division of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and are then transmitted to the Minister for final decision.  I am sure that in almost all instances, at the preliminary stage, the Minister of the day does not vary the recommendations that come to him on this initial application.  Looking at the names of townlands on an Ordnance Survey sheet on a desk is no substitute for climbing up the well worn pilgrim way of Croagh Patrick.  How anyone could have recommended the granting of a prospecting licence for such an area is incomprehensible.  Without saying anything further about the way that particular application was adjudicated on by the Geological Survey of Ireland and the minerals division of the Department, the then Minister, Deputy Molloy, made the correct decision to revoke the licence granted, but not before the people of the area became much more aware of their rights and the controls imposed by legislation on development, even if it is only at the prospecting stage.  Up to then many people believed that all activity carried out during prospecting was not subject to planning control and was exempt from it.</P>
    <P>We now know that planning permission is required for roadways or pathways necessarily made for the purpose of carrying out prospecting.  The overgrowth of bog and heather which was removed has never to this day been properly reinstated on Croagh Patrick and is a reminder to all concerned of the folly of believing that reinstatement techniques are successful all over the world.  Whenever the Minister is in West Mayo &mdash; he was there in June last &mdash; he should look at the scarring on the side of the Reek where reinstatement was carried out more than two years ago.</P>
    <P>A prospecting licence cannot issue until a notice of intention to grant a prospecting licence is advertised.  Under <Col N="734" /> section 2, is publication of the public notice to be in a newspaper circulated in the locality?  Should this not apply also to publication in a local newspaper or, better still, both?  The added expense of making it a statutory requirement to publish notices in both a national and local newspaper circulating in the locality is minimal considering the purpose in the first instance of making it a requirement to publish.  The wording of the usual public notice states that the application can be inspected for a period of 21 days, usually at a Garda station, but the notice does not state specifically that the public has a facility to make objections nor does it state that there is a 21 day limit for objecting.  If I am correct, this position should be rectified and the general public should be left in no doubt as to its entitlement to lodge objections and observations or inquiries.  The public may make recommendations rather than simple objections. I know that objections and inquiries are carefully considered and may result in attaching additional conditions to the licence to be issued, but most importantly many objections have the value of alerting the Minister to public concern, which creates the climate for the Department to move more cautiously.</P>
    <P>What is the departmental practice in seeking from the licence applicant cash security or an insurance bond?  I am led to believe it is departmental practice to seek only £1,000 cash or insurance bond at the prospecting stage, presumably to cover all claims against any activities carried out by the licensee in the performance of his activities.  This is a derisory sum of money if the legal position is that the general public who may be affected by such activity has the right to sue the Minister in the event of the company being non-existent.</P>
    <P>As in the case of Croagh Patrick, the water supplies to downstream farms were polluted with diesel on several occasions.  What if the pollution was so gross as to last for several weeks and affect a guesthouse in the summer months?  A householder would have to <Col N="735" /> try to sue an exploration company, whose very existence and longevity is dependent on exploration success.  The company could be long gone, liquidated or otherwise and have ceased business before the court's proceedings are determined.  What if somebody who is out hunting, walking or generally exploring the wilderness falls into a trench and injures himself?  Why is the Minister seeking a bond if there are no circumstances in which he could be sued by the general public?  It is important that this point is considered.  I appreciate that at the planning stage there is a requirement for bonds to protect roads.</P>
    <P>Damage can occur to an environment at the prospecting stage.  Is the Minister satisfied that the sum of £1,000 is sufficient? Has the public the right of recourse to claim where the exploration companies can come and go?  We have seen hundreds disappear into thin air. Exploration is a high risk business.  Most of the laws concerned with mineral development in Ireland were drafted with the aim of simplifying the working of minerals and of ascertaining the ownership of minerals rights, in the interests of economic expansion and attracting foreign industry.  Hence, the rights of landowners and affected communities, the active protection of the environment and the criteria for assessing the suitability of mining in sensitive regions have received little legislative attention.  The following suggestions represent only a cross-section of the numerous changes required to meet the problems of modern mining.  The Minerals Development Act, 1940 should be amended to specifically set out the rights of landowners as regards access, compensation not only for drilling operations but also for trenching, road building and vehicular disturbances.  The public interest should be redefined to include the community's opinion of the development with a strict process for the assessment of that opinion as well as the Minister's opinion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="736" /> Prospecting activity should be recognised as involving two stages.  The first, consisting of superficial surveillance and minor rock sampling, can arguably be considered to have little or no impact on a licence area.  The second, involving major earth disturbance and building of access roads, must necessarily be defined as having a significant environmental impact.  As such the planning Acts should be amended to include all aspects of second stage prospecting.  In particular, areas defined as being of special amenity or containing scenic views worthy of preservation or which have archaeological, scientific or religious significance should be more precisely protected from any disruptive activity such as trenching, drilling, road building or virtually any phase of mining without planning permission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this important Bill in view of the huge interest by national and international mining companies in exploring the country's mineral content.  I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, on her foresight in attending the international conference in Toronto recently.  It indicated to her that the time was right to home in on the vast opportunity that exists for the development of our mining industry, which will be a valuable asset to our economy.</P>
      <P>The Bill is designed to fill gaps in the Mineral Development Acts, 1940 to 1979 by expressly providing for successive renewals of mineral prospecting licences some of which have been in operation since the 1940 Act was passed.  It gives the opportunity to increase penalties in the 1940 Act for such offences as unlawful mining, obstruction of authorised officers, etc, so as to deter would be offenders and protect income from State royalties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand 486 mineral prospecting licences are in force of which 300 are due for renewal in 1995 and the remainder in 1996.  I am pleased that the exploration and mining division of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications will pay particular <Col N="737" /> attention to performance to date by the licensee, including the submission of required works, reports and compliance with the other conditions of the licence. We cannot allow mining companies to sit on a licence when they receive it. When the Department contemplates the renewal of licences it is important they bear that in mind.  I would advise the Minister to insert into the Bill a clause whereby applicants for mining prospecting licences will be required to give a commitment that they will undertake a specific programme of exploration in the area concerned before renewal of their licence is agreed.  I would not like to see clever prospecting companies take advantge of the fact that proper legislation was not enacted and put a stake holder on properties which could turn out to be a great national asset. They should not be allowed to sit on them and debar other mining interests who may have a policy of developing their prospecting areas within a specified time and give valuable employment. Employment is the name of the game and we must legislate to that effect.  If we do not we will be exploited by international mining moguls who might sit upon what could turn out to be a major financial asset for us.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a precautionary measure. Sections 2 to 4 are designed to give specific statutory cover for long standing practices.  I understand the pressure the Minister is under to introduce the necessary legislation before the report of the national minerals policy review group is published which, I understand, will be in about a month's time.  The Minister is right to introduce this legislation. It will be of paramount importance to the mining industry.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to safeguard the renewal of thousands of mineral prospecting licences effected in good faith by successive Ministers over the years since the 1940 Act came into force.  I am pleased that section 5 copperfastens the long standing practice to require applicants for State mining leases and licences to pay an appropriate <Col N="738" /> fee to cover the Minister's costs in considering the applications.  I understand that, in the case of a major complex mining project, external consultancy advice could cost anything up to £200,000, a sum which the Minister should be entitled to recover from the applicants whether successful or not. We cannot expect our citizens to finance international mining moguls who may come to this country and exploit loopholes in the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced rigid guidelines for good environmental practice in mineral exploration.  Safeguarding our environment should be an integral component of all exploration programmes. The Department's laws and regulations for the protection of the environment should be rigidly applied.  While environmental aspects must be adhered to, we cannot go overboard with environmental regulations to the detriment of our valuable mining industry.</P>
    <P>The regional environment should be maintained and safeguarded, but we should not be too quick to act on the comments of objectors who may not have a thorough knowledge of a project and may impede the progress of companies exploring the possibility of developing our viable mining industry in any region. Environmentalists have a right to object but their objections must be logical.  I would hate a position to develop as a result of the enactment of legislation whereby organisations or individuals who represent environmental organisations would have the power to prohibit the establishment of an industry which could be of vital importance to the hinterland of a job-starved community.</P>
    <P>I am pleased that under the legislation holders of prospecting licences must take responsibility for ensuring that all their contractors, sub-contractors and employees are fully informed of the guidelines and legislative requirements in this area.  I am pleased also that there will be close liaison with relevant landowners and the regulating authorities. Waste disposal and management during exploration work are important aspects of good environmental practice.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> I am pleased to note that any change to vegetation, land surface or landowners' property that may occur as a result of exploration activities will be minimised and corrected without undue delay.  I would not like the legislation to permit mining activity which would result in huge scars on a mountainside.  Valuable minerals may not be discovered.  If a proper geological survey is carried out, I am sure such disastrous consequences could be avoided.  The lack of knowledge of the minerals of our country is a sad reflection on the performance of past Governments.  Who knows what minerals are in my constituency of Cork South-West?  There may be vast quantities of copper, gold, lead, zinc or ore in the mountain ranges from Mizen Head to Malin Head in Donegal?  Past Governments were negligent in not carrying out a geological survey many years ago.  I hope it is not too late to carry out one.  The Minister should ensure that a proper geological survey of the country is carried out to ascertain the mineral content of our mountain ranges and territory.</P>
    <P>It is of paramount importance that agreement should be obtained from landowners before entering their lands to carry out geological mapping, surveying, trenching or drilling.  That is vital and must be included in the Bill with no strings attached.  I am pleased to note that exploration companies will accept responsibility for the actions of their contractors, sub-contractors and all persons employed by them in connection with works except for actions carried out expressly at the request of the owner or occupier of the land.  I am pleased the Minister is taking steps to minimise the noise problem that may arise when drilling in close proximity to residential areas.  Steps must be taken to reduce noise levels to an acceptable level of activity and should not be permitted through the night.  Residents should be able to sleep at night without being troubled by the continuous pounding of boring machines and so on adjacent to their premises.  A provision <Col N="740" /> should be inserted in the Bill to ensure that will not happen and I hope the Minister in his wisdom will include one. Mining activities should be confined to certain hours of the day and should not be allowed proceed through the night. All residents are entitled to be treated in a similar fashion in that regard.</P>
    <P>The safety of animals grazing on pastures adjacent to drilling sites must be taken into consideration.  Strict safety laws must be adhered to on drilling sites.  There is an onus on the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, who has responsibility for the National Licensing Authority, to ensure that all mining development proposals are thoroughly and expertly examined before permission is granted to proceed with them.  It is vital for the Minister to ensure that valuable national mineral resources are effectively and efficiently developed and State revenues assured. There is an obligation on all Ministers to protect the environment.  Before permitting a development of a national mineral resource, the Minister must be satisfied that such development will cause minimal harm to the local environment. I am pleased that the report of the National Minerals Policy Review Group will be available to the Minister next month.  I hope the Government will act immediately on the publication of that report and implement any suitable recommendations proposed by that group.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the outlook and prospects for the mineral industry is apparently bright worldwide. The mineral sector is beginning to recover as economies emerge from the recession.  Tara Mines zinc-lead operations at Navan, the fifth largest in the world, employs 750 people and, according to estimates could continue to operate for another 20 years.  A mining licence was granted in respect of the proposed Galmoy zinc-lead mine in County Kilkenny on 3 February for a period of 21 years to Arcon Mines Limited by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  I understand that development will employ up <Col N="741" /> to 350 people in the construction phase and, when fully operational, 200 people full-time.</P>
    <P>We have enormous potential for the discovery of additional significant ore bodies, as exemplified by the Galmoy and Lisheen finds in counties Kilkenny and Tipperary.  The time is ripe for us to utilise all those valuable assets.  Prosperity and employment are the name of the game.  Any steps the Minister can take to foster and promote our minerals exploration drive is of enormous importance not only to this but future generations.</P>
    <P>We must remember that, at the turn of the last century, huge deposits of copper and ore were mined and exported from this country by English mining companies.  The Minister should consider undertaking a major minerals exploration survey of the country to ascertain the nature and volume of such minerals which could yield untold wealth for our economy in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support everything Deputy Sheehan said and compliment him on his well-researched contribution on a subject in which he has a great interest.  I should like to compliment the Minister and the Government on the introduction of this Bill despite the moaning of the Opposition that it is being rushed through the House.  We must remember that many matters were left undone by the previous Government. Its attitude was not to touch anything, not to run into trouble for fear the party might lose votes, and take the soft option.  That is not the policy of this Government, which faces up to and deals with the issue confronting it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall objective of this Bill is to tidy up the legislative provisions on mining, to tighten up loose ends.  We have been scratching the surface in regard to the nation's hidden wealth.  We do not know the extent of that wealth.  No detailed survey of those resources has been undertaken.  We have a general idea of the extent of our mineral wealth and some people have been lucky and <Col N="742" /> are now rich.  We cannot afford to continue to conduct our business in that fashion, our resources must be surveyed and properly mined.  When a licence is applied for we must ensure it is granted to a company that is serious about its business.  Some companies have held licences for years and have not carried out any explorations, they leave undisturbed the mineral wealth they believe to be underground.</P>
    <P>I am aware also of a very important gypsum industry in Kingscourt in County Cavan, which is extremely successful and makes a huge contribution to the construction industry.  It provides much needed employment in that area. There are deposits of gypsum in other areas capable of being recovered.  As I travel to this House through County Meath I pass the Navan mines where there are 24-hour shifts and many people in meaningful employment recovering the very rich deposits of lead and zinc being mined there.</P>
    <P>There must be overall control of mining. I presume the multi-national mining companies are able to recover the costs of exploration.  The extraction of mineral deposits some ten to 20 years ago may have been unprofitable but new technology and mining equipment has rendered their extraction profitable. However, with deep boring and mining comes the problem of danger to our environment.  Such work must be carefully scrutinised and protected at all times.  There have been incidents of serious pollution, causing health hazards, by unscrupulous companies with no other concern than extracting the rich deposits for their benefit and those of their investors.</P>
    <P>The Bill is designed to fill gaps in the Minerals Development Acts of 1940 and 1979 by expressly providing for the renewal of minerals prospecting licences and to validate licences renewed to date, the practice since the enactment of the 1940 Act, but without any statutory cover.  It provides for application fees for State mining licences in order to provide a clear statutory basis for recouping <Col N="743" /> the Minister's costs, through the engagement of external consultants and others as stipulated in section 5.  That makes common sense.  Section 7 provides for offences by bodies corporate, such as companies and other organisations, in addition to offences committed by individuals.</P>
    <P>The Bill affords an opportunity to increase the penalties contained in section 6 of the 1940 Act for a variety of offences.  Penalties that would have been appropriate in the 1940s certainly would not be appropriate today; the fact that they have not been addressed to date is nothing short of a national disgrace. These relates to a variety of offences such as unlawful mining, obstruction of authorised officers protecting State royalties.</P>
    <P>Members of the Opposition and others suggested that we were running ahead of the terms of reference of the National Minerals Policy Review Group.  That is not true.  This Government will consider whatever recommendations that group makes and draws to its attention.  We should examine the potential and associated costs of a more aggressive approach to the promotion of this country as a favourable location for the exploration of minerals.  We do not know the extent of the nation's hidden wealth although it is believed that there is a vast amount of minerals for extraction. We must know precisely what exists and go about its exploration in a proper, planned manner.  The possibility of royalties to the State would be extensive, as would the possibilities of extensive job creation.  Any Government that goes about its business in that manner must be supported and complimented.</P>
    <P>I would also advocate considering all that has been said about protecting landowners' rights, a reversion to the Occupiers Liability Bill, 1995 discussed here some weeks ago.  Nobody has the right to assume, simply because they have obtained a licence to explore for minerals in a certain area, they can walk onto any private property and inform the owner they intend doing this, that or <Col N="744" /> the other.  We must pay due attention to our national heritage.  It must be appreciated, understood and protected at all times.  It is not enough for such people to enter private property in a jeep, or with bulldozers to excavate here and there and bore wells to ascertain whether there is some mineral to be extracted and depart leaving a mess behind.  Those are the two sides of the coin.</P>
    <P>Needless to say environmental groups and others will parade with placards and campaign against such developments. Their point of view can be extreme but it should be taken into account and a balanced approach adopted to ensure the best possible benefit for the country. If we go about our business in that manner, having regard to the examples I have given of Kingscourt in my county and Navan, further minerals extraction will result in the creation of worthwhile jobs.  Somebody coined the phrase, which I think is true, that if we do not grow it, we have to mine it.  While this is principally an agricultural country it is recognised that we have vast deposits of minerals.  Both industries can work closely together without interfering with each other, further develop the riches of this nation and provide employment for our people.  Many of our young people who emigrate to Australia, New Zealand and Canada do this type of work. If such work was available they would return with experience gained from working in mines and on other such activities.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on bringing this legislation forward and I hope it will be successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister on introducing the Bill.  I was amused at the statements made during the course of this debate by Deputy Molloy who criticised the extent of the legislative programme brought before the House by this Government.  This does not do justice to the importance of this legislation and the mining industry.  The Bill is specifically designed to fill the serious <Col N="745" /> gaps in the various minerals development Acts from 1940 to 1979 by providing for the renewal and successive renewal of mineral prospecting licences by giving the Minister the statutory authority in respect of application fees for State mining leases and licences and the recoupment of associated costs incurred by the Department in respect of consultancy reports etc.  It also reviews the penalties to deter would-be offenders in respect of unlawful mining and to protect State's royalties income.</P>
      <P>The necessity for this legislation came about through the recent upturn in mining prospecting and the success of that prospecting in respect of two companies, namely, Arcon and Ivernia.  It has become necessary to safeguard renewals and successive renewals of hundreds of mineral prospecting licences affected over the years and to make statutory provision for further renewals which would be considered by the Minister in respect of each prospecting licence.</P>
      <P>It is clear from the necessity to introduce this legislation that some doubts have been cast, in legal circles, about the statutory authority of the Department to protect minerals, both State owned and privately owned, and on the need to make legislative provision for further renewals of those prospecting licences.  It is a measure of the Government's commitment to mineral development, particularly in view of the proposals advanced recently by Arcon and Ivernia, that the legislation has been introduced with such speed by the Government and in advance of other recommendations which are likely to form part of the national minerals policy review group, whose report is expected in the next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sections 2 to 4 deal with prospecting licences.  Section 5 deals with the requirement of applicants for State mining leases and licences to pay the appropriate fee to cover the Minister's costs when he considers those applications.  I take this opportunity to ask the Government, and particularly the Minister for the Environment &mdash; perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, who is <Col N="746" /> present would convey this view &mdash; to review the planning fees associated with mineral development and other large scale developments for planning permission. The costs which have to be borne by local authorities associated with assessing these planning applications are prohibitive.  As a member of Kilkenny County Council I am well aware of the time and resources deployed by that local authority to deal effectively and efficiently with the Arcon Mines Limited planning application for mining development at Galmoy, County Kilkenny, in recent years.</P>
    <P>The maximum planning fee that could be charged for this application was £10,000.  It is obvious that this fee is unrelated to the size of the project. Accordingly it is necessary for the Department of the Environment to introduce a sliding scale of planning fee to allow local authorities recoup more of the costs incurred in dealing with the complexities of such an application. Kilkenny County Council employed external consultants to advise the council on the planning application in respect of Arcon Mines Limited.  A contribution was made by the company to the local authority in respect of this assessment. Were it not for that contribution by the company and the forthright way it dealt with the planning application with the local authority, the financial position of that local authority would be very serious in respect of other services which have to be provided.</P>
    <P>Local authority officials deal mainly with routine planning applications in respect of industrial, commercial and residential development but rarely have to deploy the necessary expertise to deal with a mining development application. I am pleased to note the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, will pay particular attention to actual performance to date by the licensee in respect of the renewal or otherwise of a prospecting licence.  There is considerable evidence that many licences issued over the years lay dormant and many licensees have not entered into any commitment to <Col N="747" /> undertake a specific programme of exploration in the areas in question.</P>
    <P>If the State is interested in developing a major mining industry it is necessary to increase the resources in respect of site investigation and monitoring of exploration activity by licensees to ensure licensees are proactive under the terms of those licences.</P>
    <P>As a member of a local authority, I have been particularly interested in the development of a lead and zinc mine at Galmoy, County Kilkenny, by Arcon Mines Limited.  It is the first Irish owned company that has set out to establish a mining industry and exploit mineral resources in the State for more than 20 years.  I congratulate that company on its commitment to the project at Galmoy and to developing that mine as soon as possible.  On many occasions throughout the planning process I asked questions which must be asked by a responsible member of a local authority in respect of this project.  There is no doubt that the planning process has been utilised to the full by the concerned residents of the Galmoy areas to ensure that good environmental practice in mineral exploration is implemented.  This is a statutory right of the people and one they are entitled to exercise on behalf of themselves and their community.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Minister will take cognisance of the fact that Arcon Mines Limited has effectively been utilised by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications as the principal reason for reviewing all mineral development Acts and statutory provisions in recent times.  I am sure their experiences during recent years in the planning process and in the courts will form the basis of many recommendations in the report of the national minerals policy review group.  The manager of Kilkenny County Council, Mr. Donnelly, who is a member of that group, has first hand knowledge and experience of the difficulties in the planning process encountered and the lack of expertise available to local authorities. <Col N="748" /> That expertise must be brought in from outside to deal effectively with important and complex applications.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noel Treacy ensured it would be remiss of me if I did not mention the controversy that arose in October 1994 concerning certain documentation altered in the course of the planning process. I made an allegation at the time that alteration of documentation had taken place.  Subsequently this was vindicated not only by the planning authorities but by the consultants examining the application on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. I do not propose to go into the details surrounding that political controversy apart from saying that the action I took during my short term as Minister of State at the Department of Finance was in sharp contrast to that taken by the former Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications when it was patently clear that rules had been broken and the requirements of the Constitution not met.</P>

      <P>It would be unworthy of the Deputy to try to rewrite the history of that controversy.  I supported the efforts by Deputy Treacy as Minister of State at the Department in bringing together all the mining interests under the umbrella of the National Minerals Policy Review Group.  The recommendations to be put forward by that expert group will put the mining industry on the fast track in the future.  I compliment Deputy Treacy on his efforts in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will accept those comments in the context of my credibility on these issues in recent months.</P>
      <P>During the duration of that controversy I supported the efforts made by Arcon Mines Limited to put in place, particularly through An Bord Pleanála, the necessary measures to ensure a safe mine for the workers and a safe environment for the people living in the Galmoy area.  I compliment the management and staff of Arcon and, in particular, the chairman and chief executive, Brendan Gilmore, on their strenuous efforts to deal with the concerns of local people in a very fair, courteous and evenhanded way.  I am entirely satisfied that good environmental practice in mineral exploration will be part and parcel of the mining development at Galmoy.  It is noteworthy that in recent times Arcon appointed an environmental information officer from the local area to deal with queries about environmental protection during the construction and development of the mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The guidelines for good environmental practice in mineral exploration drawn up by the Department contain many general principles and there may be a need to implement a more strict regime to supplement all relevant Government laws and regulations on the protection of the environment.  The review group may put forward recommendations in this regard.  If the State cannot allay the concerns of local people about the supervision of the work, drilling, excavation, ground water and the testing of areas of scientific and historical interest, the mining industry will earn an undesirable reputation, as happened 20-30 years ago when it earned a bad reputation in local communities because of its failure to rehabilitate sites, inattention to detail and total disregard for the environment. I am glad the mining industry no longer has this reputation and that fly-by-night <Col N="750" /> developers will not be able to undertake inappropriate mining developments which made headlines to raise the fears of local groups and communities and as a weapon to prevent mining development.</P>
    <P>Given the increasing importance of environmental protection in the context of business development, I ask the Minister to consider the role of the Environmental Protection Agency in this area and to ensure that it has the expertise to see that the guidelines drawn up by his Department are implemented by mining companies.  Will he give details of the agency charged with the responsibility of monitoring the planning conditions imposed by either the local authority or An Bord Pleanála?  As local authorities do not have sufficient expertise to deal with the complexities of a mining application, does the Minister intend to give the Environmental Protection Agency a more pro-active role in fulfilling its monitoring obligations?  I compliment the Minister on ensuring that the appropriate bonding arrangements are put in place for the development at Galmoy so that the company will not leave a hole in the ground without appropriate rehabilitation of the site when the mine has been exhausted.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not deal only with lead and zinc mining.  Ormond Brick Limited in Castlecomer in my constituency depends on the mining of shale for coal and fire clay which is used in the manufacture of bricks for the building industry. The brick manufactured by this company has been used in Grafton Street and other high profile areas throughout the country.  That company has particular concerns about sections 12 and 20 of the Minerals Development Act, 1979, in terms of the compensation paid to people who have an interest in the development before the vesting date.  I ask the Minister to ensure that the Bill covers any legal difficulties which might arise for companies like Ormond Brick Limited which provide much needed employment in their areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="751" /> The prospects for the mining industry have never been better and it is beginning to recover worldwide as economies come out of the recession.  Some years ago I visited Tara Mines in Navan, the fifth largest zinc-lead operation in the world.  This mine, employing approximately 750 people, will probably continue in operation for another 20 years. I was very impressed by this operation which is a headline for environmentally friendly mining development on the outskirts of a major town.  I compliment the management and staff of that operation for achieving the highest possible standards.</P>
    <P>High grade zinc deposits have been found at Galmoy and Lisheen in County Tipperary.  Work will shortly commence at the mine in Galmoy and planning queries have been sent to North Tipperary County Council in respect of the project at Lisheen.  These projects have the potential to employ a significant number of people over the next 15-20 years.  I believe there are other significant deposits to be found and it is only disbelief which has led to the low level of exploration.  The Minister said there has been an increase in the number of prospecting licences from 460 a year and a half ago to 486 today, indicating a renewed interest in the mining industry.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.  It will remove any doubts about the provisions of the Minerals Acts in the context of the licence granted to Arcon and the legality of the project at Galmoy. The review group is expected to report within the next month and some of its recommendations will probably require further legislation.  We look forward to prosperous economic and social development in the areas in which mining development is carried out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. B. Fitzgerald Mr. B. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House on this important Bill which at least allows us to discuss the implications of mining. It will provide a solid legislative basis for our mining industry.  Exploration requires considerable investment by <Col N="752" /> corporate bodies who may never receive dividend from it.  For that reason it must be encouraged.  The Bill deals with areas not included in the mineral development Acts, 1940 to 1979, such as the renewal and successive renewals of mineral prospecting licences, application fees for State mining leases and licences and offences by corporate bodies, such as companies and other organisations.  It is important that we address this issue so that the various bodies that may be affected by such developments know the exact position if they offend.</P>
      <P>The Bill also increases the penalties for a variety of offences, for example, obstruction of authorised officers and unlawful mining provided for in the 1940 Act.  There has not been a great deal of mining carried out here in recent years, hence the lack of pressure to introduce changes.  However, there has been major developments in County Meath in the past 20 years &mdash; I hope the Galmoy proposal proceeds as planned.</P>
      <P>Many mining licences were effected by various Ministers since 1940 and it is necessary to safeguard the renewal and successive renewals of those licences. The Bill gives statutory cover to the long-standing practice of requiring applicants for State mining licences to pay an appropriate fee to cover the Minister's costs in considering applications. I am sure most Members would agree that considerable expenditure is necessary for the professional expertise required to examine mining industry proposals.  In the case of a major complex mine project, external consultancy services could cost up to £200,000.  It is important that the State is protected from having to cover such costs.  The Bill also provides an opportunity to strengthen the law to protect both State and privately owned minerals by increasing the original penalties for offences provided for in the 1940 Act and applying them to offences by corporate bodies.  Under existing law only individuals are covered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a major obligation to protect our environment while making full use of our natural assets.  Mineral ores <Col N="753" /> should be fully developed to create jobs, to contribute to gross domestic product and to take on a pivotal role in industrial growth.  The Bill obliges the Minister to protect the environment and he must be satisfied that any proposed development would cause as little harm as possible to the environment.  A full environmental impact statement will have to be prepared and submitted to the Department in this regard.</P>
    <P>The safeguards already in place for mining licences include penalties if the site is not explored after a licence is granted.  Since November 1994 the term applicable to prospecting licences includes a condition that licences are obliged to undertake an approved programme for work within each of the three two-year periods and to submit a work report for each period.  This will ensure that licences are not used to freeze prospective sites.  If developers are granted licences to explore hundreds or perhaps thousands of acres but fail to do so, others who may wish to explore such lands are prevented from doing so.  What the Minister is attempting to do will at least ensure that developers are obliged to carry out the works within a specific period.</P>
    <P>Our minerals sector has suffered because of Europe's recession but recent recovery provides an opportunity to increase employment.  I hope the minerals policy review group publishes its report shortly because we may lose out if we have to wait too long.  The terms of reference of the review group state that the group must identify the contribution of the mineral industry both directly and indirectly to job creation and the national economy generally. People will be surprised to note the contribution in certain areas.  The group must evaluate the potential for downstream industrial development using Irish mine production and review the international competitiveness of mining in Ireland.  Developments to date will prove that we are one of the most advanced countries in that regard, particularly in the context of Tara Mines Limited.  The review group must also <Col N="754" /> consider the extent, if any, to which the fiscal incentives for the mineral industry are necessary and desirable and, if so, the form they should take and the expected benefits therefrom.  Investment that involves the creation of additional jobs should be considered with an open mind.  We have not always reaped benefits from areas to which large amounts of funding were allocated but funding would be worthwhile in this labour intensive area.</P>
    <P>The review group must also examine the potential and associated costs of a more aggressive approach to the promotion of Ireland as a favourable location for mineral exploration and the agency or agencies best suited to undertake such promotion.  For that reason it is important the Minister strikes a fair balance between the protection of the environment and encouraging people to explore.  While being conscious of environmental protection, we must not prohibit people from exploring by introducing legislation which would make it almost impossible.  The group must also review the provisions of the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1979 with particular reference to the extent to which the financial terms of State mining facilities should be standardised and published and the State's role under the 1979 Act.</P>
    <P>Protection of the environment must be top of the agenda in all of this. Because of the difficulties which have arisen in recent years, local authorities have had to employ experts in environmental protection.  Our ground water, in particular, must be protected because that is the only source of drinking water available in rural Ireland.  In many places it has been proved how easily ground water sources can be polluted, for example, by sumps and septic tanks. When the rock is cracked and a substance seeps into the ground water source it is practically impossible to stop it.  For that reason the local authority must be the monitoring body with total responsibility for exploration.  It is not right that the company doing the exploration should be the watchdog over itself. <Col N="755" /> The local authority must be informed in advance about what a company intends to do and when.  That can be done by notifying the planning officer and arranging meetings on site to ensure that what is being done is in the interests of everybody but also in the interests of protecting the environment. Nor can the Fisheries Board be ignored because of its interest in the tourism industry, if we allow our lakes and rivers to be affected it would do great damage to the industry.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works has a major role to play because it identifies the archaeological sites throughout the country.  In most areas one would not know that mining had taken place in a particular area.  For that reason, therefore, the Office of Public Works must be informed in advance because there would not be much point in a company identifying a mine and then being prevented from mining at a later stage for archaeological or other reasons. There must be a co-ordinated approach to the question of exploration.  Somebody must do the co-ordinating and the local authority, which has knowledge of an area, the expertise and staff, should play a central role in protecting the environment in the context of mining exploration.</P>
    <P>Tara Mines is a great success and of importance to the economy of County Meath, particularly Navan.  At present there are in excess of 770 people working at Tara Mines in a variety of well paid jobs, including professional and administrative people, craftspeople, miners and general officers.  Few industries can provide direct employment for in excess of 770 people &mdash; the number was greater some years back.  Also, there is potential for additional mining in that area when the question of Bula has been sorted out.  An example has been set of how to run a business and remain a friendly and acceptable employer or industry in an area of fairly dense population.  During the development of Tara Mines there was good cooperation between the local authority <Col N="756" /> and the company, which continues to this day.</P>
    <P>Regular formal meetings take place to monitor the environmental impact of all aspects of the mining company's activities &mdash; there are serious difficulties in regard to tailing pounds, etc.  When Kilkenny County Council had difficulties in regard to the proposed Galmoy mine, they visited Tara Mines and consulted for many hours with the local authority there about the objections of concerned people in the Galmoy area. They went away after a number of days convinced that mining could be the friendly industry it is in Navan.  The landscaping process initiated when the company was given permission to mine is now fully mature to the extent that it is not possible to know where exactly Tara Mines is located.  It cannot be seen from the town, although it is on the edge of the town.  Such an approach could be adopted in other areas.  Therefore, mining should be encouraged, not discouraged, because of the legitimate concerns of environmentalists.  The experience in Navan is an example which stands up. The terms, conditions and monitoring that apply there should apply also to new companies setting up.  People who are prepared to invest money in the exploration of our resources should be encouraged, if they are fortunate and strike ore, but conditions should be laid down and the fears of those who are concerned should be dispelled.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It will go some way towards dispelling the fears that exist.  It will also encourage people to invest and explore.  We have a long way to go to overcome our long term unemployment problem and there is no greater way than by encouraging industries like mining which is highly labour intensive, directly employs people, and the spin-off from which is practically immeasurable to the local economy. The reason I am looking forward to the presentation of the report of the review group is that it will encourage Ministers to invest in mining development to create well paid jobs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to make a contribution to the debate on this legislation.  I listened to the interesting contributions of the Minister and Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, who outlined the reason this legislation is required and, accordingly, I have no difficulty in supporting it.  It should receive the full support of the House.</P>
      <P>In the not too distant future we will have an opportunity to debate the report of the national minerals policy review group.  Apart from one opportunity last October when the previous Minister, Deputy Cowen, and Deputy Hogan clashed on this issue, we have not had many opportunities in recent years to have a wide-ranging debate on the mining industry or mining policy.  In this regard the highlights were the clashes in the 1970s between the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr. Keating, and the Fianna Fáil spokesperson, Deputy O'Malley.  Perhaps the issues of the day were ideological in the sense that they concerned the environmental aspects but only rarely have we been given an opportunity to discuss the potential of the industry to create many jobs.  I hope this debate is the forerunner of a more wide-ranging debate and, if necessary, legislation on the industry and on the need to provide whatever resources are necessary to ensure that it creates a substantial number of jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of mining development, we have the classic case of environmental concerns versus job creation.  On one side of the argument we have those who argue that, regardless of what regulations are put in place, the industry will always pose a threat to the environment and that there is a need to severely curtail its activities and on the other those who claim that the industry is under-developed and has the potential to create tens of thousands of jobs.  As in most classic confrontations the answer lies somewhere in between. In allowing the industry to develop we must put legislation in place to ensure <Col N="758" /> that it will not pose a threat to the environment. We should take the opportunity to discuss these issues when we debate the report of the national minerals policy review group in the fullness of time.  Although the industry is currently well regulated it may be necessary to introduce further requirements as it develops.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that this legislation is required as a matter of urgency to fill the gaps in the law which were not filled by the many Minerals Development Acts enacted in recent years.  I am, therefore, confident that my colleagues will support it.  The fact that it is being taken in advance of the presentation of the national minerals policy review group report which may be made available within the next month highlights the urgency attaching to it.</P>
    <P>Section 5 provides for the payment of fees in respect of the work done by the Department in processing applications for licences.  This work involves carrying out appropriate investigations to ensure that the Department reaches the correct conclusion.  It is proper that the legislation should provide for the payment of fees to meet the cost involved.  It is important to include this section to ensure there are no loopholes.</P>
    <P>Currently there are 486 prospecting licences in force, of which 300 will fall due for renewal during 1995.  The fee for a first licence is £600; £700 for a second; £1,200 for a third and £2,000 for a fourth or subsequent licence.  There are significant sums which are paid into the coffers of the State.  This highlights the need to ensure that this section is included in the Bill so that any sums legally due are paid.</P>
    <P>Sections 2 to 4 provide for the renewal or successive renewal of prospecting licences issued under previous Minerals Development Acts and, consequently, are very important. Section 7 deals with offences by companies and other organisations.</P>
    <P>In particular, we must deal with the possibility of unlawful mining and obstructing authorised officers in their <Col N="759" /> duties in addition to protecting the royalities income due to the State as a result of mining activities throughout the county.  Those sections are an important component of the legislation from the point of view of tightening up any rules or regulations which may be watertight. They will also ensure that loopholes are not created.</P>
    <P>In the coming months we will discuss the outcome of the national minerals policy review group and legislation may be required at that stage.  A more dynamic approach may have to be taken to the entire industry.  It will be interesting to hear the outcome of the deliberations of the policy group on issues such as the contribution the industry makes but, more importantly, the contribution it can make to job creation and the economy.  It will examine the potential for further industrial development to see how competitive our industry can be internationally and the incentives that should be put in place by the Government to ensure the industry can expand in a regulated but dynamic way.</P>
    <P>The review will be awaited with interest by people in this House and outside it because, with approximately 300,000 people unemployed, and at a time when Members are discussing a report on long term unemployment, our mining industry has an excellent history of employment.  Tara Mines, with 750 employees, is a good example.  That type of industry, where possible, must be developed and expanded in a way which will satisfy everybody from an environmental and industrial point of view.</P>
    <P>I look forward to a more comprehensive debate on this issue in the near future and I am confident that the Minister and the Minister of State, who are both very committed to the development of the industry, will bring forward whatever legislation is necessary in the not too distant future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is designed to be a technical, precautionary measure and, in that sense, it is most timely.  When I was at school we read in our school books that Ireland had very few minerals and that we had to import almost everything from England, including coal.  At that time, before Bord na Móna was established, we did not believe we had any fuel resources here.  We did not believe there was any commercial use for turf, which we have in abundance, or that it could be used to assist out industrial development in a positive way.</P>
      <P>When we set up this State 73 years ago we had a simple concept of ourselves alone, keeping out foreign goods and building up home industries behind tariff walls.  At that time the world trade markets were already tied up by companies in large countries such as the United States, Japan, Germany and Britain.  It was difficult for Ireland, therefore, to break into that market because, as we did not have an industrial tradition, we were not in a position to challenge them.</P>
      <P>Despite the best efforts of Fianna Fáil, when it came to power in 1932, to give true expression to that simple philosophy of &ldquo;sinn féin&rdquo;, after a period of seven years the number of people at work declined dramatically.  During that period there was a dramatic change in employment in the home industries but, following that, our economy was stagnant. In 1957, 90,000 people left the country &mdash; I was one of them &mdash; because there was no movement in the economy. The Fianna Fáil Government performed a miracle at that time; it abandoned its philosophy of &ldquo;sinn féin&rdquo; and allowed in the multinationals, with their free trade, thereby holding on to power. That was remarkable for a party that had come to power as the party of small farmers and businessmen.  The Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement, entry to the European Community and many other developments followed from that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation must be seen in that context.  It is an attempt on our part to <Col N="761" /> legislate for a sophisticated, international mining industry.  Many multinational firms are involved in mining with a great deal of experience and understanding in dealing with Governments. In particular, they are experienced at exploiting the mineral wealth of countries and it is important, therefore, that we have proper legislation to deal with that.  The Government, as custodians of our interests and our mineral wealth, must frame legislation to control the mining industry.  This Bill strengthens the law in that respect and provides greater protection in a number of areas including our economy, through State royalties, and, above all, our environment. I also support the concept of increased penalties for unlawful mining.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with a variety of issues which I do not have time to deal with now but I will comment on them at some future time.  They include drilling, excavations, water services, the pumping of ground water, geophysical surveys, restricted areas and other aspects of the mining industry.  They are all important measures because we are dealing with a modern sophisticated business.  The multinational companies involved in the industry are experienced and have track records throughout the world, some good, others not so good. We have all heard horror stories about countries exploited by mining companies. They pulled the wealth out of the soil and then left the country leaving the economy in a dreadful state.  There are many examples of this in African countries which were left in a poorer state following the departure of these mining countries.</P>
    <P>It is important to get the balance right in this legislation.  We must lay down certain restrictions which will ensure that companies operating in this field are closely monitored on a variety of fronts, including safety.  Deputy Bradford referred to the employment potential in the industry; that must be protected and expanded.  There is not any reason that cannot be done.  It is important to ensure, also, that we have the best safety regulations because we <Col N="762" /> often read about accidents in mines resulting in many fatalities.  We have had fatalities here also but, thankfully, they were few.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an improvement on previous legislation because it will close loopholes and give greater protection in many areas.  It is good mining practice to have an agreed code of conduct in place so that companies who come here to excavate know in advance what is expected of them.  Also, the general public must become more aware through debate on this matter.  Above all we must learn from the exploitation in other countries.  We must ensure a balance between the protection of the interests of the people and our natural resources because once the resources are exhausted nothing is left but a hole in the ground.  We have plenty of holes in the ground where the exploitation of our resources did not generate a sufficient return.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a step forward and I hope we will have other legislation in this regard in the months ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill establishes a code of conduct for mining and it regulates licences and fees.  Penalties and fees applicable for years are not compatible with present day costs.  For example a serious proposal for a mine could involve the Minister in consultancy expenses of anything up to £200,000.  It is appropriate that the developer should pay those fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While attention has focused on mining activity I welcome the renewed interest in oil exploration off the Porcupine Bank.  I remember the newspaper banner headlines in 1977 &mdash;&ldquo;Oil strike off the Irish Coast&rdquo; and I thought from the point of view of the national economy that all our birthdays had come together.  Subsequent seismic exploration and the renewed interest in the North Sea shifted the focus from the Porcupine Bank.  At that time many of the base exploration companies that operated in the Porcupine Bank operated from Foynes and the materials, <Col N="763" /> staffing and the labour provided sustainable jobs in the area.  I welcome the renewned interest of the big players such as Chevron, Santa Fé, Marathon and others who have applied for exploration licences in the Porcupine Bank and two of which are serious about drilling wells in the short term in the next two years.  They have the proper seismic data and studies that are available and obviously are aware of the economics of exploration in the Porcupine Bank.  It will benefit the economy if the exploration companies succeed.</P>
    <P>Whereas we are increasing the application fees and penalties relating to mineral exploration we have decided to decrease the cost of exploration licences in order to encourage companies to carry out exploration in the Porcupine Bank.</P>
    <P>I have a great interest in the exploitation of our mineral resources.  I echo what Deputy Kemmy said and I remember reading in the history books that there were no mining activities here.  We read about the lead quarries in Allihies in Cork but in the past 20 years our attitude to the environment has changed for the better.  The buzzword at the conference in Berlin is &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo; and concern for the environment has led to the mushrooming of a specific political party, the Greens.</P>
    <P>Naturally younger people are very concerned about the environment and it requires a balancing act to get the mining activity right.  Undoubtedly we made mistakes in the past which left dreadful scars but with the proper planning structure and environmental impact statements and the type of infrastructure that is available, it is possible to leave the landscape without an ugly blot and camouflage it by planting trees when mining ceases.  A great deal of planning will go into that.</P>
    <P>The successful port at Foynes, County Limerick handles 1.3 million tonnes a year.  Companies such as Mogul and Macabar who mined in Tipperary <Col N="764" /> exported out of Foynes port which benefited from the dues paid.  The systems that operate in Foynes can dovetail with the requirements of the mining companies. I very much welcome the working of the Lisheen mine in County Tipperary and I hope it becomes sustainable. I imagine the ore could be transported by rail to Foynes and could then be exported.  I hope we will end up exporting lead and zinc from Lisheen mines through Foynes Harbour in the next few years.</P>
    <P>Recent media attention has focused on Galmoy, County Kilkenny.  When people are concerned about mining or quarries, inevitably there are objections many of which are laudable.  A corollary in local authorities is where three-quarters of the councillors agreed to a section 4 motion to overrule a planning permission.  Many local authorities behave responsibly and the councillors on Limerick County Council for instance have a proud record of not having a policy to use section 4 motions in the interest of all councillors.  In some counties three-quarters of the councillors combine almost on a <i>quid pro quo</i> basis to overrule what in many cases is a very sensible planning decision by the planning authorities in order to protect scenic areas from being spoiled by intrusive developments.  Quite often the people who avail of section 4 motions become members of An Táisce and object to similar developments in their own areas.  One sees that particularly in some of our scenic counties.  Councillors have to be responsible and stand up to pressure.  The planning authority tries to make sensible rational decisions in the interest of the area and have to be sincere in deciding whether to grant planning permission.  When it comes to mining and quarrying, it does not matter whether for slate, gravel or whatever, there will inevitably be objections. While objections may be valid they often frighten off potential developers.</P>
    <P>Areas where mining has been established such as Galmoy usually have suffered from emigration and a shortage of jobs.  Bodies such as An Taisce and <Col N="765" /> other environmental groups are fine but we must strike a balance between environmental protection, job creation and planning.  There is a protection mechanism built into the planning process in that environmental assessments and impact studies must be carried out.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that it is important to protect our watercourses and water. There was much drama this morning about water charges and the good logical decisions made about cutting off water supplies.  Water is a mineral.  We are aware of group water schemes in our counties and we know the risk of agricultural pollution ruining the water supply.  That has happened and people could not use the water supply.  It is important that mining developers are aware of what is required under the Bill. It is important to control and monitor mineral exploration but we must also make it attractive for the developer to proceed.</P>
    <P>We were criticised this morning for not introducing legislation, yet the monopoly of wisdom on this Bill appears to reside on this side of the House since there were few contributions from Opposition Members.  If the Opposition want to criticise us, that is fine but why does it not contribute to legislation when it is introduced?  The Opposition should be constructive, not destructive. The episode this morning was a destructive saga.</P>
    <P>I am a member of a local authority and make no apology for saying that I am in favour of water charges.  There is no such thing as a free lunch.  Local authorities are bedevilled by lack of funding.  In 1977 political parties competed with each other in giving cheap sale offers.  Fine Gael offered a percentage reduction in rates and Fianna Fáil offered to abolish them but no mechanism was put in place to ensure local authorities were properly funded.  The sins of the past have led to our current problems.  We debate the amount of funding required to maintain county roads and so on but the structural fabric of our roads is falling apart.  Stupid political decisions were taken in the past. <Col N="766" /> Fianna Fáil abolished rates and motorcycle road tax.  It was returned to power with a huge majority but still managed to mess things up.  Let us hope auction type politics are a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>This legislation is positive, meaningful, constructive and a blueprint for the future.  The Minister is progressive in his thinking.  There are other delicate areas which I am sure he will deal with in a constructive, diplomatic and sensitive manner.  It is time we stopped living in Disneyland and returned to reality.  The sooner we, as politicians, cop ourselves on the better.  We have a mature sophisticated electorate who can analyse what we are doing and see through our shallow activities.  They are not fools and know they do not get a free lunch.</P>
    <P>Statements were made in the House on long term unemployment and it is interesting to note that it is endemic in areas which are likely to attract mining activities.  The Minister for the Marine is to meet a deputation from the Foynes Harbour Board and we will discuss exporting facilities and our experience of mining activities with him.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and hope that oil exploration activities lead to ports like Foynes having a successful role in supplying materials and equipment.  I look forward to the day when we will have a good oil strike off the Porcupine Basin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if I should be alarmed or encouraged by Deputy Finucane promoting Foynes and the Porcupine Basin.  The only active oil and gas exploration is off the Cork coast.  I hope that is where it will remain and that the Minister for the Marine will ensure that every available incentive is given to retaining jobs there rather than creating something that would take from the Cork area.  Deputy Finucane and I may have a difference of opinion on location but I am sure we are agreed on what needs to be done.</P>
      <P>When I was going to school I was told the only natural resource Ireland had was a fine collection of harbours for which we should be eternally grateful.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 3, 19 and 21 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="768" /> I recently received a report from Dr. Miriam Moore on post-traumatic stress disorder among United Nations veterans. It is a substantial report and it is at present being studied in the Department. The report by Dr. Moore is based on a very small limited group.  It is invalid to extrapolate from such a sample. The suggestion in some media reports that up to 50 per cent of United Nations veterans may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder is invalid and alarmist and an incredible exaggeration.  The Army Medical Corps carried out the field work of a study to identify post-traumatic stress disorder.  The results of this study are now undergoing computer analysis but preliminary impressions are that the incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder in this group is no higher than that found elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces have in place a comprehensive system for dealing with the prevention and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder.  Before being selected for overseas service, and indeed for certain duties at home, personnel undergo a thorough medical examination and a similar medical examination is carried out on their return from such duties.  In addition, each contingent going to Lebanon includes two medical officers plus a number of other medical personnel.</P>
    <P>Prior to departure for overseas service all personnel are trained to the highest level.  This training includes battle inoculation exercise which simulate stressful situations which they may experience while on overseas service.</P>
    <P>Under the guidance of their educational psychologist the Defence Forces have introduced an educational programme dealing with: (a) stress awareness, appreciation and coping skills during basic cadet and recruit training; and (b) stress identification and management skills during leadership courses.</P>
    <P>A critical incident stress debriefing programme has also been introduced which encourages members of the Permanent Defence Forces to deal with the <Col N="769" /> emotional aspects of an incident involving major stress immediately after the event.  A critical incident stress debriefing team is assigned to each battalion going overseas.</P>
    <P>Where an individual is felt to be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder he is examined by, and placed under the care of, a civilian consultant psychiatrist.  If the services of other specialists are recommended these are also arranged without delay.  The psychiatrist determines the treatment that the individual requires and this is provided through the medical corps or, if considered necessary, in a civilian hospital.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>Notwithstanding the training and medical examination members of the Defence Forces must undergo before they go overseas, will the Minister not accept that it is probably likely that post-traumatic stress disorder is more prevalent among veterans because of the nature of their work, the risks they encounter in foreign territories where there may be land-mines and other stresses and they would probably not be comparable to circumstances obtaining for groups at home?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>Common sense would dictate that what the Deputy said is true.  I have just returned from the Lebanon and even though matters are relatively stable at present, stress situations exist among battlions in smaller outposts. Fortunately, in recent times people have not lost their lives or suffered serious injuries, but there has been a number of stressful incidents.  I note the Deputy's point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dr. Miriam Moore's report included a number of exclusions in the preface which were completely ignored in some media comment.  The preface states that no conclusions can be drawn from the study regarding the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder among the veteran population as a whole.  The persons interviewed had to be volunteers and, <Col N="770" /> therefore were not a representative sample of Irish UN peace-keeping.  A number of other clarifying points are also included in the preface.  Dr. Moore was particularly upset by an alarmist heading that appeared in one newspaper which gave the impression that 50 per cent of Irish UN veterans were suffering form this type of disorder. That view is unfair to them and is not factual.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  I do not want to be alarmist about this matter, but I wish to ensure that the Minister and the Department will be sympathetic in dealing with various circumstances that come to light when the final report is properly reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a sensitive subject. It is alarming that representative bodies of the Defence Forces considered it necessary to obtain advice from a professional body outside the Defence Forces. Does the Minister consider that those representative bodies were dissatisfied with reports they received from members of the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Army has completed a report on this matter and it is currently analysing aspects of it.  I gave Dr. Moore a copy of it when she presented her report to me.  I cannot speak for the representative bodies and the fact that they considered it prudent to conduct a study in their own right.  I would not like to comment on the matter other than to say that Dr. Moore's work is appreciated.  I am anxious to point out that it has been taken out of context, something about which she is concerned.  Her report and the report being undertaken by the Defence Forces will increase our store of knowledge and, accordingly, I welcome them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, overseas duties are voluntary. People volunteer for such service and must undergo a rigorous medical examination and an intensive training programme to determine their suitability. The present system is established to prevent the matter to which the Deputy referred and I do not believe significiant numbers of people suffering from that type of stress are being deliberately sent oversea.

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Eamon Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall policy objective for inland fisheries is to ensure that this valuable natural resource is conserved, managed and developed in its own right and to support sustainable economic activity and job creation based on that resource.</P>
      <P>There is at present a number of strategic challenges to be faced arising not least from pressures on salmonid and coarse fish stocks and the freshwater environment.  There are also major development opportunities presented by significantly increased EU funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Maintaining the strong rate of growth in angling tourism achieved in recent <Col N="772" /> years will require further investment in the facilities available to anglers throughout the country.  Under the tourism angling measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism, £19 million will be spent over the next five years on the regeneration of the inland fisheries resource.  The programme is designed to ensure that coarse, game and sea angling is upgraded to the best international standards.  We estimate that the strategy can generate long term sustainable employment of the order of 1,000 extra new jobs.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the significant cross-Border dimension to inland fisheries where there is already very considerable co-operation between relevant Departments and fisheries organisations. That co-operation is set to continue and deepen with particular emphasis on realising the angling tourism potential in Border fisheries, notably the Foyle and Erne catchments. Planned investment under the second EU INTERREG programme will significantly assist that development.</P>
    <P>In addition to ensuring that EU expenditure is efficiently applied and maximising cross-Border initiatives, current strategic initiatives for inland fisheries include: implementing a wide agenda for change in the Foyle Fisheries Commission; a comprehensive review of salmon management policy; continuing the programme to restore sea trout stocks; and addressing organisational and structural issues in the fisheries boards.</P>
    <P>The latter initiative is encompassed in the major review of the organisational and management structure of the overall fisheries service we announced at the beginning of the month.</P>
    <P>I can also advise Deputies that this year's funding to the fisheries boards by the Exchequer will amount to nearly £9 million, in addition to the EU funding being made available.</P>

      <P>While it is probably true we underestimated the job potential of inland fisheries, angling tourism <Col N="773" /> and tourism generally, when will the Minister be in a position to indicate which projects will be funded under the £19 million allocated from European Union funds for inland fisheries development?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>There are at present 104 applications being considered for the 1995 portion of the allocation, which will amount to £2.85 million, by an evaluation monitoring committee comprised of representatives of the Central Fisheries Board, the Department of the Marine and Bord Fáilte.  We expect their consideration will be completed within the next month to six weeks, when we will be in a position to make appropriate announcements about the relevant funding.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious that such decision be taken as soon as possible since quite a number of people in the angling world have been ploughing a lone furrow.  This is the first opportunity within the terms of the <i>National Development Plan 1994-99</i> and European Union funding for significant funds to be made available and, if they are to be of any help whatever this year, a decision must be taken very soon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that it is necessary to make decisions as quickly as possible to allow the sponsors of the projects to proceed with their planned work.  Of those projects, slightly in excess of 60 are public sector ones, coming from the various fisheries boards and another 40 are private projects.  I too am anxious that the evaluation work on those projects should be completed as quickly as possible.  However, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate there is a large number of applications and it is important that they be properly and fully considered, ensuring that the best value is obtained for the considerable amount for money which will be spent on them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a positive agenda for change is being implemented which will broaden and deepen the mandate and effectiveness of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.</P>
      <P>This new agenda has been set on foot of a consultancy review of the commission sponsored by my Department and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland.  The recommendations of the review, which was completed last year, have been endorsed by both Governments and we are taking them forward jointly with our Northern Ireland colleagues.  The legislative and adminstrative changes are being put in place to effect significant strengthening of the commission's statutory responsibilities, funding, organisation and management.</P>
      <P>The main recommendations resulting from the review are (1) expansion of the commission's remit to enable it to undertake development of the salmon and inland fisheries resource and to promote, develop and improve angling facilities; (2) extension of its powers to include the licensing of aquaculture as well as the regulation of sea fisheries in Lough Foyle; (3) creation of a new post of chief executive, new management systems and organisational restructuring; (4) additional financial resources including capital investment in surveillance equipment and a new headquarters, and (5) restructuring of the representative Advisory Council to enable it to play a much more meaningful role in Commission affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="775" /> The Advisory Council to the Foyle Fisheries Commission was established under the Foyle Fisheries Acts to represent local fisheries interests on both sides of the Border.  It is now proposed that the long-standing advisory role of the council be restructured and broadened to enable it to play an active strategic role in commission business.  This will be achieved by establishing an executive committee of the council which will work closely with the commissioners in setting and supervising operational strategies.  The consultants advised, and we have accepted, that the actual structure of the commission itself should not be changed to encompass local representation.</P>
    <P>Together with the legislative and administrative changes now being put in place, additional funding is being made available to the Commission this year by both Departments, representing an increase of 60 per cent on the 1994 contribution to the costs of running the commission.  EU funding of almost £120,000 has also been approved towards the cost of capital equipment for fisheries surveillance in the Foyle system.</P>
    <P>I look forward to creating a new dynamic within the Foyle Fisheries Commission which will serve to unlock its full potential for development both in its own role and in its contribution to development in the north west.  The new mandate and planned investment is designed to deliver on that agenda for change.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that the Foyle Fisheries Commission has a long record of cross-Border co-operation and that it is essential to ensure it can continue such co-operation. While the Minister's reply contained a number of positive elements &mdash; such as additional funding and widening its remit &mdash; I am very disappointed that the opportunity presented to ensure true local democracy, in terms of the commission's activities, is not being availed of.  The <Col N="776" /> Minister of State will be aware of the concern being expressed, particularly in the Innishowen peninsula, by traditional shellfish fishermen.  Does he agree, in terms of North-South co-operation and the success of the new initiatives, it is vital that there be true local democracy, and the only way to achieve that is by positive local representation on that commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure Deputy Michael Smith will acknowledge that the Foyle Fisheries Commission has worked extremely well over the past 40 or more years and the necessity to widen its remit and improve its administrative and legislative arrangements is generally recognised.  The question of local representation was considered in the review undertaken but it was recommended there should not be local representation on the commission itself and that the role of the advisory council, established for the purpose of providing local representation, should be strengthened. The way in which it is proposed to strengthen that role is to establish an executive committee of the council which would regularly meet the commission and have a particular role in relation to strategic issues on development and monitoring fisheries in that area.  As the Deputy will be aware, this is a cross-Border body.  The present position has been agreed by both Governments and we are in the process of preparing the necessary legislation. Legislation will be necessary in both jurisdictions and we are endeavouring to introduce it in both jurisdictions at the same time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>While this is a good initiative I ask the Minister once again to give the fullest possible consideration to extending the membership of the commission.  I know this would be breaking away from the report.  It is important to bring together all the different interests in that area.  There is no reasonable argument against allowing the people who fished traditionally in that area to have a say in <Col N="777" /> how their lives and activities will be determined for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an area where agreement is required on the part of both Governments.  A position has been agreed and the local interests are represented on the advisory council which, it is accepted, must be strengthened. Our intention is to make provision for strenghthening that role through the establishment of an executive committee in the legislation we plan to introduce. I suggest the Deputy awaits the publication of that legislation.  I have no doubt we will have ample opportunity in the House to debate the issue raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to labour the point but, basically, the Minister of State is telling me what is contained in the legislation.  The reason I put down the question is that I feared a vital opportunity would be lost to consolidate and develop fishing resources in that area.  It is difficult to understand why local interests are left out of the equation. It is not good enough to be involved in an advisory body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with a cross-Border body which has worked very effectively and it is proposed to widen its remit.

      <P>As the House will be <Col N="778" /> aware, a fundamental review of the Defence Forces has been undertaken by the Efficiency Audit Group.  This wide-ranging examination has identified many issues which need to be addressed so that the effectiveness and efficiency of the Defence Forces can be enhanced. One of these areas which will need early attention is the increasing age profile of military personnel.  The Government has yet to consider the recommendations of the Efficiency Audit Group, including the way in which these may impact on personnel policy.  At this stage, however, I wish to emphasise that there will be no compulsory redundancies and any retirements which may take place will be on a voluntary basis.

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the term &ldquo;Dad's Army&rdquo; is unfair to the men who have given many years' service to the Army, not just at home but in the UN?  The reason this term is used is that there has not been a redundancy package worthy of their service. For example, members of the Garda Síochána would receive, perhaps, six times the amount of redundancy a person with 30 years' service in the Army would receive.

This year there are a total of 35 apprenticeships available in the Defence Forces &mdash; 15 in the Army and 20 in the Air Corps.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is not correct in assuming that I am running down the training.  It is not reasonable to suggest that the Defence Forces should take on the role of providing a training scheme beyond their needs.  This school was set up to meet the needs of the Defence Forces and the relevant training courses are being provided.  I agree that the standard of training is very high.  In the past the apprentices tended to take up employment outside the Defence Forces but, as the numbers clearly indicate, this is happening to a <Col N="781" /> much lesser extent today.  I cannot do very much about this.  We have provided apprenticeship training to meet the requirements of the Defence Forces and will continue to do so.  If the existing apprentices wish to take up employment in the Defence Forces that is their right. Until a larger number of trainees decide to take up employment in the private sector it will be difficult to significantly increase the numbers.

      <P>The Minister is aware of the controversy which arose last October and November about the use of the Government jet.  During the long hours I spent in Douglas and other areas of Cork I saw literature which, I think, was headed &ldquo;If they could see us now&rdquo;, and with a picture of a Rolls Royce and a Minister's badge on the number plate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is evident from the figures in the reply that the Government has used the jet considerably less than the previous Government during an equivalent period.  However, I do not read too much into this.  I used the Government jet before Christmas to attend a meeting of Fisheries Ministers in Brussels and I found it a very convenient way of travelling late at night.  I do not want to rehash events which took place when I was not a Member of the House.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it will be a valuable facility to the Government next year when we hold the EU Presidency.  The Deputy's question is fair.  While we are conscious of what we said in the past about the use of the Government jet it is being used sparingly, and it would be false economy to leave it on the ground permanently.</P>

      <P>While I agree with the Minister, will he convey his views about the value of the Government jet to the Fine Gael organisation in Cork? He stated that the direct cost of 33 flights in the Government jet is estimated at £79,060.  What would be the cost if it were calculated in the formula used by the Minister of State.  Deputy Rabbitte, before the fall of the last Government when he calculated it at approximately £4,500 per hour?  At what stage is the review of ministerial transport and how will that affect the use of the Government jet?</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself with the new British Navy safety measures put in place to stop the sinking of Irish trawlers by submarines in the Irish Sea.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6629/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney) Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last 15 years there have been three reported incidents involving submarines and Irish registered fishing vessels.  Only one of these incidents involved a sinking.  The last reported incident was in 1989.  Nevertheless, this matter is of concern and I am keeping it under close review.</P>
      <P>I welcome the measures put in place by the British Navy to prevent damage to fishing vessels or their gear.  These measures consist of a service known as &ldquo;SUBFACTS&rdquo; and a code of practice for submarine commanders.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;SUBFACTS&rdquo; notifies fishing vessels and other vessels of planned or known submarine activity in a specified delineated area.  &ldquo;SUBFACTS&rdquo; covers two main sea areas, the West Coast of Scotland and South West Coast of England. British Telecommunications Coast Radio Stations broadcast &ldquo;SUBFACTS&rdquo; twice daily on MF and VHF.  The Maine Rescue Co-ordination Centre at Clyde broadcasts &ldquo;SUBFACTS&rdquo; six times daily.  A &ldquo;Fisherman's HOTLINE&rdquo; telephone service is also provided.</P>
      <P>The code of practice for submarine commanders states that submarines travelling on the surface must act strictly in accordance with the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Submarines travelling at periscope depth must keep at least 1,500 yards away from a fishing vessel unless the fishing vessel's permission to go closer has been obtained.  Submarines travelling either on the surface or at periscope <Col N="795" /> depth must maintain a constant radio listening watch on VHF Channel 16, the emergency channel.</P>
    <P>Under international law, submarines travelling on the surface have the right of innocent passage through territorial waters.  They may pass freely through international waters whether on the surface or submerged.</P>
    <P>While there have been no reported incidents involving submarines and Irish registered fishing boats since 1989, I am concerned that there may be a gap in the submarine reporting measures in the Irish Sea.  While the level of submarine activity in the Irish Sea may be less than that on the West Coast of Scotland or the South West Coast of England, there may be scope for improving the reporting measures.  This is something which I intend to pursue with the British authorities.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the procedures of the British Navy but they do not address the root problem of submarines travelling under the surface. There have been many accidents both in Ireland and Scotland, including a loss of life in Scotland.  Will the Minister accept that the British Navy shows no regard for the safety of Irish fishermen and the Irish fleet generally?  Would he also accept that now that the Cold War is over and there are major political changes in the Eastern Bloc there is no need for secrecy or for underwater movement between Kilmore Quay and the North Channel, and that submarines should travel over the water if they need to travel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is probably an exaggeration to say, in the way the Deputy did, that the British Navy does not care. There have been no incidents in the past six years.  There is a gap in the reporting measures in that the Irish Sea does not have the same radio &ldquo;SUBFACTS&rdquo; system that exists on the Scottish coast and on the south-west coast of England, and I intend to take that up with the British Navy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="796" /> As to whether submarines should, as a matter of course, travel only on the surface, that is a different issue.  I presume some of their training requires them to operate under water &mdash; that is what a submarine does.  I intend to take up with the British Navy the possibility of extending their surveillance.  To put the Deputy's mind slightly at rest, in at least one of the incidents that occurred, the one involving the trawler that was pulled backwards, nobody was ever brought to account and there was speculation about whether it was a NATO, US or British submarine.  My understanding now is that in the aftermath of the end of the Cold War neither US nor NATO submarines other than British now operate out of British ports so the amount of submarine activity is substantially reduced anyway.</P>

      <Quest>if he has satisfied himself that the targets and developments for the fishing industry as outlined in Bord Iascaigh Mhara's policy document, Charting A New Course-A Development Strategy for the Sea Fishing Industry 1988/1991, were achieved; the relevance of that document to current conditions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1988 policy document for a development strategy for the sea fishing industry set a number of ambitious investment targets and development objectives for the fishing sector and aquaculture for the four year period 1988 to 1991.  In all the circumstances and given all the acknowledged constraints of the Common Fisheries Policy substantial progress has been made since 1988 to enhance the contribution of the fishing industry to the national economy and to local jobs and growth.</P>
      <P>Analysis of the period 1989 to 1993 shows that the fisheries sector has made a growing contribution in terms of output, employment and exports.  Seafish landings rose from 213,000 tonnes valued at £90 million in 1989 to over 254,000 tonnes valued at £98 million by 1992.  Aquaculture production has increased from some 19,000 tonnes valued at £24 million in 1989 to some 40,000 tonnes valued at £50 million currently. Seafish exports increased in value from £154 million in 1989 to over £180 million in 1992.  There has been a substantial restructuring of the Irish fishing fleet, in line with EU targets, with a total investment between 1989 and 1993 of over £23 million in the modernisation of 215 vessels.  Over the same period EU assisted investment of almost £5 million supported the construction of 13 new vessels.  Employment in the fleet, aquaculture and processing increased from just over 11,000 ten years ago to over 15,000 by 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three year investment and development targets set in 1988 were ambitious.  Not all of the projections set for that programme were realised in full due partly to funding constraints and external factors including, notably, EU fleet and quota policies.  Nonetheless a significant degree of growth has been <Col N="798" /> achieved in the intervening six years as exemplified in the statistics I have outlined to the House.  It remains the case, however, that notwithstanding that growth the fishing sector remains underdeveloped and suffers from structural weaknesses.  The objective now is to set about tackling those difficulties in order to deliver the sector's undoubted potential for further development and to build on its growing contribution to economic renewal.</P>
    <P>The Operational Programme for Fisheries 1994-99 was launched last month.  It is intended to deliver further integrated development in the fleet, aquaculture, processing fishery harbours, marine research and training. The total investment package for the period is £140 million.  The main aims of the programme are: significant increases in direct employment in fish processing and aquaculture, 2,000 new jobs; increased landings and maintenance of related jobs in the catching sector; a potential increase of up to £12 million annually in the value of aquaculture production and a potential increase of up to £20 million annually in the value of fish exports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is currently engaged in a process to regularise clam farming operations in Dungarvan Bay and is addressing the issue of ongoing unlicensed development in that context.  Only one licence application for clam farming in the area in question is being considered although a number of other applications have been received to engage in clam farming for this area <Col N="799" /> which is designated by the Office of Public Works, as a special protection area under the EU Birds Directive.</P>
      <P>The parks and wildlife service has considerable reservations about the cumulative impact which extensive aquaculture development could have on the protected bird life within the area. It is, however, prepared to facilitate a pilot project pending further investigation to establish the degree of aquaculture activity which can be accommodated without significant impact on the ecosystem.  Accordingly, the first applicant has been permitted to proceed to the public notice stage for the development and this process is under way at present.</P>
      <P>This system of public consultation, through advertisement of development proposals in the local and national press is designed to elicit and facilitate views and-or objections by interested parties. Any observations made to the Department on foot of this process, with advice from the relevant statutory bodies, will be duly assessed by the Department's aquaculture licence vetting committee which advises on licensing applications from all relevant technical and other perspectives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the expressed concerns about the possible impact of cumulative development, the Department has formally advised all other applicants that an alternative location for their developments will have to be identified.  The Department's scientific technical services are willing and ready to assist the applicants and the local growers' association to come up with suitable alternative growing sites, with the assistance of BIM.  The Department and the parks and wildlife service will also continue to co-operate and consult closely on the scope for aquaculture development within all areas of scientific interest, including SPA sites.  This is to ensure that our stringent EU obligations on nature conservation are met while at the same time encouraging and facilitating <Col N="800" /> a sustainable expansion of shellfish cultivation in the interests of jobs and growth.</P>

I can also advise that under the new EU Operational Programme for Fisheries, over £6 million will be invested in improved training programmes for the fisheries sector over the next five years.</P>

      <P>This is welcome news. This equipment will be of great benefit <Col N="801" /> to the Greencastle training centre which is unique in that it is the only one in the country which provides training courses in the use of radar in fish finding for skippers and deckhands.  The Department of the Marine has one of the lowest spending budgets &mdash; in one year it was £46 million approximately which was a ridiculous sum given that this is considered to be a maritime nation. Funding is required for projects such as this.  The Minister should impress on the Department of Finance &mdash; we will provide backing in this regard &mdash; the need to increase the Department's budget.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for his comments.  I hope he made a similar effort to convince the previous Minister for Finance to increase the budget for the Department of the Marine which is underfunded given its potential.

      <P>I had an opportunity to visit the training centre at Greencastle recently and if I continue to have such spectacular successes I will be extremely busy.  We are delighted the Minister has responded to our request.  Given its significance nationally, in the context of cross-Border co-operation, what are the Minister's views on the question of combining European Union, American and Irish funding to allow it develop as an international centre?</P>

      <P>I am anxious to visit the training centre at Greencastle and until I do I am not in a position to answer the Deputy's question.  The Programme for Government refers to the establishment of a marine source centre while the previous Government proposed to establish a maritime college.  A site was acquired for this purpose at Ringaskiddy, near the naval base.  I am extremely conscious of the role played by and the achievements of the training <Col N="802" /> centre at Greencastle.  I have asked my programme manager and the assistant secretary at the Department to visit it. They were due to travel there tomorrow but the visit has been postponed for a week or so.  The message should go out loud and clear that I have no plans to provide training courses anywhere else; if we develop new facilities this will not be at the expense of the training centre at Greencastle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">

      <P>I encourage the Minister to move in that direction.  The extent to which the problems along the Border and in the North affected economic development is not fully understood. The people in Innishowen, in particular, were adversely affected and any additional funding or upgrading of these facilities would be very welcome.  I ask the Minister to continue along that line.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the fact that in the case of our smaller ports it is difficult to acquire the resources necessary to go to Greencastle.  I spoke to BIM about that and I was told that it is organising a number of regional courses using the mobile unit and local instructors. That needs to be developed because some of the small boats cannot afford to lose a single crew member &mdash; a big boat can sometimes manage in those circumstances. Problems do exist in that regard and we must enhance the role of training in regard to fishing.  Given the part of the country the Deputy comes from, I understand what he is talking about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 95 together.</P>
      <P>This is a difficult matter.  Progress in the investigation has been very slow because the marine surveyor of the Department of the Marine, who was appointed to report on the collision, has not yet received permission from the French authorities to interview the crew of the French fishing vessel involved, the <i>Agena</i>.  He is also awaiting a response to other information which he has sought from the French authorities. As a result, the Department's investigation into the accident cannot be finalised.</P>
      <P>Because of the seriousness of the collision and the tragic loss of two fishermen, the French authorities decided to hold a judicial inquiry into the matter. The head of maritime affairs in Auray, France, was granted judicial powers to carry out the inquiry through a procedure known as a &ldquo;Rogatory Commission&rdquo;. He will assess whether or not criminal proceedings are warranted and will be reporting his findings to the French maritime court in Lorient.</P>
      <P>I am less than satisfied with the pace of these proceedings.  Strenuous efforts have been made through the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Irish Embassy in Paris to speed up the process.</P>
      <P>Since the matter was last raised, the Department has taken the further step of writing directly to the head of the judicial inquiry in France, urging him to complete his task as quickly as possible and pointing out that the continued delay was causing great distress for the families of the victims.  The marine surveyor appointed to carry out the investigation has, through a procedure similar to the Rogatory Commission, made a further formal request to the French judicial authorities seeking the information and documents which would allow him to complete his investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the accident the Department has at all times kept the bereaved relatives fully informed of progress in the investigation.  Department officials will <Col N="805" /> maintain regular contact with the families. I regret that this delay has prolonged the agony of the families.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome the Minister's sympathy for the families involved and the fact that he is unhappy with the progress on this matter, successive Ministers have offered sympathy and assurances to the Doran and Power families.  I recognise the Department has tried hard to bring this matter to a conclusion but, two-and-a-half years on, the families are still grieving and that is simply not acceptable.  Justice has not been served in this case and I ask the Minister to raise this matter personally with his counterpart in France.</P>
      <P>I have raised this issue on many occasions, the last of which was on 22 October.  The Minister informs me that since then only one letter has been written in regard to this case.  That is not good enough.  I appeal to the Minister to ask his colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, to intervene in this matter.  He should have shown more concern for these families during the past two-and-a-half years.  In view of the gross miscarriage of justice constituted by the delay in this case, I ask the Minister to request the Taoiseach also to become involved in the matter.  I accept the Minister's point that a delay of two-and-a-half years in this case has prolonged the agony for these families.  The Minister is aware that the fishing community in the country, and beyond, grieves when one of their own is hurt.</P>

In fact, it is possible that I may be meeting with him next Thursday at the Fisheries Council meeting. If he is at the meeting, and I presume he will be because France has the Presidency at the moment.  I will raise the matter with him.  To be fair to both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, this matter is locked up in the French judicial system and it is beyond the <Col N="806" /> power of politicians to unlock it.  I will do what the Deputy asks but I do not want to raise people's expectations that this will produce an instant answer because they have suffered enough.  The Deputy knows the problems of legal systems, even here.  I am informed that progress is being made, but too slowly.  The Department of Foreign Affairs is already involved in the matter and it is not correct for the Deputy to say that all that has happened in the past six months is that one letter was written.  I am informed there have been contacts through the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I will reinforce the urgency of the matter following the points raised by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should not underestimate his power, or, indeed, that of the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste, in addressing this problem.  I accept the French are not forthcoming in this issue; that is perhaps due to the suspicion locally that this incident was more than an accident.  I do not want to develop that point any further but the suspicion locally is far greater than that.  The Minister has assured me he will contact his counterpart in France and that he will ask the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to get invoved in the matter also.  If this country means anything in Europe, there must be a response from the French on this issue.</P>
      <P>Has this matter been raised by the Government with the French Ambassador here?  If so, has there been any response?  If not, in view of the extreme seriousness of the situation, is it not time for the Ambassador to be made aware of the Government's concern about the delay in processing this case? In fact, I would like to meet the French Ambassador with the Minister if no contact has yet been made.  I wish to emphasise the importance of this matter to the two grieving families.  The mother of the Doran family in County Wexford is distraught and for that reason I hope this matter comes to an end soon.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution.  The Minister indicated that this is largely a technical Bill and is necessary because of legal advice on renewing licences, the legal basis of which has to be established beyond question.  Many Deputies took the opportunity to discuss more widely the issue of mining.  If we are to realise its full potential, given that unemployment is such a huge issue, it needs a great deal more focus.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons mining has remained untouched is the very important consideration of protecting the environment.  Successful mining applications seem to be the exception rather than the rule and mining is seen almost as a no go area, a pity but understandable. There are many issues to be reconciled.  I will respond to some raised by the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, this morning arising from her recent participation at an international conference on mining in Canada.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This subject may not seem the average occupation of a Dublin north west Deputy with a background in education but in the years 1991-92 I was Opposition spokesperson on Energy when Deputy Molloy was the Minister and it <Col N="871" /> was a full ministry.  Unfortunately I did not hear all of Deputy Molloy's contribution but he seemed to concentrate on trying to make political points in questioning the need for this Bill instead of using the opportunity to tease out some of the problems he, as Minister, identified as needing a response but which were not responded to then and still have not been responded to.</P>
    <P>Mining is nobody's baby.  One project has got under way in recent years having gone through every hoop and hurdle in the process.  More mining opportunities have been discarded than have been pursued in recent years.  While accepting that we must work within the strictest environmental constraints, we must ask what can be done to progress the debate and develop the resources.  A Biblical parable would suggest that in the long run it is not defensible to sit on one's assets and return them untouched.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to present the findings of the group undertaking a fundamental review of the national minerals policy and the Mineral Development Acts to the House as quickly as possible.  It is regrettable that the Department of Energy is no longer a full ministry. While its budget then was modest, the range of the semi-State bodies it controlled, the major environmental debate on mining mineral resources, energy conservation and forestry were worthy of a great deal of attention and have enormous potential for development.  I have a copy of the Minister's 1992 Estimate speech which as usual is substantial and runs to some 14 pages, with half a page devoted to mining and minerals. I cannot imagine how little would be devoted to this subject when it is included in the broad range of responsibilities which the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications now combines albeit with a Minister of State responsible for energy.  I know how difficult it is to get access to adequate information and decision making from <Col N="872" /> that position unless those powers are delegated completely and clearly.</P>
    <P>There are two things we can consider. Mining is out of place in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and should be moved to the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  It should be viewed in terms of job creation, actively supported and marketed internationally by the IDA.  On the critical issue of the environment, international applicants for a project do not require soft laws.  They go into San Francisco and other States in the US where conditions and planning laws are infinitely tighter than here.  They want an element of certainty that if they know the rules and comply with them they will succeed.  I do not know whether by virtue of our planning laws one can ever get certainty but with the best environmental practices one should be able to rely on a reasonable guarantee of a positive outcome having invested in the highly expensive and risky business of undertaking a project for initial exploration and then developing the project.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for mining lies inappropriately with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  It should be moved to the area of job creation and enterprise.  The approach should be one of trying to develop, support and sell mining rather than intervening in projects.  Public figures, from Ministers to county councillors, have an important role to play in analysing issues rationally and exercising leadership.</P>
    <P>With the development of new technologies many of the horror stories associated with mining are a thing of the past. Abandoned mines are a minor feature of this country and the problems associated with them would not arise nowadays given the conditions which must be met at planning levels.  Our environment is precious and environmental activists are a committed and sincere group of people.  Whatever Department is responsible for mining in the future should take a lead in bringing together <Col N="873" /> environmentalists and mining interest groups to act as troubleshooters and draw up acceptable guidelines.</P>
    <P>Consideration must be given to the employment generated by the industry and its potential for the future.  While it is not a major industry, it is a significant employer offering short to mediumterm employment, as can be seen in the case of the Galmoy project.</P>
    <P>Together with conservation and energy taxation, this area has immense potential which the State should support. We should help resolve environmental issues which arise and create a climate of sustainable development.  We should not seek to bypass the environmental standards set by local authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency or the leasing conditions laid down by the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  A great deal more could be done to bring both sides together and ensure that the substantial resources which exist are developed on behalf of this and future generations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatUpton" hpid="Dr. Upton Dr. Upton">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this short, straightforward Bill which tidies up a few loose ends in our mining legislation.  I was interested to hear Deputy Flaherty speak about employment levels and the potential of the industry to create employment. Some 1,000 people are employed directly in mining and exploration. Another 1,000 people are employed in jobs which are directly linked to mining and exploration and 3,500 people are employed in its ancillary industry, quarrying. In the cement and other industries associated with quarrying there are 15,000 people employed.  The jobs are relatively well paid in that the average salary is £27,000 per employee per year. I am not sure if that is gross or net but if it is net it is not a bad level of income.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The value of the industry is £150 million a year.  It is not one of our major industries but neither should it be ignored.  If that sum were divided it would amount to £150 per household.  It is not a major sum but is significant. <Col N="874" /> One of the difficulties which has characterised the industry is its tendency to fluctuate.  It has huge peaks and troughs. It is associated with huge profits.  People think there are huge sums of money to be made if one discovers a rich vein of ore.  While many people have made large sums of money from mining others have incurred huge losses.  Mining involves an element of gambling and perhaps that is why it is so attractive to some.  Those who invest in mining must be prepared to accept enormous losses as there is a huge failure rate.  It is rather like developing products.  Only 5 per cent of products which reach the shelves are successful and it is the same with mining.  A lot of money is spent on research, exploration work and trawling through areas trying to find rich deposits.  Unless a person is extremely lucky they will go through many futile, unprofitable exercises.</P>
    <P>In the past, the industry was associated with large profits and major environmental problems.  We must face up to those problems if we are to develop our mining industry in a manner which is beneficial to society, not just in the short term.  It is possible to make large amounts of money from mining in the short term if one hits the right vein of ore and so on but such activity may cause enormous environmental damage.  It may be a quick fix solution in terms of benefiting the economy of a small area, but there can be a tremendous downside in the longer term in respect of its impact on the country's image.  As our country is perceived as having a green, wholesome, healthy and clean environment, it is highly desirable that any mining activity carried out here meets the highest standards.</P>
    <P>The outlook for the industry seems to be reasonably optimistic.  I gather it is estimated that of the order of 750 people will continue to be employed in Tara Mines for the next 20 years, a significant number by national standards. We would all be delighted to hear an announcement that the establishment of a factory in an area would result in the <Col N="875" /> creation of 750 jobs.  I would be delighted if that number of jobs were created in my constituency and I would be very pleased if I were told that the best estimates indicated they would be secure for 20 years.  Tara Mines is a valuable national resource.  Similarly, it is estimated that 500 or 600 jobs will be created in the Galmoy and Lisheen mines and that the value of their output will be £200 million to £300 million per year.</P>
    <P>The legislation is relevant as it is necessary to lay down a framework to facilitate development of and investment in the mining industry which will be carried out on a sustained and renewable basis.  The legal framework will allow the mining industry to progress and develop in the longer term which this relatively straightforward technical Bill facilitates.  I imagine a number of people who have become involved in the mining industry have done so on the basis of the assumption that significant amounts of resources and deposits could be exploited here if the necessary investment is made to identify them. One of the major potentials of our industry is that exploratory work would identify further reserves which could be exploited and subsequently developed.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with the renewal of prospecting licences and amounts and types of mining licence fees and lays down specific offences, particularly in respect of corporate organisations and companies which breach mining regulations. The Bill to some extent puts a legal framework on the present practice and that is desirable in many respects. It simply consolidates a set of circumstances and practices which worked well over the years.  If practices are satisfactory, it is important that they should be set in a legal framework and we should be confident in the knowledge that they will continue to benefit the country.</P>
    <P>The latter part of the Bill deals with fairly routine matters contained in most Bills.  It was initiated as a result of a series of deficiencies in the various Mineral Development Acts which date back to <Col N="876" /> 1940, 1979 being the most recent legislation. The Bill has been introduced before the publication of the report of the review group and I presume that is one of the reasons its scope is restricted. I imagine it would be more comprehensive if the report were available but that should not be seen as a fault or limitation in the Bill which is satisfactory as far as it goes.  Obviously, there is an urgent need to proceed with this legislation rather than await the publication of the report and draft legislation which may be more comprehensive and complex.</P>
    <P>The Bill lays down provisions for the payment of fees to cover mining licence applications.  It is important that it is flexible regarding the amount of fees charged for various applications.  In particular, the fees should be adequate to, cover the cost of processing applications. The cost of processing some mining licence applications is prohibitive. It is important that people who are prepared to make the necessary level of investment should carry the associated risk and bear the cost of processing an application.  Major controversy surrounds many mining licence applications which require the preparation of consultancy reports.  Sometimes the preparation of such reports involves a long, expensive and exhaustive process, involving large sums of money.  Sums in the order of £200,000 to £500,000 have been quoted to prepare a proper consultancy report to ascertain the potential of various mines.  Many people are concerned that costs should cover the effects of a mining development, not just on the environment, but on the whole community in terms of its economic impact/and its extent and life expectancy, which is an important consideration.</P>
    <P>The Bill strengthens the law governing the protection of privately and publicly owned mineral rights.  There is a reasonable level of prospecting activity. Approximately 500 prospecting licences are in force at present, rather more than I would have expected.  Not only are a large number of organisations &mdash; which <Col N="877" /> I would have thought dominated the industry &mdash; involved in mining but, having regard to the 500 prospecting licences in force, a large number of small organisations are also involved in prospecting, which is desirable.  I do not believe that the mining industry should be the sole prerogative of multinationals with large resources.  Each licence must be considered individually and it would be undersirable if the position were otherwise.  When a licence is due for renewal, it is important that the performance of the license and factors such as the amount of work undertaken during the period in which the licence is held and the track record of the applicant are considered.  Applications should be considered in the context of how the organisation performed when granted the licence.</P>
    <P>Many conditions associated with licences relate to the technical aspects of mining, but the main concern of the public is the environment and, in crude terms, the mess created as a result of various mining developments.  In recent years mineral prospecting practices have improved so dramatically that types of mining which would not have been considered viable in the past are now acceptable.  It is important to protect our environment against short-term significant gains combined with the undesirable long-term impact of poor mining practices.  It is essential that we take a long-term view.</P>
    <P>It is important also that there be close liaison between landowners where mining prospecting takes place and the relevant regulatory agencies, to promote a harmonious relationship with the local community.  While that is in everybody's interest, it has not always been the case although significant lessons have been learned by all concerned.  It is essential that every effort be undertaken to avoid any incidence of pollution in the course of exploration and that any damage to land and/or vegetation is kept to a minimum and rectified as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I understand the Bill provides for consultation, advertising and so on, in order that this overall process may be <Col N="878" /> implemented effectively.  It is also crucial that excavations are recorded so that a complaint against a developer can be recorded for subsequent consideration and analysis.  It is very useful to allow mining agencies, certainly large corporations, to identify problems in the course of their explorations and anticipate them when they move on to other areas, so that they can take appropriate action against their recurrence.  The fees to be charged are covered extensively in the Bill and relate to the value of the minerals anticipated to be extracted at the time of the granting of the licence.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference of the Minerals Policy Review Group are very comprehensive, covering almost all aspects of mining, particularly those with job creation potential, and fiscal initiatives necessary for the development of the industry.  Its terms of reference also include consideration of downstream industrial development, the value of this country as a centre within which mining development can take place, the environmental effects of mining and how they can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>I am pleasantly surprised to note that the review group is comprised of people from other walks of life including some personal friends of mine.  Lest anybody thinks I have been involved in the mining industry for years, I should reassure the House that I have not been.  Some of the members of that review group are very fine people who have made an excellent contribution to this country&mdash; here I think of the environmental aspects &mdash; people like Professor Frank Convery of UCD, whose work on protecting our environment has been of enormous benefit.  The review group also includes Professor Alan Matthews of Trinity College, Dublin who, as an economist, has made a major contribution as has Mr. Eugene McCague, a lawyer, who no doubt will have a valuable input generally but specifically on the legal aspects of mining, which is important as enormous amounts of money are involved in the determination of the legal contracts.  I understand that the report of the Minerals <Col N="879" /> Policy Review Group will be available in the near future and hope its recommendation will be quickly implemented.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this imporant Bill, whose main purpose is to cover certain long-standing practices for the renewal of mineral prospecting licences and to charge fees to applicants to avail of certain State mining facilities. Another objective is to update the original penalties in the Minerals Development Act, 1940 applicable to offences committed by companies and other organisations in order to deter people from engaging in illegal mining practices. I hope the Minister will render these fines relevant to the offences involved, that he will not go overboard, making it impossible for people to operate within the system.  We need only think of fines recently introduced for driving while drunk.  I hope similar mistakes will not be made in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I wondered about the relevance of the provisions of this Bill to my constituency. There came to mind mining activities at the gypsum works at Kingscourt, County Cavan, an important mine which opened some 60 years ago, worked by underground miners who had to dig into tunnels and do most of the work by hand.  Happily in recent years the deep shafts dug to reach the mineral deposits have been replaced by open-cast mining so that fewer people are employed in the excavation. Because of the ingenuity of the company concerned, many people are employed in using those deposits to make valuable products for sale at home and abroad.  In that one mining operation perhaps 230 to 300 people are directly employed, in full-time excavation, transport and the use of the final product.  Hundreds of people around Kingscourt, Magheracloone and Car-rickmacross depend on that mine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that we introduce the requisite laws to ensure that such mining activity can continue and be improved because, without the mine in that area, many more people would be <Col N="880" /> unemployed, and there would be much less economic activity in surrounding towns and farmlands.  Many small farms could not be sustained without the breadwinner or his son or daughter working in these areas.  If it takes a mine to keep people in rural areas, so be it.  I heard Deputy O'Hanlon say only a few days ago that if we allow the drift to continue, all of our population will move to the east.  Mines, farms or whatever must be exploited to the full to ensure jobs are created and people can remain in their localities.</P>
    <P>The Minister said there are 486 mineral prospecting licences nationwide of which three were granted to County Monaghan including the Gypsum licence and that Tara Mines were also thinking of prospecting in County Monaghan. We must examine what laws are necessary to ensure that other aspects of life continue in rural areas where mining usually takes place.  Under EU laws we have to meet certain standards of water control.  It is important that the quality of water for dairy farms, poultry production or mushroom production&mdash; which is flourishing in County Monaghan &mdash; is preserved.  The provisions of this Bill will ensure that underground water and lakes are preserved.  Much has been said in this House in the last few days about water charges.  What is important to many people is that they get quality water.</P>
    <P>In my county of Monaghan the pollution of lakes and rivers resulting from an intensive poultry industry must be considered.  If minerals are being sought the necessary laws must be enacted to safeguard the rights of householders, producers and others.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill 300 licences are due for renewal this year which involves a cost to the Department and to the applicants. In updating the fees and charges the Minister must ensure that the ordinary taxpayer, who is not involved in this area, does not have to bear the burden. He must also strike a balance and ensure he does not overcharge and prevent people from prospecting for minerals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="881" /> The last fines were imposed in 1940. If people break the law we must ensure fines are set at a realistic level to act as a deterrent.</P>
    <P>During the summer of 1994 I was fortunate to spend a few weeks on holidays &mdash; not a junket &mdash; in Canada where I visited the second largest zinc mine in the world.  It brought home to me the delicate balance in this area.  Mining can be extremely valuable and profitable in the short-term.  People can make or lose a fortune.  We are competing against huge industries worldwide.  It is not an industry on which we could depend as our main form of production but, it is important that we make use of it.  I visited a village in British Colombia where in the past thousands of people were employed, because of the change from deep mining to open cast mining thousands of people lost their jobs. Mechanisation in this area means that we may not necessarily get the value out of mining which some people would have thought possible years ago.</P>
    <P>We must be careful not to put all our eggs in one basket.  We in Monaghan produce a large quantity of eggs and want to ensure that continues.</P>

      <P>I regret that, due to an important previous commitment, I was unable to remain for the entire debate but my Ministers of State, Deputies Stagg and Doyle, have noted the points made.  I thank the many Deputies who contributed to this debate, particularly Deputies Treacy and Molloy for their thoughtful contributions which were based on ministerial experience and a deep knowledge of the minerals industry.  I carefully noted all the points raised.  I thank Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, for putting <Col N="882" /> Ireland's mineral prospecting and development in the context of the intense international competition for investment.  Following her recent communications with all the leaders in this area she will be conscious of international competition.</P>
      <P>In respect of the national minerals policy, we have begun an important debate and will benefit from the report of the National Minerals Policy Review Group which will be available to Deputies and the public generally next month.  I have asked that this report be finalised and presented to me at the earliest opportunity.  I am committed to developing a sound national minerals policy and legal framework to serve job creation and growth needs while ensuring proper safeguards for the environment.</P>
      <P>Regarding prospecting licences, 486 licences are in force.  My policy is to encourage prospectors to work very hard to identify all commercially viable deposits.  The actual number of licences is secondary to the real activity being undertaken by these prospectors.  I will keep procedures and work requirements under review to ensure that all worthwhile prospecting is actively encouraged.  If prospectors do not perform as they should under the requirements their licences will not be renewed.</P>
      <P>The other issue concerning a number of Deputies is the mining licence and lease applications.  It is important that, as Minister, I should be able to examine applications thoroughly and promptly. It is not a question of rubber-stamping the proposals for any development. There is too much at stake in terms of scarce national mineral resources and we all have a duty and a responsibility to protect the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much discussion on section 5.  There is no policy departure involved.  This section simply provides a statutory framework for charging an appropriate fee for examining applications for State mining leases and licences.  Mine projects vary considerably in size, in the nature of the minerals <Col N="883" /> involved and their environmental implications. Each one must be examined thoroughly by the Minister to satisfy the statutory obligation and in any case it must be in the public interest to grant a State mining licence.</P>
    <P>There is no basis for the view expressed that the standard fee will be £200,000 in all cases.  The £200,000 fee quoted in the explanatory and financial memorandum to the Bill relates specifically to the major and complex zinc lead mine project mooted for Lisheen, County Tipperary.  I have a particular interest in this project which is in my constituency.  I had preliminary discussions with the promoters, Ivernia, and will be in continuous contact with them.  I will examine this aspect of the Bill in great detail.  This project is unique and cannot be quoted as a precedent in terms of fees which may arise for smaller projects for coal or industrial minerals which give rise to less complex issues for consideration.  In other words, fees for considering applications for State mining leases and licences will continue to be set on an individual basis, having regard to the facts of each case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes asked about the fees for prospecting licences from November 1994.  These are as follows: £150 for each application plus a consideration fee; £600 for the second year; £700 for the third and fourth years; £1,200 for the fifth and sixth years; £2,000 for the seventh and eighth years and £2,000 for each subsequent two year period.  All notices of intention to grant a mineral prospecting licence are published in local rather than in the national newspapers. They do not invite objections, and these are rarely lodged.</P>
    <P>The essential provisions of the Bill were agreed by the previous Government in September 1994.  The Deputies opposite made their comments as if this was the first time they had read the Bill. The only change is the provision in section 2 which will require public advertisement of the intention to renew prospecting licences.  If there was no clear statutory provision for the renewal <Col N="884" /> of prospecting licences all such renewals could be challenged on legal grounds. We do not want this to happen and new laws are required to rectify the situation. I am effectively responding to the advice of the Attorney General, which I am obliged to take, and I am doing so in the interests of the mineral section and all those involved.  The legislation is, therefore, urgently required.  I have noted all the points raised by Deputies and on Committee Stage.  I will carefully consider any amendments which they believe will improve the Bill.</P>

      <P>Yesterday before the debate was adjourned I said that two of the greatest obstacles to overcoming the enormous problem of long-term unemployment are the lack of incentives to encourage employers to increase the number of employees and the financial disincentives to the long-term unemployed taking up work.  As long as this remains the case we will not be able to reduce the number of people on the live register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="885" /> The Government must take measures to encourage employers to take on additional employees as this is crucial to tackling the problem of unemployment.

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I have every respect for the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, but I am disappointed that none of the three Ministers at the Department of Enterprise and Employment has seen fit to come into the House to reply to this very important issue.  This is highly unprofessional.  When I was in the Department there was no such lack of professionalism.</P>
      <P>When I raised this matter on Tuesday I was told that this was a commercially sensitive matter, yet today's edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i> carries an interview with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, about Shannon Aerospace.  He ends the interview by saying that he does not wish to comment further on the matter and that it would not be proper for anyone to publicly debate it.  The Minister gave this exclusive interview to the <i>Irish Independent</i> on the basis that no one else was to refer to the matter.  When I requested the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 this morning to discuss this matter I was told that it was not in order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first person to whom the characteristics of insensitivity and lack of professionalism can be applied is the Minister who chose to discuss a commercially sensitive issue in the newspapers rather than deal with it in the House.  To add insult to injury, he went on to say that no one else should debate the matter publicly.  Even though he said in the newspaper report that he is <Col N="886" /> considering investing an extra £15 million in the company, the Minister did not accept my request to raise the matter in the House as a matter of urgency.  He has treated this House with disrespect in regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>Shannon Aerospace employs 700 people.  When I visited Shannon Aerospace during my term of office in the Department of Enterprise and Employment I was very impressed by the quality of the work and the motivation and commitment of its employees.  In reply to a parliamentary question the Minister said that since 1992 the State has allocated £23 million to Shannon Aerospace. This company, which has an employment potential of 800, is experiencing very grave difficulties.  I understand a series of meetings are being held in Europe which will decide matters relevant to this company.  Those meetings have been ill-served by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment who burst impetuously into print yesterday, and copies of the newspaper are now winging their way around various corners of the world.</P>
    <P>Why is none of the three Ministers here to answer my question?  Why was an attempt made to muzzle me on this matter when it was already in print? Will the Minister of State who is answering for the three Ministers in the Department of Enterprise and Employment give the House an account of the £23 million spent to date, the funding which is sought and an assurance that the 700 jobs in Shannon Aerospace will be maintained and consolidated?</P>

      <P>I accept that, and as Minister of State at three Departments with a great interest in the outcome of this difficulty, I will respond.</P>
      <P>Shannon Aerospace Limited is the aircraft maintenance facility jointly established by Lufthansa, Swissair and GPA.  It commenced trading in 1992 from a newly constructed state-of-theart maintenance facility located at Shannon Airport.  Considerable State funding has been made available by Shannon Development &mdash; SFADCo &mdash; to this firm; this funding amounts to £22.956 million comprising capital and training grants of £20 million and redeemable preference shares of £2.956 million.</P>
      <P>The private sector shareholders, who own the company, have made a substantial investment in this facility which currently employs about 700 people in well paid skilled employment.  This level of employment illustrates clearly the significance of the company in a regional, as well as national context.  It has also acted as a vehicle for the transfer of technology and skills and has established a reputation for high quality work and performance.</P>
      <P>A number of events, outside the company's control, have adversely affected its performance to date and created serious financial problems.  They include, in particular, the aerospace industry recession brought about by the Gulf War and the continuing depressed market in airframe maintenance.  This market, as we are well aware from the TEAM Aer Lingus difficulties, now has considerable overcapacity and competition for market share is intense.  These unfavourable developments have had a serious impact on the financial performance of the company, leading to substantial losses.  In short, the workload envisaged for the company on its establishment has not materialised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company has proposed a restructuring plan with a view to putting the facility on a viable and secure basis for <Col N="888" /> the future.  SFADCo has been involved in intensive discussions with the company and its shareholders on this restructuring plan which, if adopted, would involve significant additional shareholder and State investment.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, also had discussions recently with the company about its difficulties which are continuing.

    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year a debate raged around how much money we would get from Europe.  We eventually got much less than originally forecast. The money, we were told, was to ensure that Ireland reached European standards by 1999 when there will be very little funding available from the European Union.  What people do not know is that the billions we were supposed to get from the EU were used by unscrupulous employers.  Instead of putting in place structures to combat our high unemployment, we used the money very badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am referring to contracts which were subcontracted to people in the European Union who could then employ people from outside the European Union in what we might call slave labour.  Cheap non-European Union labour, mainly from Latvia, was used on dredging contracts in Cork and Waterford harbours and on work on the Malahide marina.  The Cork and Waterford <Col N="889" /> projects received 85 per cent EU funding with the remainder being provided by the State, in other words, the tax-payer. The work was carried out by European Union subcontractors who were then at liberty to employ cheap labour.  In Cork, they did not even agree on pay rates and in other cases the rates agreed were laughable.  Amnesty International had to intervene on behalf of the workers in Waterford who were literally imprisoned on ships and were refused access to union officials.</P>
    <P>Officials from the Marine and Port Workers Union and SIPTU tried to gain access to those workers to find out the conditions under which they were working, their rates of pay, their free time, onshore leave and so on, but were unsuccessful until there was public intervention which brought the matter to light.  These conditions are nothing short of a European scandal.  There are two issues of public concern.  It could be argued that, given the widespread unemployment throughout the European Union &mdash; especially in Ireland &mdash; European Union labour should be used on a European Union contract.  Perhaps I could be accused of being racist or parochial, but when one considers the conditions under which non-European labour is employed, this would merely protect ourselves and the workers involved.</P>
    <P>A more crucial issue relates to labour protection.  I am aware of the difficulties involved in protecting those workers because they are employed offshore, but the employers in this case were so cunning they knew that Irish labour law does not offer protection to workers as long as they remain offshore.  As Europe considers its territory includes the sea as well as land, surely the protection of workers' rights should extend to those working at sea, particularly having regard to the Minerals Development Bill we discussed earlier and offshore development in gas and oil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="890" /> As legislators we should not be content to maintain the <i>status quo</i>.  At the very least all contracts which are either State or EU-funded should include a stipulation regarding the type of labour to be employed and the conditions thereof.  I hope to keep this on the political agenda, and knowing people who work in offshore employment and how many people in this sector are unemployed, I am sure it would be of interest to us in the context of unemployment to bring this to the attention of the legislators at EU level.  As a national parliament we must insist that neither our people nor those outside the EU are discriminated against.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Lynch for raising her concerns about non-EU workers who have been employed on dredging projects.  I would like to clarify a number of questions which have been raised about the status of non-EU workers engaged in offshore labour. First, in regard to health and safety legislation, any vessels operating within the outer limits of Irish territorial waters, other than where they are exercising the right of innocent passage, are classified as places of work within the meaning of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989.  This means that trawlers, coasters or dredgers on which work is under way within Irish territorial waters are subject to Irish health and safety legislation.  Under the provisions of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 1989, employers are required to ensure, in so far as reasonably practicable, the safety, health and welfare of their employees. Subsequent regulations made under the Act amplify the protective provisions of the primary legislation in a number of specific areas which include use of work equipment, provision of personal protection equipment and manual handling of loads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In terms of general employment rights legislation on unfair dismissal, holidays, minimum notice etc., the general position is that the legislation <Col N="891" /> applies to employers and employees who come within the scope of the legislation, regardless of their nationality. This general rule would apply to all eligible employees on vessels operating within our territorial waters, regardless of whether they are non-EU citizens, and the fact that the employer may be foreign-based does not make the statute inoperable.  As a general rule, therefore, Irish employment rights legislation does not exclude non-EU citizens employed on offshore labour.</P>
    <P>However, different categories of employment are excluded under the individual employment rights statutes. For example, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act does not apply to employment under an employment agreement pursuant to Part II or Part IV of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894.  It would be necessary to consider, therefore, in the context of the specific exclusions contained in individual statutes, whether each individual statute applied to the particular category of employment.</P>
    <P>While certain categories of employee are entitled to statutory rates of pay and conditions of employment, as set out in registered employment agreements or employment regulation orders, in most employment these are matters for negotiation and settlement between employers and employees or trade unions acting on their behalf.  Consequently, in most employment, rates of pay are not legally enforceable, irrespective of the nationality of the workers.</P>
    <P>In summary, the general position is that non-EU migrant workers employed in Ireland, including those employed on offshore labour within the outer limit of Irish territorial waters, are protected on the same basis as Irish workers in regard to safety, health and general employment rights.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Mullaghmore (Clare) Project.</Title>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> Miss de Valera: I hope the Minister is aware that his decision on the Mullaghmore project in County Clare has devastated the people of that area.  Why did the Minister not wait for the planning process to be completed?  This process was fully endorsed by both sides of the argument, why the pre-emptive strike? There were court cases to ensure that the planning process would be adhered to.  Is it that, given the Minister's personal views on the matter, he could not resist moving on this matter now, although in the Dáil on 15 March 1995, he stated that, because of the complexities of the proposed heritage centres, it would not be wise to rush into any decision, and stressed the need for Government to give careful consideration to the issues involved?  The Minister also stated on the same day, Official Report, columns 1670 and 1671: &ldquo;It has always been my aim to try to heal these divisions and to work towards consensus&rdquo;. He also assured the House: &ldquo;I do not have any personal difficulty with any of the three sites, my only concern is to bring about a resolution that hopefully will bring together communities which were previously divided&rdquo;.  Is the Minister so politically naïve to believe that his precipitous action will do anything other than deepen and create further division within the small community of north Clare, or was what the Minister said on 15 March in the Dáil on the question of healing wounds purely platitudes?</P>
    <P>The Minister's pre-emptive strike which was both insensitive and authoritarian has caused great hurt, anger and further division within the community of north Clare.  All major players should have been involved in the decision after the completion of the planning process. This has been the view of the heritage council.</P>
    <P>Where do Fine Gael and the Taoiseach stand?  There must be a great feeling of embarrassment among Fine Gael representatives in County Clare who <Col N="893" /> supported the proposal for Mullaghmore. The Taoiseach has obviously failed to have the view supported at Cabinet.  The first hint of this failure by the Taoiseach was his agreement to allow a Cabinet decision on this matter in the Programme for Government between Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left without being able to follow it through.  Is this a Fine Gael concession to Labour on a matter on which Fine Gael does not feel strongly?  Does Fine Gael see this decision as one which will keep the Minister, Deputy M. Higgins, happy?  Many view the action of the Minister and the Cabinet as an attempt to further weaken the Office of Public Works, which has always given great service to the State.  Is the Minister aware that a motion proposed by Deputy Doherty, seconded by Deputy Bat O'Keeffe and supported by Deputies Ellis and Ned O'Keeffe, was tabled at the Committee of Public Accounts this morning?  This motion seeks to ensure that no demolition work will be undertaken at the Mullaghmore site until the financial implications of the Government decision are discussed at the committee.  The Fianna Fáil members of the committee view this as a grave matter to be treated with urgency.  It is not good enough to spend millions of pounds on the site at Mullaghmore and now decide to abandon the project.  It is crazy that the buildings at Mullaghmore will be dismantled and nothing but a car park left.  I was aghast at the suggestion by the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Enda Kenny, that the car park could be used for picnics.  What would a car park picnic site, with no supervision, do to the Mullaghmore area environmentally? This would be the worst of all worlds.</P>
    <P>I am told that the group in favour of the Mullaghmore centre is seeking legal advice on the matter and wish the Minister to hold off from withdrawing the application.  Will he review his decision which has caused a great deal of hurt, anxiety and further division in a very small community in County Clare in part of the constituency in which he was <Col N="894" /> born?  He should have a particular interest and a certain sensitivity with regard to areas of heritage and culture and an appreciation of what the people of that area have done, through tourism etc., to effectively promote heritage and culture.  He is not prepared to enter consultations but has made a pre-emptive strike before the planning process has been completed.  Even at this late stage I appeal to him to review the matter carefully in the hope that he will be in a position to reverse this unfortunate Cabinet decision.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment this afternoon. I hope my contribution will allay some, if not all, of the fears of those in the Burren area who were in favour of the proposal to develop the visitor centre at Mullaghmore.  I am particularly glad to have the opportunity of setting out exactly what the Government has decided, which is as follows:</P>
      <P>The planning application at present before Clare County Council for the retention of the existing structures and for the completion of the Visitor Centre as planned at Mullaghmore is to be withdrawn.  A management plan for the Burren National Park is to be prepared and presented for consideration by the public and interested parties. In the meantime, the partially constructed buildings are to be dismantled but the completed bus and car parks will be retained pending further consideration in the light of the management plan referred to above.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case has been made that, by withdrawing the planning application for the Mullaghmore centre, we have somehow delayed developments in the Burren by <Col N="895" /> many years.  This seems to be based on the theory that by allowing the planning process to proceed in the expectation that the application would ultimately be successful, the Government would have no option but to proceed with the project. This is an extension of the fallacious argument applied to this case from the beginning, that is, that once the project is started it will be impossible to stop it.  As I said in Seanad Éireann yesterday during the debate on the Heritage Bill:</P>
    <P>A historic shift in culture is required.  There was a time in Irish culture when people imagined that if one presented people with nearly finished items, they would accept them. However, we are now at a point in our cultural history where people want to see things in the shapes that are to come before their consent is presumed.  We must operate in that manner.</P>
    <P>It rings hollow to hear people speak of pre-emptive strikes.  If there had not been indecent haste and pre-emptive strikes by others who had responsibility in this area we would not have had the divisions in County Clare to which the Deputy referred.</P>

      <P>Mr. Justice Costello made the decision that the Office of Public Works, like every other State agency, should proceed by way of the planning process.

      <P>My approach is based on consensus and I am pleased my colleagues in Government will support it. The decision as to where and how interpretation of the Burren National Park should be provided is the first step and the seeking of planning approval in relation to proposed developments comes next.  This is the process I am setting in train and I am doing so now in order to have it resolved as quickly as possible rather than wait the rest of the year while the planning process is taking its course before commencing work on the management plan.  This plan will form the blueprint for the management of the park in the medium to long term. The plan will identify the important features of the park, including, <i>inter alia</i>, the physical, ecological and environmental aspects which make the Burren such a precious area.  The plan will address issues such as visitor facilities and other infrastructural matters and I hope, will identify strategies to enable local communities to benefit in the fullest possible manner from their location adjacent to the Burren National Park.</P>
      <P>It is important to stress that a key feature of the process of preparing a management plan for the Burren National Park is that the public and interested parties, including the local authority, will have an opportunity to have an input into the preparation of this plan.  Such consultations as will take place as part of this process will be meaningful and the genuine concerns of all interested parties will be listened to and incorporated in the plan in so far as possible.</P>
      <P>As regards the Mullaghmore site itself, the partially constructed buildings are to be dismantled but the completed bus and car parks will be retained pending further consideration in the light of the management plan.  This is prudent as it may be that the management plan will recommend that the car and bus parks be retained as part of the facilities for the National Park and, if so, planning permission will be sought for their retention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much has been said over the last few days about the Government's decision <Col N="897" /> in regard to the Burren National Park Visitor Centre.  The Government has behaved in an honest and open manner. The policy agreement, <i>A Government for Renewal</i>, made it clear that the incoming Government would make a decision in regard to the three controversial centres and, after a detailed examination of all aspects of the matter, it has now made that decision.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the strong feelings expressed at local level in north Clare regarding the Government's decision but I stress the positive aspect of the Government decision.  The plan will address important issues such as how best the local communities can benefit. Local consultation will be an integral part of the formulation of the management plan.</P>
    <P>I express the hope that everyone will accept the wisdom of proceeding first with a management plan.  It is time now to look to the future.  We should endeavour to see to it that disputes such as that which arose over Mullaghmore never arise again.  The key for the future is to manage the interaction of our heritage, community development and tourism in ways which will be ecologically responsible while at the same time respecting individual rights and the needs of local communities.</P>
    <P>Deputies have a right to raise this matter with the Committee of Public Accounts.  Members of the committee may well want to ask questions about who had responsibility when sums of money were spent and committed without entering into any meaningful consultation process with everyone involved.  I do not want to rake over the past; we should set our minds on the future and achieve consensus through an orderly consultative process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shorthall Ms Shorthall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shorthall</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the <Col N="898" /> Adjournment and the Minister for coming into the House to reply.</P>
      <P>I draw the Minister's attention to section 41 of the Road Traffic Act under which a member of the Garda Síochána will have the power to impound a motor vehicle in respect of motor tax and insurance offences or where the driver is too young to hold a driving licence.  The latter provision was designed specifically to combat the problem of joyriding by young offenders.</P>
      <P>Before this section comes into operation it will be necessary for the Minister to make regulations setting out the detailed procedures to be followed.  My attention has been drawn to the absence of these regulations which contributes greatly to the problems experienced both by constituents and members of the Garda Síochána.</P>
      <P>There is a serious problem in my constituency and many other parts of Dublin where young people, some as young as nine or ten years of age, drive around on old motorbikes or in old bangers, unregistered and obviously uninsured, which they buy for as little as £20 to £30 from scrap dealers.  This activity poses a great danger to the public and the youngsters themselves who cause much damage in public open spaces.</P>
      <P>Of most concern is the lawlessness which this activity leads to in some parts of the city.  In my own constituency I frequently witness children driving around on old motorbikes and in old bangers. Recently four children clinging to a motorbike careered across a main road in front of me.  This was an incredible spectacle and undermines the huge effort being made by communities in the city.  At present the Garda Síochána does not have the power to seize these vehicles and is therefore helpless in combating this crime and preventing the more serious crime to which joyriding often leads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 41 forms an integral part of the Road Traffic Act and should be given priority, to guarantee the safety and security of the community as well as to avoid crime and its consequences. <Col N="899" /> I urge the Minister to take the swiftest possible steps to enable the Garda Síochána detain these vehicles under the circumstances outlined in this section of the Act.</P>
    <P>I hope this issue will be taken seriously because it would be an important step in reducing crime and saving lives.  I look forward to the Minister's response.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Shortall for raising this important issue and for giving me the opportunity to outline the progress being made in implementing further sections of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, including the measures provided for under section 41.  It also gives me the opportunity to express my concern about the problems of joyriding.</P>
      <P>Joyriding has been a persistent menace in our society, particularly in the larger urban areas, for quite a number of years.  The joyriding issue has struck many people, through damage to their vehicles, personal injury, and, even more tragically and sadly, through loss of life.  It has to be condemned without reservation by all right-thinking people.</P>
      <P>Section 41 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994 provides the Garda, <i>inter alia</i>, with a new power to detain and impound a vehicle in a number of circumstances. One of these is where a vehicle is being used in a public place and where a member of the Garda Síochána is of the opinion that the person driving the vehicle is too young to be the holder of a driving licence.  I am confident that this provision, effectively enforced, will greatly assist the Garda in stamping out joyriding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Shortall raised the need for section 41 to be brought into operation <Col N="900" /> as a matter of urgency.  I agree with her and I intend that the section will be commenced, and the necessary regulatory changes made, as part of the next phase of introducing provisions of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, the provisions of which are very extensive and farreaching. A variety of arrangements, including consultations with the Garda and other Government Departments, are necessary to enable a smooth and effective implementation of the various measures.  Regulations are required to give full effect to some sections, including section 41.  For this reason, it was decided to commence the provisions of the Act on a phased basis, as necessary arrangements are completed.</P>
    <P>The 1994 Act, to a considerable extent, is geared to making our roads safer.  Important measures from a road safety point of view have already been brought into operation.  The provisions of section 38, which were commenced in July 1994, are of particular relevance to safety on the roads in built-up urban areas.  That section empowers local authorities to provide traffic calming measures, as they see fit, to slow down traffic in these areas; they can provide measures such as bollards, ramps, rumble strips, etc.  These measures, together with compliance with built-up area speed limits, can combine to improve safety on all our urban streets.</P>
    <P>I accept, however, the importance of adding section 41 to the range of measures available, and I am pleased to be able to tell the Deputy and the House that arrangements are now almost complete for its commencement. I hope to be in a position to sign the commencement order for this section within the next two weeks.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 4 April 1995.</P>

      <P>The decision to discontinue the use of Collins Barracks, Dublin, as an occupied military post has necessitated the redeployment of a substantial number of personnel to McKee Barracks and Cathal Brugha Barracks.</P>
      <P>The infrastructure facilities available at the latter locations were not adequate to absorb the number of personnel involved and it was necessary to embark on a programme of refurbishment of existing buildings which were not in a good state of repair and the construction of new buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A decision to adapt Collins Barracks for museum purposes gave rise to a <Col N="814" /> request by the Office of Public Works early in 1994 for the urgent evacuation of a substantial amount of accommodation at the barracks.  Segregation of the area required and the relocation of numbers of military personnel both within Collins Barracks and to Cathal Brugha Barracks was achieved on target in May 1994.</P>
    <P>A sum of approximately £2.25 million has been expended on the provision of alternative billet and office accommodation; in addition, over recent years, a number of other projects, including a new central armoury, new dining complex, supply and transport workshops and a Barrack Foreman of Works complex &mdash; the requirement for which was not solely dependent on the evacuation of Collins Barracks &mdash; have been provided at a cost of £6.5 million.  All of these moneys were provided for under subhead V &mdash; Building and Engineering Works, in the Defence Estimate.</P>

      <P>Under the relevant EU regulations, the monitoring of landings is a matter for the competent authorities of the member states in which the landings take place.  The prospect of multinational inspections is, I regret, remote given that most member states are not favourably disposed to them.</P>
      <P>EU Commission inspectors are, however, empowered to make unannounced visits to fishing ports in member states for the purposes of checking on national controls.  A number of spot checks were undertaken by the Commission in all member states in 1994.  I welcome the Commission's plans to further intensify its inspections this year.</P>
      <P>Commission inspectors are also entitled to observe control and inspection activities carried out by the national control services.  Where the Commission considers that there are irregularities, it has the power to insist that appropriate measures, including the initiation of court proceedings, be taken against the offending boats.  It may also carry out an administrative audit of the monitoring system in the member state concerned and impose sanctions where considered necessary.  I understand that the Commission will be reporting to Council on the outcome of the 1994 inspections by next June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The control regulations also require that member states co-ordinate their control activities.  To that end, member <Col N="820" /> states may set up joint inspection programmes to monitor vessels in each other's territories.  To date we have undertaken joint inspections with the UK authorities and we are pressing for a similar programme with the Spanish authorities.  Such an arrangement would considerably enhance the efficacy of overall monitoring and control which is our primary objective.</P>

      <P>This issue was dealt with comprehensively in the reply given on my behalf to a question raised on the adjournment of the Dáil on 15 March and also in a public statement issued on that date.  I also took the opportunity to fully brief the Seanad on the issue during the debate on marine policy last Thursday, 23 March.</P>
      <P>We have consistently urged restraint and caution on both sides and are encouraging efforts to reach a negotiated settlement.</P>
      <P>There is a range of issues involved.</P>
      <P>First, the Union does not accept, and we fully support the Union's position in this regard, the right of Canada to extend its fisheries jurisdiction over fishing on the high seas.</P>
      <P>Second, the Union quite rightly takes a very grave view of Canada's action in arresting and interfering with Union vessels fishing in international waters. Such action cannot be condoned.</P>
      <P>Third, the Union and Canada are agreed on the need to conserve stocks and in this regard the Union with Ireland's support and despite strong opposition within the Union agreed to a major reduction in the Total Allowable Catch for Greenland Halibut in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fourth, there is the matter of the allocation of the Greenland Halibut stocks as between the Union and other NAFO contracting parties.  We support the Union's view that the NAFO decision in <Col N="822" /> this regard to allocate 12.59 per cent to the Union with 60.37 per cent for Canada was inequitable.</P>
    <P>Fifth, there is general agreement in principle that control and enforcement resources in the NAFO area must be improved.  Ireland supports the need for better controls.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, Ireland does not condone illegal fishing by the vessels of any nation and we are urging both the Union and member states to face up to their responsibilities in this regard.</P>
    <P>We believe that with restraint and goodwill on both sides, an equitable durable settlement can be reached and urge both sides to work towards that end.</P>

      <P>While I am reluctant to say anything at this juncture which might jeopardise an amicable settlement, it is nevertheless the case that, since the complaint was first lodged by Irish Ferries with the EU Commission, attempts to settle the complaint have proceeded with remarkable speed at the European Commission.  Time is a critical factor in this particular case and the seasonal nature of the industry is an added reason for urgency.  My Department with the assistance of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Enterprise and Employment have been very actively involved in progressing the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an amicable and workable solution cannot be reached shortly between the two sides, I confidently expect that the Commission, which has the competency <Col N="823" /> to take interim measures, will take a decision very speedily to resolve matters for the 1995 summer season.  In this context an Advisory Committee on which all EU member states are represented will be meeting shortly under the auspices of the EU Commission to consider the issue.  The final decision is a matter for the Commission.</P>

      <P>BIM's current marketing brief spans both home and export markets, and activity levels are dictated by a number of factors including funding, priority markets and the overall supply and demand situation internationally.  In recent years home market promotions have increased with the objective of increasing <i>per capita</i> consumption of seafood.  Promotions include Focus on Fish Week held in October, the annual schools seafood cookery competition as well as a range of programmes in support of the retail, catering and tourism industries.</P>
      <P>We are conscious of the need to increase promotional efforts on the home market even further.  Such promotions form an integral part of the generic promotion initiative over the next five years for which EU funding of almost £2 million is being made available under the Operational Programme for Fisheries.  The aim is to increase the regularity of seafood consumption, and encourage a target of two seafood meals a week.  The targeted increase over the period of the Operational Programme is 0.2 kg per head per year, to achieve a level of almost 10 kgs per head by the year 2000.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a visit was made, some time back, by Dr. Nuno Gomes of the Department of Geology, University of Lisbon, Portugal, to the Mornington Bay area.  Dr. Gomes is an expert on coastal sand dune systems and has been involved in a number of collaborative projects on matters relating to coastal dynamics, sand movement and erosion with research teams from both EU and non-EU states.  Dr. Gomes is not employed by the Commission of the European Communities.  I understand that during his visit he indicated that erosion is taking place at Mornington and along the Laytown-Bettystown beach.</P>
      <P>Any erosion that may be taking place in County Meath, or elsewhere for that matter, is in the first instance the responsibility of the property owner, whether that be a private individual or local authority.  Property owners have a vested interest in protecting their own property.  The Department of the Marine's role is to work in conjunction with coastal local authorities on the management of the coastal zone.  The Department will, of course, provide assistance in terms of technical advise and foreshore permissions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department is also in a position to provide limited grant aid for coastal protection works under the Operational Programme for Environmental Service 1994-1999.  Under this programme some £5.1 million is available over the period to the end of 1999, to help address the <Col N="828" /> problem of erosion around our coastline. Given this limited level of funding, it is important that the Department aids the best possible mix of priority protection works.  To this end, each maritime local authority has been requested to submit their top four priority proposals for consideration by the Department. The local authorities have also been asked to provide detailed supporting information such as erosion rates, specifics of proposed works, costings, cost benefit analysis, etc.</P>
    <P>Meath County Council have submitted proposals to the Department for consideration.  These proposals include the provision of gabion protection works at Laytown and Bettystown, and beach-dune nourishment at Bettystown and Mornington.  These proposals will be given full consideration along with the proposals submitted by other local authorities.</P>

      <P>Under Ireland's Operational Programme for Fisheries the Irish Government and the European Commission plan for investment of over £30 million on renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet during the six year period from 1994 to 1999.  EU aid will amount to in excess of £9 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last month, I announced that EU funding of almost £900,000 would be allocated to 17 approved fishing vessel modernisation projects.  Total investment on these projects will amount to £3.5 million.  These were the first projects to be approved under the fleet modernisation programme.  A further aid package attracting EU funding of more than £100,000, to be spent on small scale fleet modernisation projects <Col N="829" /> (i.e. attracting investment of less than £60,000 each), will be announced shortly.  The remaining EU funding of over £8 million will be allocated to approved fishing vessel modernisation projects between the end of this year and 1999.  The general objective of this grant-aided investment is to provide for modernisation and upgrading of the Irish fishing fleet to enable it to take up unused fishing quotas, increase catches of non-quota species and to improve safety, health and hygiene standards on board vessels.  It will also bring the fleet into better balance with available resources thereby increasing landings, maintaining related jobs in the catching sector and increasing employment in the processing sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Coveney)</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to 1986 all fishermen were treated as employees for PAYE and PRSI purposes.  As a result of rulings in the High Court in 1986 and 1992, share-fishermen had to be treated as self-employed persons and like other self-employed were required to pay the appropriate social welfare contributions. These contributions would have entitled fishermen to contributory pensions but not to unemployment or other social welfare benefits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition of the unique position of share-fishermen, a provision was made by the Minister for Social Welfare in the 1993 Social Welfare Act whereby share-fishermen could make additional contributions under a special operational social insurance scheme.  This <Col N="830" /> scheme, which would entitle fishermen to unemployment, illness and treatment benefit, was applicable from 1 January 1995.</P>
    <P>During the winter months, fishing operations are to some extent curtailed due to weather conditions.  In the case of certain vessels fishing for demersal species, catches during this period may not justify continuous fishing activity.  It may be the case that in certain isolated instances, the enhanced social welfare entitlements have proven more attractive than fishing.</P>
    <P>However, it is understood that the numbers of fishermen opting for the new scheme have not been significant, in which case the effects of the scheme on the availability of crew should have been minimal.</P>
    <P>I will, however, examine the situation in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>

      <P>The Marine Survey Office of the Department of the Marine operates a strict year-round inspection programme for all ferries using Irish ports.  This programme is designed to ensure strict compliance with national, international and EU safety standards.  The programme also encourages a culture of safety, reliability and best practice.</P>
      <P>There is a large international dimension to maritime safety legislation which is governed by the International Maritime Organisation.  The IMO conventions are the cornerstone of maritime safety regulation throughout the world. The Department will continue to give the highest priority to introducing into Irish law the IMO's constantly evolving standards for ferry safety.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the <i>Estonia</i> tragedy last September, the IMO announced a priority review of ferry safety.  The review is being carried out by an international panel of experts and is drawing on the advice and information available <Col N="832" /> from member states.  The Chief Surveyor of the Department of the Marine is playing an active role in this review. I expect that the review will produce a number of concrete recommendations on key aspects of ferry safety.</P>
    <P>The European Union is playing an increasing role in maritime safety.  This role was given increased impetus as a result of the <i>Braer</i> tanker disaster and more recently following the loss of the passenger ferry <i>Estonia</i>.  The EU's &ldquo;Common Policy on Safe Seas&rdquo; provides the framework range of important regulatory measures covering maritime safety including port state control, the international safety management code and reporting arrangements for ships carrying dangerous or polluting goods. Ireland participates actively at EU level to ensure that the highest practical and enforceable standards of ferry safety prevail and is supportive of EU efforts to bring forward the date of application of IMO regulations in EU member states.</P>

Implementation of the recommendations of the Management report is dependent on availability of resources under the Department's administrative budget and this is the subject of a separate exercise in train at present.

      <P>My statutory powers in relation to disposal of waste at sea derive from the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981 under which permits may be granted for the disposal at sea of substances or materials.  This Act gives effect to the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution from Ships and Aircraft, 1972.</P>
      <P>Applications to dispose of substances or materials at sea are assessed by the marine licence vetting committee which is a multi-disciplinary committee composed of Department of the Marine and Central Fisheries Board officials with expertise in biology, oceanography, chemistry, navigation and engineering.</P>
      <P>The committee assesses each application to ensure that</P>
      <P>(i)  the proposed disposal site is suitable from a fisheries and navigational point of view;</P>
      <P>(ii)  the quantity and constituents of the waste are such that it will not have adverse impact on the marine environment;</P>
      <P>(iii)  there are no suitable land-based alternatives and</P>
      <P>(iv)  the disposal vessel is properly licensed and certificated.</P>
      <P>The Oslo Commission guidelines for the management of dredged material are taken into consideration in the disposal of dredge spoil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> The marina at Malahide is being developed in two phases.  Phase 1 has been completed and the dredged material which was not being used for reclamation purposes, which is the material to which you refer, was disposed of temporarily on the phase 2 marina basin.  The developers, Malahide Marina Village Ltd. intend disposing of this spoil at sea, together with a spoil arising from the phase 2 development.</P>
    <P>The developers applied for a permit under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981 to dispose of material associated with the marina development at a site some 7.5 km east of Malahide.  Assessment of the proposal revealed that the proposed area was not suitable as a disposal site due to the presence of a valuable whelk fishery in the area.</P>
    <P>The developers have now submitted an alternative proposal involving a new site located 34km from Malahide inlet which is acceptable from a fisheries point of view.  They have been requested to carry out a further survey in support of their proposals.  On receipt of these details a decision will be made as to whether a dumping at sea permit may be granted.</P>

Sale or transfer of ownership of a vessel which has its title registered under the Mercantile Marine Act must be endorsed on the certificate of registry.</P>
      <P>The granting of a sea-fishing boat licence is conditional on the applicant providing satisfactory proof of ownership of the vessel.  A Bill of Sale is <i>prima facie</i> proof of ownership.  Where a bill of sale is not available, the Department is prepared to accept such other documentary evidence, on a case by case basis, as will satisfy the question of ownership.</P>

      <P>Performance to date has fully lived up to expectations as demonstrated in the statistics which I recently published. Since 1991 the Department's helicopter has carried out over 400 missions and has saved over 300 lives.</P>
      <P>The Government also decided in 1991 that the feasibility of operating a medium-range helicopter service by the Air Corps from 1997 should be fully examined and costed.  A Department of Defence assessment of that option has been completed recently and is being considered in the context of an overall review of search and rescue requirements on the expiry of the existing contract in December 1996.</P>

      <P>Dunsoughly Castle is vested in the Commissioners of Public Works by virtue of a vesting order made in 1914.  Access to the castle is through an adjoining farm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years the farm owner has complained of vandalism to his property by people visiting the castle and has informed the commissioners that he will <Col N="842" /> hold them liable for damage to his property and for any third party claims against him.  He has requested the commissioners to refrain from allowing the local caretaker making the key to the castle available to visitors.  Pending receipt of legal advice, the commissioners have acceded to this request.</P>
    <P>However, if groups such as the Finglas Folk and Heritage Group wish to visit the castle and notify the commissioners in advance, the latter will approach the farm owner with a view to obtaining his agreement to allow access to such groups to the castle through his farm.</P>
    <P>The question of acquiring lands around the castle and a defined access has been considered but I am advised that this could entail disruption of the running of the farm and no progress has been possible to date.  I have asked the commissioners to reactivate this matter with a view to solving the access problem.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by the enrolment on 30 September of the previous school year.  The enrolment of the school in question on 30 September 1993 was 292 which warrants a teaching staff of principal plus nine assistants for the current school year.  The enrolment as of 30 September 1994 was 260 which will warrant a staff of principal plus eight assistants for the 1995-96 school year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school also has a concessionary <Col N="843" /> post, as well as the services of a remedial teacher and a home-school liaison post.  This gives it a very favourable staffing ratio compared to other schools.</P>
    <P>I am aware that representations have been made on behalf of the school for the retention of nine assistant teachers, but I regret it will not be possible to depart from agreed procedures in this case.  The name of the teacher in question has been placed on the panel for redeployment for the 1995-96 school year.</P>

      <P>The issue of vaccination for school staff against infection from hepatitis has been under consideration by my Department in conjunction with the Department of Health in the context of the preparation of a manual by the health promotion unit for issue to schools.</P>
      <P>The manual which will issue shortly advises in the case of hepatitis A that immune globulin may be given to those, including teachers, who have had close contact with persons infected.  The available vaccine can be used to abort outbreaks within schools and to immunise those in areas where the risk of acquiring hepatitis A is high.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to hepatitis B is that in general there is considered to be little risk within the school and, provided correct procedures for handling potentially infectious secretions are adopted, hepatitis B carriers can be admitted to school or day care without restriction.</P>
      <P>In the event of exposure to hepatitis B immediate use of immune globulin and hepatitis vaccine can be effected in preventing infection.  It is recommended that an immunisation programme for all non-immune personnel and children should be considered in the case of a school caring for many hepatitis B infected children.</P>
      <P>There is no information available to my Department on the number and percentage of teachers vaccinated against the disease in ordinary schools.</P>
      <P>In the case of the special schools for young offenders, all staff members including teachers are offered free vaccination against hepatitis B.  The vaccination process is designed to develop adequate antibody after three vaccine doses.  The vaccine doses are delivered by injection.  Details of the number of staff in these special schools who availed of the vaccination in 1993-94 are as follows:</P>

      <Quest>her policy on vaccination against the Hepatitis A and B virus in view of the implementation requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Biological Agents) Regulations, 1994; and the number and percentage of Garda Síochána, prison officers and probation workers vaccinated in each of the years 1993 and 1994.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department does not provide vaccination against hepatitis A as a routine procedure.  I understand that current Department of Health advice is that generalised vaccination against hepatitis A is not justified.  My Department will keep the situation in relation to hepatitis A vaccination under continuing review in the light of advice from the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards hepatitis B, the policy of <Col N="853" /> my Department since 1987 has been to offer vaccination, at State expense, to personnel based in prisons and places of detention.  Approximately 1,800 of the personnel concerned availed of the vaccination programme in the period 1987-92. This figure includes teachers, chaplains and prison-based probation and welfare service personnel.  The number of personnel vaccinated in the years 1993 and 1994 was 276 and 335, respectively. The vast majority of personnel, therefore, have been vaccinated and, essentially, the only persons who have not been vaccinated are those who declined the offer.  I should add that my Department has been encouraging staff to have their antibody levels checked regularly to ensure that they maintain immunity against contracting the disease. Booster vaccinations are given as required.</P>
    <P>Separate figures in relation to the overall number of probation and welfare service personnel &mdash; including those involved in non-prison activities &mdash; who have been vaccinated since the scheme commenced are not readily available.  Statistics in relation to the service will be compiled and furnished to the Deputy when available.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Garda Síochána, I am informed by the Garda authorities that they are aware of the requirements of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (Biological Agents) Regulations, 1994, and have already taken the necessary steps to protect members of the force from contamination.  A vaccination programme against Hepatitis was initiated in the Garda Síochána in 1989. Vaccination against hepatitis B was made available to all members of the force free of charge.  In addition, a six internal circulars have been issued by the Garda authorities since 1984 on the necessity for all members of the force to take reasonable steps in relation to contagious diseases whilst on duty. Also, in February of this year all members received a notice in their pay cheques informing them of the existence of a booster programme for members who had received the original vaccine. <Col N="854" /> Members who had not availed of the vaccine to date were reminded of its availability.  Only members of the underwater unit and members travelling overseas on UN duty are vaccinated against hepatitis A.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that they estimate that almost 50 per cent of the force have been vaccinated against hepatitis and that there is almost a 100 per cent uptake of the vaccination by trainees at the Garda college prior to transfer to stations.</P>
    <P>As the vaccine is administered by the Garda surgeon in the Dublin Metropolitan Area and by local general practitioners to members in country divisions, it is not possible, in the time available, to provide the specific information sought by the Deputy in respect of 1993 and 1994.  However, I will endeavour to provide this information to the Deputy as soon as it can be compiled.</P>

      <Quest>the reason a person (details supplied) was not granted an old age pension or refunded his PRSI contributions in view of the fact that he had made PRSI contributions in the period 1942 to 1946; the proposals if any, he has to make a refund to this person; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension, a person must, <i>inter alia</i>, have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age, must have at least 156 contributions paid and must have a yearly average of not less than 20 contributions paid or credited from 1953, or from the date of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, up to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.</P>
      <P>The person concerned entered insurance for the first time under the National Health Acts in 1942 and paid contributions for four years.  He re-entered social insurance when the PRSI scheme was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and paid contributions until he reached age 66 in March 1991.</P>
      <P>He did not satisfy any of the qualifying conditions on the basis of his record as a self-employed person.  His earlier record was, in the circumstances, taken into account.  This had the effect of satisfying the first two conditions mentioned. It also meant that the period over which his yearly average was calculated was 1953 to 1990.  The records of my Department show that he had a total of 155 contributions in that period which is equivalent to a yearly average of only four.  This is not sufficient to qualify him for an old age contributory pension.</P>
      <P>An application form for non-contributory old age pension was issued to him on 28 March 1995.  On receipt of an application his entitlement to a non-contributory pension will be examined and he will be notified of the outcome without delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under existing legislation, a person who fails to qualify for either an old age <Col N="856" /> contributory or non-contributory pension is entitled to a refund of the old age pension element of any contributions paid provided the person was aged 56 or over when entering social insurance for the first time.  These arrangements apply equally to employed and self-employed persons.  As the person concerned entered social insurance for the first time before he was 56 years of age, I regret to say that he does not, therefore, qualify for a refund of contributions. The regulations dealing with refunds are at present under review in my Department and cases such as this will be looked at in the context of this review.</P>

      <P>The free travel scheme operated by my Department is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years or over as well as certain incapacitated people in receipt of social welfare-type payments.  The scheme provides free travel at off-peak periods for eligible people on the main public and private transport services.  These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by some 42 private contractors.  The vast majority of these private contractors operate in rural areas.  It is, therefore, fair to say that, for all practical purposes, the free travel service is available throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The scope of the free travel scheme has been expanded over the years both in relation to the number of routes covered and the concessions made available to people with disabilities, such as <Col N="857" /> the free travel companion pass.  In addition, as announced in the budget, the scheme will be further extended later this year to include cross-Border journeys in both directions.  Currently, about 462,000 people qualify for free travel at an annual cost of about £31 million.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of the scheme is to encourage independence, mobility and social integration among elderly and incapacitated people.  The scheme supports this in practice by reimbursing public and private transport services throughout the country, wherever they are available.  There have been a number of recent additions of private operator services to the free travel service in locations where there were no services previously.  My Department will continue to deal with further applications from private operator services as they arise.  In this regard, I am satisfied that the free travel scheme has played a part in ensuring the continuance of transport services in parts of the country where they might not otherwise be available.  I should, however, mention that the ongoing development of transport services is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>

      <P>My Department will use every means at its disposal to ensure that women in all parts of the country are fully informed of their entitlements under the equality treatment arrears payments.  As a first step, some 70,000 women who have received payments under the European Communities (Social Welfare) Regulations, 1992 (S.I.

A special telephone inquiry unit will be set up in the Department to deal with inquiries from the married women concerned.  In addition, a comprehensive information leaflet will be available shortly from my Department's local offices and arrangements will be made to notify independent information providers, such as citizens information centres, centres for the unemployed and other local and community groups, of the qualifying criteria and payment arrangements.</P>
      <P>The arrears payments will consist of increases for adult and child dependants and unemployment assistance during the period December 1984 to November 1986.  Transitional payments as provided for in the recent court judgment will also be payable in certain cases.  In addition, compensation will be payable, based on the increase in the Consumer Price Index, from the date the entitlements fell due up to the date on which payments are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total costs of these arrangements are estimated at some £260 million, of which up to £200 million will be paid by the end of 1995.  All the married women involved will receive payments on account by September next at an overall <Col N="859" /> cost estimated at £160 million.  Further payments on account will be made up to the end of December 1995 at a cost of £40 million.  The remaining payments, estimated at £60 million, will be paid from January 1996 onwards over as short a period as possible.</P>

      <P>I take it the Deputy is referring to the Government decision to establish a local employment service, which will be introduced initially in the 12 area partnerships set up under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and in two other areas which I hope to announce in the near future.</P>
      <P>The local employment service will operate under my direction and in close co-operation with the initial 12 <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> area partnerships, which are based in the following areas: Ballymun: Coolock/Darndale/Kilbarrack; Dublin inner city; Finglas/Cabra; Tallaght; Cork North City and some other disadvantaged areas in that city; Dundalk; Kerry south west and other rural disadvantaged areas of Kerry and Killarney: Limerick city; Mayo north; Waterford west and other rural disadvantaged areas of Waterford; Wexford south west and other rural disadvantaged areas of Wexford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local development service will provide a gateway, or access point, to the full range of options available to a long-term unemployed person, including guidance, training, education and <Col N="860" /> employment supports.  The responsibility for the local development programme in the partnership areas rests with the Taoiseach.  In this regard the areas designated as partnerships have been extended from the original 12 areas to 33.</P>
    <P>I assume the reference to the community enterprise programme should be community employment which is administered by FÁS on a national basis.  Funding to FÁS for community employment in partnership areas is provided from the Vote of the Department of the Taoiseach and, in non-partnership areas, from my Department's Vote.</P>

      <P>Forbairt has been in discussion with Waterford Crystal for the past few years on ways in which it might restore its international competitiveness and thus secure the future of manufacturing jobs at Waterford.</P>
      <P>Waterford Wedgewood has drawn up a IR£13 million investment plan which will entail the expenditure of more than £IR7 million on a tank furnace alone. In addition, the company has agreed to undertake a significant R&amp;D programme to capitalise on this new technology. The Government has approved the making by Forbairt of R&amp;D grant assistance towards the programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To help support the IR£13 million investment programme, Forbairt plans to make an investment in cumulative redeemable preference shares which will be repaid to that agency within an <Col N="861" /> agreed time frame.  The Deputy will appreciate that details of the package negotiated between Forbairt and the company are confidential to the parties.</P>
    <P>Current employment is 1.500 and Forbairt accepts that, in the company's drive to achieve international competitiveness, a reduction in employment in the short term will be necessary.  Negotiations have already taken place between the company and trade union representatives and agreement was reached on the various issues in relation to the tank furnace last year.  The success of the investment programme will dictate the numbers employed in the long term.</P>
    <P>Finally, the strategic importance of this industry should not be underestimated. Waterford Crystal is one of the very few home-grown enterprises to become a world-leading brand.  Without this substantial investment by the company and the State investment approved, the inevitable result would have been the winding down of crystal manufacturing in Ireland with the consequent risk to all 1,500 jobs and major loss to the economy as a whole.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy's question relates to cost per job.</P>
      <P>In the case of Forbairt, IDA Ireland and Shannon Development cost per job is calculated on the basis of relating the total cost of all grants paid over a seven year period to the number of jobs created and still in existence at the end of the period.  Therefore, it is a measurement of cost per job sustained over that period.</P>
      <P>The most recent figures show that the cost per job sustained in Forbairt companies in the period 1988-94 was £9,930 at constant 1994 prices, while that for IDA Ireland companies was £12,786.</P>
      <P>In relation to Shannon Development, the average cost per job sustained (covering the Shannon free zone and Irish industry in the region) for the period 1987-1993 was £13,150 at 1993 prices.</P>
      <P>As county enterprise boards were only established in 1993, clearly cost per job sustained data similar to the main industrial development agencies is not available.  I understand that, based on returns supplied by the 35 county enterprise boards for 1994, their first full year of operation, some 1,776 full time and 263 part time jobs were created by grant assisted projects at a cost of £4,965,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to FÁS, the Deputy will no doubt be aware that the primary focus of its activity is the provision of training and employment scheme opportunities for unemployed persons. FÁS is not involved in direct job <Col N="863" /> creation.  However, through the Community Enterprise Programme, FÁS assists community groups with enterprise proposals through the provision of wage subsidies and other financial assistance. The estimated direct cost per job assisted under the Community Enterprise Programme in 1994 was £8,690 approximately.</P>
    <P>FÁS also provides a comprehensive and integrated advice service to co-operatives and to worker co-operatives in particular.  This service covers training, business/promotion advice and direct financial assistance.  The estimated direct cost per job assisted in 1994 was of the order of £7,980.</P>

      <Quest>the progress, if any, that has been made to prevent foreign registered vessels breaching our fisheries legislation, in particular Spanish operators; the support the Government has given to other countries that experience similar difficulties; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The coming into full operation of the Casa patrol aircraft has vastly improved our fishery surveillance capabilities which in turn has significantly improved the effectiveness of our surface patrols.  It is anticipated that, as further experience is gained in terms of aerial monitoring of vessels, further operational improvements will follow.</P>
      <P>The introduction last year of much tougher penalties (including in certain circumstances, the confiscation of vessels on a first offence) will also have sent a clear signal that we are determined to protect our stocks.</P>
      <P>Work has also begun on the pilot satellite monitoring programme to examine the future role of such technology in the enforcement of fisheries conservation measures.</P>
      <P>The agreement reached in December, 1994 on the terms of Spanish accession, in particular the arrangements regarding access to the Irish box, was a favourable outcome from Ireland's point of view.</P>
      <P>In summary, the agreement ruled out any increase in the number of Spanish vessels entitled to fish within the Irish Box or any increase in fishing effort. The proposed reporting regime will make it considerably more difficult for Spanish vessels to engage in illegal fishing in our waters.  The agreement was supported by member states who recognised the need to ensure that Spanish accession did not lead to a free for all when stocks would rapidly be depleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Liaison with other member states has intensified, not least with the UK, in relation to the activities of the <Col N="869" /> British/Spanish flagships which in 1994 accounted for more than 40 per cent of detentions by the Irish fisheries protection service.</P>

      <Quest>the present condition of the timber bridge to the North Wall at Dollymount, Dublin 3; if he has satisfied himself that the bridge is safe for the heavy volume of motorists and pedestrians using it, particularly in the coming summer months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>I have been advised by Dublin Port and Docks Board that the bridge in question was examined in detail some three years ago and was found at that time to be in sound and safe condition for use by designated traffic &mdash; that is pedestrians and vehicles weighing less than two tonnes.  This weight restriction was put in place within the last four years.</P>
      <P>The board spends over £10,000 annually on the upkeep of the bridge.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made by Dublin Port and Docks Board to ensure that the weight restriction is adhered to.</P>
