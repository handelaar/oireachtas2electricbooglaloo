      <P>The Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill to give effect to the European Convention was completed by the previous Government and ready to be circulated.  When I raised this issue around Christmas time I was informed that it would be circulated &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;. What is its present status and when will it be circulated?  We note that legislation which we thought we would not see until after Easter has appeared overnight.Perhaps this important legislation could also appear.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On assuming office I made it clear that I regarded this legislation as a priority in the interests of the peace process.  I am happy to tell the House that it is at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach give us an assurance that reasonable time will be made available to consider the forthcoming legislation relating to information on abortion, that there will be a reasonable gap between Second and Committee Stages and that the Council for the Status of Women and the Irish Family Planning Association will be consulted to ensure that we have legislation which is both realistic and compassionate?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The timing for taking the different Stages of legislation is best discussed between the Whips.  I suggest the Deputy invite her party's Whip to contact the Minister of State, Deputy Barrett, with a view to discussing that issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Having consulted with my colleague, Deputy Foxe, it appears that no one in the Technical Group was consulted about item No. 3, the motion regarding the parliamentary questions rota.  I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to address this issue which is one of many on which the Technical Group is being frozen out and kept in the dark, where possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach consult with the Irish Family Planning Association about the legislation dealing with freedom of information?  Does he agree that it would be fitting for him or the Minister to consult the agency currently providing the service and that other groups should be fully consulted on such a delicate matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the legislation is at an early stage of <Col N="1461" /> preparation and it is not likely to be presented until the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Government intend to introduce its promised charter for the victims of crime and will that charter contain provision for compensation for pain and suffering?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that matter, in all its respects, does not necessarily require legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It probably will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It therefore would not come within the category of issues to be covered on the Order of Business.  My understanding is that within the meaning of the Standing Orders, no legislation has been promised on that topic. However, as I am always anxious to replenish Deputy O'Dea's files on all these matters, I would be happy to make inquiries and send him a letter which he can put on file.  He can then determine whether he will ask the same question again next week, the week after and the following week.  He seems to have a single transferable question which applies to all situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the second time in two days the Taoiseach has had to write to me in connection with a topic I raised here.  I am happy to update the Taoiseach's knowledge and force him to carry out research on what has been promised by his own Government.</P>

      <P>On Report Stage of the Family Law Bill, the Minister withdrew, <Col N="1462" /> by some 79 amendments, all aspects of nullity in the Bill and promised to bring forward separate legislation covering matters relating to nullity.  When will this legislation come before the House and will it be in advance of the divorce referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House is aware, that legislation is in another House and it would be more appropriate that questions in regard to its progress be raised there.  I understand the matter referred to is receiving active consideration on the part of the Minister and in case the Deputy has any difficulty making contact with his party in the Seanad, I will ask the Minister to communicate with him in detail on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This should not give rise to argument now.  The Deputy has asked his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked a question in relation to the sections which have been removed from the Bill and are not before the Seanad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Separate legislation is promised on the serious matter of nullity.Is that in the course of preparation and will it be published in advance of the divorce referendum?  It is a very straightforward question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding from the Minister is that that legislation will be published but not in advance of the divorce referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally at this time of the year we would be dealing with the Social Welfare Bill but I want to ask the <Col N="1463" /> Taoiseach about the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill which must be passed before we have a divorce referendum. In the normal course of events the Social Welfare Bill takes the best part of a month &mdash; usually March &mdash; to deal with, which means that the Social Welfare (No.2) Bill will not be dealt with until April.  Does that indicate that the Taoiseach intends to deal with that Bill in April which is also the period of the Easter recess?  If that is the case, and with the mounting legislation that must be passed before the divorce referendum, does the Taoiseach intend changing the tentative date of the last Wednesday in May?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Deputy's tentative date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is only fair to say that the date in May was set by the previous Government which, subsequent to setting that date, got itself into some difficulties which led to the termination of its existence.  The new Government is now in a position where it has to review what is possible in light of the situation here.  Obviously, the forwarding of this legislation is important.  It will be brought forward quickly and has been discussed several times at Cabinet.  It is important also to draw attention to the fact that there are certain Supreme Court hearings in regard to the constitutionality of the family law legislation which, I understand, will not be heard until late in the first half of this year. Court listings and matters of this nature are entirely beyond the control of the Government under the separation of powers.  There is little point in saying we will have a referendum on a particular date only to find that the case has not been clarified.  The lesson of the previous referendum was, undoubtedly, that the more issues left unclarified, the greater the tendency of people not to support the proposals.  We will bring forward legislation on the divorce issue as soon as the issues that need to be clarified in advance have been clarified, <Col N="1464" /> some of which are beyond our control such as those before the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for the straight answer he has given, which obviously means that the divorce referendum will not be held until later in the year, if not next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously all work was interrupted as a result of the crisis that occurred in Government over several weeks.  We want to introduce this legislation to provide for divorce at a time when the public have the most information available to them on the matter and can consider it carefully. That is as far as we are prepared to go. I expect it will be held this year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that in the Seanad yesterday the Government accepted Senator Daly's Bill, will the Taoiseach tell us when he will allow the legislation into this House?  Also, will the Minister for Finance bring in a Supplementary Estimate to allow for the proposed work to be done during the current year?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Last evening before Private Members' Business rudely interrupted my contribution I was thanking the people who had played a leading role in getting this discussion document on the table.  I had not thanked the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, or John Hume, both of whom have played a leading role throughout the discussions.In particular John Hume's common sense has never wavered throughout troubled times.  I hope that people writing about grey men in grey suits will not belittle the presentation because in the long run I think it should not matter if people appeared with punk hairstyles and grass skirts.  This is an important document and the seriousness of the presentation reflected its seriousness.  We need to be careful that what we say helps rather than hinders the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the comments by Unionists today are not very encouraging but as somebody else pointed out perhaps it is a negotiating stance and they are arguing the best case they can make.  It is very hard to see how a discussion document can force anybody to do anything against his will.  For everyone's sake I hope this document will lead to serious discussion with everybody sitting down and talking.  It is far better to build bridges than blow them up.  The people have an opportunity to continue living in peace and move freely throughout the North.  With peace all forms of economic activity will advance, in particular tourism.  I have been told that tourism in Belfast has increased by 100 per cent. I think it could increase by 500 per cent if peace continues.  I hope all reasonable <Col N="1468" /> people in the North will take this opportunity to advance the cause of peace.</P>
    <P>It is unbelievable that a great many people in the Twenty-six Counties have not visited the North.  It would be nice to think that we all knew the other part of the country and that people in the North could come South and feel they were among their own.  The reality is that we are an island and as long as we are agreeable to share each other's cares we can get on together.  I hope that anything that is said about the Framework Document will not hinder the advance of peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the Framework Document. The speed at which it was published was important as obviously the change of Government was a hiccup.  People in the North, the South and the United Kingdom will have an opportunity to read the document carefully and come to their own conclusions.  I thank the Taoiseach, and in particular the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, for the work he has done in both administrations, the British Prime Minister, John Major, the members of the Opposition, John Hume, Gerry Adams and many others in Northern Ireland who have made this possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The utterings of the main Unionist parties in the past 24 hours are somewhat disappointing but we realise they must take their people with them.  I too welcome the publication of the Unionist document, A Practical Approach to Problem-Solving in Northern Ireland, and I hope all these papers will be brought to the negotiating table so that the matter is sorted out across the table rather than across the barrel of a gun as in the past.  What has the past 25 years of violence done for us?  More than 3,000 people are dead and many more have died from stress and anxiety.  Once again I sympathise with every family who has suffered traumatic bereavements as a result of the troubles.  Thousands have been maimed and their families will continue to look after them. <Col N="1469" /> With the six months creasefire, people realise what it would be like to live in peace and harmony with one another. We must ensure that nothing is done or said that takes from that.  Ordinary people across the divide yearn for its continuation, as was obvious from their comments on television and radio yesterday.Regardless of where they live or where they come from the vast majority of people want this document to be used as a discussion paper.  It is important to use this document rather than guns and bombs.</P>
    <P>The potential gain from peace cannot be quantified and tourism and agriculture are just two areas where jobs will result.  People, North or South, who have a job will be working for each other rather than using their time for all the wrong reasons.  Farm organisations, women's groups, chambers of commerce and community groups from both sides of the Border have all worked together and discussed their common interests and what they can do for each other.  I was involved in farm organisations for many years through which I met people from all sides of the divide in the North at farm and industry level. We had many things in common and worked together closely.  What I find hard to accept in public life is the difficulties at council and Oireachtas level in sitting down together as official bodies to discuss how money, in particular European Union funds, should be spent to do things for the good of all.  The political groups have said &ldquo;no&rdquo;, yet the commercial groups and chambers of commerce have said &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The document gives us an opportunity to discuss ways and means of rectifying the political situation.The three Northern Ireland MEPs, Dr. Paisley, Mr. Hume and Mr. Nicholson, fine gentlemen in their own spheres, were able to work out how EU funds, which are being given as a direct result of peace and reconciliation on this island, could be spent north of the Border and in the six counties immediately south of <Col N="1470" /> it.  It is interesting that they were prepared to sit down together when money was involved.  I hope they will allow their members at local level to do the same.  It is important that local politicians, for example in Monahgan County Council and Armagh District Council, are involved in discussions on how to use the funds to the best possible advantage through the political system and structures.  I do not see why other groups in Northern Ireland and across the Border should not discuss it together.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise what the documents are about.  They are important, lengthy, detailed documents. The heading on the new Framework Document states it is a shared understanding between the British and Irish Governments to assist discussion and negotiation involving the Northern Ireland parties.  It is not written in stone. Paragraph 4 states:</P>
    <P>A climate of peace enables the process of healing to begin.  It transforms the prospects for political progress, building on that already made in the Talks process.  Everyone now has a role to play in moving irreversibly beyond the failures of the past and creating new relationships capable of perpetuating peace with freedom and justice.</P>
    <P>It is an indication of what can be done and opens up an opportunity for dialogue with the relevant Northern Ireland parties for new institutions and structures to take account of the totality of relationships and enable the people of Ireland to work together in areas of common interest while respecting our diversities.  That is extremely important.</P>
    <P>In his speech yesterday the Taoiseach said that no party will regard this document as meeting its requirements and aspirations.  The document represents balance and compromise.  If its main elements become the basis for new institutions and political arrangements it will ultimately command the widespread support necessary to ensure a fair and effective arrangement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> Peace in my area in the past six months has shown what is possible.  The dispute over closed roads has ended once and for all.  People are able to move about freely in their communities. I recognise the quick response made by the previous Government to reopen and resurface roads in the Border areas.  It is important to use some of the EU funding to make them good permanent structures.  We also need to open up the road of communication through dialogue with community groups and politicians.There is much interest in doing that.  When the Minister for the Environment met his counterpart in Northern Ireland last week he agreed that the N2 should be looked at as a possible means of transport from Dublin to Derry.  During the term of the previous administration that idea was wiped off the map.  I am glad it has resurfaced because traffic on that road has increased by almost 25 per cent and that in the middle of winter and when the peace process has only begun.</P>
    <P>I beg all politicians North and South to read the document.  The people in Northern Ireland demanded this document yesterday.  Supplies in post offices ran out in no time.  Let the politicians read and act on it.  We do not want to go back into our corners.  We heard a little of that on radio this morning when Unionists said they would not move an inch and, unfortunately, some of our politicians said the same &mdash; they had gone thus far and were not prepared to go any further.</P>
    <P>I commend the document and hope it is used in the way it is meant to be used, that is, to improve the lives of those on this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>As Fianna Fáil spokesman on Foreign Affairs I join my Leader, Deputy Ahern, in warmly welcoming the publication yesterday of the Joint Framework Document in Belfast. I applaud the balance between the Irish and British opinion which is in the document <i>vis-à-vis</i> such issues as cross-Border institutions, the role of the EU and <Col N="1472" /> the principle of consent.  It is important, as we approach the next stage of the peace process, to praise those who have been principally involved in getting us this far.  I would like in a special way this morning to say a word of praise for John Hume, for his work, together with Gerry Adams, in initiating the talks process with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds and the British Prime Minister, John Major; for the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, who in 1991 was involved in the beginning of the process; for the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring and the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, for the important roles they played also.  The back-up they received through the years from the Civil Service in the Republic, the North and the UK was important.  One man who has played a very special role in all of this work is Dr. Martin Mansergh.  I put on record my appreciation and recognition of the work he has done.</P>
      <P>At the launch of the document yesterday the British Prime Minister stated that this process went back four years to 1991.  That reference gave me great pleasure because it recalled for me the role I as Minister for Justice, together with my colleague, Deputy Collins, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, played in dealing with the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Brooke. With the approval of the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey and the Government of the day we agreed the three strand process.  The Joint Framework Document published yesterday refers to strands II and III of the process agreed as far back as March 1991.  Its publication is particularly welcome because during the period before its publication it led and would undoubtedly have continued to lead to a series of very damaging leaks similar to that in <i>The Times</i> which set temperatures soaring and could have threatened the advancement of the peace process.  The publication day of the Joint British-Irish Framework Document was an important event, following four years of intergovernmental discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> I will remind Members what was involved in the three strand process and what continues to be involved in it, because the principle of nothing being agreed until everything is agreed remains vital.  The first strand concerned the structures within Northern Ireland and was the subject of discussions between the parties in Northern Ireland and the British Government.  The structures would enable elected representatives in Northern Ireland to exercise shared administrative and legislative control over all those matters that can be agreed across both communities. Yesterday the British Prime Minister published the proposals of his Government in relation to strand I.</P>
    <P>The second strand concerns North-South institutions which would enable representatives of democratic institutions, North and South, to (a) enter into new co-operative and constructive relationships, (b) promote agreement among the peoples of the two islands, (c) carry out on a democratically accountable basis delegated executive harmonising and consultative functions over a range of matters to be agreed and (d) serve to acknowledge and reconcile the rights, identities and aspirations of the two major traditions.</P>
    <P>Finally, the third strand dealt with the east-west structures which were intended to enhance the existing basis for co-operation between the two Governments and help to promote, support and underwrite the fair and effective operation of the new arrangements.</P>
    <P>After the publication of the March 1991 proposals there was a process of negotiation and discussion, followed by the talks at Stormont in 1992 between the British and Irish authorities and the parties in the North which continued until the end of 1992.  After the respective Governments delayed the recommencement of the Anglo-Irish process, the talks were suspended by the Loyalists.In December 1993 we witnessed and welcomed the Joint Downing Street Declaration which, in turn, led to the IRA ceasefire on 31 August 1994 and <Col N="1474" /> the Loyalist creasefire on 13 October 1994.</P>
    <P>The publication of the Joint Framework Document yesterday and today's debate should represent the beginning of a period of negotiation and discussion to ensure that the process which has continued since April 1991 and the ceasefires will give birth to a permanent peace in 1995.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all concerned to carefully study and consider the document published yesterday, there should be discussions by all interested parties involving all strands of opinion and, in my strongly held view &mdash; I have tabled a priority question to the Tánaiste on the issue today &mdash; nobody should be excluded from that talks process.  Sinn Féin and the Loyalists should be involved without preconditions.  I want to emphasise that, of course, the decommissioning of weapons is vital but should not be seen as a precondition to talks.  With almost six months of the peace process behind us it must be recognised that all democratic parties, including Sinn Féin and the Loyalist organisations, must take their place at the table and be involved in the talks process.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Unionist parties, in particular the Official Unionists and the DUP, not to be hypocritical in relation to this issue &mdash; because there is certain element of double - speak on this.  The Unionists and the DUP speak to the Loyalist organisations and the fringe groups within the Loyalist community but their weapons have not been decommissioned.  If they are prepared to talk to their Loyalist representatives they should be prepared to accept the bona fides of Sinn Féin and talk to it. The issue of decommissioning of arms must be tackled, but it should not be a precondition to talks because, if we set preconditions, we will go nowhere in this process.  I am also heartened by the reaction of the smaller Loyalist parties at this stage and that of Sinn Féin to the <Col N="1475" /> document, which has been very considered in its approach, saying it is prepared to read and, consider it and move forward.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Joint Framework Document is open to discussion and amendment.  It is critical that all of us, the people of the North and South, from all sections of all communities, are aware that the document is not a <i>fait accompli</i>.  Its general status should be clear to all concerned and, essentially, should remain intact, but it is essential to state that its detailed contents are open to discussion and amendment. One thing should be borne in mind throughout all the discussions, neither side should turn it into a cherry-picking exercise.  The Joint Framework Document should not be perceived as an <i>a la carte</i> menu, after all it is the result of two years' solid discussion and negotiation and represents the considered views of the respective Governments on the best way forward.  Much emphasis has been placed on the fact that it is not to be considered a blueprint but, surely, it deserves very serious consideration since the best brains on both sides of the Irish Sea, within our respective Civil Service administrations have worked on it carefully over those two years?  That is not to say that there cannot and should not be give and take in all the discussions on this document; I accept that there should &mdash; and will be &mdash; give and take.</P>
    <P>After 25 years of violence in the North &mdash; preceded by 50 years of Unionist control at Stormont, having presided over a sectarian regime so bad it had to be abolished &mdash; it is not unreasonable to say it is time now for the Unionists to agree to something that someone else, in this case the Irish and United Kingdom authorities, advances as their point of view.  I appeal to the Unionist leaders to follow the lead of their own people &mdash; I understand the reaction on the streets and within their communities in the North since the publication of the document yesterday was: &ldquo;We have the peace, we now have the <Col N="1476" /> framework document, let us read it, study it and not say &ldquo;no&rdquo; merely for the sake of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is imperative that we grasp the fact that the minutiae of the document are not cast in stone.  On Tuesday as last minute preparations for the publication of this document fell into place, the Ulster Unionist Party issued its alternative policy document.  As mentioned already, all opinions are to be welcomed.The document has at its core that it does not exclude discussion of other documents.  It is important that the Unionists have not said they will not talk.  It is important that we should encourage them to talk.  On the question of talks and who should talk, our Government has an important role to play as a persuader.</P>
    <P>In the three strand process, the first of the three relationships, strand I within Northern Ireland, culminated with the publication of an internal framework document yesterday morning.  The move now is towards finalising strand II, the relationship between the North and the South.  The areas listed in the document include, among others, agriculture, transport and industrial development. Tourism was omitted, but I am sure that was an oversight.  The importance of the EU aspect of these matters was emphasised.We have common interests and concerns at EU level in agriculture, fisheries and other areas regardless of whether we come from the North or the South.</P>
    <P>It must be emphasised that the strand II process concerns discussions between Northern parties and the Irish Government.The UK Government has no direct role in the strand II process, it is a North-South issue.  It played a vital role in strand I, but the Irish Government was involved in the North-South relationship.  For that reason and because of the framework elements referring to strand II and North-South institutions, the Irish Government should act as a persuader through its contacts with the Unionist and loyalist communities, Sinn Féin and the SDLP <Col N="1477" /> to secure the greatest level of acceptance of this document.</P>
    <P>What happens next following the publication of the document?  The British and Irish Governments should encourage progress.  My party leader yesterday welcomed and applauded the balance in the document.  We are concerned that constitutional changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, changes to section 75 of the Government of Ireland Act and the 1973 British legislation were not published at the same time as the Framework Document.It would be preferable if all those matters were on the table and available for discussion at the same time.  It is important to remember that Fianna Fáil demonstrated vision and courage yesterday by laying out in the speech delivered by our party leader precisely our views on the addendum to Article 2 of our Constitution and the stated recognition of the question of consent in respect of Article 3.  Article 2 states: &ldquo;The national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its island and the territorial seas.&rdquo;  The addendum should state: &ldquo;and is the shared inheritance of all the people of Ireland in their diverse identities and traditions&rdquo;.  It is a pity that was not spelt out yesterday.  On Article 3, we recognise the consent factor while stating our legitimate national objective of a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>There was a total misrepresentation of our position in the editorial of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> this morning.  While the remainder of the media got it right, I strongly suggest that the editorial writer <i>The Cork Examiner</i> should read my leader's speech yesterday.  We are willing to make ourselves available and brief him or her on it.  The article referred to a return to irredentism, but my leader specifically ruled that out in his speech; obviously it was not read by that editorial writer.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document is a very important one advancing the work done since 1991.  At this stage the two Governments must play the role of persuaders.If the Framework Document was merely a document about talks it <Col N="1478" /> could have been published years ago. We all recognise that the Framework Document is a considered view as to the best way forward and the two Governments must stand over that view.  The ideas in the document are workable, not exclusive of any other thoughts and are worthy of serious consideration and agreement.  From all sides, North and South, we must discuss, promote and sell the concept and the benefits to be gained from peace to those who have been so far reluctant to discuss the document and the way forward.  I encourage all on the two islands to start the process of talks.</P>

      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this important debate, a significant element in the ongoing peace process.  I welcome the publication of this historic document.It will make an enormous contribution to the establishment of lasting peace.  The last six months have shown that the majority of decent people north and south of the Border want the ceasefires to be copperfastened into a just and lasting peace.  The document published yesterday is first and foremost a consultative discussion paper.  It clearly states that there will be no joint authority by the Irish and British Governments over Northern Ireland.  The proposals will not predetermine any outcome of the talks process.  No section of the community in Northern Ireland will be coerced into a new political situation.The document is based on consent and the process can only succeed if that concensus is upheld.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the co-ordinator of the Labour Party's delegation to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, I understand the most successful method of achieving any type of success is through dialogue. <Col N="1479" /> The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, in existence since last October, illustrates that progress can only be achieved when all parties enter into meaningful negotiations and discussions.I hope the Framework Document will stimulate widespread discussion and public debate throughout the length and breadth of this island.  I urge all those who have an interest in this process to read the document in a calm and measured frame of mind. When the document has been read and digested, I believe it will draw all political parties in Northern Ireland to the negotiating table as a just and lasting settlement can only be achieved when all parties enter into genuine and meaningful talks.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Labour Party will continue to play a full and complete role in the ongoing peace process which is now entering a new and crucial phase.  Labour is committed to establishing a just and lasting peace which recognises the rights of all people on this island.</P>
    <P>During the past two years we witnessed dramatic changes which many of us would not have countenanced in our wildest dreams.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to my party leader, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, who during the past ten years has made an enormous contribution towards the achievement of lasting peace on this island.  He played a major role in the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Downing Street Declaration and, of course, the Framework Document.  It would be remiss of me not to mention the contribution made by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, and my constituency colleague, the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, who also in their efforts helped to bring about this hopeful chapter in Irish history.</P>
    <P>The Irish and British Governments have met the challenge and they are at one on the need to establish a lasting peace in Northern Ireland.  I commend both Governments for the efforts and <Col N="1480" /> work they have invested.  The challenge has now been firmly placed with all the politicians on this island but, in particular, with the politicians of Northern Ireland.  It is the responsibility of all of us to ensure that no vacuum is allowed during this crucial time.  I shudder to think that we could return to the bad old days &mdash; even though it is only six months ago &mdash; where political stagnation was the so-called norm.  This vacuum could only lead to a return to violence and more misery for the families in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government, for its part, has signalled that Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution are not written in stone.  I believe this will go some way towards alleviating the fears of people from the Unionist community.  The Government has said it will bring forward changes to these Articles as part of an overall agreement.  The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Sir Patrick Mayhew, clearly acknowledged that last night. Likewise, the British Government has stated that it has no selfish, strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland. This statement will offer a certain degree of hope to the vast majority of the people in the Nationalist community who aspire to a united Ireland.  The British Government has also said it will bring forward the necessary legislation to put this aspiration into law.  Such legislation could only be brought forward by the British Government on the basis that the majority of people in Northern Ireland are in favour of such a change.</P>
    <P>So far some of the reaction to the Framework Document has been very positive.  As Deputy Burke stated, I also have been heartened with the initial response of the Progressive Unionist Party, the Ulster Democratic Party and Sinn Féin.  All these political parties said they are prepared to read and consider the document in its entirely, before making any judgment on it.  It should be noted that these same groups have been to the forefront of the conflict during the past 25 years.  If they are prepared to examine the document I cannot <Col N="1481" /> understand why the mainstream Unionist parties cannot approach the Framework Document in the same manner and, indeed, desist from using emotive language such as &ldquo;Ulster is on a war footing&rdquo;.  The ordinary people of Northern Ireland have had enough bloodshed and hurt and they want no more of it.</P>
    <P>I firmly believe the Framework Document will be the bridge to the next stage of this delicate process.  I want to see the community rebuild itself in the context of a lasting and just peace which respects the rights and wishes of all the people on this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with my colleague Deputy Pat Gallagher and me.  As one who has lived and worked on the Border for the past 50 years and as one who worked in Northern Ireland as a senior union official of the largest trade union in the country I consider this to be a joyous occasion.  At last we have been able to produce a document which should be examined seriously and conscientiously. Even extremists on both sides of the community in Northern Ireland have to accept it is well thought out and deserves all our gratitude.  In that context I pay tribute to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, who made an enormous contribution to getting the peace process on the road and also to Mr. Hume and my colleague and party leader, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring.  Effectively, the latter was the link between the two Governments as he was involved in both the discussions of the previous Government and this Government.I also pay tribute to the Taoiseach who took over at a very difficult time when the negotiations were at a delicate stage and who has shown courage and initiative in a quite but positive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those of us who have lived and worked on the Border will know the damage that has been done in the Border areas due to the conflict of the past 25 years.  Unemployment levels were out of all proportions.  This is one of the largest unemployment blackspots in the <Col N="1482" /> country, much of which is due directly to the violence in Northern Ireland. There were differences in taxation, VAT and so on but the violence did not encourage people and foreign industrialists to come to the Border areas.  In fact it gave every encouragement to some foreign industrialists to move away from the Border areas and from my own county in particular.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that if the peace process continues and we finally succeed in reaching an agreement which is acceptable to both communities in Northern Ireland, and by agreement with the Irish Government, we can create 50,000 to 60,000 additional jobs in the Border region.  Every opportunity is being given to the local authorities, trade and industry by the USA, Canada, Australia and the EU.  Plenty of money is available to create employment and to improve and restructure what has been destroyed in the Border areas but it can only be done through the peace process. Those moneys will not be available if violence recommences.</P>
    <P>We have to take into account the huge cost of Garda and military involvement to Irish and UK taxpayers.  That money could best be used to improve social welfare, to assist in further job creation and to repair county roads and so on.  The Garda, which have for the past 25 years been engaged in cross-Border activity, could be redeployed in urban and rural areas throughout the country where crime has increased substantially.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the media last night and this morning one would think there was only one side to this document.At one stage I had the impression that I was reading the wrong document with the result that I had to read it again.  Spokespersons for some sections of the communities in Northern Ireland certainly must be reading a different document.  There is no doubt that some of the guarantees in the document would not have been acceptable in the Republic 25 years ago.  Both sides have had to move, and will possibly have to <Col N="1483" /> move further to achieve permanent peace.</P>
    <P>As a trade union member, I attended meetings in Unionist areas, in companies where 95 per cent of the workforce were Unionists, people who, on a daily basis, had the Union Jack displayed in the workplace and on their machines. However, I always found there was a common bond, the trade union movement which set the example for a 32 county arrangement.  Such an arrangement exists in the ICTU, and unions North and South work in harmony irrespective of a person's religion or beliefs. That example also exists in rugby and boxing, a sport in which I was involved. There was never a problem with boxers from the South fighting in the King's Hall in Belfast and boxers from the North fighting in the National Stadium in Dublin.  Similarly, there was no problem with Northern rugby players playing in Landsdowne Road and elsewhere in the Republic.  There are many fine examples of successful co-operation between North and South and perhaps some of our Unionist friends in Northern Ireland will follow the example of boxers, rugby players and trade unionists.</P>
    <P>I am involved, as are some of my colleagues, in many cross-Border organisations.For many years we have been co-operating in trying to build better infrastructure, roads, sewerage, water and other activities along the Border.  We now have two choices: to go down the road of peace or to go back down the road of violence, I hope we will choose the road of peace.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I thank my colleagues, Deputies Fitzgerald and Bell, for sharing their time with me.  I spoke previously in a debate on Northern Ireland and at that time, as a person who does not live in a Border area, I expressed a reluctance to get into the deeper and finer political issues.  In my work before I became a Member of this House I had much contact with groups in the community and voluntary <Col N="1484" /> sectors, not only in the Republic but in areas around Belfast.  I pay tribute to the many groups and organisations in that sector which down the years, even in the worst days of the troubles, fostered co-operation and contact between ordinary people, north and south of the Border.</P>
      <P>Well deserved tributes have been paid to political leaders from many parties on this island, in Britain and even overseas, who helped us get to the stage of publishing the Joint Declaration and the Framework Document.  I pay tribute to the ordinary men and women who kept the contacts open during the years at community level and in voluntary and sporting organisations.  Regardless of the progress made by political leaders and the agreements at political or intergovernmental level, unless there is understanding among the people at ground level, no solution will work.</P>
      <P>The fact that the views of ordinary people in Northern Ireland are being considered is due in no small way to the contacts that have been built up throughout the years.  Groups and individuals had an opportunity through the Opsahl Commission to record their views on the future of Northern Ireland. Many organisations have been assisted through Co-operation North and the International Fund for Ireland.  Deputy Bell mentioned the work done by the trade union movement in fostering co-operation, North and South, and dealing with issues on a common basis.  Many business and economic organisations in trade, industry, agriculture, tourism and fisheries have shown that common interest can be identified and worked on.  This is an area that can grow organically, where people can learn over a period of time to recognise their common interests and take action, whether within this island, between Ireland and Britain or in the European forum.  I appeal to both Governments to continue to do everything possible to foster growth and co-operation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Governments in the Republic and Britain have committed budgetary funds over a period of years to assist this <Col N="1485" /> process.  Governments in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have also given support by way of funding.  I appeal to all these Governments to continue their support and foster co-operation so that, as well as progress being made at political and intergovernmental level, ordinary people can learn to live and work together and further their common interests through co-operation and mutual understanding.</P>

      <P>I welcome the publication of the Framework Document which is long overdue.  While I concur with many of the remarks of other speakers about the various people who have had an input to this process, it should be acknowledged that many unsung heroes were involved in the peace process down the years.  From time to time we find it difficult to mention Gerry Adams, Mitchell McLoughlin and Pat Doherty of Sinn Féin and Father Alex Reid from Clonard Monastery who was one of the main movers in the process.  Tributes should be paid to them and to people such as Reverend Roy McGee, Billy Hutchinson and David Ervine who have taken incredible risks in the cause of peace.  Without their input we would not have reached the stage where we have had six months of peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only people such as myself and Deputy Bell who live in Border counties who realise the incredible significance of peace to the people not only on the northern side of the Border but also south of the Border.  I have always lived within sight of the Mourne Mountains and it is incredible that for the last six months people on the other side of the water from my house are living in peace. Previously there were daily explosions and shootings within earshot of my home, but that has now stopped.  We <Col N="1486" /> have moved on as a result of the efforts not only of politicians and high profile people but also ordinary people.</P>
    <P>In the last couple of hours Fianna Fáil has been accused in certain circles of being irredentist.  That flies in the face of what our Leader has clarified on a number of occasions in recent weeks, that irredentism is dead; long may that continue to be the case.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent, those who criticise us have failed to realise and accept the incredible contribution made by Fianna Fáil to the process.  Events would not have reached this stage without the efforts of former Taoisigh, Deputy Albert Reynolds, Charlie Haughey and the Fianna Fáil Party generally.Fianna Fáil has not been given enough credit for the way in which its ideas and aspirations have evolved and for the way in which it has set about achieving them.  There was a time when some members of Fianna Fáil, other parties and the general public would have said it should not be left to the people of the Six Counties to decide the constitutional situation on the island, that one person's consent is another person's veto and this is one of the key issues which has dogged the process. Fianna Fáil has shown that it has no problem with the principle of consent being built into the Constitution. However, this does not mean that someone can keep saying &ldquo;no&rdquo; to progress. This is one of the areas on which people have held the line.  While we agree with the need for consent, it should not be applied in such a way that people can continue to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Unlike some members of my party at the time, I supported the Anglo-Irish Agreement, not necessarily because of what it contained but because it was the first time a British Government &mdash; I pay tribute to Mrs. Thatcher in this regard &mdash; told Unionists they could not say &ldquo;no&rdquo; all the time.  I welcomed that change of attitude by the British Government.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that there will be some sort of settlement.  Ordinary citizens, particularly those who lived with violence, will do anything to maintain <Col N="1487" /> peace.  However, this is not to say that we should reject our ideals.  People may castigate my party but the reality is that Fianna Fáil's input to the process is very important.  It was the main architect of all the political developments and it responded to the mood of ordinary people.  It has an extremely important role to play in any future developments and the Government must bear this in mind.</P>
    <P>Like my constituency colleague, Deputy Bell, I look forward to the establishment of cross-Border bodies. However, while everything may be fine on paper &mdash; Fianna Fáil was one of the architects of the document &mdash; overcoming the bureaucracy in Departments is another matter.  I have had much experience of this during my time as a councillor and Deputy.  While politicians may be in favour of co-operation, if the will is not there within Departments then it will not happen.  This is an obstacle we must get over.  I hope the cross-Border bodies are successful.  The need for such bodies was shown recently by the fishermen in Kilkeel who have their opinion on how the country should be governed and who were adamant that there should be co-operation in the fishing industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Framework Document which represents not only the culmination of two years work but the culmination of many years of painstaking work between both Governments and the various parties and personalities in the North.  I compliment all those involved in the process, particularly the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, who made a significant policy judgment that the peace process should be accelerated in parallel with or in advance of the talks process. He took this key strategic decision in the knowledge that peace would transform the climate for talks and the building of political institutions which would consolidate a political settlement.  He <Col N="1488" /> was on his own for much of that journey.Given his traits, he was the right man in the right place at the right time.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the emphasis on a North-South body with executive powers.  While much of what is contained in the document will take some time to bring to fruition, there is much we can do now to build bridges between the North and South.  One of the great tragedies of this conflict is that there are not enough exchanges between the North and South.  More politicians should travel North to meet people with differing political views.  Recently Deputy Dermot Ahern, I and other Deputies met a number of Unionist politicians.  We were put into one room and told to write on the blackboard our spontaneous views of Unionism and loyalism.Deputy Enda Kenny said we would not last too long when they saw what we had written.  Likewise our Unionist colleagues were writing their views of us on a blackboard in another room.  Afterwards we discussed the myths and misconceptions which had been created about each group, and managed to correct some of these.  The lesson I learned from that visit is that we need more of these exchanges in order to break down barriers and create a new understanding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Governments should set up a special fund to assist exchanges not only on a political level but also on a community, voluntary, sporting and cultural level.  For the past 25 years the Between organisation in Cork under the leadership of Criostóir De Baróid has organised holidays in Cork for loyalist and Nationalist children, from working-class areas of Belfast, some of whose parents are in prison.  Thankfully the Department of Foreign Affairs has consistently supported that initiative. It has come under attack from time to time and has been undermined by certain establishment figures in the British Government and, unfortunately, the European Commission.I wish to express my support for it.  It is important to recognise an organisation such as Between that has <Col N="1489" /> soldiered on for many years doing its best to assist people in the areas of conflict and build bridges.  People from different communities were together in Cork summer after summer.  Co-operation North has also been doing extremely good work.</P>
    <P>In almost every local authority in the country there are committees to twin with cities and towns in Europe to foster understanding.  Why not have twinning committees to deal with the North, without prejudice to constitutional or political issues?  We need to be proactive in helping schools and sporting clubs to travel North and to support exchange visits.  The only way to build true harmony, peace and unity is through people getting to know each other more and being happy in each other's company, thus getting rid of the myths and misunderstandings.</P>
    <P>Education offers particular opportunities, especially within the broader European context.  Schemes such as the Socrates programme which facilitates exchanges in higher education and secondary schools should be used.  The Commenius strand of the Socrates programme offers particular opportunities for exchanges involving young people. The community employment initiatives such as Youthstart, Horizon, which deals with the disabled and disadvantaged, and the NOW programme all provide opportunities for funding and assisting exchanges between communities North and South.  I urge the Government to promote that.  A fund should be set up immediately by both Governments to fund groups to be proactive in this regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support all the views expressed.  We live in extraordinarily historic times.  The Framework Document produced by the British and Irish Governments is one of the most significant documents ever produced between two sovereign governments.  Its impact could be extraordinary if all those who can be a party to discussions take up the challenge which has now emerged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks back over the years <Col N="1490" /> we can see how far we have come.  If people in Bosnia, Israel, Palestine or wherever there is conflict were at the point we are now at and had a document of such magnitude, I wonder how they would feel or what they would give to have available real and serious discussion documents.</P>
    <P>I want to address my remarks in particular to the strand one framework produced by the British Government.  I want to say to a new generation of politicians that they have a right to lead their people.  They have a right to have their own assembly or parliament.  This island needs a new generation of active, vibrant and committed people who will enter public life.  That opportunity, in the widest context, is now being presented to those in Northern Ireland on all sides of the community.  While many leaders there who have been involved for many years and have brought the process to its present point will have a role to play, the possibility of an assembly of 90 members necessitates substantive young figures being available in all parties, representing all shades of political opinion, who should take up the challenge.  They should not be smothered by those who have led and who would seek now to prevent the process moving forward on the basis of the Framework Document. They have a right to lead their people, a right to be involved in public life.  They have a right to have a voice on a wide range of issues &mdash; economic development, education, health &mdash; to take up those challenges and to play a part in what can be a tremendously dynamic future for this island and, in particular, for those in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I think of people like Gary McMichael who at least has the capacity to stand back and not make knee-jerk judgments or give instant reactions.  He comes from a section of the community that has suffered greatly and I can compare it to Gerry Adams's community on the other side.  It is interesting that those who have come from the deepest roots of violence are those who are now most realistic and honourable in demanding <Col N="1491" /> of themselves and those whom they seek to lead that dialogue and discussion and all the other challenges be given an opportunity they have not been given in the past.</P>
    <P>I echo what my colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, said about the contribution of this party to what has happened over the years.  In joining this great party one of the key elements in my decision was that I had been saying we needed somebody to emerge who could grapple with the problem.  That happened.  I saw that this party was not looking backwards but had the intent, vision and ability to look to the future and make a contribution.  It has done so and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>A Russian who sought asylum in America but never forgot his own country said, &ldquo;Let man's petty nations tear themselves apart, my land's only borders lie around my heart&rdquo;.  In many ways that can signify the point we are at.  I use those words to appeal to all not to look at land borders but to look to themselves and their own abilities and drive for the great challenge and opportunity that now faces us all.</P>

      <P>I join with other speakers in welcoming the Framework Document for peace in Northern Ireland.  It is extremely important and welcome. For the last number of years I have represented the people of Cavan and Monaghan at national and local level.  We have lived in the Border region in the shadow of the violence of Northern Ireland and we are fully aware of it.  The consequence of rejecting this framework is a return to the violence of the last 25 years and nobody wants that. Peace and the freedom for people to go about their business is something that <Col N="1492" /> people want to keep and will keep if they are allowed.</P>
      <P>It behoves all of us to play our part and to be constructive and encouraging. Comments and remarks made off the top of the head will not be good enough &mdash;&ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; or &ldquo;not enough&rdquo; will not do.  The people will not have it. Speakers here talk of the &ldquo;ordinary people on the ground&rdquo; and I understand the context in which that is meant. However, we are all ordinary people. We are not extraordinary because we are elected here.  None of us has a solution to any problem, but by putting our point of view we can encourage debate and bring about solutions.</P>
      <P>The solution to the problem of Northern Ireland is within our grasp but it will take time.  It will not happen in the next month, six months or 12 months, or indeed the next year or five years, but we can work towards common ground and a common bond.  I am convinced of that.  I am prepared to say that peace will last because the people want it to.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Martin who made relevant comments about the interaction of people North and South, which has never been more important.  There are misconceptions and as a public representative, I could count on one hand the number of times I have been in Northern Ireland in the past ten years, but since the ceasefire, I have been there on many occasions &mdash; to Lisnaskea, Enniskillen, Armagh and Derry, which I have not visited for many years.  I am, however, no different from my friends and neighbours in County Cavan, the Border regions and elsewhere.We stayed away from Northern Ireland because we were afraid we would be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  That is no longer the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People can move freely across the Border to Northern Ireland and <i>vice versa</i>.  We must also encourage people from Northern Ireland to come to the South.  That is something which is gathering momentum each day.  There is an establishment in my native village of Butlersbridge where people stop to <Col N="1493" /> break their journey when travelling to and from the North.  There has been a significant increase in the number of Northern Ireland registered cars stopping there.</P>
    <P>When I was a young man 20 to 25 years ago Protestant and Catholic neighbours lived and worked together &mdash; as they still do &mdash; and when there was a ceremony, a Protestant wedding, for example, Catholic neighbours who were invited went to the hotel, but not to the church.  In the case of a Protestant funeral, Catholics went to the church, but did not go inside.  The same was the case with Catholic weddings and funerals.  That barrier was broken down in the 1960s by two clergymen, our administrator, Fr. Gargan, and Canon George Miller, the Rector of the Protestant church in Cavan, who is still hail and hearty.  They saw the futility of neighbours standing outside each other's churches and decided it was not good enough.  They encouraged people to enter each other's churches.  Now we attend functions organised by the various churches for the upkeep and repair of Catholic and Protestant churches. Both communities rightly support the upkeep of those churches.  What is happening in counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal could also happen in Fermanagh, Armagh, Derry, Down and Antrim.  The same barriers exist in Northern Ireland between Protestants and Catholics or what we refer to as Unionists and Nationalists.  Misunderstandings result in fear and it is only when people come together to mix, understand each other and show there is no need for fear that we can work together and built a better country.  That will only happen if there is interaction and that is why I support Deputy Martin.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985 brought major benefits to the North and Border regions.  The by-product of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the International Fund for Ireland, brought about major improvements that generated activity which created jobs and <Col N="1494" /> wealth.  The by-product of this agreement can bring continued peace and prosperity.  That is what we are striving for.  If we work together, we can achieve that.  I hope there will be a fair distribution of further funding in the Border regions.  Members may say Deputy Boylan is being parochial, as usual, but I represent people who have suffered as a result of violence because we have lived in its shadow.  We seek a fair share of the £80 million earmarked under the Delors package and whatever else is allocated.  It must be additional to existing funding, not a substitute for it. People can be assured that that finance will be put to good use to rebuild the corridor from Donegal to Louth which has been devastated because of a fall in business and commercial activity due to the troubles.  Unless we are given a fair share of the funding, a corridor of poverty will be created which will result in further problems.  We should not allow that to happen.  I welcome this document which represents a golden opportunity which will be grasped by the people if politicians, North and South, have the courage to lead them to implement this agreement so we can live and prosper and develop this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Tá an-áthas orm an seans seo a beith agam chun cúpla focal a rá sa díospóireacht tábhachtach seo.  I join with colleagues in welcoming the publication of the document and in congratulating those who played a part in putting it together over the past two years.  I acknowledge the contribution by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, and the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, and I know the House will forgive me if I pay particular attention to the contribution made by my party leader, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some ways the Labour Party is in an almost unique position in this House and, indeed, on this island in the contribution it can make to the resolution of the problems in Northern Ireland.  It is a party which has no genesis in the problems of this island &mdash; it played no <Col N="1495" /> part in the Civil War and has not attempted to define its political priorities in terms of wrapping flags around it.  It is a party which has defined its political priorities in the welfare of individuals &mdash; people as people, irrespective of their religion or national identity.  That has been a source of strength to the Tánaiste and the Labour Party in the contribution it has been able to make.  I would not attempt to suggest that it is the only party in that position or that the Tánaiste is the only political leader in that position.</P>
    <P>It was not before time that the document was published. It was a pity it was delayed by circumstances which were nobody's fault.  The delay created fears which were entirely unjustified.  Some fears among the Unionist population were deliberately stoked up not least by the premature publication of part of the document a few weeks ago and the editorial spin put on that leak by <i>The Times</i>.  We must see the unfortunate reaction of some Unionist leaders partly in that context.  Nonetheless, I am disappointed that Unionist leaders reacted the way they did.</P>
    <P>The Unionist population &mdash; I must be careful how I say this &mdash; has not always been well served by its leaders or had the leaders it deserves.  This is a time when it needs good leadership.  The Unionist and Protestant people of Northern Ireland are a proud people with a proud tradition and have a good case to make.  It is time for them to make that case but they cannot do so by simply uttering the word &ldquo;no&rdquo; time and again.  Some politicians in Northern Ireland believe the word &ldquo;no&rdquo; is a sufficient policy.  It is clear that it is not.</P>
    <P>The Unionist people have seen the benefits &mdash; as we all have &mdash; of peace over recent months.  It is a benefit which is clear to anybody who visits Belfast or other centres in Northern Ireland.  This is an opportunity we cannot easily let go, one which people in Northern Ireland will demand that politicians grasp.  The people of Northern Ireland will demand that politicians address the <Col N="1496" /> issues involved, make their case in negotiations and do not simply say &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  In that context I welcome the publication this week of the Unionist document as their contribution to be considered during the talks and negotiations that will take place in the next few months.</P>
    <P>There is consensus that the way forward is based on the three strand talks process.  In relation to strand one &mdash; internal structures within Northern Ireland &mdash; there appears to be something approaching consensus among the parties on the basic principle that institutions must be such that all or the greater number of people in Northern Ireland should be able to identify with them.  Institutions in themselves are not sufficient.  There will have to be changes in other important aspects of life, such as economic and social development.  In working class areas which have been touched by the troubles people do not identify with any institutions of State. They consider they have been alienated by local government and the State.  That matter needs to be addressed by providing economic assistance for these areas.</P>
    <P>The question of policing has to be addressed.  In Lansdowne Road last week firm action was taken by the Garda which meted out harsh treatment to English thugs who were misbehaving. There has been little criticism of the treatment meted out on that occasion for the simple reason that we felt this was merited and it was our police force that was involved.  They act with our licence, agreement and consent.  Sadly, this is not the case in Northern Ireland where significant sections of the population do not identify with the RUC or see it as their police force and are therefore not willing to give it their consent in conducting normal policing work.  We need to make progress on this issue.</P>
    <P>The issue of the protection of rights, including the rights of minorities, is dealt with at some length in the document.I welcome the commitment to provide for a covenant which will set out the rights that attach to each and every individual in Northern Ireland. The document sets out these civil rights <Col N="1497" /> and states that the same rights would attach to any minority on this island even in the context of a changed political or constitutional framework, for example, a united Ireland.</P>
    <P>On constitutional issues there are two important concepts, the first of which is the concept of balance.  The British Government has agreed to return sovereignty to the people of Northern Ireland and to amend the Government of Ireland Act.  In turn, we will seek to implement what is set out in the Downing Street Joint Declaration which states essentially that we have no territorial claim of right.  This is an important shift from the concept of the nation based on territory to one based on people.  We have seen just how far definitions based on territory have got us in the Europe of the 1990s; we do not have to look further than Bosnia and Eastern Europe to see painful and bloody examples.  We must move to a concept of the nation based on people and acknowledge the right of individuals to their identity and traditions.</P>

      <P>I thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to speak in this debate.  Paul Arthur, professor of politics at the University of Ulster, summed up the position in Northern Ireland recently when he said, &ldquo;If there was ever an example of political ambiguity, Northern Ireland stands as the supreme visual aid&rdquo;.  As the problem is complex the solution must also be complex.  The Framework Document published yesterday will form part of the solution and the process leading to it.  There is no quick fix.  Infinite patience will be required on the part of all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reaction of the Unionists was predictable.  It will take them some time to come to terms with the principles outlined in the Framework Document.  I was worried about the reaction of Fianna Fáil yesterday, in particular the concluding comments of Deputy Ahern. He should not draw a line in the sand in relation to constitutional change.  We <Col N="1498" /> had our troubles in the past with document No. 2.  The right approach is to set out the underlying principles and to discuss how best we can give these effect in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Archbishop Eames who has played an outstanding role in Northern Ireland in recent years was calm and balanced in his comments today when he said that the Framework Document represents a genuine effort to find a balance.  This gives us cause for hope.  This is indicative of the leadership he has been providing.I urge everyone on this island to adopt a similarly calm approach, to study the document and in due course to give a reasoned and balanced response.  If we do this we will find that the Framework Document forms part of the solution and that we can all contribute in bringing the process to finality.</P>
    <P>As well as asking people to study the Framework Document and the document produced by the British Prime Minister dealing with internal structures we should commit ourselves to studying carefully the documents produced by the Unionist parties.  We should be prepared to discuss them all together.</P>

      <P>The purpose of the Framework Document and the accompanying document published by the British Government is to establish a new dispensation in which peaceful political, social and economic development can proceed on a democratic basis.  As a result of the cessation of hostilities by the paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland we can use these two documents as a basis of discussion and negotiation leading to a final agreed settlement between all the parties involved and the two Governments.  It is important to emphasise that there is no blueprint which will be imposed on anyone; rather we should proceed on the basis of discussion and negotiation.  I appeal to all <Col N="1499" /> the parties involved, in particular the Unionists, to consider the matter in that context.</P>
      <P>The document is based on the concept of the totality of relationships &mdash; the relationship between this country and Britain, the relationships within Northern Ireland and the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  I was present in 1980 when the then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and the then British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, first established this concept.  This document marks the culmination of that process.  We must consider all aspects of the problems in Northern Ireland and on the island as a whole in that context.  This is as valid now as it was in 1980.</P>
      <P>The two elements on which we can achieve success in reaching a peaceful settlement and permanence for the totality of relationships are the principle of concurrent self-determination and the principle of consent in regard to the majority of people in Northern Ireland. Self-determination on the part of the people, North and South, can be expressed in their decision after democratic agreement is reached by both Governments and all the parties in Northern Ireland.  That expression of self-determination will incorporate the principle of consent as regards the majority in Northern Ireland who will have to consent to the agreed peaceful arrangement for the future.  That is elementary and it carries the provision of support for all traditions on this island, North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An important aspect in this is the concept agreed between the two Governments with regard to the sovereignty of the people.  In Britain, there was a traditional territorial concept of sovereignty which grew out of the old rights of the monarchy in Britain.  That concept of sovereignty has been outdated, as far as Britain and Ireland are concerned, since we joined the European Community together in 1973.  For the past 20 years the two Governments have shared sovereignty with other European countries <Col N="1500" /> within the European Union.  This concept of the sovereignty of the people underlines the constitutional basis of this agreement.</P>
    <P>The British Government is committed to the repeal of section 75 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  Side by side with that our Constitution which, in this respect, was well ahead of its time in emphasising people sovereignty, refers to the people of Ireland. Articles 1, 2 and 3 deal with the Irish nation.  Article 1 states: &ldquo;The Irish nation hereby affirms its inalienable, indefeasible, and sovereign right to choose its own form of Government ...&rdquo;.  Article 2 states that the national territory of that Irish nation consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas.  That should not be interfered with in any way and does not take from the right of concurrent decision by the people of Ireland, North and South, because we are talking about two different jurisdictions, a Northern Ireland jurisdiction and the jurisdiction in the Republic. That does not take from our right to state, in an article of our Constitution, what the Irish nation consists of.  We regard the Irish nation as the people of Ireland and the people of Ireland have a right to express, in concurrent referenda, their approval or otherwise of the peaceful settlement that is reached.</P>
    <P>For the first time in its relationship with this island, the British Government has decided that the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, represents an oldfashioned version of sovereignty dating back to the times of the monarchy.  It is now willing to delete its sovereign claim to control of Northern Ireland from the Government of Ireland Act, 1920.  That is vitally important.  With the elimination of the British Government's sovereign claim to Northern Ireland and our right to claim sovereignty in Northern Ireland, the two Governments are entering a new relationship in which they both acknowledge the Irish nation as one composed of people with diverse traditions.  That is acknowledged in the proposed addendum to Article 2, which <Col N="1501" /> was the position when we left office last December.  I cannot understand why we do not reiterate that basic tenet which is favourable towards the acceptance of the package as a whole.</P>
    <P>When we left office in December last year &mdash; I understand this is still the position although the Taoiseach appears to be coy about stating it &mdash; the position was that Article 2 would remain as it is. It is important to say that because there is little point in getting into a sterile debate on it or on its wording.  If it is acknowledged that Article 2 should remain as it is, that the national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas and relating to the Irish nation referred to in Article 1, that is an acceptable proposition to both Governments.  That has been acknowledged but for some reason the Taoiseach is reluctant to say that; he is being coy about the matter.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is an addendum to that which emphasises the people involved.  The addendum makes clear &mdash; and I quote exactly what was agreed in December, which I understand remains the agreed position &mdash; that in addition to the national territory consisting of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas, &ldquo;It is the shared inheritance of all the people of Ireland in their diverse identities and traditions&rdquo;.That is making our definition of &ldquo;nation&rdquo; a pluralist one.  It is a perfectly acceptable proposition and does not, in any way, frustrate the right of people of another tradition within Northern Ireland to decide their position if the principle of consent is written into the Constitution, which it is proposed to do and which we believe gives a balanced constitutional accommodation to the whole matter.  In addition to the principle of self-determination on the part of the people North and South, the principle of consent will be clearly written into Article 3.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the Taoiseach's coyness in this regard.  Deputy Bertie Ahern raised this matter yesterday but no satisfactory response emerged.  The reason I place such emphasis on it is <Col N="1502" /> that I do not want commentators here, North and South, and in Britain to enter a futile debate on this particular matter. Let us clarify the matter now and move on to the important aspects of the totality of relationships that are included in the remainder of the two documents. The British document is primarily concerned with the important aspects of the new Administration in Northern Ireland which will be run on a partnership basis with a sharing of responsibilities between the two traditions.  It is obvious we cannot go back to the old, crude majoritarian system which caused the downfall of Stormont, that is agreed by everybody.</P>
    <P>Power sharing can emerge and has proved a practical proposition in South Africa, for example, where it is the fundamental principle underlying the Government of Mandela and de Klerk. I will not dwell on the British document. Agreement can be reached on specific powers, the system of election, allocation of responsibilities and so on as long as it is done on the basis of parity.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document also deals with the question of North-South institutions which will operate in the framework of a North-South body with certain political, social, economic objectives that are agreed between all parties North and South as suitable for co-operation.  Much play has been made of this by certain Unionist critics but if they stand back and look at it sanely they will see it is only common sense.  I hope that common sense will be an increasing ingredient in all discussions and negotiations on this matter and that we will get away from megaphone diplomacy and other factors of verbal conflict that have bedevilled relationships in Northern Ireland and between Northern Ireland and ourselves.  It was the realisation that they were in a verbal cul-de-sac that led the people towards the imperative of peace and brought the paramilitaries to declare ceasefires last autumn.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in North-South institutions and common areas of action particularly in the social and economic <Col N="1503" /> fields.  People, such as representatives of the loyalist working class in Belfast, who experience serious problems on the ground, see the benefits of this and have been most forthright in supporting it.  It is heartening that those at the coalface realise that the problems facing the working class people on the Falls Road, on the Shankill Road, in east and west Belfast are precisely the same and can be dealt with by joint executive action to further development and by joint authorities that will help to remove deprivation in Belfast and Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is important that there will be a permanent intergovernmental conference established between the London and Dublin Governments to supervise and underwrite the situation.  That is a very desirable guarantee and is in accordance with the spirit of the totality of relationships.  All of this will be done in the context of the European Union in which Ireland, North and South, and Britain have many mutual interests.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Lenihan for sharing time with me.  I welcome the Framework Document and wish it well. I would be surprised if all the political parties do not sit down together and discuss their principles and beliefs.  This is a discussion document so nobody should have any fears.  The one certainty is that all people want peace to continue and it is important to build on that.  I hope the British Government will lead the way in helping to achieve a permanent peace.</P>
      <P>These discussion talks will be difficult, we should agree to differ but work together where there is agreement for the common good of all and for a permanent peace.  I hope the people of Northern Ireland will be clearly advised before the referendum, as that is the people's choice.  It is my wish that the outcome of the discussions would be a democratic administration to look after the affairs of Northern Ireland in future years in the interests and beliefs of all the people living there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cross-Border joint business enterprises can be developed for the <Col N="1504" /> good of all in the context of the European Union.  Whether there is a unity of people in Ireland in the future is a matter for the people to decide freely and I hope they will as it will be in the interests of the next generation.  I thank the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, for the excellent work he has done for peace.  The success of these discussions will now depend on trust and respect for one another's religious and political beliefs.</P>

      <P>Women in Northern Ireland were crucial to the bringing about of the ceasefire and they are crucial to its maintenance and consolidation.Political parties ignore this crucial role of women at their peril. Women in Northern Ireland may not be very active in the formal political process but they are active in the informal process, voluntary and community groups, reconciliation activity and the development of better community relations.</P>
      <P>The Framework Document is a product of the formal political process. Unfortunately, many people in Northern Ireland are, and have always been, alienated from that process.  Many of those people are, however, engaged in what might be termed the informal political process.  They are involved in voluntary and community activity and women's groups.  The importance of this activity should not be underestimated. Reconciliation is more likely to be achieved through this informal process alongside the formal political process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Voluntary and community groups &mdash; of which women are usually the majority and the leading activists &mdash; have already been actively involved in cross-Border contacts, for example, the Focus on Children project which focuses <Col N="1505" /> on children North and South and meetings of the women's representative groups from both sides of the Border.  A number of such meetings took place the year before last and this year.  They have already discovered that they share common problems.  This activity needs to be encouraged and built on in order to ensure that the peace dividend extends to all sectors of society.</P>
    <P>The Forum for Peace and Reconciliation held a session on social and economic reconstruction on 20 January.  I know that many people found this to be a very thought provoking session of the forum, because it gave a voice to many of those who have not been heard very much in the past 25 years but who have suffered in ways which do not always attract the kind of attention usually given to the violence there.</P>
    <P>These are the people who must now be no less affected by the peace.  If the first instalment of the peace dividend is to be felt in any particular quarter, it should be in those deprived areas, which include both sides of the community divide in the North.  Participants at the forum session, especially those representing voluntary groups and bodies, were especially anxious to emphasise how peace offers them the opportunity to reach across the sectoral barriers and develop or begin to develop a new cross-community culture in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is something we must not only welcome, but encourage in every way possible.  I very much hope that the maximum amount of funding from the increased resources the peace process has already attracted will be channelled in this direction.  I am particularly pleased that the Combat Poverty Agency at my suggestion has put in place a contact between community groups North and South and has received a special allocation of £200,000 for this in this year's budget.  This is in addition to the inclusion for the first time of community groups in funding allocations for INTERREG projects.  It is a positive manifestation of the active support needed by community groups <Col N="1506" /> and cross-Border contacts in this area and between women.  What is needed, as the forum discussions showed, is an integrated approach to social and economic development and one that gives as much control and responsibility as possible to local communities.  We have many good examples of this approach in the South.  Targeted measures to tackle problems of disadvantage affecting women, the long term unemployed, marginalised groups and young people were emphasised at the forum.  There is a large network of voluntary and community bodies throughout the island which can do much to bridge the North-South divide, as well as the divide within Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Voluntary and community groups have been working hard in Northern Ireland for many years to bring solace and comfort to those whose lives have been affected and diminished by the violence.  What they need now is an opportunity to show what can be achieved in terms of personal and community development when there is peace and when that peace is supported by structures that command respect across the community divide.</P>
    <P>It has been said that after 25 years of bitter conflict it may take another 25 years to heal the wounds.  However long it takes, let us see that the healing process gets all the attention it requires and deserves from now on.  Peace does not just happen.  After 25 years of violence it must be nurtured, encouraged and built up in every way possible.  This is what the two Governments have been engaged in for a considerable time and what everyone in the House wants to encourage.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document is the product of a lengthy, unique and sustained effort by the two Governments to reach an understanding of the many complexities involved in the Northern Ireland conflict.  Working closely together towards that understanding is what made it different from earlier attempts.  Its purpose was to produce an agenda that is neither orange nor green but a comprehensive and inclusive set <Col N="1507" /> of ideas, proposals and challenges which address the issues and target all the obstacles and difficulties.</P>
    <P>I know that it has not been welcomed by everybody in Northern Ireland but when those who have criticised it read it again, when they have talked and discussed it with others, especially with neighbours and acquaintances who may not share their views, they will see that it is something new and different and does what it sets out to do.  It provides the shared views of the two Governments on what is now required to get discussions and negotiations going and sketch possible outcomes, bearing in mind the entrenched positions which some parties in Northern Ireland have as starting points.</P>
    <P>Peace makes everything possible but it does not make everything happen. Women were the essential component in getting peace and saying to the paramilitaries on both sides: &ldquo;We have had enough&rdquo;.  While women are not involved to any great extent in the formal political process they are the key to making the peace last within the community and this is crucial to the success of the process which has commenced.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Burton for sharing her time with me and I, in turn, will share mine with Deputy Byrne.  I welcome the document and congratulate everyone involved with its delivery.  I see a continuous thread of progress from the Sunningdale agreement of 1974 to the Anglo-Irish joint sovereignty agreement of 1985 to the Downing Street agreement of 1993 which contained the basic principles of consent, self-determination, respect for different traditions and peace by dialogue.In the Sunningdale agreement we have the North-South strand, in the Anglo-Irish Agreement we have the east-west strand and in the Downing Street Joint Declaration the emphasis was placed on Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Framework Document fleshes out the principles agreed in the Downing Street Joint Declaration &mdash; to create <Col N="1508" /> new structures and institutions in the context of the overall three strand approach, to encompass the totality of relationships through dialogue with all the political parties and to arrive at a resolution through negotiation.  Twentyone years have elapsed since we had limited democratic structures on the island and it is time that we had elected representatives and a new assembly with a charter or covenant for all the people, particularly the minority grouping.</P>
    <P>The British and Irish Governments have agreed to relax their territorial claims, the British Government through amending the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, or bringing in new legislation and the Irish Government through looking at the Constitution with a view to modifying Articles 2 and 3.  We cannot do other than that if we accept the principle of consent.  It is a natural continuation of the principles enunciated in the Downing Street Joint Declaration and I am happy to see this area developed.</P>
    <P>The cutting edge of the document is the North-South strand.  This offers the greatest scope for work and action on the ground where we can co-ordinate, consult and establish joint programmes and policies.  We can work together for the betterment of the island internally, within the EU where there is great scope for joint activity and globally where we should harness the Irish diaspora.I have great hopes for the proposed new body.</P>
    <P>The question of mutual recognition of teacher training and qualifications, North and South, is raised in the document.There should be greater co-operation between third level institutions. There are great opportunities for peace studies.  The teachers' unions North and South have worked closely together on international bodies.  I was invited, as part of an all Ireland group, in 1990 to talk to the former Eastern European countries, including Russia and Romania and explain the kind of system we operate here.  The concept of teachers' unions and their role in society does not exist in those countries.  We did that <Col N="1509" /> jointly but it is a shame to have to say there was minimal co-operation when at home on this island of ours.  There is enormous scope for development there and I should like to see such transpire.</P>
    <P>This is a good document which will enable much progress to be made.  Its content affords much scope in that it provides the bricks and mortar for creating new structures and relationships between the two communities.  I recommend it wholeheartedly to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the aftermath of the First World War the French Prime Minister, Monsieur Georges Clemenceau, said it was easier to make war than to make peace.  I think he said also that peace demands courage, compromise and, very often, a willingness to face what may be unpalatable realities.</P>
      <P>The principles enshrined in the Joint Framework Document are deceptively simple, yet are crucial to any understanding and constructive dialogue between the different traditions on this island; often it is comforting to seek refuge in the certainties of bigotry rather than confront the possibilities of tolerance.For example, the fears on the part of the Unionist community are understandable and must be addressed with sympathy and understanding rather than exasperation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Joint Framework Document provides a basis on which all of the relationships involved can be addressed in a fresh, innovative way, in that it enshrines the principle that any future arrangement should respect the equal legitimacy and value of both traditions on this island.  It is worth noting that, in our submission to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, Democratic Left pointed out that ultimately what divided the people in Northern Ireland was national allegiance rather than religion, race or ethnicism.  That really has been recognised and addressed in the document launched yesterday.  Both Governments took a great leap of faith &mdash; reflected in the British Government's <Col N="1510" /> pledge to amend or replace the Government of Ireland Act, 1920 and, of course, in our Government's pledge to introduce and support proposals for constitutional change in order to implement the commitment contained in the Downing Street Joint Declaration.</P>
    <P>The proposals for the establishment of North-South institutions, catering for political, social and economic interconnections also reflect the reality of the place of the island of Ireland within the European Union today, which I believe will be of benefit to all of the people on this island.  It is sad to reflect that the ordinary people have borne the brunt of the polarisation for far too long.  I argue that peace offers a chance for a new kind of unity, not merely territorial or political, but one of purpose aimed at eliminating unemployment, poverty and disadvantage from this island as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document represents a beginning rather than an end, forming as it does the basis for dialogue. In that regard we welcomed the publication yesterday of the proposals of the Ulster Unionist parties for a Northern Ireland Assembly.  I urge all concerned to study and reflect on its contents, ascertaining how they can be used to make further progress.  There is now an unprecedented chance to replace the politics of the ultimatum with the politics of dialogue.  All parties owe it to future generations to take part in that dialogue.  The document enshrines the principle of self-determination, not the simplistic versions touted in the past, but a version which recognises that self-determination is a day-to-day matter rather than a mere once-off political decision or vote.  Self-determination affords people power over their lives. over their respective neighbourhoods and communities.  That is the self-determination I believe is facilitated in the proposals embodied in this document.</P>
    <P>Those who believe that peace can be prescribed like aspirin have complained that the Joint Framework Document is short on specifics, thereby missing the <Col N="1511" /> whole point, in that it seeks to facilitate rather than prescribe; its proposals are not written on tablets of stone; all parties are free to put their proposals on the table, to sit around and talk at that table.</P>
    <P>It is important that Members of this House should endeavour to reassure the people of Northern Ireland, the Catholics and Protestants of both the Nationalist and Unionist traditions.  It is important that we do not, and never have intended to, force-feed the people of Northern Ireland against their will.  It is important that all sides, in particular the Unionists, who have expressed most concern to date, understand that we respect their views, but we ask that they respect and wish for us that which we wish for them, that is to respect our honesty in the formulation of this document.</P>

      <P>The publication yesterday of the Framework Document by the Irish and British Governments represents a further important step on the road to a just and lasting peace on this island.  Obviously, it builds on the progress made by the Downing Street Joint Declaration, the ceasefires declared by the paramilitaries on both sides of the political divide and the establishment of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  Furthermore, it is designed to assist in the talks process, representing the only democratic method of achieving a lasting settlement of matters at issue on this island and between the Irish and British Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We, in Fianna Fáil, welcomed the document as a balanced, even-handed one which represents reason, sense and compromise.  It does not represent a victory for any side over the other or abandonment by any one side of its rights or <Col N="1512" /> obligations.  Most important, it places the future of Northern Ireland in the hands of the people of Northern Ireland.  As is now recognised by both Governments, those people have the right to determine the future constitutional status of Northern Ireland without any impediment by selfish, strategic or economic interests on the part of the British Government.</P>
    <P>The future development of Northern Ireland must encompass recognition of the fact that there are two communities, with two traditions, on this island; it has long been recognised that that is so.  The ideal of all Republicans is that of Wolfe Tone &mdash; to substitute the common name of Irishman for Protestant, Catholic and Dissenter.  That is our ideal, a valid and legitimate one, based on the belief in the Irish nation.  That belief in the Irish nation has been asserted and reasserted by generations of Irishmen and, in deference to previous and future generations on this island, no Irishman has the right to abrogate that ideal.  It is the right of every person born on this island, or born of Irish parentage, to be a part of the Irish nation; that is their birthright, not a gift to be given or taken away.  Of course, the modern Irish nation is not homogeneous; it consists of different identities and traditions, each legitimate, each entitled to the respect of the other.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution reflects that belief in the Irish nation and also draws a distinction between the nation and the State.  Our laws have force within the State, not within the nation.  This was explicitly recognised by former Chief Justice T.F. O'Higgins in the Supreme Court in Re Article 26 of the Constitution and the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1975 when he stated:</P>
    <P>The national claim to unity exists not in the legal but in the political order and it is one of the rights which is envisaged in Article 2 and is expressly saved by Article 3.  Article 3 states the area to which the laws enacted by the parliament established by the Constitution apply.  The effect <Col N="1513" /> of Article 3 is that, until the division of the island of Ireland is ended, the laws enacted by the Parliament established by the Constitution are to apply to the same area and have the same extent of application as the laws of Saorstát Éireann had.  The area to which the laws of Saorstát Éireann applied was... undoubtedly the area now known as the Republic of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It has long been accepted by all democratic Irishmen that the legitimate ideal of a united Ireland can only be achieved by consent and agreement.  We have no objection to the principles of self-determination and consent being incorporated into our Constitution in the context of an overall settlement.  We can have no objection to our clearly stated views on consent and reconciliation being reflected in the Constitution.  We can have no objection to our view that the national territory is the shared inheritance of all the people of Ireland in their diverse identities and tradition being incorporated into Article 2 of the 1937 Constitution.  That represents Fianna Fáil's long held position, but I stress it does not represent an abandonment of the Irish Nation or our belief in it.  Our position on this has been made clear time and time again.  We believe in unity by consent, we do not believe in abandoning the concept of the Irish nation.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Framework Document has been dismissed in some quarters without having been read.  That reflects more on the people who have made dismissive comments than on the Framework Document.  It must be acknowledged by all sides that the Framework Document is an integral part of the continuing wider peace process and that there can be no going back.  If some people on this island live in a time warp or believe that the clock can be turned back and that there can again be Unionist majority rule in the North of Ireland, they had better know that they are in the minority, not only <Col N="1514" /> on this island but on the neighbouring island.  There can be no going back.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to say that Irish nationalism has developed and matured considerably.  It has adapted to changing times and differing circumstances.It is high time that some of those involved in the Unionist cause should adapt their stance to the changing circumstances of today in the interests of the children of tomorrow. There is no point now in looking back, it is time to look to the future.  There is no point in trying to stir up enmities within the Unionist population for political or populist purposes.  We are talking here about human life and the future of this island.  The sooner those involved in vitriolic attacks on the Framework Document and on those who hold an opposing political view are stopped the better.</P>

      <P>I welcome the publication of the Framework Document and I take this opportunity to compliment all the Ministers and officals involved for their strenuous efforts.  It is a further important stage in a long process of negotiation between Irish and British Governments and within political parties North and South.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My one major reservation about it is the possible lack of clarity on the possible changes to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.  Our party Leader, Deputy Ahern, made the Fianna Fáil position very clear yesterday.  Fianna Fáil's attitude to changes to Articles 2 and 3, in Government and in Opposition, reflects clearly the view of the majority of the people in this State.  The Irish people will only accept balanced constitutional change and I am aware from contacts from within my Border constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and in neighbouring Northern countries that this is very much the viewpoint.  Deputy Reynolds's argument in February 1992 for constitutional balance as between Articles 2 and 3 of Bunreacht na hÉireann and section 75 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, is a valid basis for discussion by both Governments and all political <Col N="1515" /> parties.  It has long been accepted that the will of the majority of the people of this island would not be imposed on the people of Northern Ireland without their consent.  The appropriate balanced constitutional changes must maintain, as Deputy Ahern said, &ldquo;the integrity of the nation as set out in Article 2&rdquo;.  I believe the Government, in the Joint Framework Document or simultaneously in a separate document, should have clearly laid down the paramaters of change that it would be willing to put before the Oireachtas for consideration and subsequently for decision by the Irish people.</P>
    <P>In the past 18 months we have witnessed major decisions like the Downing Street Joint Declaration, the cessation of violence and the establishment of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.The establishment of peace after 25 years of violence, bloodshed and more than 3,000 deaths created a totally new climate, not just for Northern Ireland but for all of this island.  I am sure everybody in this country is grateful for the single-minded determination of Deputy Reynolds in his role as Taoiseach in advancing the peace process. As one who travels regularly in the Six Counties, particularly in my neighbouring county of Fermanagh, I have witnessed at first hand since September the peace dividend, namely, the constant green light at the permanent checkpoints, the scaling down of security and a new lease of living in that area.</P>
    <P>The Government in September 1994 stated that the communities in the Border region needed to have visible signs of the peace dividend without delay. They rightly pointed out that the opening of closed cross-Border roads would be a priority and I welcome the progress being made in this regard.  However, I must express serious disappointment at the lack of funding provided by our Government towards the re-opening of those Border roads.  I emphasise to the Government that it is practically pointless to have Border crossings re-opened if it is not possible to gain access to <Col N="1516" /> those crossings due to the impassable condition of the relevant link roads.  The Department must fund the upgrading of those roads leading to the Border crossings.I refer particularly to roads in the Swanlinbar area of County Cavan.  We are witnessing the substantial upgrading of roads on the Fermanagh side.  There has been talk about parity of esteem and equality and surely this is the opportunity for the Government to give our people living in rural Border areas a decent road network.  People are well aware of the serious infrastructural problems facing Border counties, particularly the totally inadequate road network.I instance Aghalane Bridge, which effectively puts an end to the N3 outside Belturbet on the Fermanagh border.  The funding being provided by the European Union must be additional to the funding committed in the operational programmes of the various Departments.  In the past we have had too much substitution and no additionality.</P>
    <P>I welcome wholeheartedly the commitment by both Governments in the Framework Document to the establishment of new institutions which will be vital for the promotions of economic growth within the island of Ireland.  Co-operation in the agricultural, tourism and transport areas will be beneficial for my home area and for the entire country.I hope that the proposed cross-Border bodies based on the local authority network will have a direct and meaningful access to the new institutions.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the tourism potential of this island is not targeted more positively in the document.  We are all aware of the need to build on the strength of our natural resources both North and South.  A concerted Border areas investment programme is needed now.  The climate of peace will be strengthened by the Government addressing forthwith the major infrastructural deficiencies of the southern Border counties.  It is essential that a senior Government Minister should chair a top level committee of senior <Col N="1517" /> Government and public service personnel to oversee a programme of investment by Government Departments and State bodies and ensure that the funding is additional and not a substitution.  We need a focused approach involving the whole State sector.  I trust the Government will not adopt a minimalist approach, about which we have been warned by the European Union.</P>
    <P>We have an excellent food industry in the Cavan-Monaghan area and I ask the Department of Enterprise and Employment and Forfás to build an advance factory in Cavan geared towards the food industry.  Attention must also be given to the establishment of an information technology centre.  Such an approach is our only hope of inward investment.  The people of the Border region have a strong work ethic and investment by the public and private sectors will be justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleagues, Deputies O'Donoghue and Brendan Smith, for sharing their time.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to make brief comments on the Framework Document published yesterday.</P>
      <P>The publication of the Framework Document has been the culmination of much painstaking work on the part of many people.  The whole process of edging forward progress in the North has been very slow.  The publication of the document is satisfying in that real and tangible progress has been made.  The Framework Document provides the opportunity for all political parties to participate in meaningful dialogue and to put in place as quickly as possible structures which will be acceptable to both traditions in the North.  We would be very foolhardy if we thought those structures could be put in place over-night.It will take time.  The polarisation of the two communities in the North is deep-seated and entrenched.  People, in general, in the North have a sense of pragmatism and realism and when they see the opportunity now presented after so many years of bloodshed and violence, I believe they will grasp it firmly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1518" /> The proposals contained in the Framework Document are the culmination of work which started many years ago.  I will not refer to all those involved but history will judge favourably those who have contributed to the publication of this document.  Fianna Fáil in Government and now the rainbow coalition, combined with the Conservative Government in Britain, have succeeded in identifying the trust which I hope will bring together the two traditions in the North.</P>
    <P>If we are to create the type of environment in which progress can be made it is important to look at economic development.  The South may not fully appreciate the development of the infrastructure in the North in which a tremendous amount of money has been invested.  While there has been a dramatic change in the industrial base in many ways it is no different from ours. Their unemployment problem is related to lack of investment because of the troubles in the North.  It may call for a special initiative in the trading area. There may be a case for the introduction of an arrangement similar to that which the Caribbean islands have with the United States for the six northern counties and, indeed, the six counties south of the Border.  This would mean duty and tariff free access to the entire north American market for industrial output from the existing base.  Future industrial development there could mean ready assess to a US market.</P>
    <P>Clearly, this is an area which would have exceptional attractions for investors from Japan who wish to get their products into the United States or to United States corporations who wish to avail of a production base in Europe to export back home to the huge market. If we could create that type of environment it would accelerate the process of coming together in the North.  At the end of the day if people get employment their attitude changes dramatically.</P>
    <P>I represent a Border constituency and I am closer to the North than most Members.  A significant number of <Col N="1519" /> unemployment blackspots were in a pivotal position in regard to the northern troubles during the past 25 or 30 years. If the employment levels in those areas had been higher would we have had the same degree of violence and trouble during that period?  I hope that question can be addressed in the context I am talking about.  Various ideas are being discussed including the question of providing money under different headings, from the Delors package, the IFI or other sources.  There is need for a greater co-ordination of these funds to ensure we maximise the benefit not alone to the six northern counties but the six counties immediately south of the Border.</P>
    <P>In County Louth we have been at the coalface of the problem during the past 25 years.  Louth has been a receptacle for people who have been displaced in the North because of the troubles.  In the main they have come to live in Dundalk and Drogheda and to a lesser extent in areas such as Ardee.  Finding their economic and social niche in areas such as County Louth has resulted in a certain amount of social upheaval.  It takes time for people in those circumstances to integrate.  I am sorry my time is limited as this is a subject on which we could speak at length but I appreciate that other Members wish to contribute.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Bree and Dukes.  It is timely to reflect on the historic achievements in respect of peace on this island in the last 12 months or so.  I congratulate the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and their respective teams, not only during the last few weeks but over the past couple of years, as well as former Taoisigh and Ministers for Foreign Affairs during the past ten years, who have endeavoured to achieve a peaceful settlement in this island, often in the face of great odds and seemingly with little result for their efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1520" /> The Framework Document gives us all time to reflect on what has happened over the past 25 years, to consider it against the backdrop of what might have happened in different circumstances and to remember that a new generation is growing up, that has lived with war and violence for 25 years.  It gives us time to reflect on the economic impact on the economies of Britain and Ireland.  It gives us time to reflect on what the alternatives might be, where we might have been if we had not gone down the road of violence.  Public representatives here and in the North should examine the position and ask how best we can contribute to what is envisaged in the Framework Document and in the various other aspects of the peace process.  Not only is it useful but it is imperative that we examine constructively and in a balanced way the options before us.</P>
    <P>It is also a time for innovation.  As the Taoiseach and British Prime Minister said yesterday it is a time for those who are not in agreement with all aspects of the peace process to date and particularly in respect of the Framework Document, to put forward their own proposals.  If they wish to improve the position they now have an opportunity to put forward their own proposals in a meaningful manner in a framework which will have an impact and will take account, to a large extent, of the fears which both sides hold and have expressed from time to time.</P>
    <P>It is also a time for those who have agreed with the process to date to move their influence a stage further &mdash; to influence those around them, whether Nationalists, Loyalists or Unionists.  It is a time for those who have seen what the violence has done, over the past number of years, to use their influence on those around them in a peaceful and meaningful fashion with a view to ensuring we do not travel along the same course again.</P>
    <P>I have been a Member of the House for a number of years and it is clear we have matured in the past ten to 12 years. When I came here first it was not <Col N="1521" /> unusual for inflammatory speeches to be made at sensitive moments, which were not helpful to the process in which we are now engaged.  We have matured a great deal in this part of the island, and I am quite certain the same applies to the other part.</P>
    <P>This is also a time to reflect on the enormous benefits that can accrue to both parts of this island, more especially to the northern part, as a result of pursuing the object of peace within the Framework Document.  At this stage it may not be possible to identify all the beneficial aspects but it is up to us as public representatives, in all parts of this island, to try to bring that about.</P>
    <P>I hope this Framework Document gives us an opportunity to give peace a chance and in the course of that we might even give rhetoric a rest.  That was not always the case.  I hope, as a result of the progress made during the past 12 months, bearing in mind the difficulties over the past 25 years, that we may go down that road.</P>
    <P>As a Member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs it was my privilege some time ago to meet Lady Faulkner and I marvelled at the way that woman, who has seen so much history unfold before her, who, with her husband and family, has been deeply involved in it and has paid the price, has shown an interest in the well-being of the country. I hope we can take an example from people such as her and proceed along the course of peace that has been charted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DeclanBree" hpid="Mr. Bree Mr. Bree">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bree</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the Framework Document and like the great majority of people on this island I recognise it as an historic development in the process of building peace in our country.  I take this opportunity to thank and pay tribute to all who have been involved in drafting and preparing the document, including the Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds and in particular the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Spring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> The Joint Declaration acknowledges that the most urgent and important issue facing the people North and South, and the British and Irish Governments, is to remove the causes of conflict, overcome the legacy of history and heal the divisions which have resulted. Both Governments are aware that the approach in the Framework Document presents challenges to strongly-held positions.  However, a new beginning in relationships means addressing fundamental issues in a new way and inevitably requires significant movement from all sides.  It must be emphasised that this Framework Document is not a rigid blueprint to be imposed but rather it sets out a realistic and balanced framework for agreement which can be achieved, with flexibility and goodwill in comprehensive negotiations with all the relevant political parties.</P>
    <P>The publication of this Framework Document is a clear indication that partition as we have known it has failed. The fact that the UK Government has reiterated that Britain has no selfish strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>At a time when people are engaged in a process of healing and understanding, peace must be based on truth, justice and charity.  Without these, political agreement would almost certainly be impossible.  While paramilitary organisations and political parties associated with them have indicated their regret and remorse over their contribution to the deaths and suffering of innocent people, the reality is that the British Government has been slow to acknowledge or apologise for the deaths and suffering of innocent people it has caused.  In this context, I welcome the statement in the Framework Document that both Governments recognise that there is much cause for deep regret on all sides in the long and often tragic history of Anglo-Irish relations.</P>
    <P>In this period of transition, if we are to overcome our past, we must come to terms with it and we can only do that if we know the truth about it.  The victims of State violence and the public have a <Col N="1523" /> right to know the truth about the actions of the State and its agencies in terms of human rights abuses.  We owe this to the victims and their families.</P>
    <P>The peace process is now entering a new and crucial phase.  We all realise that both communities in Northern Ireland have suffered more than enough, and this Framework Document attempts to reach out to both.  As we have pointed out before, this cannot be done by picking and choosing among democratic principles.  If some are acceptable, all must be acceptable.  The right of the Nationalist community in the North to continue to pursue the entirely legitimate aspirations to unity by democratic political means cannot be suppressed.  At the same time, we must continue to send a message to the Unionist community that we are prepared to ensure that their rights and identity are fully represented and protected in any settlement we make.  We cannot coerce Unionists into abandoning their rights and identity.  We have to find ways of including them in any settlement, in such a way as to provide the kind of guarantees they need and to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>The Nationalist community, having suffered decades of injustice, can no longer be ignored by any administration.They have rights too, including the right to an even-handed system of justice, to expect they will not be discriminated against because of religion or where they live, and the right to pursue the historic goal of Irish unity through democratic means.  These are rights that must always be defended.</P>
    <P>Now more so than ever, community reconciliation is necessary to address the legacy of the past.  This in essence means changing relations of privilege, discrimination, oppression and ascendancy.It also means confidence building measures to minimise the inheritance of bitterness.  Almost everyone in the North has a family member, relation, neighbour, friend or workmate who has been murdered, maimed, jailed or harassed by one paramilitary group or <Col N="1524" /> another or by State forces over the past 25 years.  We cannot expect that bitterness to disappear with a political settlement, but people need to be assured that in a new Ireland there must be no retribution, no guilt, no settling of old scores, no &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; discrimination to compensate for discrimination against Nationalists in the past.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the inclusion in the Framework Document of suggested North-South institutions.  There are many areas where we can improve co-operation in terms of agriculture, fisheries, industrial development, transport, energy, trade, education and economic policy.</P>
    <P>It is said that politics is the art of compromise, and as we know compromise is never easy.  The Framework Document is about compromise and in this case compromise must be striven for.  The grace and courage of the people in both communities, particularly those who have had to cope with tragedy, must be matched now in political terms by all their representatives.</P>
    <P>The compromise for which we are looking rests on the fundamental idea of equality &mdash; nothing else and nothing more.  We want to help to build structures based on equality of esteem and respect between both traditions; we want to build relationships between North and South that reflect the equality of our aspirations.</P>
    <P>As Nelson Mandela approached the whites and Zulus in South Africa, we have to go to our Unionist fellow countrymen and women and engage with them as to what kind of Ireland we want, even if many of them do not want to hear it.  We have to give them guarantees about their rights, their religious and cultural beliefs, their living standards.We have to make clear to them that we are not interested in erasing a line on a map and pretending that everything will sort itself out thereafter. We must say to them that we are sick to the back teeth of tribal politics.  We are still liberating ourselves from the remnants of a narrow, suffocating, Catholicdominated confessional State as they <Col N="1525" /> must liberate themselves from notions of a Protestant State if they are to have any hope of engaging with reality in a world approaching the third millennium.We want peace, progress and a secular State.  They may not respond in the way we would like.  Some may want an independent &ldquo;Ulster&rdquo;, once they realise, as many of them already have, that the British ruling élite has already withdrawn from Ireland psychologically and is seeking acceptable ways to do so politically.  That does not matter.  At least, once they engage with us it means they have started to move away from tribal politics.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document is positive and balanced.  It offers to everyone living in Ireland, in particular in Northern Ireland, the prospect of lasting peace and justice.  It creates in short a &ldquo;table&rdquo; where all can sit down and negotiate the future without loss of principle or damage to basic concerns.  For all of us who seek Irish unity the reality remains that unity can only be achieved by those of us who favour this outcome, persuading those who do not, peacefully and without coercion or violence.  In short, the search for Irish unity must become for all of us a search for unity of hearts and minds, for unity of purpose, and not merely a search for unity of territory.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily endorse the welcome given to the Framework Document and I fully agree with the sentiments of congratulations expressed in this House and elsewhere to everybody involved in its preparation.  I would like to add similar sentiments in regard to the unilateral document produced at the same time by the British Government, because the two documents together form a very important whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The documents present the Governments' views and they are very much documents for discussion.  It has been clear for a long time that the issues raised in those documents have to be discussed, and the sooner that is done and we arrive at conclusions the better. I do not know, nor does anyone else in this House, what will be the conclusion <Col N="1526" /> of such discussions.  I hope the outcome will be an arrangement along the lines of that set out in the Framework Document and in the British Government document.  It is important that we set that ambition in context, and I suggest a very clear context for that.  If the discussions we would all like to see take place were to eventuate in a set of arrangements such as those described in the Framework Document and the British Government document, we should make clear that we would be prepared to envisage those arrangements continuing in force for a considerable time, possibly even for a whole generation.</P>
    <P>When it is in place for a lengthy period will we have a political system in Northern Ireland and on this island which has a framework &mdash; I use that word advisedly &mdash; which will be found to be acceptable.  It will take at least a generation for those habits of political action to become embedded in people's customs.  We can say with some confidence what is involved because it took us 50 years, if not longer, to get used to the idea of working with institutions we gave ourselves in 1922.  It will take at least that long for those habits, customs and instincts to become rooted.  It is important for us to say that there will be no outside pressure on the people living under those arrangements to change them unless and until they decide that is what they want.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document contains a number of elements which each group in the political process in Northern Ireland will find congenial and very much to their liking and other elements about which each group will have some reservations.  It is the process of balancing the give and take which will determine whether talks on these proposals are successful.  At the end of the day the system will have to get bedded in and there should be a clear consciousness that it will not be interfered with before the people who make it work for themselves and their governance decide that they want to change it.  The flavour of the Framework Document and the UK <Col N="1527" /> document is very positive and open. Even those who find substantial parts of them uncongenial must now recognise that they will have to deal with these uncongenial proposals sooner or later, and sooner is better than later.</P>
    <P>I regret that already there is a note of discord in the debate.  The Fianna Fáil position on Article 2 of the Constitution is extremely ill advised and will prove seriously counter-productive in further discussions.  I listened very carefully to the remarks of Deputies Ahern and Lenihan about the addendum to Article 2.  As I understand it, this addendum, which I find rather meaningless, was communicated to the British Government before the collapse of the previous Government and is not agreed.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Ahern referred to the integrity of the nation as set out in Article 2 of the Constitution.  I invite him to re-read the first three Articles of the Constitution which give no definition of the nation.  That may have been deliberate at the time and whether or not this was the case, it is now wise. Deputy Ahern referred to citizenship, which is a different idea to that of a nation.  Many people in Northern Ireland do not feel part of an Irish nation and do not necessarily want to be part of such a nation.  As long as they have the conviction &mdash; which they will be given by the position being taken by Fianna Fáil on Article 2 &mdash; that we are trying to manoeuvre them into being part of a nation to which they do not feel they belong, then they will be suspicious and difficult and will refuse to talk.</P>
    <P>Mr. Adams's statement yesterday to the effect that the one island ethos is gaining ground will prove to be counter-productive to this process.  We should be very conscious that we are now entering what is probably the most difficult part of the peace process, the part which requires political ingenuity and imagination.The morally difficult decisions have been made with the ceasefires, we now have to deal with the politically difficult ones.  This is where we require a <Col N="1528" /> great deal more courage than has been shown by this type of spacious argument about Article 2.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all Members of the House and all citizens, North or South, I welcome the Framework Document. We have come a long way in the past four-five years in bringing about peace on this island.  In this context, I commend the efforts made by the former Taoisigh, Charles Haughey and Deputy Albert Reynolds, and the Taoiseach who has continued the work begun by his predecessors.  We also owe a debt of gratitude to Mr. John Major who took courageous decisions in the face of enormous pressure, especially in recent times and the threat of his Government being brought down by individuals who did not think a settlement which would be acceptable to all could be achieved while he was in office.</P>
      <P>We can now wake up in the mornings without fearing to hear about another atrocity in the North.  Instead we can look forward to hearing positive news on the economic front etc.  This shows that there is a willingness among the paramilitary organisations, the Unionists, the Nationalists and the people who have been on the fringes of democratic politics for many years to bring about a lasting settlement.  The Framework Document does not seek to coerce one side or the other; rather it will give people room to negotiate.  Previously many organisations in Northern Ireland, especially Nationalist ones, felt alienated, that they had been forgotten not only by people in the South but by their fellow citizens in the North.  There are ghetto communities on both sides in the North, and no one should try to tell me there are no poor Unionists.  Anyone who looks at the situation in the North will see there are ghettos in both communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> I disagree with Deputy Dukes's comments about Deputy Ahern's speech. Last night and this morning Ken Maginnis clearly stated that the addendum proposed to Article 2 does not pose any threat to the Unionist people in Northern Ireland.  I welcome the proposal to set up a Northern Ireland parliament which I hope will co-operate with institutions in the South.  This will give people and marginalised groups on all sides an opportunity to get involved in politics at a national level.  People who are not members of either of the main groupings in the North may get involved in local politics but they do not stand a chance of getting involved in national politics.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 47 of the document states:</P>
    <P>In the event that devolved institutions in Northern Ireland ceased to operate, and direct rule from Westminster was reintroduced, the British Government agree that other arrangements would be made to implement the commitment to promote co-operation at all levels between the people North and South. ...</P>
    <P>That is what the document is about. There is an opportunity here on an economic level to bring about an improvement in the quality of life and the standard living of people in Northern Ireland.  People have seen the benefit of peace for the past six months.  The economic benefit to Northern Ireland has been enormous; it is only a fraction of the long term economic benefit that could be gained.  The Delors package and other initiatives are helping to remove the deprivation of Northern Ireland and the Border areas of the past years due to the terrorist activities in the North.  When these funds come to be spent I hope consideration will be given to the six southern counties which have suffered greatly as a result of the troubles in Northern Ireland.  The American Senator Mitchell paid a fact finding visit in the past week and that will be of benefit when disbursing these funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1530" /> We must all give this document our full support as politicians.  Our party leader drew a line in the sand with regard to Article 2 of the Constitution and put down a marker which many would have preferred had been put down by the Government prior to the publication of the document in the form of the amendment they hope to bring forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the publication of the Framework Document and fully support it as a document for further discussion and consultation. It brings together the peace process which has been under way for some months and the political process which will now commence in earnest.  I pay tribute to the Government for finalising the Framework Document in the past few weeks.  When the previous Government left office in December it was, I understand, 90 per cent finalised and, therefore, the previous Government must also be congratulated.  I wish to record my appreciation to those involved in the peace process.  Gerry Adams played a major role; he commenced the process in the Republican movement almost ten years ago.  I would also mention John Hume who showed tremendous courage by involving himself in the Hume-Adams talks and was vilified at the time for so doing.  Deputy Albert Reynolds and the British Prime Minister, John Major played an important role.  Others behind the scenes, such as Dr. Martin Mansergh, Fr. Alex Reid and many others, will have their roles recorded by history and the part they played recognised.  In 1980, as Deputy Lenihan mentioned this morning, the British and Irish Governments recognised that a solution to the Northern Ireland problem would involve the totality of relationships within these islands.  That concept is firmly recognised now in the Joint Framework Document &mdash; the North-South relations, the relations between the two communities in Northern Ireland and the relations between the two Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1531" /> The Anglo-Irish Agreement was also important in the process.  The principle of consent was established and adopted. Nevertheless, the Fianna Fáil view was that it could never be a final solution. The publication of the Framework Document demonstrates that that agreement was inadequate.  The Anglo-Irish Conference is being retained according to this document and that is good.  It also imposed institutions and arrangements on the Unionists without any consultation and that was a flaw as far as the Anglo-Irish Agreement was concerned.  All those involved in the preparation of this Framework Document recognise that the Anglo-Irish Agreement needed to be replaced.  This document is not a <i>fait accompli</i>, and this time all will be persuaded to become involved and all concerns are to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Over the years Fianna Fáil has changed and responded to new circumstances.The Anglo-Irish process is an evolving one.  We have accepted the principle that a united Ireland has to be achieved by agreement, with consent and by peaceful means.  That is one of my primary objectives in political life. Fianna Fáil supports the balanced constitutional changes recommended by both Governments to recognise these recent developments.</P>
    <P>Article 2 of the Constitution must remain in place.  It states that the national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland, its islands and the territorial seas, and there is a reference to the nation in that Article.  The British Government put great pressure on the previous Government to drop Article 2 but without success.  This Government recognised Fianna Fáil's bottom line. The addition of an addendum suggesting that the island is the shared inheritance of all the people of Ireland, involving diverse identities and traditions, recognises the reality.  The birthright of an Irish citizen remains.  The addendum recognises the need for a more pluralist definition of the nation, and recognises the different traditions.  The emphasis is <Col N="1532" /> now placed on the concept of the nation and not on the concept of the State.</P>
    <P>Article 3 involves a recognition that the reintegration of the national territory remains a legitimate national objective.This is as it should be.  Nevertheless, the principle of consent is now firmly established and this should now be accommodated in an addendum also. Nobody is in the business of coercing anybody.  Major change beyond that proposed by Fianna Fáil would be difficult to sell to people in the South. Section 75 of the Government of Ireland Act, 1920, must go.  As we on this side of the House have always said, constitutional change can only be brought about in the context of an overall settlement.  The Government has fudged the issue of constitutional change and this is a bad negotiating strategy.  The Government is now open to constant pressure from the British Government.  It should state its position on constitutional change and put forward its position.</P>
    <P>I welcome in particular the establishment of cross-Border institutions which are recommended in the document. Local authorities should also be given a major role.  I support all those groups bringing about communication between the people of this island such as the Glencree Reconciliation Centre.  I support the call for new imaginative ideas from our politicians to accommodate the proposals in the Joint Framework Document.</P>

      <P>In the short time available to me I will skip the niceties about who should be thanked &mdash; they go without saying &mdash; for the work put into the production of this document.  I welcome it in the sense that it was so long in coming and more was built up around it than it ever could obtain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The structures mentioned in the document &mdash; North-South, east-west and in Northern Ireland &mdash; show a great deal of imagination, but also show the cleverness and the complexities that only the British and Irish civil servants combined could put together.  We will <Col N="1533" /> be talking about it and teasing it out ten years from now and we still will not quite know what it was, is or will be.</P>
    <P>I will deal with the basic issue of constitutional status and constitutional issues.  It is notable about those paragraphs in the document that there is an extraordinary reaching out to assure the Unionists of their future and well being. It ignores that it is they who have brought about the situation which culminated in 25 years of mayhem and war as a result of 50 years before that of discrimination and intimidation with their partisan police force, the B-Specials, backed up by the occupying British Army when and if necessary.  In the late 1960s the Nationalist people could take no more and took to the streets &mdash; we all remember Burntollet Bridge and Craigavon Bridge.  They would not have succeeded but for the new element of television.  The paper wall was no longer able to contain the scandalous treatment the minority was receiving in the Six Counties over the previous 50 years. The war since then was caused by the Unionist majority which incidentally was contrived on the first day by a count of heads.  The Six Counties with that contrived majority are now giving equal status to the rights of a minority which has been bruised, bloodied, bent, but unbroken over the years since partition.</P>
    <P>The Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Downing Street Joint Declaration and this document place great emphasis on balanced accommodation.  It seems that balance began yesterday, not when the trouble began 70 years ago.  The belief expounded in the three documents is that the will of the Irish people as a whole will determine their future, but a veto is installed in all three documents. This is hard to take and will not result in a lasting peace, whatever about the interim peace we have at present.</P>
    <P>If we continue double talking in terms of giving all the people of Ireland the inalienable right to self-determination, we cannot overwhelm that by saying that less than 20 per cent of the island's <Col N="1534" /> population may say otherwise.  We cannot have it both ways.  The Six Counties, with its contrived majority which has intimidated and discriminated down through the years, continues.  According to the latest statistics, the ratio between the two communities is 57:43.  Where are we going?  Who are we satisfying?  It is like asking President Mandela to give back to the whites in South Africa the powers taken from them.  That is what is being said here as regards Nationalists and Unionists in the Six Counties, in that we must give the majority, contrived as it was, powers to ensure that it can secure its position.  The majority was never under threat, nor is it, but it perpetrated the scandalous treatment which caused the past 25 years of war.</P>

      <P>Many are dead on both sides.  The attitude seems to be that balance starts from today's situation, not from yesterday's.  That is not balance, because the situation has been unbalanced for 70 years.  We cannot build on this to create an even handed approach. In the document under Constitutional Issues, the democratic wish of the majority is referred to many times, but Nationalists are mentioned only once when their traditions are referred to.</P>
      <P>It is strange that we are discussing the rights and concerns of Unionists who have blackguarded Nationalists over the years.  We are confirming a situation whereby they will maintain that role in the future despite the complexities in the proposals for cross-Border and east-west structures.  We cannot and should not interfere with Article 2 of the Constitution until section 75 of the 1920 Act is removed.  If that does not happen, we are merely prolonging the agony with a little break in between because there will not be a lasting peace.  I have no doubt about that.  I am aware of what takes place there, I belong there, I have contacts there and I have more dealings with Unionists than any other Member.</P>

      <P>This document cannot be seen as the final solution to the Irish question.  It must be seen as a document for consultation and discussion.  It is an agreed framework resulting from the deliberations and hard work over the past two years of the Irish and British Governments, their officials and civil servants. Its main objective must be to get all parties, all shades of political opinion, engaged in talks and discussions with the ultimate objective of establishing a permanent peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1536" /> Our greatest failure since the establishment of the State has been our failure to get all parties engaged in talks. Unfortunately, there have always been empty chairs.  Republicans and Nationalists of various hues have not always been at the conference table, while Unionists have almost never been there.  We have never succeeded in getting everyone round the table at the same time to discuss the future of this island and of its people.  The success or failure of this document will rest on its ability to achieve a genuine and comprehensive round table conference where all strands and shades of political opinion, North and South, are represented.If it succeeds in achieving that, it will be a success.  If not, we must get back to the drawing board once more.</P>
    <P>It is now 24 hours after the publication of this document and I am reasonably confident that success is more likely than failure at this stage. The document has already got widespread and cross-party support in this House and in the British Parliament.  In Northern Ireland, it has been greeted positively by many parties, including the SDLP, the Alliance Party, Sinn Féin, the Workers Party and others.  The reaction and attitude of the Unionist population is crucial for its success.  It is encouraging that it has not been completely dismissed by all Unionist politicians.I wholeheartedly agree with the statement of a senior Unionist on television yesterday who did not commit himself on the document because he had only read it three or four times.  He said he would need to read it 20 times before he could decide whether he was for or against.  At least he agreed with Deputy Blaney in that regard.  That is the attitude we should adopt; people should not give their verdict before they have an opportunity to read it.  It should not be left to the politicians alone, North or South, to judge the document. It is widely available and people should study it calmly and in depth before rushing to pass judgment on it.</P>
    <P>In the past the reaction of many people to similar proposals was in line <Col N="1537" /> with their prejudices and preconceived ideas.  We cannot remain cocooned any longer; we must open our hearts to new ideas and adopt fresh attitudes if we are to break free from the logjam and political inertia.  This document presents us with the best opportunity in 70 years to do this.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Blaney, I am a Donegal man and an Ulsterman.  I usually spend a few hours each week in Northern Ireland.  There is a perceptible air of hope and optimism since the peace process commenced about six months ago. It is a new experience to see families walking in the streets once more, visiting shopping arcades and carrying out ordinary everyday activities without the need for security checks, body searches and electronic scanning.  This is something we take for granted in the South but for an entire generation in the North such ordinary, everyday activity presented great danger and, unfortunately, led to injury and even death. One of the great dividends of the peace process is that the atmosphere of suspicion and uncertainty has been dispelled and that there is now a tide of trust, understanding and co-operation throughout the community.  This document is designed to provide a framework within which the peace process can be strengthened and made permanent.</P>
    <P>The people of County Donegal have always had strong links with Northern Ireland.  For generations Derry was our natural city and Donegal its natural hinterland.  Derry was also the port of departure for thousands of people from Donegal on their way to Glasgow and other parts of Scotland.  That is where they said farewell to their kith-and-kin and where their hearts lifted on their return; they were following in the footsteps of Colmcille who left 1,500 years before.</P>
    <P>Donegal was the natural holiday destination for thousands of people from Northern Ireland.  Its tourism industry was booming in the 1960s before the violence commenced.  Towns such as <Col N="1538" /> Rathmullan, Ramelton, Portnoo, Dunfanaghy, Gweedore, Rossnowlagh and Bundoran prospered.  Our hotels, guest-houses and chalets were filled from Easter to October.  Unfortunately, when the violence commenced 25 years ago the effects were sorely felt throughout Donegal.  If the peace process continues the dividend will be just as significant.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the vast majority of people in the South do not consider Northern Ireland as a holiday destination.How many people from Dublin or Cork can say that they visited Northern Ireland?  How many have visited the Giant's Causeway, Bushmills, Ballycastle, the Glens of Antrim from Cushendun to Cushendall and the Ulster Folk Museum?  Northern Ireland has so much to offer, yet few people have ventured there.  Is there a better way to get to know our land than visiting these places and their people in their own homes and localities?</P>
    <P>I hope this document will bring all parties and shades of political opinion on this island together.  If this can be achieved the peace process can be made permanent and allow us an opportunity to get to know our country and its people.  The ultimate aim is to allow us to live in harmony and peace together on this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the comments of the Father of the House, Deputy Blaney, who invoked the name of Nelson Mandela whose hallmark was his extreme generosity in creating structures to accommodate the Nationalist minority in South Africa who at one time exercised power over the majority. The Deputy ignored the major opportunity to pursue development that would be presented by a North-South body and the co-operation between the people on the entire island which could flow from it.  At times he sounded like a dinosaur and echoed the comments yesterday of one or two other dinosaurs in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his book <i>States of Ireland</i> published in 1972 my predecessor in Dublin <Col N="1539" /> North-East, Conor Cruise O'Brien concluded that the fundamental problem in relation to the holocaust of violence and terror then engulfing the country was that politicians, especially those in the South, had lost the key to the solution to the national problem which he identified as the principle of consent of the governed and the right to self-determination for all the people who live on the island.  He wrote that the problem was not how to achieve unity but how to share an island in conditions of peace and reasonable fairness.</P>
    <P>He went on to argue that the great political figure in the first 30 years of the Free State, Eamon de Valera, held the key in his hand on 22 August 1921 when he told the 2nd Dáil that he was prepared to consider the principle of self-determination and consent because if the South used force it would have made the same mistake as England had made in Ireland; de Valera indicated that in certain conditions he would understand if any Irish county wanted to secede if it was not prepared to give its consent.</P>
    <P>As a Labour Deputy, I am deeply proud of the role played by my party leader, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, in the recovery of the lost key to the problems on this island.  In the 14 years he has been leader of the Labour Party he has embodied the great principle of James Connolly &ldquo;Ireland without its people means nothing to me&rdquo;.  With his key advisers he has relentlessly and patiently sought a solution based on the key principles of consent and agreement and the need to bring the violence to an end once and for all.  He has been Tánaiste in three Governments and has resolutely &mdash; and sometimes painfully &mdash; slowly pursued his vision of an Ireland in which all the people and their traditions are accommodated.</P>
    <P>He was one of the key architects of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in which the aspirations of the Northern minority were finally recognised through the establishment of the intergovernmental conference and London's acceptance <Col N="1540" /> that it would abide by the wishes of the majority in Northern Ireland if they wished to be reunited with the rest of the country.  On his return to Government in late 1992 he resumed his ceaseless search for peace in Ireland and in his speech in the Mansion House in March 1993 he called on all the parties to the Northern Ireland conflict to accept reality and agree to new political arrangements.  He said that each act of violence was the ultimate expression of contempt for the rights of the other community.</P>
    <P>These themes were echoed in his powerful address at the 1993 Labour Party national conference where he stunned the audience by reading out the names of 25 innocent people from Northern Ireland who had been slain in the early months of that year.  His massive contribution to the Downing Street Joint Declaration has been acknowledged.Paragraph 4 of that Declaration lays down the right to self-determination of all the people of Ireland.</P>
    <P>That Declaration also embodied the Tánaiste's six principles which he outlined in an earlier speech, namely, freedom of political thought, freedom of expression, religious freedom, the right to pursue democratically national and political aspirations and constitutional change by peaceful means, the right to live where one chose and the right to equal opportunity.  The Tánaiste has tried to create a background whereby we can move on to achieve a comprehensive peace for our country.  His reward has been the IRA ceasefire of August 1994, the combined loyalist military command ceasefire in October 1994 and this Framework Document.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute also to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, whose imaginative, daring and businesslike qualities helped to bring together the various elements in the peace process.I wish to pay tribute also to the Taoiseach who, when in Opposition, made one of the best speeches I have ever heard in this House on the day of the IRA ceasefire.  When one is paying tribute to those involved in this peace <Col N="1541" /> process, one must pay special tribute to John Hume who has been the voice of peace and constitutional progress for all Irish communities, but particularly communities in the North, over the past 25 years.  His deep awareness of relationships between the various communities in the North and throughout the island has played a fundamental part in the peace process.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document offers a great opportunity for all the peoples on the island, North and South, and for the people of Britain.  It should not be seen as a threat to any group or community.  I agree with Deputy McGinley that there should be a sense of urgency in regard to round table discussions involving all parties in Northern Ireland.  In that way they can work out a comprehensive and accommodating settlement.</P>
    <P>The guiding principles of the Framework Document are the rights of self-determination, the consent of the Governments, exclusively democratic means to pursue political objectives and full respect for the rights of all.  In paragraph 20 the British Government reiterates that it has no strategic or economic interest in our country and it will act in a facilitatory and supportive capacity as we work out our fundamental relationships for the future.</P>
    <P>I recognise this document presents a great challenge to the people of the North.  On a recent visit there, one of the main complaints of Unionist politicians, and also some Nationalist politicians, concerned what they regard as the number of non-elected bodies in the North, of which there are approximately 150.  Building on this document, there is now an opportunity to replace those bodies with a democratic assembly, possibly along the lines of the Strand One document, which will give them a clear input into future developments.  I welcome the projected framework for a North-South body and there are many areas in the consultative and the Executive process where both communities can work closely together.</P>
    <P>I say to our fellow countrymen and women in Northern Ireland that this <Col N="1542" /> document should be seen as a platform on which to reach a lasting and comprehensive settlement which is what everyone in this House desires.  It is not a threat to them or their freedom in the future.</P>

      <P>Tá mé ag labhairt anseo thar cheann an Chomhaontais Glais, The Green Party, agus seo ár gcuid tuairimí i ndiaidh foilsiú An Framework Document.</P>
      <P>The publication of the Framework Document is welcome and not a minute too soon.  Its delay brought about a deluge of leaks and speculation which resulted in fear and suspicion among some Unionists.  I urge the Government not to confuse my solitary presence in Dáil Éireann with the potential of the Green parties, North and South in this island and in England, Scotland and Wales, to offer new and alternative ways to build on the peace.</P>
      <P>Since 1983 my party has worked with Northern Greens and with Greens in England, Scotland and Wales and we have had a common position on Northern Ireland.  That should be examined closely so that we can continue to build on the consensus we have achieved up to now.</P>
      <P>While the general thrust of the document is in the right direction and marks an advance on both the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Downing Street Joint Declaration, we remain disappointed with the fact that it is rooted in the majoritarian principle.  It is as if the authors were prisoners who succeeded in removing one brick in the wall of their cell, can now see where they should be going but as yet do not have the means to get there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two fundamental flaws in the document.  The first is its basis in majoritarianism and the second is its excess of detail.  In a framework document intended to set parameters there was no need for it to move beyond first principles.  Not only has it moved far beyond the statement of first principles, but every step it has taken away from them has been a step back to traditional <Col N="1543" /> models of decison-making based on the majority vote whether within referenda or weighted majority systems.  A statement of first principles could have begun with the statement in paragraph 12 that the absence of a democratic consensus, a norm in democratic society, is absent in Northern Ireland and that the principle task of the peace process is the construction of such a consensus.</P>
    <P>In regard to power sharing, the document rightly points to the divided nature of Northern Ireland society and recognises the two political, cultural and national identities.  The document, however, seems to offer models which have caused partition in countries such as Czechoslovakia and civil war in Bosnia. Technical fixes such as weighted majorities superimposed upon a constitutional status fixed by simple majority voting could institutionalise the divide and plunge the North into a crisis as deep as the one from which it is now emerging.</P>
    <P>If the Governments had instead focused upon the need for innovation in decision-making, particularly in advanced democratic procedures, and insisted upon the need for proportionality both for the election of parliaments and governments through a mix of PRSTV and the matrix vote, together with the need for a consentually agreed new Constitution arrived at by referendum, without spelling out the final detail, there would have been less to disagree with in the document.</P>

      <P>I will be making a fuller statement to the Dáil later today at the close of the series of statements on the issue.  In the meantime, I am glad to have this opportunity to deal with a number of questions raised by Deputies in relation to the Framework Document and the follow-up to its publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards participation in talks on <Col N="1546" /> the Framework Document, the document itself reflects agreement by the two Governments that the issues set out in it &ldquo;should be examined in the most comprehensive attainable negotiations with democratically mandated political parties in Northern Ireland which abide exclusively by peaceful means and wish to join in dialogue on the way ahead&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Ray Burke that that should include all the relevant democratic parties in Northern Ireland, and that participation should be without preconditions, except of course as regards democratic commitment and mandate.</P>
    <P>We believe also that representatives of Loyalists organisations should be facilitated in making their own contribution to the talks process, either directly to the extent of their democratic mandate, or in some appropriate form to be agreed with the other participants.</P>
    <P>We are anxious to see comprehensive and inclusive talks underway as soon as possible.  Round-table talks in the three stranded process would require the agreement of Unionist parties.  I do not believe the interests of any party will be served by standing aloof from negotiations and I very much hope they will reconsider their position.  It has been made clear their involvement in talks can be entirely without prejudice to their views on the Framework Document, and without preconditions.</P>
    <P>In the first instance I would, however, envisage an intensive pattern of bilateral contacts at various levels between the parties and both Governments and, I hope also, between the parties themselves.The Government, for its part, will be seeking to engage in such dialague with all the parties willing to meet it.</P>
    <P>The issue of constitutional balance in the Joint Framework Document has been dealt with by concentrating on the effects to be achieved on each side.  It was not considered necessary or appropriate to publish with the Framework Document detailed proposals for the actual constitutional changes needed to honour those commitments.  In the first <Col N="1547" /> place, these are a matter for the respective parliaments, and in our case, for the Oireachtas and people.  It did not seem right to bind the Governments inflexibly to detailed wording on either side, before the parliaments had an opportunity to consider the matter.  The constitutional proposals in the Framework Document are part of a balanced whole. It would not be helpful to have the proposals for constitutional change taken out of context of an overall agreement, or debated in isolation, as might have happened if actual wording had been published.  Furthermore, given that British legislation would have to enshrine arrangements which still have to be negotiated, it would be particularly difficult, as of now, to prescribe how their commitments might be met in detail.  I would not of course wish to see a situation where detailed proposals would be confined to the Irish side only.</P>
    <P>For all these reasons, we concluded that the precise manner in which the commitments on constitutional balance in the Framework Document are to be implemented are best considered in detail by the respective parliaments, in the light of the discussion and negotiations we hope to see take place.  I should emphasise that the only commitments by the Government are those on the face of the Framework Document. There are no secret understandings or side-agreements.</P>
    <P>A North-South body with executive, harmonising and consultative functions is an important part of the accommodation envisaged in the Framework Document.  I refer Deputies to paragraphs 24 to 38 of the document in particular, which set out the views of the two Governments.  As has been made clear, the ultimate shape and competence of such a body depend on the outcome of negotiations.</P>
    <P>As regards the recent leaking of material to <i>The Times,</i> the initial implication that the leak emanated from Dublin seems very questionable and the possibility that it might have come from any Irish governmental source is <Col N="1548" /> exceedingly remote.  In the absence of serious indications to the contrary, we did not consider it necessary to pursue our preliminary investigations further.  I have not been informed of the outcome of the internal inquiry instituted by the British Government in the wake of that leak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs replied to a number of questions.  He acknowledged that all parties should be involved in the discussion process but he did not refer specifically to Sinn Féin.  Does he agree that it is high time British Government Ministers had direct discussions with Sinn Féin and the Loyalist parties and will he acknowledge that both have been more constructive in their response than some of the other Northern parties that have roundly denounced British Ministers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal first with the latter part of the question.  Yes, the response has been very constructive and we welcome that.  Obviously if we have a constructive response from all parties we would be far more confident of making progress.</P>
      <P>I believe it is right to insist that Sinn Féin and all other parties should abide by the democratic rules and rely exclusively on their democratic mandates.  The logical corollary of that is that their mandate should be fully respected and that parties which accept the constraints of the democratic process should also be given its benefits such as normal contact with Government at every level, including ministerial level.  The Deputy will probably be aware that on recent occasions I have said publicly that I think it would be in everybody's interest if the British Government was able to facilitate meetings with Sinn Féin at ministerial level.</P>

      <P>Does he agree that the decommissioning of arms is an important question but that it should not be a bar to opening discussions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1549" />
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be surprised if anybody in this House disagrees with the statement that the decommissioning of arms is a very important part of this whole process.  I have said on many occasions that we accept that the war is over and that the cessation of violence is permanent.  In that respect there is no further need for armaments or explosive materials.  It is important that methods are found for the decommissioning of arms and it is also important that the priority of that concern should not be a road block to making progress in the matter.  I would like to think that progress can be made, an essential part of that progress obviously at the earlier stage would be a meeting between a Sinn Féin delegation and the British Government representatives at ministerial level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we take it from what the Tánaiste said that he has abandoned the position on which he expounded twice in this House on 1 June last, lest the House be in any doubt that there would be no discussion with any party that still maintained arms and explosives or was associated with those who did?  In view of the long series of possible happenings as set out by the Minister in his reply, will he give some likely timescale for all these arrangements and when, for example, one might foresee the establishment of an assembly in Northern Ireland or any of the other concrete steps referred to in the Framework Document and in the accompanying document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I think my position on Sinn Féin's meeting with the British Government at ministerial level is the same as the position taken by all parties at this time and that reflects what has happened since last year, the cessation of violence on both sides and the opportunity that presents to build on the peace.  This is the best opportunity I can recall in my lifetime and perhaps for the rest of it.  It is important to move with the process and I hope that can happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite difficult to put an exact <Col N="1550" /> timetable on the situation as of now. The Framework Document was published yesterday.  We have called for a period of calm reflection on the document.I hope not only political leaders but members of their parties and all citizens North and South will reflect on it. We are arranging for the dissemination of information and for the document to be made available on the widest possible basis.  It is important that people understand the document after careful reflection.  As a Government &mdash; this applies to the British Government &mdash; we are willing, ready and available to have bilateral or multilateral negotiations at the soonest possible time.  Obviously the parties in Northern Ireland will want some time to facilitate their worked out responses to the document and they should be allowed a period of time for that.  I imagine that the first couple of weeks will be a time for reflection by the parties before formal statements are made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Tánaiste agree that the constitutional section of the Framework Document is totally satisfactory and that the formula underlying it should have been published, especially as the press seem to have been briefed on it by Government sources?  When the Tánaiste was in Government with Fianna Fáil he endorsed and supported specific constitutional proposals put to the British Government.  Has his commitment to the approach taken by the previous Government and his attitude to the bottom line in those discussions weakened in any way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards whether it would have been better to publish proposals for the wording of the proposed changes in the Constitution, the ultimate changes in the Constitution are a matter for the people.  It must be presented by the Government for agreement by the parties.  It would be in everyone's interest if we could get the House to agree on the proposed amendments to the Constitution.  I do not <Col N="1551" /> believe it would be in the interests of any party in the House if there was division about the proposed wording of changes in the Constitution.  It would not be in our interest &mdash; I say &ldquo;ours&rdquo; collectively &mdash; to have a divisive debate on proposed amendments to the Constitution.The broad lines of proposals for constitutional change were discussed by the previous Government.  Neither side sought to press that discussion beyond what I would call an idicative stage. Various formulations were put forward and I have no reason to depart from them.  We did not feel it would serve any purpose at this stage because one of the key aspects of the Framework Document is that it must be taken in its totality.It would not be beneficial to have a debate focusing solely on the proposed wording of changes to the Irish Constitution until we advance other stages such as the establishment of North-South bodies, the question of an Assembly in Northern Ireland and the EU dimension.</P>

      <P>When I heard those remarks I intended to check the record of the various meetings.  We had brought it to an indicative stage in relation to possible changes of Article 2 and 3.  No formal agreement had been made by either side.  I do not want to mislead the Deputy in any way and would like to check the record of one meeting, which I have not yet had an opportunity to do, and come back to him on it.  It is necessary to have clarity and precision in this area.  Neither Government felt since then that it was necessary to bring it to completion.  The actual wording was never agreed between the Governments.  In fairness to the British Government it has always accepted that it is a matter solely for the Irish Government to come up with a wording that will honour the commitment we have given to significantly change the Constitution, as all sides have spelled out in the House.  That is a commitment I am confident we will deliver on and I would like to think it can be done with all party support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Government agree to the section on personal rights contained in the Framework Document where it refers to their being declared by a charter or covenant in view of the fact that the arrangement is valueless?  Personal rights should be underpinned by statute or preferably by a constitutional document, such as a written constitution for Northern Ireland, guaranteeing those rights and giving citizens a way to vindicate them where they feel they have been infringed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be <Col N="1553" /> aware of the complexities in this area. We want to ensure that rights are protected and developed.  It is a complex area in terms of British constitutional law.  There is a genuine worry that if a bill of rights or a constitutional format were established in Northern Ireland it would have carry over effects for England, Scotland and Wales.  There is a commitment in the document to ensuring that we develop rights along the lines in the document.  I am confident that the parties who come to negotiate will have an input into how that is done.  One thing that is agreed between all the parties in Northern Ireland and in the South is that a bill of rights for people in the North would be a welcome development.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 13 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 14 February 1995, the EU Commission adopted draft guidelines for the new initiative for Northern Ireland and the Border counties in support of the peace process.  The draft guidelines will now be considered by the Committee of the Regions, the Management Committee on Commission Initiatives and the <Col N="1554" /> European Parliament.  Once this examination process is completed, the guidelines can be formally adopted.  This is expected to take place by the end of April.  The two member states concerned will then be given four months to prepare an operational programme.</P>
    <P>As I outlined in the Dáil on 24 January, it is accepted that the greater share of the funding will go to Northern Ireland.  The Commission has indicated in the draft guidelines that the North will receive a maximum of 80 per cent of the overall funding and the South a minimum of 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>While I fully accept that the six southern Border counties have suffered from the adverse effects of the troubles in the North, I believe that the envisaged North/South division on funding for the EU initiative represents a reasonable balance.  The central theme of the EU initiative is the need to bring about reconciliation and I consider that the requirements in this respect are more acute in Northern Ireland.  I should also point out that the six southern counties represent about 20 per cent of the population of the total eligible area.</P>
    <P>I have previously indicated that I am willing to meet Deputies from the six southern Border counties in order to discuss matters relating to both the EU and US aid packages.  A meeting has been arranged with the Deputies concerned and I look forward to hearing from them at first hand their views on all of these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that many areas on the southern side of the Border are poorer, more deprived and were more badly affected by the troubles in the North than those on the northern side?  What percentages have been applied to the division of aid between North and South in INTERREG I and II, in the special aid package and the IFI?  Is it not 75 per cent/25 per cent in most cases and is 80 per cent/20 per cent a retrograde step? Will he press to have the percentage altered to recognise the critical position of many areas in the six Border counties?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1555" />
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The southern Border counties also suffered from the difficulties and consequences of decades of violence and division between the two communities in Northern Ireland. Obviously, there has been a spill-over to the Border counties, both well acknowledged and recorded.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the ratio in International Fund spending is 75:25, which would have been the guideline in the past.  On the 80 per cent/20 per cent ratio I have given as indicative, if one looks at the details in the draft, one will see 15 per cent is allocated for cross-Border projects, the remainder to be divided by way of a maximum of 80 per cent to the North and not less than a minimum of 20 per cent to the South. Therefore, there may be a need for rebalancing as the programme progresses through its various stages, when obviously the 15 per cent will be very important.  In my meeting with Border county Deputies I hope to examine the type of cross-Border projects coming forward.  What is important is that we get funding from the European Union throughout the various stages from the Committee of the Regions, the Management Committee on Commission Initiatives and the European Parliament in order to get the operational programme up and running as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 29 and 44 together.</P>
      <P>I take it these questions refer to the National Security Revitalisation Bill recently passed by the United States House of Representatives.  It requires the US Administration to deduct from its annual United Nations contribution any sums which it has spent on voluntary actions associated with peacekeeping.In addition, it would reduce the United States contribution towards United Nations peacekeeping to 20 per cent for all future United Nations missions unless the President requested the permission of Congress to increase it to 25 per cent.  The Bill will now go before the Senate where a related measure is under discussion.</P>
      <P>The American Administration has made clear its opposition to the draft legislation.  The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Mrs. Madeleine Albright, summed up the effect of the proposed legislation on peacekeeping as likely to lead to &ldquo;budgetary anarchy and a progressive inability on the part of the UN to plan, initiate or sustain peace operations&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Given that the US is currently assessed for 31.7 per cent of UN peacekeeping operations, it would be difficult to exaggerate the impact of the current proposals were they to become law. They would undermine the ability of the United Nations to mount peacekeeping operations and accordingly, would seriously affect the ability of the organisation to discharge its responsibilities to international peace and security.  The proposals, which would amount to a unilateral derogation from the obligations of UN membership, have very serious implications.</P>
      <P>I will take the opportunity in future contacts with the United States Administration and with members of the United States Congress to express the Government's concern regarding the likely impact of the current proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland, along with our European <Col N="1558" /> Union partners, is also concerned at the effect of measures adopted last year by the United States which will, as of October 1994, unilaterally reduce the US contribution to UN peacekeeping operations to 25 per cent.  This issue has been raised repeatedly in contacts between the EU and the US, most recently on 1 February.</P>
    <P>The United Nations is already severely handicapped by financial problems. On 31 January 1995, the UN was owed a total of $3.6 billion by member states; $2.2 billion of this related to peacekeeping operations.</P>
    <P>As of that date, Ireland was one of only 19 member states which had paid their regular budget contributions in full and on time.</P>
    <P>A high level working group on the financial situation of the United Nations is meeting in New York at present. Along with our EU partners, we are participating actively in the work of the group which is considering the problems of arrears, late payments and the scale of assessment for UN contributions.</P>

      <P>While thanking the Tánaiste for his very comprehensive reply and acknowledging his grasp of the importance of this matter to us and our friends in the United States of America, and they are our friends, would he agree that the cutbacks would send a very negative message about United States support for international peacekeeping?  Given our strong commitment to peacekeeping, in addition to the diplomatic efforts already undertaken, would the Tánaiste engage in a further, active diplomatic effort to get our views across?  In addition, would he say how much the United States owes in back payments to the United Nations and whether that accounts for the arrears of payments to us?  Would he say what is the amount of the arrears outstanding to us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy says on the very serious implications of this reduction, if it becomes law, for United Nations peacekeeping.  I think <Col N="1559" /> the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher, said that the ultimate effect of the legislation is that United Nations peacekeeping simply would come to an end.  That would be catastrophic, something that must not be allowed to happen and, certainly in terms of any contacts we may have with the United States, we will take this matter up forcefully with them.  We have raised it with them in the past, in particular at previous meetings I had with Secretary of State, Mr. Warren Christopher, when I raised with him the question of moneys owed to the United Nations.  We were in a strong position to do so because over the years we have always paid our annual contributions early bearing in mind the difficulties the United Nations was facing.  The United States continues to be by far the largest debtor of the United Nations, at present owing $1.087 billion, $527 million of which is for the regular budget and $560 million for peacekeeping.  To balance the equation, the United States made substantial arrears payments in 1994, totalling some $900 million.  I raised this matter with President Clinton at one of our meetings when he said he was committed to the United Nations, which is clear from his statement on the actions of Congress.  I hope they can rectify this position because we are all very conscious that the peacekeeping role of the United Nations is becoming even more important as time goes past.</P>

      <P>As part of a review of our overall requirements in the foreign policy area over the three-year period ahead, the Government has concluded <Col N="1560" /> that there is a need for a limited and selective strengthening of Ireland's network of overseas missions.  The Government has identified Eastern Europe and the ASEAN region in particular as areas where we are under represented and where it would be desirable to have resident embassies in place before Ireland assumes the Presidency of the European Union in the second half of next year.</P>
      <P>Therefore the Government has decided to establish three new Embassies and the formal agreement of the countries concerned is at present being sought.  I will give further details as soon as our consultation with the Governments concerned have been concluded and their agreement has been received.</P>
      <P>When the new embassies are established, I envisage that they will be asked to undertake additional non-resident accreditations to some other countries in the region as a way of extending our network of non-resident diplomatic relations.  Over the coming months, my Department will be carrying out a review of the arrangements for secondary accreditations to ensure that we obtain the maximum benefit from the new embassies in terms of our overall diplomatic representation abroad.</P>

      <P>In the normal course of events I am informed that Protocol requires us not to publish the names of the countries until consultations with them have been completed.  I am sure the Deputy, as a long serving Minister, would appreciate the Protocol involved. With the consent of the home Governments the intention is to establish embassies in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Malaysia.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what Protocol entails, including not disclosing <Col N="1561" /> the contents of the budget in advance, and such like.  Notwithstanding that, would the Tánaiste bear in mind that we have two embassies only on the continent of Africa, one only in South and Central America and that, apart from the regions he mentioned, there is a severe need for this country to be represented in other parts of the world?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I am afraid we have limited resources; we have a limited number of missions.  In answer to Deputy Ray Burke, on the last occasion, I said I would examine the overall question of our Honorary Consuls around the world in order to strengthen our diplomatic service.  I am conscious that we have one represenative only in the whole of the continent of South America, a remarkable achievement on the part of the person involved, Mr. Davenport, in servicing our Departmental needs.  It is a very difficult task but there is not anything like the penetration of South America I would like to see.  Likewise, in relation to the continent of Africa, where we have two embassies, we shall have six Overseas Development Aid offices by the end of this year, which will be of help to us also.  I am convinced of the necessity to expand our foreign service.  Countries of a comparative size to ours have a much greater number of embassies abroad.  I hope to expand the service and we are taking a significant step in that direction this year by opening three new embassies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister have figures on the average cost of opening a smaller type embassy?  Has any cost benefit analysis been done to ascertain the potential economic benefits to be gained from establishing embassies in countries with large populations, such as, Brazil and Mexico.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give the Deputy precise figures based on a cost benefit analysis as he requested.  I am convinced <Col N="1562" /> we need to expand our diplomatic service to promote relations with other Governments.  Also, the benefits to be gained from expanding our diplomatic service can be ascertained from examining the experience of embassies we opened in recent years.  For example, since we opened an embassy in Poland our trade with that country has increased enormously and there have been increased opportunities for Irish people to become involved in European Union programmes, such as, the PHARE programme and the TACIS programme.  The results have been very beneficial in relation to the spending of the embassy.  For a sum in the region of £0.5 million per annum an embassy could be run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's analysis.  Will he not agree that it makes a telling case for an expansion of our foreign service?  Would he agree also that there is a case, in principle, for Ireland to strive to establish embassies in countries with markets that serve a population of 40 million people or more?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy in principle, but there are such things as Estimates.  The Deputy will be well aware that there are limitations on the availability of money in terms of Estimates and expenditure.  However, we have taken a first step this year.  I hope it will be part of a process.  I will advocate in trying to convince my Cabinet colleagues that it is in our interests to expand our foreign service.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 40 together.</P>
      <P>Article O of the Treaty on European Union provides that any European State may apply to become a member of the Union.</P>
      <P>There are currently five applications for membership of the European Union on the table.  These are from Turkey, Cyprus, Malta, Hungary and Poland. The aspiration to eventual EU membership of the other associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia, and of those countries with which the Community is currently negotiating Europe Agreements, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, or expected to commence such negotiations in the near future, Slovenia is well-known.  Applications for membership of the Union from some or all of these countries and from other European countries may be made at a future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's general attitude to the question of enlargement of the European Union as expressed in the conclusions of a number of recent European Councils is open and positive.  Enlargement must take place in the context of deepening European integration and the maintenance of the Union's key policies.In the period in advance of enlargement, the Union's relations with <Col N="1564" /> the countries concerned must be reinforced through the various institutional arrangements which they have with the Union.</P>
    <P>In the case of the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe with whom the Union now has a formal structured dialogue, the Copenhagen European Council agreed that if they so desire these countries shall become members of the European Union, with accession taking place as soon as an associated country is able to assume the obligations of membership.</P>
    <P>These obligations include the stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for, and protection of, minorities; the existence of a functioning market economy as well as the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union; and adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, when agreeing a strategy to prepare the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe for accession, the Essen European Council stated that the institutional conditions for ensuring the proper functioning of the Union must be created at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, which for that reason must take place before accession negotiations begin.</P>
    <P>As regards Cyprus and Malta, the Essen European Council confirmed that the next phase of enlargement will involve those countries.</P>
    <P>The Turkish application was the subject of a Commission Opinion in 1989 which concluded that it would not be useful to open accession negotiations straight away but that a range of steps should be taken to intensify EU relations with Turkey.  Discussion on the establishment of a Customs Union with Turkey is under way.</P>
    <P>At this stage I would not wish to engage in speculation as to the duration of future accession negotiations.  This will depend in the first place on the timing of the completion of the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference and then <Col N="1565" /> on the complexity of the issues arising in the negotiations themselves.</P>
    <P>Clearly the further enlargement of the Union will offer both opportunities and challenges as far as Ireland is concerned.In particular, the accession of countries which are less developed than our own poses important questions, especially as regards the future of the CAP and of the Union's cohesion policies.</P>
    <P>The Commission is undertaking detailed studies of the implications of enlargement for the Union's policies in general, for the CAP in particular, and of the application of the internal market in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.  The results of these studies will emerge in the course of 1995 and will have an important bearing on the assessment of the issues involved in further enlargement and on the evolution of Ireland's negotiating position.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference in 1996 will consider adjustments to the operation of the Treaties designed to accommodate further enlargement.  We will be approaching that negotiation with two concerns in mind.  First, there is the need to preserve the balance in the Treaty and enable the enlarged Union to continue to respond to the needs of all of its members.  Second, the efficiency of the Union, and its capacity to serve its citizens' needs effectively must be maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for his full statement on a matter of great importance to us and Europe.  I put it to him in general terms that many of the applicant countries to which he referred and which are mentioned in Question No. 40 are likely to have a serious effect on Irish economic interests, because their interests will clash with some of our requirements, particularly in terms of agriculture.  Notwithstanding that, will he agree that we will have to balance that consideration with the political and often human rights and democratic considerations of trying to ensure membership for those countries?  I would like to see countries, <Col N="1566" /> such as, Cyprus and Malta become members of the Union.  Given that those are small countries with populations of less than one million people, will they acquire the rights in regard to commissionerships, voting at the Council and so on existing member states have or can some system be devised for small applicant states such as those and the Baltic Republics which would also fall into that category?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I tried to give a reply that was as comprehensive as possible.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that this whole area is one of enormous complexity and ten questions could be asked about each country.  I will ensure that the Deputy gets a copy of the reply.</P>
      <P>The accession of some of those countries to the Union would bring opportunities and challenges.  The greatest challenge from our point of view will be in the operation of the CAP and Cohesion funding, because the balance within the Union will obviously be tilted towards Eastern Europe.  I have had recent discussions with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and we will carry out studies on the impact of accession of those countries on our economy.  The requirements under which these countries can gain accession to the European Union are detailed and searching, for example, the capacity to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the Union.  Some of these countries would not be in a position to comply with this requirement at present.  Those countries will have to make enormous changes in relation to their accession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arises of facilitating smaller countries within the mechanisms and the institutions of the European Union.  The Deputy will be aware that there is a growing feeling in some of the larger states that the Presidency should not go to the smaller states as is the case at present.  We would object to that.  We have carried off our presidencies with style and impact and this has been well recognised.  Credit must go to the previous Government on the success <Col N="1567" /> of the last Presidency.  I would hope we will do the same next year.  Questions have been raised because of the possible accession of countries the size of Malta and Cyprus <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Commission and the Presidency.  These questions will have to be addressed in the context of negotiations.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that many of the criteria for membership of the European Union, other than economic, fiscal and monetary criteria, are the same as those for membership of the Council of Europe? Many countries such as the Baltic States, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are already full members of the Council of Europe and meet fully the demands of democracy, human rights etc.  Will the Minister accept that there are enormous economic transitional problems for these countries and that it is likely to be a long time before they are economically ready for full membership of the European Union?  Will he consider the suggestion that the precedent of special guest status, which exists in the Council of Europe, might be considered at the next Inter-governmental Conference as a half step towards enlargement of the Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy has said in relation to the similarity of some of the requirements, for example, in the area of human rights, institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law and protection for minorities.  At the same time the half way house already <Col N="1569" /> exists in the context of Europe agreements.On the one hand we are offering these countries access to our markets. We are also offering assistance to these countries in terms of strengthening their own market economies to bring them up to a level where they would be able to compete in a functioning market economy with the European Union.  I agree with the Deputy that the transitional period will be considerable given the weakness of the emerging democracies and their economic systems.  At the same time we should not underestimate the potential strength of their economies and should assist them.  The other aspect is the widening and deepening of Europe simultaneously.  We must ensure within the new European Union that there will be no return to conflict.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that many of these countries are concerned about the on-going instability in Russia and that the Europe agreements do not give any assurance in that respect?  If there was some form of special guest status, as in the Council of Europe, the umbrella protection of the European Union might be more readily understood in Russia.  Therefore, any future attempt by Russia to extend its sphere of influence might be halted.</P>

What is vital is that technical assistance is of a kind that will promote sustainable development, stimulate linkages with and training of local people and strengthen local and human institutional capacities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> I am satisfied that ASPO's work responds to needs expressed by developing countries, identified by NGOs, and is not driven by concerns about the returns to Ireland in terms of our domestic employment figures.</P>
    <P>The provisions announced in the budget regarding superannuation credits for voluntary service with APSO are further evidence of the priority the Government attaches to encouraging voluntary service by skilled Irish personnel in the developing world.</P>

      <P>I welcome the budget increase to APSO.  To ease the concerns of the Conference of Religious of Ireland will the Minister indicate the numbers of people involved and give a breakdown of the type of professional work done by APSO personnel?</P>

      <P>The Conference of Religious of Ireland welcomed the increase in ODA to £19 million which brings us to the highest level ever in our history.  This is appropriate in the Year of the Famine.  It is now 0.27 per cent of GNP.  They said they welcomed the substantial increase in ODA particularly as it means that the percentage of GNP allocated to development assistance is growing.  They also welcomed the substantial increase in the bilateral aid programme and the tax relief in contributions to Third World charities.</P>
      <P>In 1994 there were 1,143 assignments by APSO in more than 50 countries. The target for 1995 is 1,250 assignments. The majority of those assignments relate to areas such as education, health, water supply and engineering.  They are based on requests by countries in the developing world, by Irish NGOs and particularly by some of the 40 missionary organisations from all denominations who work throughout the developing world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I had the opportunity to accompany the President on her State visit to Tanzania.  Since my appointment I have met a number of Ministers from countries such as Ethiopia and Lesotho, <Col N="1572" /> all of whom commented that they highly value the skill and expertise of Irish people.  Recently the OECD in a report on the Irish development programme commended us on the quality of the personnel and type of programme in which Ireland has been involved.  The Deputy need have no fear about the quality of personnel we are sending abroad and the recipient countries have strongly expressed their appreciation, not simply to me but to the President and in various fora.  The OECD comment on the quality of work our people are doing abroad is very valuable.</P>

        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> Will the Minister confirm that her Department and APSO are well aware of the possible difficulties in coping with the sudden increase in funding?  Will she confirm that they have been making strenuous efforts to ensure the extra money is spent in the best possible way? Will she agree that the reservations expressed by Deputy Kitt would not be raised if the amount of money provided was reduced?  These reservations are of a different nature from those expressed prior to Christmas when it seemed that the interim administration was going to reduce the amount of money allocated to overseas development aid.  Will the Minister confirm that the Government <Col N="1573" /> will continue to increase ODA allocations in line with the programme for Government?</P>

We are undertaking a detailed examination of our commitments, particularly in Africa, with a view to absorbing the extra money made available in the budget. There is a timescale involved in getting new projects under way and a great deal of planning is needed, but I am confident we will use all the additional money this year.</P>
      <P>I am particularly pleased with the commitment of the Minister for Finance to allow superannuation credits for public servants who go abroad.  When I became Minister of State at this Department this was one of the matters brought to my attention by APSO, which has been of concern to that organisation for a number of years. What we are talking about here is experienced public servants who take perhaps two to three years off to work in a developing country.  Up to now if these people went abroad as volunteers they lost their superannuation for that period and had to repay it when they came back, which was quite expensive, but they will now be given superannuation credits.  That will result in a substantial increase in the number of people in that category, people in midcareer who cannot afford to lose superannuation, who will be in a position to take up assignments overseas, and will have a valuable influence on the Irish programme in subsequent years.</P>

There is no Vote for this area and it is a great achievement on his part.  Will the Minister say by what year it is expected we will reach the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP for overseas aid?  Will she indicate what is the expected yield to voluntary agencies from the tax concessions announced in the budget?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the last point, estimates have been made that the benefit to voluntary agencies from the tax concession, whereby when an individual makes a payment of between £250 and £750 a tax rebate will be given by the Revenue Commissioners to the ODA charity involved, will be possibly up to £3 million.  The benefit will depend on the extent to which individuals make contributions but I am optimistic that a substantial benefit will accrue to the charities concerned.</P>
      <P>On the question of meeting the target, in the last Programme for Government as well as in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, a commitment was given to substantially increase the ODA budget on an annual basis.  We should be in a position towards the end of the century to meet the United Nations' target.  Our contribution to the ODA budget is supplemented by the very substantial individual contributions of Irish people to the charities of their choice.</P>

      <P>Work on the preparation of the Customs Union with Turkey has been continuing since the decision taken <Col N="1575" /> by Ministers at the EEC-Turkey Association Council in Brussels in November 1993 to achieve effective completion of the Customs Union in accordance with the timetable and procedures laid down in the EU-Turkey Association Agreement and the Additional Protocol.</P>
      <P>The negotiations on the Customs Union are not yet completed.  It is hoped however, that all the remaining political and technical issues can be resolved in time to allow for agreement on the Customs Union at the next meeting of the Association Council at ministerial level which is scheduled to take place in Brussels on 6 March.  If agreement can be reached in March, it is expected that the Customs Union with Turkey will come into effect on 31 December 1995 following ratification by all the parties.</P>
      <P>Ireland supports the negotiations on a Customs Union with Turkey and we are hopeful that these can be brought to a satisfactory conclusion in the near future.  Total trade between Ireland and Turkey is small.  However, our trade with Turkey has been growing steadily in recent years and the balance is now in our favour.  The abolition of customs duties and other trade restrictions in the context of Customs Union should have a positive impact on the further development of Irish exports to Turkey.</P>

A closer relationship with Turkey, which the Customs Union would bring, will strengthen the European Union's capacity to exercise a positive influence on that country in regard to human rights issues.  The Presidency statement at the Association Council, which will conclude the Customs Union negotiations, will stress the need for Turkey to make concrete progress in this area.

Greece has particular sensitivities about the Turkish attitude to the Cyprus issue, Greek-Turkish relations and human rights in Turkey.  Recent attempts to find a solution to these problems demonstrate the willingness of other member states to take account of these concerns.  There is no question of the sensitivities of one partner being cast aside in this exercise, and the decision on the Customs Union with Turkey will be on the basis of consensus.I hope progress can be made at the meeting on 6 March.</P>
      <P>In recent years much has been written about the broader question of the relationship between Islam and the western world, about which we have to be concerned.  If we want global peace then we have to ensure reconciliation between Islam and the western world; otherwise the conflict will grow.  There are threats in various locations, and the European Union has serious concerns about the Mediterranean region and some countries in the Middle East.

These breaches of human rights are raised at meetings between the European Union representatives and the Turkish Government.  I have had discussions with visiting Turkish Ministers who are well aware of the European Union view on human rights in their country.  Our stronger relations with Turkey will assist the Turkish Government in dealing with the very difficult problems facing it, including those of human rights.  It is in everybody's interest to strengthen those relations and I am hopeful progress can be made on the Customs Union in the very near future.</P>

      <P>Ireland's first report on implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child was due in October 1994.  My Department commenced work on the report in 1993.  Its preparation has involved extensive co-ordination work with all Departments concerned in any way with the welfare of children.  I understand that all 14 Government Departments and offices have been contacted and are preparing material.  In recent months additional resources were allocated within my Department to drafting the report.  I expect that it will be finalised and submitted to the Committee on the Rights of the Child in coming months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A consequence of the ratification of a number of UN human rights instruments in recent years is that the State <Col N="1579" /> has undertaken a permanent and continuing obligation to submit, at regular intervals, comprehensive reports on the implementation of their provisions.

We have been working on the report for more than 12 months and the delay is due to the wide consultation required and the collation of material from 14 Departments and offices. Obviously subscribing to conventions increases one's requirements.  The convention covers many issues, for example, non-discrimination, interests <Col N="1580" /> of children <i>vis-à-vis</i> social welfare institutions, courts of law, care and protection facilities, standards, law and administration measures, legal administration and the responsibilites, rights and duties of parents and guardians.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 41 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have availed of all appropriate opportunities in bilateral contacts with the Turkish authorities to express the Government's deep concern about continued reports of human rights violations in Turkey such as those reported by Amnesty International.  In line with this approach, I have strongly supported the emphasis placed by the European Union on human rights issues in dialogue with Turkey.  The Union has stressed that observance of a state of law and basic liberties underlie the development of relations between the EU and Turkey and wishes to see rapid implementation of the plans for the exercise of public freedoms recently put forward by the Turkish Prime Minister. While the EU has repeatedly condemned terrorist acts in Turkey and is conscious of the problems that these <Col N="1582" /> acts pose for the Turkish authorities, it has made it clear that it expects the fight against terrorism to be conducted within the law and with full respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>In addition to raising the matter bilaterally, the EU is pursuing its concerns about human rights in Turkey in all appropriate internationnal organisations and fora, including at the session of the UN Commission on Human Rights which is currently taking place in Geneva.  The EU has also called on Turkey to grant access to an OSCE human rights mission.  The option of further steps under the Moscow Mechanism is a possibility which, in consultation with our EU partners and other like-minded OSCE participating countries, we are keeping under active consideration in the light of developments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>While I fully recognise that the Minister has expressed concern both publicly and privately in discussions with the Turkish authorities I am concerned that we are trying to reach agreement on treaties on trade with Turkey which will benefit Ireland more than Turkey.  We must never allow distance colour our view of human rights.  Now that we have secured a fragile peace in Ireland we must not enter any discussions with the Turkish Government while the human rights violations continue.  Amnesty International, which does not have any axe to grind, strongly argues that the Turkish Government is hell bent on pursuing a campaign of genocide.  The Minister should use his influence at European Union level and ensure that we do not cajole or coax the Turkish Government but rather lay it on the line that we will not participate in any discussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of our concern about human rights abuses, distance is not a factor.  We are concerned about such abuses no matter where they occur.  We are in the process of setting up a specialist unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs to deal with human rights matters.  Additional <Col N="1583" /> resources have been provided in the budget for this purpose.  This is the best way of dealing with and monitoring human rights issues on a global basis.</P>
      <P>On the question of the European Union's relationship with Turkey I have conveyed our concern to Turkish Ministers in bilateral contacts and we will continue to do so.  In relation to Turkey's application for European Union membership, the European Commission delivered a negative opinion for both political and economic reasons in 1989 but stressed that the Union had a fundamental interest in intensifying relations with Turkey and recommended a wide range of measures aimed at deepening mutual relations.  This has been restated at European Councils in Lisbon and Copenhagen.  I hope progress can be made.</P>
      <P>With our European Union partners, we are conscious of the desirability of encouraging greater involvement by Turkey in European affairs to strengthen the position of those elements in Turkey which are striving to achieve the application of European standards in terms of human rights and democracy.  A closer relationship with Turkey which will result from the Customs Union will strengthen the capacity of the European Union to exercise a positive influence on Turkey.</P>

Now that we have secured a peaceful resolution of the conflict in Northern Ireland what steps is the Department taking to alleviate the plight of the five Kurdish MPs jailed by an Ankara court having been found guilty of assisting or being members of the PKK?  Does the Minister have any plans to examine their case?</P>

      <P>The European Union has called on Turkey to grant access to an OSCE human rights mission.  The Deputy raised the possibility of Members of this Parliament travelling to Turkey.  This is a matter I will consider if members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs wish to travel there. The Deputy also referred to the imprisonment of members of the Democratic Party who were convicted and sentenced to long prison terms in December 1994.  I have conveyed our concern about this action to Turkish Ministers in bilateral contacts.  At the time of the lifting of their parliamentary immunity, the European Union expressed its concern underlying that the right to freely express one's ideas and opinions is a fundamental freedom for all, especially for Members of Parliament.The conviction and long prison sentences imposed is a matter of great regret to Ireland and to its EU partners. In its statement at the time of the sentencing, the European Union made it clear it expected the sentences would be subject to review by the Turkish court of appeal.</P>

    <Title>Framework Document on Northern Ireland: Statements (Resumed).</Title>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity of participating in this <Col N="1639" /> important debate.  In particular, I welcome the new framework for agreement.It is an important document, produced following two years of great effort by many people.  I wish to pay tribute to the Taoiseach who is leading the nation in an effort to resolve the problems of Northern Ireland.  I pay a special tribute to the Tánaiste who has been deeply involved in this process for a long period of time and to all the officials in the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Foreign Affairs who worked quietly but assiduously, here and in the North, to help to bring about the draft documents on which the Taoiseach and Tánaiste could work.</P>
      <P>It would be remiss of me &mdash; and of the House &mdash; not to acknowledge the outstanding contribution of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, in bringing about peace in Northern Ireland.  As I said on a night last November, when there was political mayhem, the main difference between Deputy Reynolds, as leader of this country and previous leaders of Britain was that Albert Reynolds and John Major were prepared to listen to everyone, evaluate what they heard and act on the basis of what they believed was best for all of the people on these islands.</P>
      <P>A tremendous contribution has been made by John Hume.  For many years he has been the champion of peace and democracy and a symbol of all that is good in the democratic process in Northern Ireland.  In his negotiations with Gerry Adams over the past number of years he was able to help focus people's minds on events in Northern Ireland.  Through his efforts, Gerry Adams was prepared to lead his people to a peaceful conclusion of the paramilitary violence that bedevilled the nationalist people and the community of Northern Ireland for the past 25 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, was the first Dublin leader who was prepared to listen to the men of violence and encourage them to embrace the peace process.  That helped <Col N="1640" /> to bring about this document.  The Irish nation owes a great debt of gratitude to the Prime Minister of Britain, John Major.  Above all, he has proved an outstandingly brave leader of a party that, for many years, did not regard Northern Ireland or its problems to be of major importance.  John Major, who was a friend of the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, realised, as a result of the constant dialogue he had with Deputy Reynolds, that it was time for action.</P>
    <P>I hope the Irish people who are fortunate to live and work in Britain will recognise the immense contribution John Major has made to bringing peace to Northern Ireland.  I hope he will remain Prime Minister for a long time to come because it is important to have stability in the leadership of Britain. The two Governments must ensure that further progress is made in bringing peace to Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The one disappointing aspect of the document is that it has not clarified the constitutional situation.  Ireland, as defined in our Constitution, is the island of Ireland and nobody can take away from that geologically, geographically or politically.  While it is a natural desire for the people of Ireland to have the ideal of a united Ireland, the Unionist people believe it is their right to be part of the United Kingdom.  We recognise that but it is important to realise that the Unionist community, the Nationalist community, the leaders of both Britain and Ireland and the people of both islands &mdash; particularly the people of Northern Ireland &mdash; have particular personal and constitutional rights, including the right to self-determination.  Political leaders have a particular responsibility to lead their people in a democratic and positive fashion.  It behoves the Unionist leaders to ensure they lead their people forward in a positive way because they have nothing to fear.</P>
    <P>Those who have been privileged to live on this part of the island since the State was founded 75 years ago can vouch for the fact that our Constitution gives equality of opportunity to all our citizens, provides free rights of <Col N="1641" /> expression and the right to participate in all types of activities, irrespective of one's religion, culture or traditions.  Any involvement by this Government should be seen as a positive contribution to ensuring a proper environment and equality of opportunity for all its people in all parts of the island.</P>
    <P>This document is a major step forward in ensuring that a system is created whereby the leaders of all the political parties and all responsible people, particularly in the north eastern part of the island, can make an individual and collective input to that system.  As a result of the system created in this new document, peace will be sustained, opportunity will be created and this country can prosper and further enhance the opportunities that exist for the people privileged to live in this island and for the country we all serve, irrespective of our traditions or aspirations now or in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to have an opportunity to bring to a close this series of statements on the Framework Document.  I am particularly happy to do so because the tone of the discussion in the Dáil since yesterday afternoon, from the Taoiseach's opening statement onwards, recognises the historic significance of the event.  There was also a keen sense of the importance of a responsible and balanced approach to the most delicate and vital process of seeking agreement on this island.</P>
      <P>The Framework Document is of pivotal importance as a statement of where the two Governments believe agreement can eventually be found through dialogue and negotiation.  As has been said by many speakers, it is not a blueprint to be imposed, but it has been carefully considered.  It marks a watershed in the search for a lasting political settlement of the underlying problems which would balance and reconcile the interests of both traditions without threatening or compromising either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It also inaugurates a decisive new <Col N="1642" /> phase in the peace process by launching political debate on the nature of the political structures and arrangements needed to consolidate that which has been achieved over the past months, and gives practical expression to the principle out in the Joint Declaration.  It signposts a path to lasting peace and stability on this island.  It is not necessarily the only path but it seems to the two Governments to be the most promising.The widespread welcome given to the Framework Document should not blind us to the obstacles that lie in the way before we can confidently say that peace is irreversible or that stability has been achieved.</P>
    <P>Nearly 16 months ago in the immediate aftermath of the Shankill massacre I made a speech in this House in which I tried to speak of the revulsion and sense of despair which that massacre had inspired.  It seemed at the time that not only had the massacre wiped out innocent lives but that it had also spelled doom for the peace process that was then only beginning to take definite shape between the two Governments.</P>
    <P>The speech, which became known as the &ldquo;six principles speech&rdquo;, was widely welcomed at the time.  I like to think it provided new impetus at the moment of near despair.  I mention that speech now because among the people who most warmly welcomed it were the Unionist people of Northern Ireland through their political leaders.  Not only did they welcome the speech for its tone, but they broadly endorsed the principle it sets out.  Those principles were not intrinsically new but drawing them together in that speech seemed to give a helpful and reassuring focus to many who were sorely troubled by the direction in which matters were heading at that time.</P>
    <P>I mention them now for two reasons. First, as far as I am concerned, those principles have informed and underpinned everything I have done since the negotiation of the Framework Document.Second, I have found it surprising that those who welcomed the assertion of those principles at the time, <Col N="1643" /> especially those who welcomed them from a Unionist perspective, appear unable to see that A New Framework for Agreement seeks essentially to translate those principles into practice.</P>
    <P>Since I began negotiation on A New Framework for Agreement and in all the many meetings devoted to it I have tried at all times to keep the need for balance to the forefront in every calculation.The balance I have had in mind is the balance between two legitimate and equal sets of rights.  I could not preserve that balance by setting out to undermine Unionists' rights anymore than I could have done it by selling Nationalists' rights short.  I do not believe that A New Framework for Agreement does either.  If it did it would not have been consistent with the first principle I asserted then, namely that people living in Ireland, North and South, without coercion or violence should be free to determine their own futures.</P>
    <P>The balance that has been struck in A New Framework for Agreement, especially the constitutional balance, is true to that principle.  It seeks to vest the future of Northern Ireland in the hands of the people of Northern Ireland and no one else.</P>
    <P>The second principle I asserted then was that this freedom to determine their own future can be expressed in the development of new structures for the government of Northern Ireland, for relationships between North and South and for relationships between our two islands.  That principle is fully reflected in the structural suggestions contained in A New Framework for Agreement.</P>
    <P>The third principle set out the fact that no agreement can be reached in respect of any change in the present status of Northern Ireland without the freely expressed consent of a majority of the people of Northern Ireland &mdash; free, as I have said, from coercion or violence.  I do not believe there is a significance body of opinion anywhere in this State that would dissent from this principle.  It is the most solid safeguard <Col N="1644" /> that Unionists can have and it is freely offered and given by the people here.</P>
    <P>The overwhelming majority in this State and, indeed, of Nationalists in Ireland generally repudiate all notions of an Ireland united by force or coercion, or by deception or underhand methods.  That is not just out of deference to the Unionist position.  They believe that to speak of Irish unity other than unity arrived at by freely given consent is quite simply a contradiction in terms.  It is for that reason that so many recognised at the time the force of the fourth principle I set out in that speech.</P>
    <P>If we would wish the majority at some time in the future to say yes we must and do recognise the right of the majority to say no.  If we allow themselves the freedom to persuade and to seek consent by peaceful means we must and do recognise the freedom of the majority in Northern Ireland to withhold that consent unless and until they are presuaded by democratic political means only.  We must recognise also their right and freedom to resort to democratic persuasion on their side also in favour of their own vision of future relations in Ireland and between these islands.</P>
    <P>It is for that reason also that the fifth point was clearly recognised as an essential part of the package, namely, that our belief and consent as an integral part of our approach must be included at the right time and in the right circumstances in our fundamental law.  I would ask those who now object to elements of A New Framework for Agreement to look again at those principles which they accepted and warmly welcomed at the time and to ask themselves in what way we have departed from them.</P>
    <P>I would also ask them to look at the sixth principle which promised a place at the negotiating table for those who renounce violence and to ask themselves how much longer it will be before the really important work begins &mdash; the work of building a lasting agreement which reconciles the rights and aspirations of both traditions and founds <Col N="1645" /> those rights in a new dispensation for Northern Ireland.  That dispensation will be free of threat and that is a central goal of the Framework Document.</P>
    <P>As the document makes clear, we are offering it for consideration and we are strongly commending it to the parties and to peoples North and South.  We hope there is a new beginning in our relationships.  It means addressing fundamental issues in this way; inevitably it requires movement on all sides.</P>
    <P>We have long been told that the territorial claim in Articles 2 and 3 was profoundly important to them.  Deadlock on the issue was a serious impediment to the 1992 talks.  When I spoke of this issue shortly after taking office, I could only say that the relevant provisions were not cast in bronze.  The Framework Document gives an explicit and unprecedented commitment in this area.</P>
    <P>It is not true, by the way, as some Unionist spokesmen have alleged, that offers were made in the past to change these Articles and then reneged upon. Sunningdale and the Anglo-Irish Agreement were indeed explicitly designed not to require such a change on our side.  That change is on offer now in the most forthright terms.  It would be wrong for Unionists to underestimate the difficulties which we may face in honouring that objective.  If they are sincere, they have a duty to help rather than hinder us.  It is not encouraging to find that once offered, this change is now dismissed by some as of no value.</P>
    <P>Unionists have always insisted that the wish of the people in Northern Ireland must be the ultimate test of legitimacy in their eyes.  The principle of consent suffuses the Framework Document.The guarantee of a referendum within the confines of Northern Ireland was always in the past set out as a critical criterion.  It is now on offer.  Yet it seems utterly disregarded in the reaction which some Unionist leaders have given to the document.</P>
    <P>Prime Minister Major has referred on several occasions to a triple lock where the constitutional position of Northern <Col N="1646" /> Ireland is concerned.  I have said publicly elsewhere, and I repeat it here, that where North-South bodies are concerned, there is a fourfold lock.  Let me explain what I mean.</P>
    <P>First, it is common ground for everybody that a North-South body must operate by unanimity.  That is the strongest defence mechanism it is possible for anyone to imagine.  It protects all of the interests represented in the body and, in particular, the Unionist interest.  It is the most absolute possible guarantee that the body must always work exclusively by agreement, and that there can be no question of any interest having overruled.  If there is a Unionist objection to such a body, it cannot possibly be on grounds of loss of control.</P>
    <P>Second, is the problem that the body might be used to override the constitutional or democratic wishes of the people of Northern Ireland.  That might be alleged of some other North-South models envisaged in the past.  Unionist representatives made clear their strong views on this issue in the 1992 talks and elsewhere.  We intend to do our utmost to meet these concerns.  A New Framework for Agreement sets out to ensure that this accountability should be to an assembly representing the people of Northern Ireland themselves.  In short, if there is a Unionist objection to such a body, it cannot be on the ground of threat to the democratic wishes of the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Third, is the objection that the North-South body would deal with matters which might be of interest to the people of Northern Ireland.  On the contrary.  It is accepted that the agenda of the body would be sharply focused on matters of mutual interest.  That these exist in abundance is evident from the testimony of a formidable array of economic, professional and cultural organisations which have, in recent years, discovered the potential and value of such co-operation.  The North-South body will therefore meet the criterion of enlightened self-interest, for North and South alike.</P>
    <P>Is the objection that the North-South <Col N="1647" /> body might give the South a say in some aspects of activity in Northern Ireland? The answer is that it may do so, by agreement, but also on the basis of reciprocity.There is no question of the South gaining a partisan influence over the North or indeed <i>vice versa</i>.  Our vision is rather that both North and South would combine their resources, on a basis of equality, and agree to do together some things which can more effectively be handled in that way than either could achieve through isolated efforts.  There are many areas where the co-operation can give us an overall impact far greater than the sum of the parts.  If there is Unionist objection to a North-South body, it cannot be because it does not make economic sense.</P>
    <P>Four generations since its foundation, Northern Irealnd remains divided in a way that has no parallel elsewhere on these islands, and indeed few anywhere. The two communities there disagree profoundly on the most fundamental issues of identity, allegiance, and national aspiration.</P>
    <P>The Nationalist tradition in Ireland has evolved to the point where the principle of consent is now firmly established as a central tenet.  It recognises that a solution will never be found simply by substituting one coercive relationship for another.  There will be no change in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without the consent of a majority of its people.  Any Nationalist leader who sought to proclaim the contrary would be disavowed by the Nationalist tradition as a whole.</P>
    <P>But, as Seamus Mallon and others have pointed out, consent is a coin with two sides.  If, as I believe, Unionists have a perfect right to invoke it against any imposition of a united Ireland, they must not disdainfully deny its relevance to the Nationalist community within Northern Ireland.  They sometimes hint that most Nationalists there secretly prefer the Union.  At the last European elections &mdash; where tactical voting is at a <Col N="1648" /> minimum &mdash; almost 39 per cent of the electorate voted for parties whose commitment to a united Ireland ranged from the explicit to the vehement.</P>
    <P>The Unionist quest for external legitimacy is inextricably bound up with the question of internal legitimacy.  The persistent failure of Unionist leadership to acknowledge this central reality is a key to the sense of isolation which the Unionist community finds so baffling and hurtful.</P>
    <P>There is no consent across the communities in Northern Ireland at present for either of the sovereignty options open to them.  Perhaps there may never be.  That reality can be handled in one of two ways.  We can say, as Unionists tended to, that &ldquo;Northern Ireland is in the United Kingdom; there is a Unionist majority there.  Let Nationalists knuckle down to this reality.  If or when they become a majority, it will be their turn to play winner takes all.&rdquo;  That formula was in place for more than 50 years, and, ultimately, produced thousands of dead.</P>
    <P>The alternative approach is to accept that the central political reality in Northern Ireland is, precisely, its fundamental division and majority-minority tensions.  Why should dogmatic read-across from either Westminster or Dublin prevent us from putting in place a pragmatic new dispensation for Northern Ireland which manages that reality? Why not jointly sponsor a culture of mutual respect rather than mutual denial by both communities there?</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland problem is intractable because as I have already said it is about two sets of legitimate rights, not a Unionist right and a Nationalist wrong, or <i>vice versa</i>.  Any attempt to assert one and suppress the other will end in disaster.  A relationship of mutual respect and equality is not just the best basis for agreement.  It is the only one.  There can be no victory that is not a victory for all.</P>
    <P>That means acknowledging that there <Col N="1649" /> are Unionist rights which must never be subject to Nationalist veto, just as there are Nationalist rights which must never be subject to Unionist veto.  Unionists would rightly scorn a Nationalist approach which said, &ldquo;We are totally respectful of all your rights, provided, of course, you do not mention the British connection.&rdquo;  They must understand in turn that the self-definition of a Northern Nationalist is someone who identifies with the wider Irish framework.</P>
    <P>Unionist offers of decent treatment on an exclusively internal basis in Northern Ireland quite simply miss the point.  The Irish dimension for Nationalists, like the British dimension for Unionists, exists whether the other side likes it or not.  The only question is whether they can be given due political expression in new structures.  If we can succeed, for the first time, in creating arrangements which actually match the complex realities in Northern Ireland we shall be well on the way to stability, which is ultimately only another word for agreement.</P>
    <P>The Northern Ireland conflict reflects unresolved issues in the wider British-Irish relationship.  It is wrong to throw the entire onus of finding a solution on the Northern parties, who are in a situation not of their own making.  It is unrealistic to expect them, unaided, to have the room for manoeuvre to do so. That is why the two Governments must give the lead.  The Framework Document is not intended as a rigid blueprint to be imposed.  It is intended above all to give an impetus to creative political thinking.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document is of course intended as an aid to comprehensive negotiations, and not a substitute for them.  The two ceasefires mean that, for the first time in more than a generation, the Governments and political leaders in Northern Ireland can set about the search for agreement free from the immediate shadow of violence <Col N="1650" /> on either side.  Subject only to a common commitment to democratic procedures, these talks should be as inclusive as possible in participation and as comprehensive as possible in agenda. The issues at stake are too important for any significant group to be excluded. They are also too important for any group to exclude themselves.  The definition of stability in Ireland is agreement between the main currents of the Nationalist and Unionist traditions. Unionists must however address that reassuring reality in a spirit of opportunity, rather than of veto.</P>
    <P>Northern Ireland was born in conditions of the most bitter controversy and is still marked by it.  It is self-evident that each community there has the capacity and the determination to resist coercion by the other, if either side ever sought to impose it.  The only alternative to the politics of accommodation is the politics of mutual frustration.  Irrespective of how the choice of sovereignty ultimately falls, the people living in the area, and whatever Government exercises jurisdiction there, will in either case face the challenge of ensuring harmony, trust and co-operation in a deeply divided society.  The Northern Ireland framework was in the past seen as a contrivance to enable one community to dominate the other.  The goal now &mdash; and especially, I would have thought for Unionists &mdash; is a new dispensation for Northern Ireland, across all its relationships, in which both communities can feel an equal sense of ownership and involvement.  It must seek to encompass and reflect as fully as possible, rather than to curtail or deny, the differing identities and aspirations in all their diversity.</P>
    <P>Without prejudice to either aspiration, it would be an act of great statesmanship to remould Northern Ireland structures to serve, by agreement, a continuing need of equal importance to both sides.  They could be developed as a framework specifically dedicated and <Col N="1651" /> adapted to expressing and reconciling the rights of both communities.  The area could be endowed with institutions and arrangements designed to cater for the unique requirements and sensitivities of a society as yet deeply at odds on fundamental constitutional issues.</P>
    <P>Such an approach would not solve the conflict of sovereignty, but it might greatly diminish it as a polarising influence.The stark hopes and fears invested in it would be lessened, since it could be accepted by all that the structures to guarantee rights and ensure political expression for both communities in Northern Ireland would continue irrespective of who filled the majority of minority roles, or where ultimate sovereignty might lie.  Peace in Northern Ireland will not be consolidated by limiting the horizons, but by raising them. If the Northern Ireland conflict could have been resolved by tinkering at the margins it would have been done long ago.</P>
    <P>The Framework Document offers a new and better alternative.  The Members of this House have been generous in their tributes to the Framework Document.  In turn, I wish to express my appreciation for the support which the Government has consistently had from the Opposition parties while the document was being negotiated.  We all have the same end in sight &mdash; a new dispensation on this island which will permit the rights of both main traditions to be safeguarded and brought into balance with each other.</P>
    <P>We all want to see a new Ireland in which neither identity feels threatened or oppressed by the other and each can live in peace with the other.  We all want to see an agreed Ireland in which anachronistic fears and suspicions are laid to rest and co-operation replaces confrontation once and for all.</P>
    <P>Many of these points have been made to great effect during this series of statements. I echo the recognition by many <Col N="1652" /> Deputies of the deep fears which exist in the Unionist community.  With yesterday's publication of the Framework Document, the Government has confirmed its readiness to address these fears in early and wide-ranging dialogue with the Unionist parties.  We want the Unionist population to know that we understand their concerns and are ready to seek ways of allaying them in frank discussions with their elected representatives.</P>
    <P>The essential issue is trust.  The two Governments have outlined what we consider would be a fair and balanced settlement.  We have strongly commended our proposals to the parties for their consideration.  We have equally made clear that what we offer is merely a discussion document and that nothing in it will be, or could be, imposed. Agreement and consent are the key and will always be the key.</P>
    <P>We have no hidden agendas or ulterior motives.  The face of the document tells it all.  Our commitment to consent is absolute and unqualified.  We do not question for one moment the right of people to say that they disagree with our conclusions or that they will not consent to a certain proposition.</P>
    <P>All that we ask them to do is to accept our good faith, to recognise that a serious and honourable effort had been made to suggest a possible accommodation and to sit down with us with open minds and tell us what they like, or dislike, about our proposals.</P>
    <P>The way forward, as the Framework Document so clearly signals, lies in frank and sincere dialogue among all concerned with this problem.  If there are disagreements over the document, let us hear about them.  Let us hear counter-proposals for the achievement of the same objectives.  We cannot overturn past failures.  We cannot undo mistakes which have been made by both traditions on this island in their dealings with each other.  But we can begin a journey together towards a new future. <Col N="1653" /> I ask the Unionist leaders to set out with the two Governments and the other parties on that road.</P>
    <P>Prior to the publication of the Framework Document concern was raised by many as well as by those across the water and there was a very serious attempt made to blow the Governments off course.  I refer to the malicious and selected leak of parts of this document to the London <i>Times</i> some weeks ago. That was a very serious leak by persons who had no interest in securing peace on the island of Ireland or in allowing progress to be made in securing peace. It presented difficulties for both Governments but, as I said at that time, if somebody had set out to maliciously leak in the other direction and select parts of the document it could have been done and one could have brought the same response and reaction from the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  Both Governments were determined, however, not to be thwarted in their efforts or to be blown off course and I commend the British Prime Minister and his Government for their pragmatism in dealing with the malicious events that took place at the time of the publication of those leaks.</P>
    <P>We set out to convince people that this document had to be looked at in its totality.  As we said on many occasions there will not be winners or losers in regard to this document.  Many Members said there are aspects of the document which on the one hand the Nationalist community will not be 100 per cent satisfied with but, as we said at Question Time today, they have, in fairness, responded in a pragmatic and realistic way to the document.  They said they will give it the time and consideration which I believe it deserves. Obviously we are disappointed with the reaction from other quarters and that is why I itemised at the beginning of my contribution the basic tenets of the six principles.  I genuinely believe that if the Unionist community give this document <Col N="1654" /> the consideration it deserves they will see that it is non-threatening, that it will not be imposed on anyone and that was never the intention of either Government.</P>
    <P>It is worth recording what the Governments set out to do originally and how we tried to bring this process to a conclusion.  The three strand talks which took place in 1992 came to an end in inconclusive circumstances.  Many people were critical at that time. Despite the fact that they did not come to a conclusion those discussions were encouraging.  It was the first time in many years that the parties both North and South were in a position to go to the negotiating table.  In their own way, they created a momentum for the discussions.</P>
    <P>It was not possible to bring the parties back to the table for various reasons. For the last two years, the Dublin and London Governments were ready to go to the negotiating table, as was the SDLP, but the Unionist parties, for their own reasons, said they would not go back to the negotiating table.  We have to find a way to break that log jam.  On the one side, we had the development of the peace process and on the other, the development of the Framework Document.</P>
    <P>One of the most important events to take place in recent years was the signing of the Downing Street Declaration. That gave a new impetus and momentum to the process.  Last autumn we had the IRA cessation of violence, followed by a cessation of violence by the combined loyalist military command.  These events were of major significance towards attaining the goals we set out to achieve.  It had been profoundly held by many people that if we could bring an end to violence it would make finding a solution to the problem somewhat easier.It obviously would still not be a simple matter but it would be made somewhat easier.  One of the conclusions of the Opsahl Commission, correctly <Col N="1655" /> expressed by the late Professor Opsahl, was if you could end violence in Northern Ireland you could make progress in ending the political conflict.  The combination of the Downing Street Joint Declaration and the cessation of violence by both sides was of major significance.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, for his unprecedented and invaluable work in regard to the conflict on this island.  The cessation of violence changed the atmosphere.It has presented us with a challenge to bring the process to a conclusion and that will require parties on all sides to come to the negotiating table.  Some parties have said they are willing to do so and it is important that the widest possible spread of parties should be represented.</P>
    <P>There are recognised difficulties which have been stated in recent days, for example, the Unionist party say they will not negotiate with Sinn Féin and see no way to change their minds on that at present.  Whereas the British Government is having pre-negotiation talks with Sinn Féin, it is not prepared to have meetings at ministerial level with them, over the last number of months Sinn Féin has participated in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation and made a considerable contribution to that body.  It has said it wants to enter into negotiations with the British Government and we have been encouraging the British Government to provide the facility to allow for an historic meeting to take place at ministerial level between it and Sinn Féin.  That is an important part of the process we are undertaking and it is essential that that happen in the near future.  It would be a recognition that the campaign of violence is over, as is widely accepted.  We must ensure there is no going back to that campaign.</P>
    <P>I have detected from people on both sides of the Northern divide a strong <Col N="1656" /> yearning to ensure that the peace established in recent months is not squandered.That is the biggest challenge facing the British and Irish Governments and all the parties in Northern Ireland. We have a duty and an obligation to ensure that everything is done to preserve that peace.  It is a reality that there can be no going back to the violence, divisiveness, hatred and bitterness which we have seen in Northern Ireland for the last 26 years.</P>
    <P>It must be accepted that there are differences and those differences will persist but the people in Northern Ireland want their politicians and leaders to make themselves available for discussions and negotiations between the parties and with both Governments. Despite the fact that we were criticised in recent weeks for attempting to produce a Framework Document, the Governments have been responding at all times to statements made by political leaders in Northern Ireland over a number of years.  When the leaders found they were not in a position to come to the negotiating table they put the onus back on the Governments.  It had been accepted by both Governments that we would want to give the lead in what would happen.  In giving a lead we have sought to achieve a balance in the document presented yesterday.</P>
    <P>If people are reasonable and fairminded and try to overcome the baggage of history which we all inherited they will find the document is balanced in all aspects.  We are trying to address the divisions and background which have made Northern Ireland a divided State.  They are complex issues and need to be catered for carefully.  That is the Government's intention.  We set out to allay the fears on both sides.  There are serious issues on both sides.  There is the proposed constitutional amendment by the people of the South.  That is a matter of great importance to the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland and to the community in the South.  The <Col N="1657" /> Government is prepared to deal with that in a way which I believe fulfils the commitment given to the British Government and which will be accepted by the people in the Republic when the time comes to put a referendum to them.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we should have published the wording of the proposed amendment to the Constitution.  I do not believe that would be the best course of action at this stage, not that there is anything to hide or run from. What is important is that the main components of the Framework Document consist of a number of major elements. On the one hand we have the constitutional issues where both Governments have obligations.  The Irish Government, with the concurrence of the majority of the people in a referendum, have an obligation to bring forward amendments to Articles 2 and 3.  That is a commitment which has been fairly given and will be honoured by the Government and, hopefully, by the people.  From the tenor of the debate it appears it will be supported by the vast majority of Deputies.  The British Government also has an obligation to bring forward change, be it in the Government of Ireland Act, through amending legislation or new legislation.</P>
    <P>Many people of the Unionist persuasion have great fears about the imposition of cross-Border bodies on this island.  I should like to dissipate some of those fears.  In the way the Framework Document is structured it will be evident to anyone who cares to study it with an open mind that we are trying to bring about co-operation between North and South in areas where we have neglected it in the past, for example, the economic area, tourism, trade, education and health where it is obvious and practical that it would be far wiser for us to deal with these matters on a cross-Border basis.  That does not undermine sovereignty in the South or in the North, and should not <Col N="1658" /> be seen as threatening.  I heard some responses already today demonstrating that the Framework Document does not mean an awful lot to the unemployed and marginalised people in Northern Ireland.  I accept that, in terms of its formulation, dealing with constitutional and other issues, it does not seem to have an immediate impact on those seeking better prospects for themselves and their families.  Nonetheless, within the arena of economic realities covered by its contents, their prospects would be far better.</P>
    <P>I hope that the conference on investment to be held in Washington in May will be a first and obvious indication of the economic benefits that will follow from peace on this island.  It will afford the Government, the parties in Northern Ireland and the British Government an opportunity to address that major conference, to be opened by President Clinton, as further testimony of his interest in finding a resolution to the conflict on this island which will be attended by many large corporations, those interested in investing in Ireland and within the European Union.  In that respect, I hope it will afford us, as a Government, and the parties in Northern Ireland, an opportunity to convince potential American investors, those in corporate America interested in entering the large markets of the European Union, that Ireland is a very attractive place for investment within that Union.  I hope that conference will be the first obvious indication to people in Northern Ireland asking the very obvious question, apart from the politics, what is in this document for those who want work and better educational opportunities, accompanied by better prospects in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The last aspect of the Framework Document is its European Union dimension.  On many occasions in this House we have discussed the various programmes emanating from Brussels, of major importance to cross-Border <Col N="1659" /> counties, North and South, which will be coming on stream, coupled with the most recent package being discussed in Brussels, representing its direct response to the peace process.  I pay a special tribute to the former President of the European Commission, Jacques Delors, who, when the British and Irish Governments approached him in the aftermath of the cessation of violence in Northern Ireland, was immediately forthcoming in his willingness to ensure a package would be devised by the Commission, for approval by the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, now coming to fruition.  That too will be extremely important.</P>
    <P>Nobody in Northern Ireland should feel threatened by the Framework Document.  If they take the time to look at it in a reasonable manner they will see that both Governments have set out to present, in a balanced and fairminded way, our best understanding of the present position in Northern Ireland and a framework for possible development of its future, one in which people, of whatever tradition, persuasion or political affiliation, can find a balanced accommodation within which to live their lives.  The cessation of violence over recent months on this island has brought a great sense of relief, very obviously reflected in Northern Ireland, its people having borne the brunt of the difficulties but is reflected in the South also because we too have borne some of the brunt of that violence.  For many years events on this island have brought a sense of shame to the people of this country.  We are given an opportunity now of lifting that sense of shame, of developing peace on this island.  It is my belief that, only when we have permanent peace, agreement on Northern Ireland and <i>vis-à-vis</i> the future of this country, the island of Ireland will continue to develop within the European Union, as committed Europeans, to bring about the economic prosperity we <Col N="1660" /> all seek.  It will be then only we can fully develop this island economically, culturally and throughout the many other aspects of life.  That time is long overdue.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - North Dublin Water Supply.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to raise the crisis with regard to the water supply in the north Dublin region.  It is ironic that, at a time when many Members representing the midlands and west complain about very heavy rainfall and huge water levels, the Dublin area water supply is and for some time past has been in crisis, in that the 320 million litres of water annually produced by Dublin Corporation and the approximate 90 million produced by Finagal County Council barely meet the demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many areas of the north side of the city there is continuous throttling back each night, sometimes total shut-off of supply for extended periods, and long periods of poor pressure, especially at night, upsetting many people.  There are many stories of people such as pregnant women being unable to take a drink of water at night because of an unannounced diminution in pressure or total shut-off.  The areas most severely affected stretch right across my constituency from Clonshaugh and Artane across to Raheny, including many others on the northern fringe of the city such as Finglas and Glasnevin across to Killester.In all those areas in recent weeks and months there has been totally unacceptable pressure and supply of water.  I acknowledge that there has been significant investment recently to improve the overall position but, unfortunately, it was too little, too late.  For example, there has been the 1B contract scheme at Ballymore Eustace which increased water output in 1992 to 50 million gallons daily, accompanied by many other measures by way of telemetry, rehabilitation of water mains, <Col N="1661" /> stoppage of leakages and water conservation generally.  Dublin Corporation and Fingal County Council have launched major plans, attempting to prevent current leaks.</P>
    <P>That being said, some more recent developments such as the north arterial water main, although having improved the water supply distribution, has not increased overall output.  Residents on the north side of the city desperately await the completion of the Leixlip water treatment plant costing £2.3 million to afford them some degree of respite from water supply difficulties. Engineers within Dublin Corporation and Fingal County Council have drawn up major development plans.  We know the overall demand on water supply to this city will be 450 million litres of water daily by the end of the century. For instance, there was the recent production of the 1994-99 development plan for water supply and main drainage within Dublin Corporation and County Dublin, the greater Dublin region.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say why the mandarins in her Department stopped contract 1C six months ago, designed to significantly increase water supply at Ballymore Eustace at a cost of £33 million. We understand that Dublin Corporation had obtained planning permission, had everything in place to commence work, when suddenly the Department of the Environment pulled the plug.  We are told this will necessitate a year-long study.  We do not need a study, we know the problem, its size and how desperately residents on the north side of the city, in particular, require an expansion of the water supply to them.  Can it be that there is another agenda, perhaps to privatise our overall water supply, because of the significant investment that may be required over the forthcoming ten years, amounting to some £100 million?  If that is so we must immediately stop following it.  We must support the efforts of our local officials in providing a water supply that meets <Col N="1662" /> the requirements of the city.  Major housing developments are under way in Fingal, in my constituency.  While I welcome the additional housing for people and the work such development provides I question whether we should give planning permission for such development if there is not an adequate water supply in the area.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy McManus, and my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, have a fine record in tackling difficult problems.  Perhaps one of the most difficult they face in the Department is that posed by the inadequate water supply in the city.  As the Labour leader in Dublin City Council and one who represents a small part of the Fingal area I am sure I speak on behalf of all citizens.  The problem requires urgent action and the Minister should sanction the approval of contract 1C immediately and implement the development plan for an adequate water supply in the greater Dublin region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for raising this issue.</P>
      <P>Matters relating to the operation of water services, including the maintenance of supplies and pressures, are the responsibility of the local authority concerned, in the present case Dublin Corporation and Fingal County Council. My Department's functions relate principally to the prioritising and financing of new or improved water and sewerage facilities from among proposals submitted by the local authorities.</P>
      <P>My Department is in regular and close contact with the Dublin local authorities so as to ensure as co-ordinated an approach as possible to capital works and to anticipate and respond to new requirements and problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> I am aware there was widespread disruption in water supply the weekend before last, which affected most of North Dublin and which was the result of a major fracture in a water main at the Leixlip water treatment plant, operated by Fingal County Council.  The fault in a vital water main required urgent remedial work and faced with this emergency the county council had no option but to suspend supplies so as to carry out repairs.  Every effort was made, via the media, to notify consumers affected and to minimise disruption.</P>
    <P>The problems being experienced with the water supply in the Dublin area are now largely related to quantity.  These problems are being addressed on a number of fronts: source augmentation, the provision of trunk delivery mains and the refurbishment of the various distribution systems.</P>
    <P>The Department's programme of capital improvement works continues to provide for schemes which will improve water supply in Dublin's northside. These include a phase of the north Dublin city arterial water main costing in the region of £3.4 million.  This was recently commissioned and is designed to provide significant improvements in the water supply to the north city area.</P>
    <P>In addition, major construction works are currently in progress at the Leixlip water treatment plant to increase the intake and production capacity of the plant for supply to the greater Dublin area.  The works in progress involve the provision of a new intake works and raw water delivery system which will overcome the operational problems associated with the existing intake.  The new intake works costing in the region of £2.7 million are scheduled for completion before autumn 1995.</P>
    <P>Work has recently commenced on a £8.6 million project to refurbish the existing water treatment plant and to increase its water production potential <Col N="1664" /> by more than 50 per cent.  This increased capacity will yield up to 15 million gallons daily in extra water supply and will have particular benefit for the north Dublin area.  It is anticipated that these works will be substantially completed by the end of 1955.</P>
    <P>The major improvement-expansion works at the Leixlip plant and the construction of the north Dublin arterial water main are being co-financed under the EU Cohesion Fund.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, my Department has recently commissioned a major study of water requirements in the Dublin region.  The main objective of the study will be to provide the strategic framework within which investment in water infrastructure in the region will take place over the next ten years.  This will include an examination of the extent to which conservation and the recovery of leakage losses can contribute to meeting the region's increasing water demands. This strategy study will be substantially completed by the end of 1995 and will provide valuable guidance for the future management of Dublin's water resources.</P>
    <P>Substantial investment is being made in north Dublin's water infrastructure and in related strategic planning.  I assure the Deputy that everything possible, both in the short and the long terms, is being done to ensure that an adequate supply of good quality drinking water is available to the people of Dublin.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Proposals for Irish Steel.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, for coming in this evening to reply to the debate.  I have raised this matter because it seems to be difficult to get full information about proposals in respect of Irish Steel and other companies, such as TEAM Aer Lingus which is not under the remit of the Minister.  Information about such <Col N="1665" /> companies has been issued in a fragmented and haphazard fashion.  The Minister issued a press release on Tuesday or Wednesday evening following a Government decision on Irish Steel.  I thought the press release was prepared very hastily and it certainly posed more questions than gave answers.  I have raised this matter on the Adjournment because of a lack of transparency in terms of information on this issue.</P>
      <P>When we were in Government we were positive and helpful towards Irish Steel and we wish to remain so.  The previous Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, negotiated with the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern on securing approval, in principle, for an injection of funds into Irish Steel.  That positive and helpful attitude towards Irish Steel remains within our party but it is difficult to maintain our stance in view of the sketchy information we are receiving.Not only members of the Oireachtas but the public are entitled to receive full information on this matter as they pay the taxes which will be invested in this company.  Will the Minister indicate the precise proposals for Irish Steel and when he will present them to the European Commission?  Is there flexibility regarding the amount to be invested and can additional funds be provided at a later date?  Is there a bottom line as there was when the survival plan for the company was submitted to Cabinet and received approval, in principle, last autumn?  Does the Government intend to retain any stake in Irish Steel?  The Minister's statement was extremely vague on that.  Has Irish Steel met its budgetary and performance targets as set out in the survival plan?</P>
      <P>Since I tabled this matter for the Adjournment I had a satisfactory conversation with the Chairman of Irish Steel and received information from him.  I applaud his open approach when I sought information from him.  The public deserve to be informed of the full facts and not to be given an unclear statement.  It is time they are given full information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1666" /> As we move from providing State subsidisation or protection for commercial State bodies to commercial viability, it is important that the public be appraised of the facts, otherwise an incoherent and incomplete picture emerges resulting in confused reporting which may have adverse effects on the company in question.  I understand the workforce in Irish Steel has made strong efforts to meet its deadlines, productivity levels and budgetary targets and that the chairman and the board are intent upon that.  Yet the picture presented is entirely different.</P>
    <P>While Irish Steel is under the aegis of this Minister, TEAM Aer Lingus is the responsibility of another Minister.  In recent days startling stories have emerged about TEAM and the employment prospects of a number of people appear to be under threat again.  Why was that story allowed to develop?  I urge those commercial State-sponsored bodies and the responsible Ministers to lift the aura of secrecy surrounding those companies and be forthcoming regarding proposals for them.  If they are so they will find us, the Opposition, and the public at large, open to persuasion.Certainly the public need to be informed and receptive to the full disclosure of the facts.  Otherwise Irish Steel is being done a disservice.  Is there a regular way in which the viability plans &mdash; the two we have had and those to come from the commercial State-sponsored bodies &mdash; can be examined? There is a need for a committee other than the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies which has no powers of compellability and can only examine matters in a <i>déja vu</i> sense. It does not have the resources to conduct the kind of audit and vigilant monitoring of which I speak.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for coming into the House.  I ask him to answer precisely the questions I have posed.  Will he agree that it is better that such facts are not extracted unwillingly from a body, <Col N="1667" /> agency, Department or group but they are encouraged, as I encourage Irish Steel in this instance, to make the facts known?  They will then find favour with the public in their onerous task.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not true that I have been less than forthcoming with information but the Deputy must be aware that there is information which is commercially sensitive in all such companies and in all such negotiations that we might embark on.  As an example of my willingness to provide information, I have answered fully the Deputy's questions about what would be interpreted by many Ministers as the day-to-day workings of a company for which I am not responsible to the Dáil.  I have today given detailed production figures in order that the public and the Opposition spokesperson would be properly informed.  I reject any suggestion that our press release or decision-making was hastily put together.  In order to understand the position of Irish Steel&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and its future prospects it is necessary to outline the recent history of this company.  Irish Steel is a small steel producer, producing a range of basic steel products, about 85 per cent of which are exported. In commercial terms the company has always been marginal and profits generated during upturns in the steel business cycle have always been inadequate to carry the business over the downturns in the cycle.  By June 1993 the company had accumulated losses of £118 million and without a radical restructuring was always unlikely to achieve long term viability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The early 1990s was a time of crisis in the European steel industry generally <Col N="1668" /> and the problems at Irish Steel started to come to a head in 1993.  The company lost £13 million on a turnover of £58 million in that year.  The company was projecting a similar level of loss for the year ended June 1994 and during 1993 tried unsuccessfully to negotiate a cost reduction package with the workforce.</P>
    <P>My predecessor, Deputy Quinn, engaged outside consultants, Simpson Xavier, at the end of 1993 to assess the Irish Steel viability plan.  The subsequent Simpson Xavier report was critical of the 1993 plan and a new viability plan was drawn up by Irish Steel at the end of April 1994.  This aimed at reducing the cost base of the company by £8.4 million net per annum through a combination of redundancies, cuts in basic pay and a three year pay freeze from July 1994 and by securing cost reductions from suppliers.  As everybody is aware, there were many difficulties throughout the summer of 1994 before the plan was finally agreed. The plant was reopened, to implement the plan, on 27 September 1994.  The board submitted a final plan to return the company to profitability within a period of three years on 28 November 1994, which included a request for £50 million &mdash; £40 million in equity and £10 million in guaranteed borrowings.</P>
    <P>Since taking up office I have considered the company's application for funds.  A number of issues must be addressed before the Government could approve the commitment of such large volume of taxpayer's funds to the company.Under the rules of the European Coal and Steel Community, a Government is not permitted simply to subsidise a steel plant which is not viable.  No Government aid can be granted until approval has been obtained from the Commission and all other member states.  Such agreement cannot be assumed.</P>
    <P>In considering applications for State aid to the steel industry, the European Commission apply the criterion that the <Col N="1669" /> company should obtain viability within a three-year time span.  In assessing viability, the Commission specify the gross operating margin which steel companies must achieve under normal market conditions in order to obtain lasting financial viability.  The reason State aid applications are assessed in such a demanding fashion is that the European steel industry has long been in a position of over-capacity and it is felt that State aid to particular companies should not affect competition in the industry. Other member states also view State aid to the steel industry very critically and Members of the House may have seen reports in <i>The Financial Times</i> and other newspapers during the week indicating possible opposition to aid for Irish Steel from certain member states. For all these reasons the Government in considering the application wishes to be satisfied that the application by Irish Steel for funds is properly formulated before forwarding it to the Commission.</P>
    <P>In its decision on Tuesday, the Government agreed that negotiations with the European Commission for approval of State aid to Irish Steel should be on the basis of £50 million.  It is expected that it will take some months before the Commission and the Council are in a position to take a final decision on the application.  The application to Brussels is based on the company's viability plan being fully implemented.  There is a number of individual capital investment projects within the £50 million restructuring plan.  It will have to be shown that these projects will meet the cost benefit projections that have been put forward in the viability plan before any funding will be committed to them.  In addition, the company viability plan is critically dependent on the company achieving the production and financial targets set out in the plan.</P>
    <P>During the period since October, in which the company has been implementing the viability plan, the production of finished steel products was 5 <Col N="1670" /> per cent less than budget.  The Deputy has the detailed figures available to her. This shortfall has resulted in a negative contribution to profitability of approximately £200,000.  Detailed monthly figures have been supplied in the annex to the reply.  The company argues that the shortfall arises because there is a learning curve involved for the workers in the implementation of the viability plan and that they expect the shortfall will be made up by the end of their financial year on 30 June 1995.</P>
    <P>Because the attainment of the targets is so fundamental to the viability plan I will be closely monitoring the performance of the company in the coming months.  I understand that all the employees in the company are committed to achieving the targets set down in the viability plan and I hope they are successful.  One of the recommendations of the Simpson Xavier report was that the process of attracting a strategic partner should be carried out in tandem with the reorganisation of the company. The company itself and the Government also accept the need for a strategic partner to secure Irish Steel's long term future.  A strategic partner could help improve the marketing and distribution of the company's products as well as facilitating the rationalisation of the company's product range.  A strategic partner would also be expected to contribute to the planned investment in the company.</P>
    <P>For all of these reasons the Government has now decided to open negotiations on the possible sale of shares in and control of Irish Steel Limited.  Irish Steel has spoken with an Italian company and a company from the US.  It would not be helpful or appropriate to give the names of these companies or others who may express an interest. Whether these companes will continue their interest remains to be seen.  I would expect the decision to open negotiations will generate interest from other <Col N="1671" /> companies.  In this respect the Government is currently engaging an independent specialist to advise it on this matter.The details of negotiations with any potential strategic partner will, of necessity, have to remain confidential until a conclusion is reached.  At this stage I cannot predict how or when these negotiations will end.  The process will involve our advisers dealing with companies who have already been in contact with Irish Steel and any others with a serious interest.  The advisers will also be required to evaluate the offers and make recommendations to the Government.  The size of the stake to be acquired will be a matter for negotiation.I cannot go further in detailing our intentions at this stage because of the preliminary state of discussions.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the future of Irish Steel is dependent on EU approval for the investment package which underpins the viability plan.  Second, it is dependent on the ability of the company to deliver on the targets in its own viability plan.  Third, it would be greatly assisted if a deal can be done with a strategic partner who could contribute to the success of the company.  None of these three elements can be assumed at this stage and Government action alone will not guarantee success.  Notwithstanding this, the Government is doing all it can to secure the future of the company.  I call on all others who can assist in this process to do so and to refrain from any action or statement that could be detrimental to the successful future of Irish Steel.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1672" /> I am grateful to you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter.  It is an issue I have been pursuing for the last year by means of parliamentary questions, statements on the Adjournment, debates on the Estimates and so on.  It is a matter of considerable potential importance to the east midlands area.  There is a very keen interest among the population of the area in this project.  I am anxious, like I am sure all other representatives of the area, that progress is made as quickly as possible and that the public is kept fully informed of progress.</P>
    <P>To emphasise the importance of this matter I will outline the other factors involved in that area.  The briquette factory at Lullymore closed some time ago with a number of job losses and the peat fired power station at Allenwood closed, also with a number of job losses &mdash;&mdash; from my information there are difficulties in the redeployment of former employees there to other units.  There are fears for the peat fired generating stations at Ferbane and Rhode.  In that whole area, which covers north-west Kildare and a good part of County Offaly the population settlement pattern has been heavily influenced by dependence on the peat resource.  Without further employment opportunities based on that source we can foresee very serious disruption of the population and great difficulties for the social structure of the whole area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications recently told me by way of private communication that the outgoing EU Commission, which went out of office last month, had not made a decision on the Government's application for funding for this project in the context of the Community Support Framework for Ireland.  I understand that all the information, analyses and studies requested by the Commission to assist it in coming to a conclusion on this application has been made available.  As I understand it &mdash; I <Col N="1673" /> am sure the Minister of State will confirm this &mdash; all those studies and analyses were positive in that they have shown that the project is feasible, it represents reasonable value for money and it can be expected to perform as projected.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State to press the Commission for an early and favourable decision on the application for funding. That is a crucial step in the development of this project.  I understand that more than three-quarters of the funding for this project will have to be raised commercially by way of equity, with or without additional loan funding.  I gather that the Government's intention is to seek equity partners on a competitive tendering basis.  The amounts involved are substantial.  The total projected cost of the power station is in the region of £90 million.  The application for European Union funding is for a sum of £21 million, leaving a balance of £69 million to be raised by a combination of equity and loan funding.  It is obvious with the state of markets today that a substantial proportion of that funding would have the form of direct equity injection.  It will not be easy to find £69 million for a project of this kind.  The process of assembling the funding cannot even begin until the Commission has made the necessary decision on the allocation of funding.  A favourable Commission decision will not guarantee that the project will go ahead, but it certainly will not go ahead without it.  The Commission decision is, therefore, a crucial factor.</P>
    <P>I am delighted my constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, is in the House because he is familiar with and very close to this issue.  I need hardly assure him that I will support him in whatever he seeks to do on the issue.  I would be grateful if the Minister of State would indicate the steps he proposes to take to persuade <Col N="1674" /> the Commission to take the necessary action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and affording me the opportunity to outline the position to the House.  To understand the importance of this station to Bord na Móna, it is necessary to look at the changes within the company in recent times and to look at its current status. Since the late 1980s Bord na Móna has been forced, for financial reasons, to undergo a major programme of rationalisation which included massive redundancy, resulting in the halving of its workforce of approximately 4,800 to just over 2,200 at present.  However, the company still has an extremely serious debt problem.  At the end of its last financial year, 31 March 1994, this debt stood at around £180 million of which £126 million was regarded as unmanageable.</P>
      <P>The future of Bord na Móna, and the company's ability to pay off this debt, all of which is State guaranteed, is contingent on its ability to continue to sell a minimum of three million tonnes of milled peat annually to the ESB for the foreseeable future.  Current forecasts show that annual sales of milled peat to the ESB from existing peat stations, which in 1994 were around three million tonnes, will decline rapidly over the next 20 years as older peat plants reach the end of their operating life and reserves of peat are depleted.  In this context, it can be clearly seen that the proposed station, which will use an additional one million tonnes of peat per annum, will be crucial in helping to secure the future viability of Bord na Móna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993, the board of Bord na Móna submitted a proposal to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications for a new 120MW peat fired power <Col N="1675" /> station.  Due to the availability of sufficient reserves of peat, this station would be located in the east midlands region and would be designed to take one million tonnes of milled peat annually from Bord na Móna over the next 25 years.  The total recoverable peat reserves estimated to be available to Bord na Móna for use in the proposed power station are 39 million tonnes, which is more than adequate to meet the needs of the proposed station over its expected life.</P>
    <P>The proposal is in line with Government policy on peat usage.  Ireland's energy policy has a number of broad guiding principles among which are competitiveness, security of supply and due regard to the environment.  Security of supply is of vital strategic importance to this country and to that end it is Government policy to promote as strongly as possible the development and exploitation of our indigenous resources.  The Government is committed to the continuing development of our peat resource to our maximum economic benefit.  However, this has to be done in the most cost effective manner possible.</P>
    <P>Based on studies undertaken on behalf of Bord na Móna, the main features of the new station would be: capital costs of £90 million in 1993 prices; employment of 90 in the station itself, the majority of which would be permanent; the employment of 450 at peak construction; the support of 250 permanent and 250 seasonal jobs in peat extraction when fully operational; an improved conversion efficiency factor of 36.7 per cent compared to the average of 25.5 per cent in existing peat stations and a direct income impact of £19 million during construction and £8 million annually thereafter, most of which will accrue to the local economy.</P>
    <P>The proposed new station is included as an energy measure in the Economic Operational Infrastructure Programme <Col N="1676" /> for Ireland as approved by the European Commission in July 1994 and EU financial assistance of £21 million has been sought towards the project.  At the request of the EU Commission, a socio-economic cost benefit analysis of the project has been completed by a firm of international consultants and is being considered by the Commission.  The study shows that the building of a peat station would result in a net overall benefit of just under £12 million to the economy above the best alternative, that is the building of a gas powered station.</P>
    <P>All power stations are owned and operated by the ESB.  It is envisaged that the new station will be put up for competition on the open market on a build-own-operate basis.  This would ensure that the station is built in line with best international practice.  A competition for the project would be consistent with developing EU policy on liberalisation of the electricity markets and would also conform with the Government's response to the Moriarty Task Force on the implementation of the Culliton report.  No decision has been made on the exact location of the proposed station in the east midlands.  If the Government decides to hold an open competition the final decision on the site of the station will rest with the successful bidder.  Obviously, the location of the station will be influenced by among other things, the logistics of supplying peat from the peat supplying production areas.</P>
    <P>In accordance with national and EU legislation the proposed station will be the subject of an environmental impact study.  When application is made for planning permission an environmental impact assessment will be carried out as the plant will require a licence from the Environmental Protection Agency.</P>
    <P>The cost benefit analysis is under consideration by the EU Commission.  I understand that the Minister, Deputy <Col N="1677" /> Lowry, expects to meet with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies shortly to discuss the proposal and I am confident that a decision will be forthcoming in the near future.  On receipt of this decision, the Minister will put immediate proposals to Government so as to ensure the necessary measures are put in train for the construction of the station.  It is envisaged that the timescale for the project will be in the order of four years.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Dublin Airport Ground Handling Agreement.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  The decision by Aer Rianta and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to appoint a second ground handling agent at Dublin Airport from 1 January last is of great concern to the workforce and the trade unions.  To say that the staff are angry and feel betrayed is an understatement, and the Minister will be aware of this from his meetings with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</P>
      <P>The workforce in Aer Lingus is well aware of EU directives on civil aviation and their implications.  The 1,000 plus employees in the ground handling section are aware of pending EU legislation on ground handling at European Union airports.  This legislation is due to come into force on 1 July 1996 and will be phased in over a two-year period. This will lead to further changes in competition, to which the workers are not opposed.  Change is nothing new for the workforce in Aer Lingus.  Under the Cahill plan staff had to accept major changes in work practices, reductions in earnings and the loss of approximately 1,000 jobs.  All this took place with agreement and with little industrial unrest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to implement a new policy at Dublin Airport without consultation with the workers is totally <Col N="1678" /> unacceptable.  I blame the officials in the Department who obviously have not learned anything from the experience in the recent past in Aer Lingus and TEAM.  It is not good enough to inform the workers on 17 December of changes to be introduced on 1 January the following year.</P>
    <P>I have the highest regard for the management of Aer Rianta who are doing an excellent job in developing and promoting Dublin Airport.  There is a widely held view that this premature and unnecessary decision was taken at the behest of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and that people in the Department have another agenda for Aer Lingus.  I hope this is not the case.</P>
    <P>In justifying this decision, Aer Rianta informed the workforce that it was under constant pressure from airline operators at Dublin Airport to introduce competition and that a formal complaint had been submitted to the European Commission.  Surely a complaint is no justification for introducing a change which will have major implications for the staff and possibly, the Cahill plan.  In July and October 1994 the Commission approved state aid for two other airlines, TAP and Olympic Airways, on the basis that their ground handling arrangements were similar to those at Dublin Airport.  In regard to the TAP agreement, the Commission stated that given the lack of liberalisation measures at Union level it was satisfied that each airline could self-handle Portuguese airlines.  There cannot be two standards; one cannot go in one direction when it suits and in another direction some other time.</P>
    <P>The Minister has set up a committee to consider the ground handling arrangements in Dublin Airport.  I appeal to him to rescind the decision even at this late stage and to put in place a structure to implement the EU directive on ground handling on a planned and phased basis.  The best way forward is through a planned approach by the <Col N="1679" /> workers, management and the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a statement on ground handling arrangements at Dublin Airport and to clear up possible misunderstandings.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the maintenance and operation of Dublin Airport is delegated to Aer Rianta.  This includes responsibility for ensuring that ground handling arrangements at the three State airports are efficient, cost-effective and in compliance with Irish and EU competition law.</P>
      <P>What has happened in relation to ground handling at Dublin Airport is that a very modest element of competition has been introduced in the provision of ground handling services.  To put this in perspective it is necessary to take account of a number of important developments in recent years.</P>
      <P>Under a franchise agreement dated 13 June 1988 concluded between Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus, the airline was given the sole concession to do aircraft and passenger ground handling at Dublin Airport for other airlines.  This agreement expired on 31 December 1992.  Aer Rianta continued the sole concession arrangement on a week by week basis from 1 January 1993, pending consideration of new arrangements and legal advice sought by the company towards the end of 1992 on the implications of EU competition law and the Competition Act, 1991, for their ground handling arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company's solicitors advised that an exclusive agreement could be caught by the prohibition in Article 85 (1) of the EU Treaty and result in legal action by an aggrieved party under that Article; in relation to the Competition Act, 1991, an exclusive ground handling agreement would come within the prohibition in section 4 (1) of the Act and require a licence from the Authority; <Col N="1680" /> and the grant of an exclusive agreement could amount to an abuse of a dominant position, unless it could be shown that the contract was awarded on the basis of objective criteria after open tendering procedures.  I am aware that there are other opinions on those issues.</P>
    <P>This advice was given towards the end of 1992.  Aer Rianta considered it had no option but to act on the basis of the advice which it got and appoint a second ground handling agent at Dublin Airport.To give Aer Lingus time to adjust its cost base to enable it to compete with other operators, on a number of occasions in 1993 and 1994 my Department asked Aer Rianta to defer the introduction of competitive arrangements for ground handling at Dublin Airport, particularly as airlines could self-handle there.</P>
    <P>In the light of the legal advice which Aer Rianta obtained and as a number of airlines had complained to the European Commission about the Aer Lingus monopoly of ground handling at Dublin during 1994, Aer Rianta decided in May of this year to appoint a second ground handling agency at Dublin Airport with effect from 1 January 1995.</P>
    <P>The then Minister approved these arrangements in May 1994, on the basis that he could not instruct a State body to break the law.  The new arrangement was agreed with Aer Lingus and the executive chairman of Aer Lingus was informed of the decision.</P>
    <P>As I said, an important consideration in the past has been that airlines could self-handle at Dublin Airport.  Severe pressure on the amount of space available on the ramp at the airport &mdash; brought about by an increase of 16 per cent in aircraft movements in that year &mdash; meant that new carriers could no longer self-handle, because of the physical limitations on capacity.  All operators on the ramp are obliged to follow strict safety regulations and procedures. The existing congestion on the ramp, in terms of vehicles and other equipment, <Col N="1681" /> is a potential safety hazard and I understand that a number of carriers have complained to Aer Rianta in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are also severe capacity restrictions in the passenger terminal at Dublin Airport and no space for new carrier self-handling check-in desks.  The design capacity of the terminal is 5.8 million passengers &mdash; the number of passengers handled in 1994 was 6.9 million, an increase of 18 per cent over 1993.  A major development of both the apron and the terminal is planned but phase 1 of this scheme will not be ready until 1997 at the earliest.</P>
    <P>In the last few years, a number of new low cost carriers have come on the scene.  There was no space for them to self-handle at Dublin Airport.  Also, they regarded the ground handling costs under the Aer Lingus monopoly agreement as high, given their own low costs. Apart from the fact that these carriers cannot self-handle at Dublin Airport because of lack of space, they may not be prepared to self-handle in any case because of the heavy cost involved in purchasing the necessary equipment for ground handling.</P>
    <P>The foregoing developments, together with complaints made by new carriers about the Aer Lingus agreement, brought matters to a head.  Aer Rianta decided in December 1994 to appoint a second ground handling agency, Servisair, from 1 January 1995. Servisair was already doing third party freight handling at Dublin Airport, so what was involved was extension of the Servisair contract to cover passengers as well as cargo.  As Servisair already operated at Dublin Airport with its own equipment, their appointment had the merit of ensuring no increased congestion on the ramp.</P>
    <P>Shortly after taking up office in December 1994, representations were made to the Minister, Deputy Lowry, about the implications of the new arrangement for Aer Lingus's third <Col N="1682" /> party handling business.  He felt that there was a case for further time to allow Aer Lingus to adjust and that the new arrangements should be phased in over a 12-month period.  Aer Rianta agreed to the Minister's request for a 12-month transition period.  I understand that Aer Lingus also agreed to this period.  The Minister also asked Aer Rianta to discuss with Aer Lingus management the full implementation of competitive ground handling arrangements over a period of 12 months, and whether it would be possible that only two at maximum of existing Aer Lingus customers could transfer to the second ground handler, and only 10 per cent at maximum of existing charter business handled by Aer Lingus could transfer to the second ground handler.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to term this arrangement &ldquo;competition&rdquo;.  The balance of advantage is very much with Aer Lingus &mdash; the airline cannot lose more than a very small amount of its existing business but can win new business if it is competitive.  The purpose of the transition arrangement is, as I said, to allow Aer Lingus further time to adjust so that it will be able to compete successfully with other operators.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that all the contacts between the Government and the social partners over the last eight or nine years laid heavy stress on the need for greater competitiveness and reduction of access transport costs. Nowhere is this more crucial than in air transport.  As an island nation on the edge of Europe, we require efficient, economic, speedy and, above all, cost effective transport links with our trading partners in Europe.</P>
    <P>Ireland's geographical position in the European Union represents a major disadvantage in competitiveness terms. The additional distance, time and associated cost factors contribute significantly to Ireland's transport costs &mdash; an estimated 9 per cent of export sales values, equivalent to about twice the <Col N="1683" /> EU mainland average.  The fact also that Ireland is one of the most open economies in Europe makes it essential that our competitive position in the EU is improved.</P>
    <P>I would now like to address the issue of whether we are pre-empting the EC Directive on ground handling.  As I understand it, this directive, when adopted, will apply the existing provisions of the Rome Treaty about competition law and set down the procedures to be followed.  As I said, the existing EU competition law prohibits exclusive arrangements.  Regard must be had also, of course, to the provisions of the Competition Act, 1991, which prohibit exclusive agreements in domestic law.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus has provided an excellent service in the past and the introduction <Col N="1684" /> of this limited competition should not be seen as reflecting in any way on its performance.  The quality of the airline's service has long been recognised by customers and the industry.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Lowry, met a delegation of the ICTU on Thursday, 9 February 1995, and there was an exchange of views on the new ground handling arrangements at Dublin Airport. The ICTU representatives requested a separate meeting to discuss the matter further With all the interests concerned, namely, Aer Rianta, Aer Lingus and my Department.  This meeting took place on Friday, 17 February 1995 and I understand that there was a wide-ranging constructive discussion of all the issues.  A further meeting has been scheduled for 7 March 1995.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern at the injuries and deaths that have been caused by plastic bullets in Northern Ireland in the past.  The record of fourteen deaths from the use of plastic bullets in Northern Ireland, and numerous injuries, demonstrates that these weapons are highly dangerous.Successive Governments have impressed on the British Government the need for stricter controls over and effective guidelines on their use.  I note that their use has declined over the years although I am aware that there have been instances of their use since the ceasefire.  In the circumstances now prevailing, it is particularly important that the security forces act with maximum restraint so as to ensure that the use of plastic bullets is curtailed to the greatest possible extent.  I shall keep this matter under review in the context of our ongoing contacts with the British Government within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 50 and 51 together.</P>
      <P>The issues raised by the Deputies in their questions have been the subject of continuing discussions with the British Government.  I availed of the Intergovernmental Conference of 14 February to discuss these issues directly with the Secretary of State.  While I do not propose to enter into the details of these exchanges, I can say that the British Government is fully aware of our views and concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The individual in question has been convicted before the courts, and that conviction has been upheld twice on appeal.  Further referral to the courts is of course possible if new evidence is put forward.  However, it is essential, if trust in the administration of justice is to be maintained, that all cases should be <Col N="1588" /> dealt with equally under the law.  The reaction from both communities in Northern Ireland makes clear that any attempt to give special treatment to the individual concerned, in isolation from the broader prison issues evoked by the ceasefire, is likely to provoke resentment and complicate the task of sustaining support for the peace process.  The British Government is aware of our views in this regard and of the need for sensitive handling of cases of this kind.</P>
    <P>As for a fundamental review of prison sentences, it is essential in the context of the peace process that prison issues should be dealt with in a sensitive and flexible manner and with particular reference to the changed likelihood of reoffence by paramilitaries in the wake of the ceasefires.  I conveyed my views in some detail on this point at the recent meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference on 14 February.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the National Economic and Social Forum was established in June 1993 to develop economic and social policy initiatives, particularly in relation to combating unemployment.  I am delighted with the work that the Forum has produced since it was established 18 months ago.  Over that period of time, it has produced five reports:</P>
      <P>&mdash; Negotiations on a successor agreement to the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> (November, 1993).</P>
      <P>&mdash; National Development Plan 1994-1999 &mdash; the proposed Local Development Programme (November 1993).</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1589" />&mdash; Commission on Social Welfare &mdash; Outstanding Recommendations (January 1994).</P>
    <P>&mdash; Ending Long-Term Unemployment (June 1994).</P>
    <P>&mdash; Income Maintenance Strategies (July 1994).</P>
    <P>These reports have been given very careful consideration by Government and have and will continue to make an important contribution to the development of policy.  A further report on the quality delivery of social services will be published shortly.  The Forum is currently working on a report dealing with the jobs potential of the services sector and it is expected that this will be completed over the next few months.</P>
    <P>The Government looks forward to receiving this report in due course.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1590" /> The US Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland will be held in Washington on the 24-26 May 1995.</P>
    <P>The conference is the major feature of a package of US economic initiatives to support the peace process which President Clinton announced last November.These initiatives are aimed at providing tangible US support, in the new context created by peace, for the political and economic revitalisation of Northern Ireland and the Southern Border counties.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be assured that our representation will be at very senior political level and I would expect to lead the Irish delegation myself.  We expect that the conference, which will be addressed by President Clinton, will be a highly prestigious and influential event in terms of mobilising concrete US support for the peace process. Increased US investment North and South will be of enormous benefit to the economies in both parts of the island and will help to repair the damage done by the years of violence and turmoil in Northern Ireland.  The conference should demonstrate to US companies the dramatically improved business opportunities which now exist in both parts of Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>The situation in Chechnya remains of grave concern.  Figures announced this week suggest that as many as 30,000 people may have been killed since the conflict erupted in December.</P>
      <P>Following a lull in the last few weeks fighting has begun to intensify again around Grozny and in the surrounding towns.  Russian artillery and aerial attacks on these areas have recommenced.</P>
      <P>A ceasefire between the two sides, agreed at the beginning of last week, expired on Sunday night and was not extended.  The ceasefire had provided for the non-use of heavy weapons, which have been responsible for most of the destruction and loss of life.  While there were reported violations by both sides, the ceasefire, although fragile, had reduced the fighting and provided a window of opportunity to pursue negotiations for a solution.  The non-extension of the ceasefire is a serious setback in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, efforts to involve the OSCE constructively in the resolution of the crisis are continuing.  Following <Col N="1592" /> his visit to the region at the end of January arrangements are now being made for a second visit by Ambassador Gyarmati, the personal representative of the OSCE Chairman in Office.</P>
    <P>A team of OSCE Human Rights experts has now arrived in Moscow on the first stage of a ten day mission, six days of which will be spent in Chechnya. This mission has as its mandate</P>
    <P>&mdash;to help facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid</P>
    <P>&mdash;to examine the possibilities for OSCE assistance in the setting up and operation of a human rights body to investigate violations of human rights and ensure their observance in the future.</P>
    <P>&mdash;to discuss co-operation in setting up a local administration in Chechnya and</P>
    <P>&mdash;to discuss the preparation of free elections.</P>
    <P>However, the commitments being given by Russia within the OSCE must be translated into action on the ground. The international community demands this.</P>
    <P>From the outset, Ireland has been working both bilaterally and together with our EU partners to make it unequivocally clear to Russia that its handling of the Chechnya crisis and the consequent violation of human rights are unacceptable; to promote a ceasefire and a negotiated solution through the involvement of OSCE; and to bring about the urgent delivery of humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>The Government responded quickly to the needs of the victims of the war and we are willing to extend further humanitarian assistance.  Ireland has provided grants totalling £150,000 to the ICRC which is delivering humanitarian assistance in Chechnya and visiting prisoners on boths sides.  Also 10.31 million ECU has been contributed by the EU to the ICRC since late December for the <Col N="1593" /> supply and distribution of food, basic medical supplies, shelter and clothing.</P>
    <P>In addition to the 250,000 people who are being assisted by the ICRC a further 175,000 persons have fled to neighbouring Ingushetia and Dagestan where they are being helped by the UNHCR.  I have decided to allocate £75,000 from the Humanitarian Assistance Fund to the UNHCR to help with these refugees. Next week I will be meeting with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva to discuss with her any other way in which Ireland can be of assistance in the humanitarian crisis.</P>
    <P>Since 24 January, my Department, at my direction, has strongly underlined our concerns on the situation in Chechnya to the Russian Ambassador in Dublin.In addition, our representative to the OSCE has made our views clear in the OSCE Permanent Council and directly to the Russian OSCE Head of Delegation.</P>
    <P>At EU level there have been Troika and joint EU/OSCE démarches to the Russian authorities.  In a Declaration on 6 February EU Foreign Ministers sent a clear message to Russia that</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; we wished to see a humanitarian ceasefire concluded immediately with the assistance of the ICRC</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; we expected Russia to uphold the provisions of the OSCE Code of Conduct and of Additional Protocol no 2 to the 1949 Geneva Convention</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; we wished to see Russia take the required steps to guarantee free movement of aid to populations in need and</P>
    <P>&mdash;&nbsp; we wanted to see a local office of the UN High Commissioner opened in the region.</P>
    <P>Since that Declaration the President of the EU Council of Ministers, French Foreign Minister Juppé, has had a number of direct contacts with Foreign Minister Kozyrev.</P>
    <P>It is essential that we maintain our efforts, both bilaterally and through the relevant international fora, to bring an <Col N="1594" /> end to the fighting, promote a negotiated solution and address the serious human rights situation in Chechnya.  In this regard, I intend to raise the issue of Chechnya at the UN Commission on Human Rights during my visit to that organisation on Monday next.</P>
    <P>It is of the utmost importance both for the people of Chechnya and for the stability of the region as a whole that this crisis is brought to an end at the earliest possible date.  Ireland will continue to work as constructively as possible, both bilaterally and with our EU partners, to achieve this aim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 22 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>The Treaty on European Union provides for the convening of an Intergovernmental Conference of the member states in 1996 to examine those Treaty provisions for which explicit provision is made for a review.</P>
      <P>The agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference will therefore include the Maastricht Treaty provisions on the common foreign and security policy, the decision-making powers of the European Parliament, the Union's legislative procedures and the structure of the Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Brussels European Council in December 1993 and the informal Foreign Ministers meeting in April 1994 <Col N="1595" /> added to the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference the weighting of the votes of the member states in the Council, the number of members of the Commission and any measures deemed necessary to facilitate the work of the institutions of the Union and guarantee their effective operation in the perspective of future enlargement.</P>
    <P>I should also point out, moreover, that it is open to any member state or to the Commission to propose revisions to the Treaty in other areas for consideration at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>The European Council meeting in Corfu in June 1994 agreed to establish a reflection group of personal representatives of Foreign Ministers and of the President of the Commission to prepare the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference.  The reflection group which will also include two representatives of the European Parliament will begin meeting in June under a Spanish chairperson.It is expected to report to the Madrid European Council in December.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State for European Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell, has been appointed as this country's representative on the reflection group.</P>
    <P>The preparatory work for the Intergovernmental Conference, at this stage, is very much focused on the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty.  The European Council requested the Council the Commission and the European Parliament to establish separate reports on the functioning of the treaty.  These reports will serve as inputs to the work of the reflection group.</P>
    <P>The preparation of the Council's report on the functioning of the treaty has begun under the current French Presidency of the EU and will be completed before June 1995.  The Council has agreed that its report should be factual and consensual in nature.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference is expected to open in the first half of 1996 under the Italian Presidency of the EU. <Col N="1596" /> It will continue in the second half of 1996 when Ireland will hold the Presidency.The chairing of the Intergovernmental Conference will be one of our key Presidency priorities.  No deadline has been set for the completion of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>Preparatory work on the Irish negotiating position at the Intergovernmental Conference is under way.  The Government will ensure that Ireland makes a constructive and imaginative contribution to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.  In this context it is important that we have a detailed understanding of our partners' positions on the key issues and that they are aware of our concerns.  In recent weeks, for example, I have had discussions with the Spanish and French Foreign Ministers while Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell, has met his Belgian and German counterparts. There are also continuing contacts on the Intergovernmental Conference with our partners at official level.  Over the coming months these ministerial and official level contacts will be intensified with a view to developing our negotiating position on the wide range of issues likely to arise at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

      <P>Under the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952, foreign military aircraft require the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to land in the State. Permission is granted subject to acceptance by the requesting Government that <Col N="1597" /> certain conditions be met, the most important of which are that the relevant aircraft are unarmed, carry no arms, ammunition or explosives and do not engage in intelligence gathering and that the flights in question do not form part of military exercises or operations.</P>
      <P>An application for permission to land is made by the Embassy of the applicant country accredited to Ireland.  The application procedure involves the provision of detailed technical information with regard to aircraft specification, crew, cargo and flight plan.  Each application is examined and cleared by the technical Departments concerned before permission is granted.</P>
      <P>Under these procedures a total of 333 requests for permission for foreign military aircraft to land in the State were received in 1994.  All requests conformed to the requirements I have outlined and permission was granted in each case.  It would not be in accordance with established practice to give details of checks that might be undertaken.</P>

In this context I have raised with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, including at the recent meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference, the question of the provision of financial assistance to Méanscoil Feirste and urged that positive consideration be given to this request.

      <Col N="1600" /> Last month, the British authorities decided to suspend all routine day time military patrolling in the Greater Belfast area, where the First Battalion of the Parachute Regiment is currently stationed.  This was widely seen as a significant step in the process of de-escalation by the security forces.  I have emphasised to the Secretary of State, as recently as the Intergovernmental Conference of 14 February, the need to ensure continuing rapid and visible deescalation in the level and posture of the security forces in response to the paramilitary ceasefires.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 52 together.</P>
      <P>The Government remains deeply concerned about the humanitarian and political situation in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The assistance which Ireland has given can be summarised as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>First, Ireland has contributed over £2 million from the emergency humanitarian assistance fund to the international relief effort in the region.  The bulk of this money has been channelled through the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, which is the lead agency for the relief effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, in response to the needs of people who have been displaced from their homes by the war, we have admitted 371 Bosnians to Ireland.  The welfare and resettlement of these persons in Ireland is being co-ordinated by the Refugee Agency.  The Government has <Col N="1601" /> also allocated visas to facilitate the reunification of Bosnians in Ireland with their immediate family members in Bosnia-Hercegovina.</P>
    <P>Third, we have supported the United Nations special medical evacuation programme for Bosnia-Hercegovina for the treatment of serious medical cases and victims of war.  Ireland was one of the first countries to respond positively to this programme when it began in July 1993.  To date we have organised three medical evacuations to Ireland under that programme and have offered treatment in Cappagh Hospital to thirty six serious medical cases from Sarajevo and Gorazde.</P>
    <P>Fourth, Ireland has supported the European Union's administration of Mostar in western Bosnia which aims to promote reconciliation and reconstruction in that divided city.</P>
    <P>Fifth, the Government has pledged US$500,000 to support the United Nations programme to restore essential services to the inhabitants of Sarajevo. As part of this commitment we are currently giving financial support to the Office of the UN Special Co-ordinator for Sarajevo as well as a project to restore the homes of elderly persons in Sarajevo many of whom have spent three winters living in damaged buildings without gas, heating or electricity.</P>
    <P>The Government stands ready to give further assistance to the Bosnian people both by way of meeting their immediate needs and through rehabilitation of the structures and communities which have been shattered by the fighting in the region.  With the ending of the war between the Bosnian Government and Bosnian Croats in Central Bosnia and the successful implementation of the ceasefire agreement there by UNPROFOR, it is encouraging that the number of people dependent on humanitarian aid has been greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>A comprehensive negotiated settlement is essential if we are to end the humanitarian crisis which has been precipitated by the fighting in the region. To this end, Ireland is continuing to work with its EU partners for a political <Col N="1602" /> solution for Bosnia.  The Contact Group's plan for territorial arrangements have been accepted by the Bosnian Government and by the Bosnian Croats.  A key objective of the international community is now directed at obtaining Bosnian Serb agreement.  A plan for a political solution for Croatia has recently been put to the parties by the International Conference on Former Yugoslavia, which is co-chaired by the European Union and the United Nations.  These are important elements in the efforts of the European Union for an overall resolution of the conflicts in former Yugoslavia which would guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States within their inter nationally recognised borders.</P>

      <P>The standard fee for a ten-year passport with 32 pages is £45.  A 46-page version is available at £55.  One-year passports are no longer issued.  A three year, non-renewable, passport is available for £10.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at European level to introduce a European identity card.</P>
      <P>Many of our EU partners have national identity cards.  The average cost of these cards is less than £10; they are usually valid for ten years and may be used for travel to other EU countries.The Netherlands have recently introduced what they call a European identity card which is valid for a number of European countries outside the EU as well as for EU countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The possible introduction of a national identity card in Ireland is a complex issue which would require indepth debate.  Its introduction could not <Col N="1603" /> be justified simply as a low-cost alternative to a passport.  Given the travel patterns of Irish people, a high proportion would continue to require a passport with worldwide validity even if a separate document for EU or European travel were available.  The administrative difficulties associated with the production of two different types of travel documents would hardly be justified in cost-benefit terms.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, while the Chairman and members of the Board of the International Fund are appointed by the Irish and British Governments, they are required under the Agreements establishing the fund, to act independently in carrying out their functions.  The board is therefore the ultimate decision-maker in respect of all applications submitted to the international fund.</P>
      <P>The agreement establishing the fund states that because of the special problems in Northern Ireland associated with the instability of recent years, approximately three quarters of the resources of the fund shall be spent there.  In the South, Counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth have been prioritised for fund assistance.</P>
      <P>The fund, which has been in operation for eight years, has well established procedures, including a formal application form which prospective applicants and interested groups can follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the international fund operates a range of programmes covering various <Col N="1604" /> sectoral areas, the Deputy will appreciate that the criteria of eligibility will vary according to the priorities established by the board of the fund in the various sectors.  To assist the application process the fund has engaged the services of eight local development consultants across the twelve northern counties whose principal task is to assist prospective project promoters with their applications.</P>
    <P>In addition, the fund's secretariat in Dublin and Belfast are available to assist prospective groups in making applications for assistance to the fund.</P>

Of the ten non-permanent seats two are reserved for members of the Western European and Other Group (WEOG), the regional group of which Ireland is a member.</P>
      <P>Ireland has served on the council on two occasions.  In 1962 we served a split term and in 1981-82 we served a full two year term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>A provision of £8.9 million has been included in the 1995 Estimates (Subhead A of the International Co-operation Vote) to cover Ireland's contributions to international organisations in the current year.  The comparable provision was £7.5 million in the 1994 Estimates.  The provisional outturn on the subhead was £6.562 million.</P>
      <P>The Subhead A provision goes to meet Ireland's contributions, which in almost every instance are mandatory, to the following organisations: United Nations; Council of Europe; GATT; OECD; UNIDO and Intergovernmental Legal Bodies.  In addition, it covers Ireland's contributions to the EU Monitor Mission in former Yugoslavia and the Preparatory Commission for the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.  Any contribution payable by Ireland in 1995 towards the costs of the Transitional Secretariat for the proposed New Forum for Multilateral Export Controls within the GATT/WTO framework will also be met from this subhead.</P>
      <P>The sizeable increase in the 1995 Subhead A provision is accounted for by particular factors as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  UN contribution: the increased UN provision arises in part from the increase in Ireland's rate of assessment (both for the regular UN budget and peacekeeping operations) to 0.2 per cent in 1995 as compared to 0.18 per cent previously.  In addition, the allocation includes approximately 0.5 million to cover mandatory assessments for <Col N="1606" /> peacekeeping operations which had been anticipated would arise for payment in late 1994 but which in the event fell for payment in early 1995.</P>
    <P>In estimating the UN provision, allowance was also made for the anticipated additional expenditure which could arise for this country as part of the continuing increase in the number and size of UN peacekeeping operations. The dramatic growth in peacekeeping expenditure by the UN in recent years, coupled with the uncertainty as to whether individual assessments will arise for payment at the end of one financial year or early in the following year, has made it very difficult to forecast accurately the extent of our assessed contribution to the peacekeeping budget in any given year.</P>
    <P>(b)  GATT contribution: in keeping with previous practice, provision was made in the 1994 Estimates for payment in December 1994 of the estimated 1995 assessment for GATT/World Trade Organisation since the payment in question was due as at 1 January 1995.  In the event the assessment in question had not arrived in the Department prior to 31 December 1994 and provision for the amount involved &mdash; approximately £367,000 &mdash; had to be made in the 1995 Estimates.</P>
    <P>(c)  Other organisations: the increase in the overall 1995 allocation is also accounted for, in smaller part, by increases in the contributions payable in the case of certain of the other organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>Only the funds actually required to cover the contributions to the various international organisations will be drawn down and, in accordance with normal practice, any balance remaining will revert to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>The Lomé Convention and its financial Protocol are due for updating by the end of this month.  The special meeting of the General Affairs Council held in Brussels on 15 February 1995 failed to agree on an overall level of funding to be offered to the African, Caribbean and Pacific States for the period 1995 to 2000. Ireland offered to increase its share of funding substantially in the context of our expanding aid programme but some member states sought to reduce their contributions.</P>
      <P>Our offer reflected the importance Ireland has traditionally attached to the Lomé Convention which is regarded as qualitatively one of the best ever development co-operation agreements. More importantly, its trade and aid provisions benefit some of the poorest countries in the world, including all of the priority countries in Ireland's bilateral aid programme.</P>
      <P>Ireland has expressed its disappointment at the failure of the European Union to agree on the level of funding for the ACP countries.  We will assist the French Presidency in its efforts to secure agreement on a comprehensive package of measures to offer to the ACP side when negotiations resume.</P>

      <P>The question of policing falls within the remit of Article 7 of the Anglo-Irish Agreement which, <i>inter alia,</i> records the agreement of the <Col N="1608" /> two Governments that there is a need for a programme of special measures in Northern Ireland to improve relations between the security forces and the community.  I and my predecessors have availed fully of the Anglo-Irish machinery to discuss policing issues, both general and specific.  I shall continue to avail fully of the Anglo-Irish machinery in this regard.</P>
      <P>In the post-ceasefire situation, a widespread debate has grown up in Northern Ireland on policing in general and the role and structures of the RUC in particular.In addition to our own exchanges with the British Government on policing, I have been following this debate closely.  In considering possible future arrangements, it is relevant to note, as provided in paragraph 44 of the Framework Document, that issues of law and order in Northern Ireland are closely intertwined with the issues of political agreement and consensus. Within that context, the Government's approach to the future of policing in Northern Ireland will take full account of the reality that, ultimately, the Nationalist community must be convinced that policing structures in Northern Ireland are open, independent from partisan political control, fully accountable, responsive to the policing needs of all sections of the community, reflective of the communities they serve and that give equal esteem to the Nationalist identity.</P>

      <P>Ireland, in its approach to the European Union, has opposed the creation of an exclusive &ldquo;inner core&rdquo; group of member states. Ideally, we also favour a single-speed approach to European integration. However, we have in the past accepted a multi-speed approach in certain limited areas, as for example in the provisions in the Treaty on European Union relating to economic and monetary union.</P>
      <P>At the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference Ireland would not favour agreement on any arrangements which might lead to fragmentation of the Union.  Therefore, we would not wish to see the Treaty amended to allow for the emergence of an inner core from which other member states would be excluded.</P>

      <Col N="1610" /> The process for the preparation of the Intergovernmental Conference will be a lengthy one.

This will be followed by preparatory work to be undertaken by a Reflection Group on which Ireland will be represented by the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
    <P>It is far too early to say precisely what proposals will be on the table of the Intergovernmental Conference. However, Ireland has a fundamental interest in contributing to the success of the Intergovernmental Conference.  We will make a constructive contribution to its preparation and conduct, notably when it falls to us to chair the Intergovernmental Conference during the second half of 1996.</P>

      <P>A total of £650,000 in Government assistance was given last year to Irish emigrant advice and welfare organisations in Britain and the United States.

      <P>A letter was received in my Department in November, 1994 in relation to an extension of the old urban renewal scheme for certain areas in Clonmel.  These areas in Clonmel had been designated since May 1990.  It is understood that no development had commenced on the three specific sites in question when the request for a deadline extension was first made to the Department of the Environment in September last year. This was despite the fact that it was well known that the deadline of the scheme was either 31 July 1994 or 31 December 1994 where a certificate had been received from the local authority before 23 February 1994 stating that 15 per cent of the cost of the development had been incurred before 26 January 1994. Given these facts, and also that Clonmel Corporation had agreed to the inclusion of new areas under the new urban renewal scheme in preference to the redesignation of these existing areas when the issues were discussed with the Department of the Environment last year, it is clear that there is no case for introducing legislation extending the deadline of the original urban renewal scheme for Clonmel.  Such a deadline would in any event have to apply to all the old designated areas and could not be confined to Clonmel.</P>

However, while the Carer's Association referred to the need for £65,000 to fund the development of the Home Care Assistance Service in the Cork and other regions in their pre-budget submission, no formal application for assistance has yet been submitted to my Department.  On receipt of such application I will have it examined by the health boards responsible and consider it in the light of the resources available for respite care and the demands of other interested groups.</P>

    <P>At the moment, 17 applications for naturalisation on foot of investment in the State, are awaiting finalisation in my Department.

It was indicated in answer to that question that the then Minister for Justice, following advice from the then Attorney General and confirmed by the current Attorney General, was legally bound to grant these applications provided all the necessary conditions were met.  One of this group of 29 has withdrawn his application and I have granted naturalisation to a further 6, in line with the legal obligation.</P>

      <P>The numbers deployed as well as various other aspects of what took place was the subject of comment and controversy, then and subsequently, which was why I also announced in my statement that I had asked the former Chief Justice, Mr. Thomas Finlay, to report to me on the matter.

      <P>Ireland's trade with Libya is on-going, if erratic.  Over the last five years for which statistics are available, our exports ranged from a high of £37 million in 1989 to £11 million in 1992. Exports in 1993 were worth £21 million and consisted mainly of live cattle and miscellaneous food preparations.  Our imports in the same period were minimal, totalling £5,000 over the five years 1989 to 1993.</P>
      <P>Current restrictions on trade with Libya are based on UN and EU action in introducing sanctions.  The main target of these sanctions are the Libyan civilian and military airlines and the oil export and refining industries and thus, it is only the supply of related goods and services which come under the scope of the restrictions.  Any relaxation of these restrictions would be a matter for the UN who review the situation on an ongoing basis.</P>

    <P>During the above five month period, production of finished steel was 5 per cent less than budget.  This has resulted in a negative contribution to profitability of approximately £200,000.  The company expects the shortfall to be made up by the end of the financial year 30 June 1995.</P>

      <P>I have no function in this matter.  Operating schedules, route services and such matters are the day-to-day responsibility of the airlines concerned having regard to relevant commercial and operational criteria.  Aer Rianta has, however, informed me that the total number of airline seats available on scheduled services to Shannon and Dublin from the United States in 1994 was 470,621.</P>

      <Quest>the proposals, if any, he has to increase the accessibility of Ireland to visitors from the United States by making more airline seats available, either by increased capacity by Aer Lingus or by providing to other air carriers fifth freedom rights from airports in Ireland.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no function in the matter of increasing the accessibility of Ireland to visitors from the United States by making more airline seats available.  The question of the level of service to be provided by an airline on any given route is a day-to-day matter for such airline.</P>
      <P>Air transport agreements between Ireland and other countries enable Irish and foreign carriers to mount services between Ireland and the relevant countries.The question of whether an airline wishes to exercise its right to operate on any specific route is a matter for the commercial judgement of the airline.</P>
      <P>The provision of transatlantic air services between Ireland and the US is governed by the Ireland-US Air Transport Agreement.  In accordance with the terms of that agreement designated airlines of both countries are free to operate air services on specified routes between the two countries.  There are no limitations on capacity offered by airlines on such services and airlines are free to determine air fares in accordance with their own commercial judgment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to scheduled air services, <Col N="1629" /> which Irish airlines currently enjoy access rights to four US points, US airlines may serve Ireland from any US point.  In this regard it should also be noted that the Shannon stop policy has been changed in recent years to allow direct access to Dublin while also maintaining the same level of direct flights to Shannon.  US airlines also enjoy unlimited fifth freedom rights at Shannon on scheduled services.  In relation to charter services, both Irish and US airlines can operate from any point in the US to Ireland.  In the case of charter services to Cork or Connaught Regional Airport, the policy in relation to Shannon does not apply.</P>
    <P>Any further changes to an already very liberal agreement would have to be clearly assessed from the point of view of their potential impact on not just tourism, but also the Irish airline industry and regional development.  In the aviation world traffic rights are seen as <Col N="1630" /> national assets which are normally traded on the basis of reciprocity and equivalent benefits to both sides.</P>
    <P>In recent years Aeroflot has continued to develop its services to and from Shannon and it has been fully encouraged by my Department in this development.  My Department has given Aeroflot fifth freedom rights at Shannon to Miami and Washington and, on an <i>ad hoc</i> temporary basis, to Chicago.</P>
