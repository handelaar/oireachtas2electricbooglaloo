      <P>It is our sad duty to hear expressions of sympathy on the death of the father of the House, the late Deputy Neil Blaney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with a sense of very deep sadness and shock that I rise to pay tribute to the memory of the father of the House, Deputy Neil Blaney.  Neil was elected to this House in 1948 and served as a Member for 47 years.  In that time, the confidence of the people of Donegal in Neil Blaney was renewed time after time.  He overcame electoral challenge after electoral challenge, and did so for a good part of that time without the benefit of membership of a national political party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be some small consolation to Eva, his wife, and to his children to reflect on why the people had so much confidence in the man they will now miss so much.  I suppose that only someone from Donegal can really understand or express that adequately.  I had one or two opportunities to see Neil Blaney at work as a politician in his area.  I remember very well standing in the square in Carndonagh during a by-election. As Members will appreciate, one never stands listening to the political rallies of one's opponents.  However, <Col N="2066" /> while passing through the square in Carndonagh on the way to where I was staying I heard Neil Blaney speaking and I could not move.  It is the only time in my life that I remember being frozen in position by the magnetism of a platform speaker.</P>
    <P>In my view, no other public platform speaker, with the possible exception of James Dillon, could hold an audience with the magnetism which Neil Blaney could, regardless of whether they agreed with him.  That ability to hold his audience, which he was particularly able to do in the traditional open air venue for political activity, came from within himself.  That magnetism was not manufactured or artificial but real.  It came from his deep conviction of the justice of his views and the rightness of his cause.  The genius of Neil Blaney as a politician was that he was still able, while holding such deeply contested views, to work as part of a team which consisted, I am sure, during much of his ministerial career of people who, for equally good and sincere reasons, did not altogether agree with the views.</P>
    <P>He had an ability to work with people, which was especially shown during his time as an Independent Member of the House.  Many Independent Members came and went during Neil's long period as an Independent Member. However, I am sure that all of them &mdash; including the most recent, Deputy Fox &mdash; will say that Neil Blaney showed a warmth, sympathy and understanding of the difficulties attendant on membership of this House.  He also showed an understanding of the bewilderment felt by any Member entering this House for the first time.  I experienced that kindness on the part of Neil Blaney when I entered the House in 1969.</P>
    <P>He was, of course, a man of great achievement.  Many of the commentaries which will now be written on Neil Blaney's career will focus on one year &mdash; 1970.  That would do Neil Blaney a grave injustice because he was the longest serving Minister for Local Government ever.  He was also Minister for Agriculture and held numerous other <Col N="2067" /> ministerial posts.  In those posts he acted at all times with robust courage.  In the one year when he was a Minister and I was a member of the Opposition, I remember well how Fine Gael regarded putting one over on the then Minister, Deputy Blaney, as the greatest possible achievement in political life.  He was the hardest man to criticise because he always had a tremendous mastery not only of his brief but of this House from his time on the Government benches. That mastery was built on a record of work as a Minister.</P>
    <P>As a Minister he did a great deal for his county of Donegal, another reason the people there held their faith in him when others did not.  He had tremendous support throughout the west of Ireland as witnessed by his success in European elections.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael Party which consistently held a different point of view from that of Deputy Neil Blaney and on behalf of the Government as Taoiseach, I wish to express our sympathy to Eva, his sons and daughters, his brothers and sister and all those who supported him throughout his long political career.  It is worth recalling that I was only one year old when he was first elected to the Dáil.  I hope it is some small consolation to those who will miss him so much to reflect on the confidence placed in him by so many people and the friendship of so many of his opponents during the years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Once more the national flag is flying at half mast over Leinster House this morning.  It was with great sorrow that I and my party learned in the early morning of the passing of the father of the House.  As the Taoiseach said, Deputy Neil Blaney was by far the longest serving Member of the House, having been returned at every election since 1948.  It is hard to believe that a Member could serve for such a long period in Leinster House. He spanned the Administrations under <Col N="2068" /> successive Taoisigh since Eamon de Valera &mdash; a remarkable history.</P>
      <P>Older people remember Neil Blaney as an exceptionally effective Minister in the late 1950s and through the 1960s.  He served briefly in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, nine years as Minister for Local Government and three and a half years as Minister for Agriculture.  Although it was a long time since he was Minister, he had clocked up a great deal of ministerial experience.</P>
      <P>He is well remembered among the farmers for the vigour with which he promoted their welfare and livelihood, efforts of which he was proud.  He helped to put rural infrastructure in place by promoting group water schemes all over Ireland.  He was also responsible for widespread road improvements and giving a real impetus to housing policy.  He steered through the basic planning legislation of 1963 under which we all still work.  Not a day passes that a public representative does not need to deal with the 1963 Planning Act, one of Neil's achievements.  He established An Foras Forbartha and started the work of creating the planning regions.  An account of local government for the period from 1957 to 1966 states that a great deal of the innovation marking the early years may be credited to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The loyalty he commanded during the rest of his life can only be understood by the fact that he was remembered as one of the great Ministers of the 1960s. I was born a few years after he was first elected to the House.  He never lost interest in politics.  People will speak of all he did for Donegal and of his ministerial experience, but when I was Minister for Finance I had the benefit of his views and fears about CAP and GATT. He did not support the direction we were following in respect of Europe, particularly regarding European Monetary Union.  Yesterday I said that Deputy Brian Lenihan was of the modern age, but I believe it would be incorrect to apply that description to my late colleague, Deputy Neil Blaney, in light of <Col N="2069" /> recent conversations I had with him.  If we were to follow the direction of his views on European Monetary Union, the proposal in that regard would have no chance of being achieved in 1999 or in 2005.</P>
    <P>During his ministerial period, he was an effective political campaigner famous for securing by-election victories, sometimes for those who would stand far apart from him after they were elected. He fought general elections in a full blooded way and played a major part in securing a majority for our party in the 1969 election under Jack Lynch.</P>
    <P>The outbreak of troubles placed great strain on everybody as the Government and all parties of the House grappled with the problem of the appropriate direction to follow.  Neil Blaney represented a traditional strand of republicanism as it would have been universally understood when he was first elected to the House.  We believe his philosophy was best summed up by the all-party declaration of 1949.  Even though the Fianna Fáil Party and Deputy Neil Blaney went their separate ways after the difficulties of 1970 he continued to be held in high regard for many reasons by a large section among our elected members and supporters throughout the country.  It was an abiding regret of many people that despite attempts by various leaders it did not prove possible to rejoin his independent Fianna Fáil organisation with the wider Fianna Fáil Party.  He continued to enjoy electoral success making a valuable contribution to the European Parliament as well as the Dáil, in which he had a great interest although we did not always agree with him.  His republicanism was never anti-European. He remained a lone and sometimes outspoken voice in the House whose views were genuinely independent and were listened to with respect and attention, even if people were not always in agreement.  He spoke not only of the North but of the need for economic and social development.  As a Member who was elected to the House 18 years ago, those are the issues on which I remember him mainly speaking <Col N="2070" /> in the House.  He spoke of how life could best be developed in towns and throughout the country.  He felt passionately about the disgrace of emigration and high unemployment in his native Donegal and on the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>In more recent times, particularly during the past year when many of us had an opportunity to work closely with him in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation at which he was a keen attender, he represented one of the poles of opinion.  At its first meeting just over a year ago he warned that we should not think that because of the ceasefire peace was around the corner. Those who were present at that meeting, including many Members of this House, will recall he spelt that out clearly with great gusto.</P>
    <P>Deputy Neil Blaney made an important contribution to this country in Government and in parliamentary life.  He was a representative voice and it was important that he should have been heard.  He had a strong mandate from the people who elected him to the House.  On a personal level he got on well with people of all traditions.  I join with the Taoiseach's remarks about how he helped people.  He was a good adviser.</P>
    <P>In more recent times when I held the post now held by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, Neil Blaney made representations to me on behalf of the Technical Group and explained how a Minister should be able to get around various matters to help that group.  He was not representing a body that held one view, but I suppose he could claim credit for how he helped that group in the electoral Bill as it appears that group has fared better than other parties. I suppose that will be the last credit he secured on the floor of the House if things remain as they are.</P>
    <P>Neil Blaney represented all traditions. I respected him personally, as did members of my party and another generation of Fianna Fáil people.  We extend our condolences to his wife Eva, his five sons, his two daughters, his extended family, his brothers and sister <Col N="2071" /> and all his great supporters who were so loyal to him.

      <P>I express sympathy to the Blaney family on the loss of a father and husband.  As the father of this House, the House will be the poorer for the death of Neil Blaney who served in public life for 47 years, almost half a century.  We have been reminded that when Neil Blaney became a Member, the Taoiseach was but one year old; leaders of other parties and myself had not been born.  That was an incredible period of public service.  Many of us will have memories of Neil Blaney, the younger Neil Blaney, the ministerial Neil Blaney.  He was a robust politician in every sense of the word.  He was also a strong member of the Fianna Fáil party.  He had strongly held views and never hesitated to express them.</P>
      <P>Neil Blaney will be remembered for many things.  As Deputy Ahern said he will be remembered above all for his involvement in the Planning and Development Act, 1963, which set a new course for planning and development here which, by any standards, was a milestone in the planning and development legislation and for his contribution to the development of group water schemes, which are extremely important to people in rural areas.  They continue to be developed today and have an important role to play in life in rural areas.</P>
      <P>He served with distinction in many ministries and in each he had a mastery of the brief, a mastery which he retained to the end when he questioned Ministers on the conduct of official business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was also a legend in many respects.  I saw Deputy McCreevy smile when Deputy Ahern mentioned the contribution Neil Blaney made to by-elections. There are those of us in other parties who would have wished he was not so successful in the contribution he made to by-elections.  Deputy O'Leary from south Kerry will remember the <Col N="2072" /> enormous contribution made by Neil Blaney.  I only wish he had left some record of those and perhaps we could all learn from them.  We express our sympathy to his wife, Eva, and to his sons and daughters.  It will be difficult to replace Neil Blaney whose loss we mourn this morning.  He gave 47 years of service to the people of Donegal, a service which has been unequalled in the history of the State.</P>

      <P>The death of Neil Blaney marks the passing of one of the truly legendary figures of modern Irish politics as he was the colossus of Irish political life.  Having been elected to this House for 47 years, and particularly since 1970 as an Independent, was an extraordinary feat.  He was also elected to the European Parliament.  To have been elected as an Independent in a three seat constituency was remarkable. Neil Blaney will be best remembered, as others said, for his political and organisational skills and the machines he mustered during by-elections in the 1950s and 1960s for Fianna Fáil candidates are now part of the Irish political folklore.</P>
      <P>His adherence to a fundamentalist republican analysis of the conflict in Northern Ireland will serve as his most enduring characteristic.  Though I always felt it was a pity he did not try to embrace the challenge of trying to reconcile the British and Irish identities on this island, he, nonetheless, clung to those beliefs which were sincerely held and very forcefully expressed.  To his widow, Eva, and to his family I extend on my own behalf and on behalf of the Progressive Democrats my sympathy.</P>

      <P>For the second time in 24 hours we are mourning the loss of a Member, one of the longest serving Deputies who was first elected to this House before many of the younger Members were born.  It is no exaggeration to say he gave a lifetime of service to politics and to the people.  I disagreed with Neil Blaney on many issues, none more so than in relation to Northern <Col N="2073" /> Ireland in regard to which he had a deep traditionalist view.  At one point I was shocked when he declared his pride in having helped to establish and create the Provisional Republican Movement, a movement which in my youth I had sought very strongly to prevent being created.  However, today is not the time for judgment on these issues; history will make its own judgment.</P>
      <P>As the Taoiseach said, he should be remembered for his long service in the Department of Local Government. There will be those who will criticise him for the creation of Ballymun in my constituency.  I do not believe he should be criticised for the creation of Ballymun even though it has not worked out in the way many of us thought it would. The people who first moved in to the seven towers, named after the signatories of the proclamation, felt they were in seventh heaven when they moved into those flats, because of the conditions from which they had moved.  That should be acknowledged and not denigrated. We have much to do in Ballymun to solve the problems there but that is our responsibility today and not that of Neil Blaney.</P>
      <P>Neil Blaney had already clocked up 13 years as a Minister before the traumatic events of the 1970s when the eruption in Northern Ireland resulted in him losing office.  Nevertheless, the people of Donegal and Connacht-Ulster continued to give him their loyal support and in turn he gave them his loyal support.  I offer my condolences and those of my party to the family and friends of Neil Blaney.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Independent group of Deputies &mdash; our numbers are getting smaller &mdash; I tender our sincere sympathies to the family of the late and much revered Neil Blaney.  It is a peculiar twist that Neil and his old sparring partner, Brian Lenihan, should pass on within a matter of days of each other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last 12 months since the inception of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation I came to know Neil <Col N="2074" /> Blaney quite well.  Most of the meetings we had in connection with the Forum were held in his office and, more often than not, they wound up in more convivial quarters in this establishment.  He had an amazing ability to recount stories of electioneering, especially in by-elections, how they were won and how they would have been won except that someone did not do as he had told them.  All things come to an end and Neil Blaney has passed on.  He will be sadly missed throughout the country but even more so in his beloved Donegal.  May he rest in peace.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs I am grateful to you for allowing me to express on my own behalf and on behalf of the committee our sympathy to the family of Neil Blaney and to his many friends of all parties and of none.  He was a member of a delegation which the committee sent to meet its counterparts in Budapest earlier in the year.  At that time he was ill and sometimes in distress but it did not prevent him from being an unstoppably active member of the delegation. He took his participation in the work of that delegation as seriously as he did everything else in this House. Indeed, there are many Members, particularly those who have served in Government, who have had &ldquo;passages of arms&rdquo; with Neil Blaney and nobody better than Neil would understand the ambiguity of that phrase.  In particular, I remember discussions with him on the Extradition Bill, 1986.  Neil had the ability to be at the same time a political opponent, a loyal colleague and a personal friend.  It is in that way that many of us here will remember him.  Solas na bhflaitheas air.</P>

      <P>For the second time in a week we are mourning the loss of an outstanding Member.  This man was unique in many ways.  Neil Blaney will go down in history as one of the legends of politics.  He was a passionate believer in the eventual unity of Ireland and he never wavered in that belief throughout <Col N="2075" /> his life.  His skills as an organiser were known all over the country where he led the famous Donegal mafia and many by-elections whenever and wherever they occurred.  His record as a Minister was exemplary.  He served in three different Departments but perhaps the one he enjoyed most was the Department of Local Government where he served for nine years.  This was an area in which he had an enormous interest because it dealt with many problems of the type of rural area from which he came.  Civil servants often marvelled at Neil's grasp of detail in the most complex situations.  He only had to be briefed once and he could then answer any question without the slightest difficulty.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the painful events in Northern Ireland during the early 1970s led to the parting of the ways between Neil Blaney and Fianna Fáil.  That parting, however, could never be regarded as a complete split.  He often said: &ldquo;I was born into Fianna Fáil and I will always be Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  The fact that his new organisation was named Independent Fianna Fáil was evidence of that.  It was clear that Neil's magnificent poll topping victory in the European election of 1979 was largely due to the tremendous support he received from Fianna Fáil voters throughout Connaught-Ulster.</P>
      <P>I met Neil Blaney a few weeks ago at his home in Sutton where he expressed the wish to return to this House again &mdash; a desire he was not to fulfil.  It was his intention to return to Donegal and to visit Kerry also where I believe he had a tremendous following.  When I was at the Listowel races recently I was amazed by the number of people asking about his well-being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have lost the father of the House. He had become as much of an institution as the House itself.  Neil Blaney will be missed not only by the Members of this House but by many people in the Civil Service as well as the staff in this <Col N="2076" /> House whom he got to know so well. May he rest in peace.</P>

      <P>I wish to be associated with the tributes being paid to Neil Blaney.  He gave me some pointers when I ran in the Wicklow by-election and in my opinion he was truly the master. I am sure his political career will be well documented by the media in the next few days but a day which is very special to me was one of the last days he spent in this House when he honoured me by introducing me to this House.  On behalf of the Wicklow and East-Kildare Independent grouping I extend my sincere sympathy to Neil's wife and family.</P>

      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach one question on legislation.  Over the past number of weeks the Taoiseach has assured this side of the House in regard to numerous Bills.  We have now received the Committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Bill and the Dumping at Sea Bill for which we are grateful.  As the Taoiseach knows, the Order of Business this week deals mainly with reports which really should be dealt with in Committee.  We agreed to that on the basis that there was not any other legislation.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House now or give a notification later today of the legislation we can expect for the remainder of this session?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has <Col N="2078" /> published five Bills in the past two weeks.  That speaks for itself.  If the Opposition has agreed with the Government not to take them straight away, that is fair enough from the Opposition's point of view, but the Government cannot be criticised for the delay. However, I would make the point &mdash; and this is relevant to the tendency to raise this matter on the Order of Business because it is the only matter the Opposition is allowed to raise &mdash; that legislation is not an end in itself.  Legislation should only be introduced where it is necessary to regulate the activities of citizens and it should only be introduced when it has been properly and carefully drafted.  Any legislation involves some form of infraction on civil liberties.  We should not regard the production of legislation as if it was some sort of industrial product.</P>

If that is what the Opposition wants we can make the necessary arrangements. However, it will mean that the committee system, a good innovation introduced by a previous Government with the support of the then Opposition, will fall into disuse.  It is better to put up with these very superficial criticisms from Deputies Ahern and Harney than to depart from a very good system of dealing with the bulk of legislation in committee.  If this means that the legislation is occasionally passed through this House so fast that Deputies can ask the sort of questions that were asked today so be it; I am happy to come in and give the same answer day after day.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment provides that the Minister for the Marine may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, pay to the trustees of certain pension schemes <Col N="2088" /> moneys in respect of certain liabilities that have arisen prior to the relevant vesting day.  This provision applies only to port companies to be established under this Bill.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage I touched briefly on the pension liabilities of harbour authorities.  Historically, they operated a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; system for pensions rather than having a specific pensions fund.  This system is no longer in accord with acceptable standards. Under the provisions of the Pensions Act, 1990, and this Bill harbour authorities must build up pension funds. This is a costly process and while some authorities are in the process of building up a fund others are only beginning to do so now and it will take some time for them to put fully funded funds in place. In particular, the Dublin Port and Waterford Harbour authorities have serious shortfalls in their pension funds.</P>
      <P>The Government is taking action to secure pensions and to ensure that harbour authorities build up the necessary funds.  Consultants have been employed to conduct a comprehensive study of the financial status of harbour authorities, including the long-term funding requirements of the ports and how these are to be achieved taking due account of measures to meet the appropriate funding standards for pension schemes under the Pensions Act.  I expect that this study will be available shortly.</P>
      <P>If it is found that some harbour authorities cannot build up the required funds within the timescale set out in the Pensions Act it will be necessary to remove from the scope of Part IV of that Act those pension schemes or parts thereof which do not meet the required funding standard.  The purpose of this amendment is to allow for this.  The effect of removing pension schemes from the scope of the Pensions Act is that such schemes will avail of Exchequer cover.  In the unlikely event that port companies cannot meet their pension obligations the State will undertake to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This provision will also allow for the payment of moneys by the Exchequer <Col N="2089" /> into a pension fund to build it up.  This is an enabling provision and will only be invoked in the direst of circumstances where the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Finance are satisfied that an Exchequer contribution towards a pension fund at a port company is necessary.  Any such contribution will be made only on foot of a plan agreed by the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Finance with the company and the trustees of the pension scheme which provides for building up the pension fund over a specified period.</P>
    <P>The policy will be to minimise the Exchequer exposure in this regard through ensuring that every effort is made by harbour authorities and port companies to provide for the funding of pre-vesting day pension liabilities themselves. The purpose of this amendment is only to provide a back stop guarantee against the eventuality that certain harbours may be unable, through trading performance or closure, to meet their pension liabilities.  Exchequer intervention will occur only in the direst circumstances.</P>
    <P>Harbour authorities will be expected to make every effort to fund all pension liabilities through improved trading, asset sales, etc.  The boards will be required to provide in their strategic plans for a mechanism by which funds may be built up to meet the required funding standard under the Pensions Act.  The Exchequer's back stop guarantee will operate only until such time as the boards can reasonably attain that status.</P>
    <P>There will be a stringent case by case approach.  For example, not withstanding the text of the amendment, there will be no question that certain categories of liabilities, such as pre-vesting day liabilities, will be automatically Exchequer funded for all bodies.</P>
    <P>The intention is that when the study which has been commissioned into the current and prospective viability of harbour authorities is completed I will consider further, in conjunction with the Minister for Finance and the harbour <Col N="2090" /> authorities, how best to put the necessary measures in place to enable the pension schemes to meet the required funding standards under the Pensions Act.  The DKM study is now almost completed and the consultant's report and recommendations should be available shortly.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 27 provides that moneys required by the Minister for the Marine or the Minister for Finance under this section &ldquo;shall be advanced out of the Central Fund or the growing produce thereof&rdquo;.  In this regard moneys will be required by the Minister for Finance to enable him to meet his obligations under subsection (5) and moneys may be required by the Minister for the Marine in accordance with the new subsection (9).</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 62 is to provide that, in respect of harbour authorities which remain under the Harbours Act, 1946, moneys may be made available by way of grants or loans to cover pension liabilities in respect of pension schemes made in accordance with section 151 of that Act where the harbour authorities concerned do not have the resources to cover such payments. The Harbours Act, 1946, does not make provision for the payment of State grant assistance to harbour authorities towards pension costs.  This provision will provide emergency cover for pensioners where a harbour authority cannot pay pensions out of its own resources.  It covers the authorities at small harbours where one or two persons only are employed.</P>
    <P>The intention is that the section will remain in force for a period of not more than five years after the commencement date of the section and that moneys, if any, made available will be in respect of a period of 12 months only after which time the matter will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The ultimate aim of these amendments is to ensure that existing harbour pensioners and the employees of harbour companies and commissioners will have their pension entitlements honoured in full and, if necessary, the Exchequer will provide the necessary <Col N="2091" /> finance to achieve this.  The primary responsibility for ensuring that pension funds are adequate for this purpose will continue to rest with the individual harbour companies and commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these new provisions which were promised by the Minister of State on Committee Stage. It is extremely important that the Exchequer is not exposed to unnecessary payments in this area.</P>
      <P>Having examined the matter briefly it seems that different schemes were introduced. It may well be the case that certain harbour boards took their responsibilities more seriously than others.  The resources devoted to these schemes could, perhaps, have been used to fund developmental projects, but in their wisdom they decided to ensure that their employees were fully protected under the law.  That did not apply in all circumstances. However, the Minister has two distinct responsibilities in this regard. First, he must ensure that people who are employed are fully protected and that commercial companies discharge their responsibilities in this regard to the ultimate limit.  Second, he must at the same time give an assurance or legal guarantee that, when all other avenues are explored and everything possible has been done by the company but a balance must still be made up to protect the employees' pension and other rights, the State will, in that ultimate circumstance, take up the cudgels.  The provision as drafted and the Minister's statement to the House indicate that this safeguard exists but will only be used in exceptional circumstances, so the obligation on the commercial companies to discharge their responsibilities in this regard will be enforced as far as possible.  On that basis I agree to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the previous day I spoke on this section and asked the Minister about the position of pilots. Has he had time to examine it since? I want to ensure in the context of this <Col N="2092" /> amendment that pilots, who have been part of harbour authorities for many years and given valuable service, are also protected.  Does he consider this provision applies to pilots as much as to others, given what harbour authorities were involved in heretofore?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Two questions have been raised.  The first was from Deputy Smith, whom I thank for his support for the amendments.  There was some concern among pensioners and employees of harbour companies that there might be some risk to their pension entitlements &mdash; comments to that effect were made in news reports.  I wish to put those concerns to rest.  The pension entitlements of ports pensioners and existing employees are being guaranteed and the purpose of these amendments is to underwrite that in legislation. However, that does not confer on the harbour companies or the harbour commissioners a blank cheque or a soft option in making provision for their pensioners.  The primary responsibility in the matter will continue to rest with the companies and the commissioners to provide for the pension funds from their resources.  To assist in that process, we have commissioned a study by DKM to examine the extent of pension liabilities and the ability and assets available to pension companies to discharge them.</P>
      <P>The second question was also raised by Deputy Cullen on the last occasion and I apologise for not responding to it in my earlier comment.  The amendment applies only to pre-vesting day employees of harbours.  Pilots in most cases are not employees under law, they are self-employed and therefore are not covered by the amendment.  By virtue of their self-employed status their pension arrangements are separate from those made for employees of the companies. The position at present is that pilots make their own pension arrangements as self-employed people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That may nominally be the case but the pensions of pilots who have already retired are being paid by <Col N="2093" /> the existing harbour authorities. Although technically they would have been expected to have made private pension arrangements, I understand that is not the case.  Those who are already receiving pensions are in the same system as other harbour authority employees.  It will cause problems if people who were pilots will now have no guarantees as to their pensions.  The Minister is technically correct &mdash; the pilots are self-employed for specific reasons &mdash; but practically they are direct employees of the harbour authorities.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about his reply because this could seriously affect those about to retire, those currently receiving pensions and those who have given long service in cases where there is no pension fund to meet their requirements.  I am worried about their futures because they have given long service and their duties are integral and essential to the business of the harbours.  I am not happy with the reply; although it was technically correct, the practical aspect is different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>To make this clear to Deputy Cullen, the legislation will not disadvantage pilots in their pension entitlements, which will continue to operate.  I appreciate what the Deputy said about the technicalities of the person being self-employed or an employee.  The pensions of pilots are not paid from harbour revenue but from pilotage authority revenue.  Where existing arrangements are in place for pilots' pensions those will continue.  As the Deputy knows, two options are provided for in the legislation concerning pilots.  The first is a licensed pilotage, which is analogous to the self-employed status enjoyed by many pilots at present.  Alternatively, there is the option of direct employment of pilots by harbour companies, in which case they would enjoy the conditions attaching to employees of harbour companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was going to come to that point; if they take up the option of regularising their position to become <Col N="2094" /> employees of the new companies, they are covered under this section.  Is that correct?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  If the option of becoming an employee of the company is exercised, a pilot will enjoy the conditions of company employees and consequently will have pension protection. In practice, where any such transfer from employee to licensed arrangement or <i>vice versa</i> is concerned, there must be negotiation and discussion between the parties involved.  Such discussions must deal with pension entitlements because if a pilot had operated on a licensed basis, had a pension scheme other than a direct scheme with the harbour company and wished to transfer into the company scheme, various issues would have to be sorted out in relation to the transfer of previous pension rights and entitlements.  The principle which will apply is that they will have the conditions and rights of employees but if they are self-employed and licensed, separate arrangements are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has clarified the point to an extent.  Some very interesting aspects arose from our previous discussion on this issue.  Cork Harbour Commissioners have a sizeable fund to provide for the pension rights of pilots whereas the funds to provide for pension rights in the other three main ports, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford, are depleted and in two cases they are virtually non-existent.  The Minister said that nobody would be deprived of their pension rights.  Will the staff in Waterford port have problems with their pension rights or will the new companies cater for them?  Will all pilots be eligible to join the pension schemes which the new companies will operate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a similar question. Based on the figures of pension liabilities that are not currently being met, is the Minister in a position to say or even make a rough guess at the potential figure that will be required <Col N="2095" /> from the Exchequer in the next year or two to meet the pension liabilities, particularly in the ports to which Deputy Deasy referred?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with Deputy Michael Smith's question first.  I do not expect there will be a liability and that was the whole purpose of the comments I made earlier.  The provision in the Bill is to deal with the worst case where harbour companies go bust and cannot meet their pension liabilities.  The State will guarantee the pensions of the pensioners and the employees.  The first priority is to ensure that pensioners and employees have guaranteed pension entitlements but the responsibility for ensuring that rests with the harbour companies.  The harbour companies will have to look to their own resources, to their trading position, their commercial future and to their assets to provide that the pension liabilities are met from the pension fund.  To assist in that process we have commissioned through DKM a study of the various harbours to get a more accurate picture of the pension liabilities, the future prospects and the ability of the respective harbour companies to establish pension funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress that the responsibility falls on the individual harbour companies. Provision is not being made in the Bill to provide a vehicle whereby harbour companies can come back to the Exchequer in a year or two and say they need money for the pension fund.  The harbour companies in the first instance will have to provide for the pension funds and only in dire circumstances will the Exchequer be called upon.  I was asked if the Exchequer would be faced with a liability in the next year or two but I do not expect that will be the case. I expect that companies will have to address the very difficult task of building up pension funds.  I hope to some extent that answers part of Deputy Deasy's question because it relates not only to pilots but to harbour employees in general.  Section 96 which relates to the transfer of rights and responsibilities <Col N="2096" /> will protect the pension rights of pilots where their pensions are being paid out of pilotage authority revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeadarClohessy" hpid="Mr. Clohessy Mr. Clohessy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that in the event of the harbour companies going bust the Department would look after the rights of their employees.  Will the Minister give an assurance that in such an event that would be the case?  We all remember a company that was engaged directly and indirectly in the marine that got into financial difficulties and their former employees were at the gate of Leinster House for years until the matter was resolved a short time ago.  I would not like to see a port authority going bust but if that were to happen I would like to be assured that the workers would be dealt with immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has been very helpful on this issue.  I thought I heard the Minister say that pensions paid to pilots is a separate issue but I understand their pensions are paid from current revenue and this is important in the overall context of the income to harbour authorities.  The situation may be different in each harbour area.  Even though they are separate, effectively they are treated as employees and their pensions are paid from current revenue. I am not condoning it but that is the practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not expect that the harbour companies will go out of business. The whole purpose of this legislation is to provide for the commerciality of the harbour ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not want to be responsible for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The prospects for harbour companies are bright.  Trade is increasing in all harbour companies. Prospects for increased trade are substantial. There is considerable growth prospect both through the growth of the economy and the possibility of winning back sea trade that is going across the <Col N="2097" /> Border through Northern ports.  Their commercial future looks bright and it is on that basis they are being set up as commercial semi-State companies.  I have no doubt that when they have that status they will have the capacity and ability to trade more effectively and profitably.  The doomsday scenario we are trying to protect against in the legislation will, we hope, not arise.</P>
      <P>What we are providing in the Bill is a guarantee that, should unforeseen difficulties arise or the worst come to the worst, ultimately pensioners and employees of these harbour companies will receive their pensions.  At the same time, by no stretch of the imagination are we absolving those harbour companies of their primary responsibility to provide these pension funds from their own resources.</P>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Cullen, the position with regard to the payment of pilots' pensions is that they are paid from the pilotage revenue as distinct from the pilotage revenue as distinct from the harbour revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">

      <P>The Minister of State should not be too sure about harbour companies not going out of business.  I remember a ship that berthed in Dungarvan Harbour some years ago, landed on a mud bank and broke its back.  Since at that time urban councils were the local harbour boards &mdash; but were not so designated under the 1946 Act &mdash; when its owners lodged a claim against the harbour board the urban council was held to be the relevant authority.  Were it not for ratepayers and the Department of the Environment that urban council would have been bankrupt.  The Minister of State should not be too sure that a £50 million ship will not come into Waterford, Foynes or Limerick and <Col N="2098" /> be damaged, thus placing severe financial pressure on a harbour company. That is a possible eventuality.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> I move amendment No. 47:</P>
      <P>In page 51, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  Pilotage shall not be compulsory for a ship which is proceeding to or from a pilotage district to which access is only possible by passing through the pilotage district of another company.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is not designed to cause conflict with Waterford.  It is imperative this Bill ensures that, when established, port companies are free to operate commercially without their competitiveness being affected by another port authority with jurisdiction for part of the river leading to the other port.  Problems exist between Waterford and New Ross and this is the means to iron them out.  It is important the Minister takes on board some of my suggestions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present pilotage is compulsory for inbound vessels to Waterford estuary. In many cases ships proceed to Ballyhack-Passage East before embarking a <Col N="2103" /> pilot.  This practice is especially prevalent in poor weather which prevents pilots boarding at Dunmore East.  Pilotage onwards from Ballyhack-Passage East is not compulsory.</P>
    <P>I suggest pilotage should be optional for vessels of less than 8,000 tonnes dead-weight from Dunmore East to Ballyhack-Passage East.  Current practice indicates that compulsory pilotage in this area for ships of a certain size is unnecessary.  I also suggest that the New Ross pilots should board at Ballyhack-Passage East and proceed through the Barrow Bridge to New Ross.  This would improve safety by giving the New Ross pilot a chance to become familiar with the handling characteristics of the ship before crossing the Barrow Bridge which is the most challenging area of navigation in the entire passage.  The current position is not satisfactory whereby the New Ross pilot boards at Cheekpoint as the ship approaches the bridge.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister talked about safety and Deputy Deasy also emphasised the need for safety on Second Stage.  Safety is a major aspect of my suggestions.  My recommendations will improve the cost efficiency of the service without compromising safety.  I ask the Minister to consider seriously setting up a review group to examine the pilotage operations in the estuary which would examine costs, safety, pilotage exemption certificates, logistics, jurisdiction, and all other matters related to the estuary.  The Minister has examined Foynes-Limerick in this way and should similarly examine New Ross-Waterford.</P>
    <P>Rather than have New Ross and Waterford at loggerheads the Minister should put in place a review group and under sections 43, 79 and 80 he would have the power to implement its findings and recommendations without further legislation.  The findings of a review group which would be in the interests of Waterford and New Ross ports should be implemented as quickly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I strenuously oppose this amendment.  It is highly dangerous to contemplate it.  The stretch of water from Dunmore East to Cheekpoint is exceptionally tricky and requires expert knowledge.  It is not acceptable to allow a skipper who has never travelled the channel to take a chance.  It would result eventually in a large ship going aground, blocking the harbour and causing chaos. It is against maritime law to allow a ship to negotiate a hazardous stretch of water without a pilot aboard.  Pilotage is a basic concept of the law of the sea.</P>
      <P>Under no circumstances can this amendment be entertained.  It would involve a financial saving for New Ross harbour commissioners but the safety element will have to be accepted.  The alternative is far too dangerous and, therefore, unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that I spoke at length on this issue on Committee Stage it will come as no surprise to the Minister that I am not in agreement with my colleague on this issue.  I understand why he wants to put forward the issue but I do not agree with his arguments. The stretch of water involved needs expert pilotage.</P>
      <P>The issue of inshore rescue is of concern with regard to the Suir Estuary due to the substantial increase of use of the river and I hope the Minister will deal with the matter.  In addition to bulk cargo ships, there has been an increase in recreational use of the estuary and there are also inshore fishermen working there.  All of these vessels should be active in the estuary to maximise employment in the area but that puts a responsibility on Waterford harbour authority to ensure safety is the foremost consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the last couple of weeks a ship sailed from Dunmore East without permission from the pilotage authority and would not make contact with the pilots or the harbour authority on the open frequency, and it went aground.  Fortunately, no serious accident ensued. However, a ship with a cargo of oil, for example, could break its back and cause <Col N="2105" /> a major spillage which would impact on the shellfish beds and the other activities in the Suir Estuary, not to mention the damage to shipping and the potential loss of life.</P>
    <P>Such factors are a commercial reality. A commercial injustice is not being done to New Ross in this regard.  These are costs every legitimate company or industry must bear in carrying out its business.  I had thought the Minister indicated on Committee Stage that he would discuss the matter with the relevant people in New Ross and Waterford. He cited the example of the Shannon where one authority was made responsible for the pilotage.  If New Ross feels it is too cumbersome to have two pilotage areas I am sure the Waterford harbour authority might take over the pilotage for the New Ross area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is very generous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>That may have the added benefit of achieving two ends.  Deputy Browne mentioned the difficulty of boarding some ships although with the experience of the pilots I doubt it is that difficult.  Perhaps the whole area should be one for pilotage purposes and given that Waterford is one of the premier ports in Europe I am sure the harbour authorities would be happy to take on the task.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to be facetious in making the proposal; I consider it logical.  In reponse to what I said the Minister mentioned that possibility.  If New Ross wishes to remain on its own that is fine, but the question of removing pilotage from Dunmore East to the Barrow Bridge cannot arise.  That would be lunacy and a retrograde step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>There should not be any argument between the two active and growing ports of New Ross and Waterford.  I commend Deputies from Waterford for making a case for the pilots who stand to lose substantially if changes are made but they should not mention the issue of safety just for the sake of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2106" /> The purpose of the Bill is to provide for commercial ports.  Waterford and New Ross ports are commercially oriented and competition between them will increase when the new port companies are set up.  In 1994, New Ross port had a turnover of 1.2 million tonnes and 560 ships entered it.  The estuary is 20 miles long.  A ship bound for New Ross must take on a pilot at Dunmore and them must disembark that pilot and take on another at Cheekpoint.</P>
    <P>I live on the Wexford shore over-looking Dollar Bay and it is with some amazement that people ask how Waterford Harbour Commissioners control the whole estuary.  The cost of entry of ships to New Ross will be determined by a new port company or harbour commissioners. If what is proposed in the Bill is implemented, Waterford port company will decide the level of pilotage charges and light dues for ships bound for New Ross.  We have paid out a lot of money but we have expressed satisfaction&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>New Ross is treated very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As competition becomes keener it is inappropriate for another port company to determine our costs.  For example, if both ports wish a ship to attend its port and the costs are higher at one port than they are at the other, the ship will attend the port with the lower costs.  It will not go to New Ross port just because it is a beautiful town on a beautiful river.  A commercial decision will be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are six buoys and eight shore lights from the Hook to Cheekpoint. From Checkpoint to Waterford port there are six buoys and nine shore lights.  It is amazing that ships bound for New Ross pay for the use of all of them even though they do not enter from Cheekpoint to the Waterford port area. It is estimated that we in New Ross pay £45,000 per annum in light dues and that the maintenance cost to Waterford Harbour Commissioners is £15,000.  Deputy Cullen made a generous offer earlier <Col N="2107" /> but we too are generous.  Although it is a serious matter we are still in a position to compete.</P>
    <P>A ship bound for New Ross or Waterford would normally take a pilot on board at Dunmore.  When they go further up river the Waterford pilot disembarks at Cheekpoint and a New Ross pilot embarks.  Although it may seem complicated, the bottom line is we pay double charges.  It is lovely to see a new coalition in Waterford.</P>

      <P>If weather conditions are bad a pilot will not board a ship at Dunmore East.  The ship will go up river and take a pilot on board in the stiller waters at Passage.  I cross the ferry from Ballyhack to Passage quite often and I know that happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The <i>Marnam</i>, a 1,600 tonne ship, arrived at the Hook on the morning of the 16th.  It was bound for New Ross and requested a pilot from Dunmore.  It was told to wait one and a half hours because of bad weather conditions and the unavailability of a pilot.  The master of that ship, like many another, steamed up river hoping to make the tide.  He followed the <i>Merlake</i> which was piloted.  In estuaries it is quite common for ships without a pilot to follow ships which are piloted.  The tide did not oblige the <i>Marnam</i> and the master dropped anchor.  When the tide went out she was <Col N="2108" /> grounded.  She refloated on the following tide without any damage.</P>
    <P>We would do well to investigate the arrival of the <i>Pyrgos</i> on 16 October 1995.  She berthed on 19 October.  I will not go into the details but anyone who is concerned with safety should look at that.</P>
    <P>We in New Ross are concerned that the port remain commercial and do not want another port company determining costs to our disadvantage.  That would be possible if another port decides such costs.</P>
    <P>In New Ross we have commissioned an independent person from Trinity House to examine the estuary which is navigated in bad weather from Dunmore East to Passage East by all masters. It is strange then that in good weather a pilot has to board at Dunmore East.  This merits investigation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a good one.  Its purpose is commerciality for ports.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment tabled by my constituency colleague, Deputy Browne, to make sure we are all on a level playing pitch.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>Commerciality is an issue in my area also.  The Harbours Bill puts harbours on a commercial basis as independent entities.  A pilotage district could put a port dependent on it for pilotage at a disadvantage but the Minister's amendment No. 56 gives protection in such a situation.  If the Minister or the officials felt the port was being <Col N="2109" /> blackguarded in this way they would invoke amendment No. 56 to ensure it did not happen.</P>
      <P>I would be concerned about ships proceeding without the benefit of a pilot from the point of view of safety.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

      <P>I listened for quite some time to the previous speaker and I am sure he will extend the same courtesy to me.  If he gives me a chance to qualify what I said, I will expand on what I mean by safety.  Shipping is so commercial nowadays that captains come from every country.  In many cases they have not totally mastered the English language.  It may be their first trip to an estuary and they may be confused and need the assistance of pilots to navigate the channels.  I could not support this amendment on that basis. The Minister offers protection within section 56 to ports that might be at a disadvantage because they do not employ their own pilot.</P>

      <P>They say blood is thicker than water.  It would appear that county loyalty is thicker than political loyalty, at least on the opposite side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment proposed by Deputy Browne asks that pilotage should not be compulsory for a ship proceeding to or from a pilotage district to which access is only possible by passing through the pilotage district of another company. On Committee Stage Deputy Hugh Byrne raised the question of compulsory pilotage in the Waterford pilotage district for ships travelling to New Ross. Since then I have had this matter investigated. There is a total of 1,100 ship movements being piloted to and from New Ross each year and 1,600 to and from Waterford Harbour.  With that degree of traffic in the estuary, compulsory pilotage is necessary in the interests of safety for all ships from Dunmore <Col N="2110" /> East to Cheek Point where the New Ross pilots take over.  For that reason I cannot accept Deputy Byrne's amendment.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I would point out that pilot exemption certificates may become more common once the new legislation is in place.  Persons in charge of ships travelling to New Ross on a regular basis will be able to apply for such certificates in respect of the Waterford pilotage district if they so desire and if they satisfy the conditions laid down in section 72, thus cutting overall shipping costs.  New Ross Harbour Commissioners have forwarded another proposal to me concerning pilotage in the Waterford estuary.  In the light of these new proposals both Waterford and New Ross Harbour Commissioners were invited to roundtable talks at the Department of the Marine last Monday, 6 November.  At this meeting it was agreed that a review of the pilotage operation in that estuary would be undertaken with a view to solving the impasse between Waterford and New Ross.</P>
    <P>It was further agreed that a review group would be set up by the Department of the Marine to examine the pilotage issues in detail.  The group will comprise one nominee from Waterford Harbour Commissioners, one nominee from New Ross Harbour Commissioners, one official of the Department of the Marine and one independent member with the necessary technical expertise to be nominated by the Department of the Marine and agreed by both sides.  The terms of reference of the group will be drawn up by the Department and it was agreed that the group would be requested to concentrate on the cost effectiveness of existing pilotage and any new operations proposed, including safety, management, logistics, jurisdiction, pilotage exemption certificates and their effects under the new legislation, and comparison with relevant situations elsewhere in the EU.  It was agreed that the group would convene as soon as possible with a view to the Department receiving the <Col N="2111" /> group's recommendations within three months.</P>
    <P>The Bill, as drafted, will enable any of the review group's recommendations to be implemented.  Section 79, for example, provides for the redefining of pilotage limits and section 43 allows for the amalgamation of interests provided the companies concerned are in agreement.</P>
    <P>I also want to refer to amendment No. 56 which is in my name and which, I understand, is being taken with this amendment.  Concern was expressed on Committee Stage, and again today, that Waterford might use its position to impose excessive pilotage charges on New Ross and thereby put New Ross at a competitive disadvantage.  A similar situation will arise in the case of Foynes and the Shannon estuary or the Limerick Port company where Limerick is the pilotage authority for Foynes.  It could also arise in Dublin Bay where Dublin Port is the pilotage authority for Dun Laoghaire.  My amendment is to provide a safety net to cover situations like those.  If, after vesting day, a company impose exorbitant pilotage charges, the Minister will have the power to intervene and ensure that competition is not distorted.  I should add that a similar provision exists in section 44 regarding general harbour charges.</P>
    <P>In view of what I have said on the establishment of the review group and the amendment which will allow the Minister to intervene where one company uses its pilotage position to make exorbitant charges, I ask Deputy Browne to withdraw his amendment.</P>

      <P>This amendment is proposed at the request of Deputy Molloy who expressed concern on Committee Stage that the Minister for the Marine might define limits for a harbour under the control of a county council without consulting the relevant local authority.

      <P>&ldquo;7.  Limits consisting of the Harbour Works and the land vested in Foynes Port Company from time to time together with the waters and foreshore of the sea and River Shannon lying within the boundaries of County of Limerick, between the meridians 90-5i West of Greenwich passing through the mouth of Robertstown River, and 9-12i West of Greenwich passing through the mouth of the White River at Loghill.&rdquo;.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2116" /> Will the Minister publish the interim and final reports of the mediator appointed to report on Foynes and Limerick harbours?  On Committee Stage he stated that additional jurisdiction was required in the case of Foynes.  Does he still hold that view or is he awaiting the report of the mediator?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It is with some disappointment that I speak to this amendment. Throughout all Stages of the Bill the Minister made considerable effort to meet the demands of the Opposition so that the best possible Bill would be enacted.  The jurisdiction of the estuary is a vexed question with a long history. The Foynes harbour trustees date back to 1890 and the port harbours tribunal, as far back as 1930, recommended that the jurisdiction of Foynes harbour should be defined and extended.  The Murphy report spelled out the need to deal with the matter and on Committee Stage the Minister proposed the appointment of a mediator that would be acceptable to both sides.  The mediator has submitted his report but it is disappointing that the Minister has not introduced an amendment to end the saga.</P>
      <P>Limerick and Foynes are two commercial ports.  The request from Foynes Harbour Authority is for less than 4 per cent of the foreshore, representing approximately five miles of the natural land and water reserves attaching to a port that has expanded successfully since 1965.  As reported in the Official Report of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy of 26 July the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>I am familiar with the issue that has arisen in Foynes.  I visited Foynes harbour at the request of the harbour trustees and saw at first hand their jurisdictional problem.  I have no hesitation in stating that the jurisdiction of Foynes harbour is restricted and that the limits will have to be amended.  It is a question of how we go about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The request for Foynes is justified <Col N="2117" /> because of its rate of expansion.  It would be a great pity if, in the closing stages of this Bill we did not deal in a conclusive and comprehensive way with this matter.  The mediator met both sides and since his report is available to the Minister he must be aware of the recomendation in this regard.  It is inconceivable, based on the Minister's experience and his statement, which I accept as absolutely genuine following his visit to Foynes, that any mediator would turn down the request made by Foynes to allow them proper berthage and the proper commercial freedom of management of the area around the port.  The harbour commissioners in Foynes are not making an unusual or exorbitant request.  They have tailored their needs to what most of us would consider the minimum requirements. The area sought is not sought by and would never be useful to any other harbour.</P>
    <P>In all the amendments the Minister has brought forward on foot of discussions with harbour authorities and harbour interests and discussion in this House and in the select committee, he has attempted to address most or all of the problems in a genuine way.  This is one outstanding problem which goes back in history and all assessments of the problem lead to the conclusion that the jurisdiction of Foynes should be increased.  The management, workforce and board have a proven track record. The Minister has an opportunity finally to lay this matter to rest.  Since we have tried to avoid divisions so far I am anxious to avoid a division on this issue. I want to be absolutely consistent in this matter and it would be a last resort on my part if I were to press the amendment. I am also conscious that Government Deputies who are as interested in this matter as I am should not be compromised for political reasons.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to do one of two things: tell the House that he has the mediator's report, that he will give us access to the recommendations and that he is preparing an amendment for the Seanad to deal with the matter on the <Col N="2118" /> basis of equality and fair play, or alternatively inform us that he has at hand an amendment which we can accept.  In light of the historical evidence, the Minister's genuine statements and the efforts made by all of us to solve this problem, to pass the legislation without dealing with this matter would be a retrograde step.  Amendments have been brought forward on issues that are not as important as this and that have not created such difficulties.  Given the commitment made on Committee Stage that if the mediator's report was available prior to the conclusion of Report Stage an amendment would be brought forward, I see no reason that the Minister cannot bring forward such an amendment or give an undertaking in that regard on the basis of the published mediation report.</P>
    <P>On Report Stage we do not have the opportunity to respond in detail except with the forbearance of the Chair.  I do not want to hear from the Minister that changes may be made to solve this problem after the passage of the Bill.  I have been a Member of this House for a long time and I cannot recall a precedent where a Bill was amended in the early stages after its passage.  It usually stands the test of time for a number of years. In this case all the wrong signals will be given if we fail to deal with the matter now.  I ask the Minister to do his best to solve this problem either in the way I have suggested or otherwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Smith said, we have discussed many amendments to this Bill that were not as important as this one.  The Foynes authority is not making an extraordinary request.  All it is seeking is a small extension of its shoreline to accommodate vessels that cannot travel upstream, and it is sensible that such a request be granted.  I would like the Minister to tell the House whether the mediator's report is available to him.  If a decision is not made on this matter now it will never be made and Foynes will find itself in a <i>cul-de-sac.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This port has generated a huge <Col N="2119" /> amount of business since it was restructured some years ago and the prospects for it are great.  It is possible for many ships to travel only as far as Foynes; they are unable to travel to Limerick. Whereas the harbour commissioners govern this area, the ports authority governs the area I represent.  The position is similar in other areas such as Waterford and Dublin.  Foynes is seeking only a small extension to its port to accommodate big ships and it is right and proper that request be granted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>My views on this matter are well known.  I sat through the entire Committee Stage of the Harbours Bill and I regard this as the most important amendment.  Given that I am a member of the Foynes harbour board I have an emotional interest in this matter. I come from Foynes and my late father who was a harbour pilot gave a lifetime of service to the port of Foynes. However, apart from the emotional aspect, there is logic in what Foynes is looking for.  Foynes Harbour was established in 1890 and its jurisdiction was set at one mile.  The Limerick Harbour Authority claims jurisdiction over the entire estuary, not by way of statute but by some mythical dart which was thrown into the estuary some time in the past.  Foynes has expanded and has more than 1.4 million tonnes of cargo and ships up to 35,000 tonnes deadweight entering the harbour.  The only two ports in the country which can achieve that are Dublin and Cork.</P>
      <P>I was delighted recently when it was designated as one of the 12 commercial ports, which was only right.  That is what we are trying to achieve here.  Foynes is seeking an extension of its jurisdiction because it intends to expand as a commercial port.  It sees the drift in shipping to 60,000 and 70,000 tonners and recognises that the capacity of its port will not be able to cater for that size of ship. Therefore, it wants to move further down the estuary.  As I am sure any Minister or official would agree its demands are very reasonable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2120" /> A mediator was appointed in recent weeks and I had hoped the amendment would be compatible with that tabled by Deputy Browne of Wexford.  The Minister, Deputy Barrett, and the Minister of State are well aware of my interest in this matter and I have lobbied intensively about its importance.  I accept that the Minister assured me that the report of the mediator was an interim one.</P>
    <P>The Minister also assured me that Foynes' jurisdiction will be extended and the question is to what degree will it be extended.  I will not be satisfied by a cosmetic exercise to limit the extension of Foynes' jurisdiction because that would not meet the wishes of those responsible, which is a chance to expand as a commercial port.  The former Minister, Deputy Coveney, recognised that it was a progressive port when he allocated more than £5 million to increase the berthage of the existing facilities and for warehousing facilities in Foynes. Therefore, the Government recognises the importance of Foynes.  Will the Minister give an assurance that the jurisdiction of Foynes will be extended?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I sought to make this change on Committee Stage but it appears that is difficult.  The amendment refers to 90º when it should read 9º.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be some extension.  As Deputies are aware, the Minister, Deputy Barrett, appointed Mr. Patrick J. Murphy to act as independent mediator between Limerick Harbour Commissioners and Foynes Harbour trustees in the matter of an application by Foynes Harbour for an extension of its jurisdiction.  The mediation process commenced early last month and an interim report was received by the Minister on 12 October. The interim report needs to be tested and developed further, which will be done by the mediator at the earliest opportunity.  The issue, as Deputies are aware, is sensitive and we are conscious of the need to tread cautiously with a view to arriving at the right decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, the mediation process <Col N="2121" /> has not yet been concluded and, therefore, I am not yet in a position to go into any detail about it.  However, it is only right that I should indicate to Deputies the general approach which I propose to take on this issue.  I intend to extend the limits and jurisdiction of Foynes Harbour. I wish to assure Deputy Finucane that I do not intend it to be a small cosmetic extension.</P>
    <P>As I said on Committee Stage, and as Deputy Smith reminded me in the course of his contribution, I am satisfied that there is a case for the extension of the limits and the jurisdiction of Foynes Harbour, with which I intend to proceed. That will obviously involve consequential changes in the jurisdiction of the Shannon estuary ports company.  As Deputy Smith said, this issue has been kicking around for a long time and has been the subject of some debate in the area.  I am sure Deputies will appreciate that it is not simply a matter of arbitrarily drawing lines on a map.  Apart from the views of the respective port companies and harbour commissioners, there are issues relating to navigation, hydrographic issues and so on which have to be taken into account in any decision of this kind.</P>
    <P>The process of mediation which we started will take a little longer.  When it is completed I intend to proceed with an extension of Foynes Harbour.  If the process is completed prior to the Bill being taken in the Seanad I will deal with it in that House.  However, assuming that the Bill passes through this House today, I do not have control over when it will be taken in the Seanad and the time involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be dealt with fairly quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  I do not want to make a rash promise about the Seanad which time constraints could prevent me from meeting.  However, if the final report is available I will deal with it in the Seanad.  If it is not available before that, a further amendment to the Bill is not required.  Deputy Smith <Col N="2122" /> raised the possibility of the Bill having to be amended shortly after it is passed. It will not require an amendment to the legislation.  Section 9 will enable the Minister to change the jurisdiction by order.  Deputy Smith also asked for an assurance on the publication of the arbitrator's report.  I have no difficulty in making that report available when it is completed.</P>
      <P>Deputy Smith said that he was not anxious that we divide on this issue and I wish to tell him that I intend to extend the limits of Foynes Harbour and it will not be a cosmetic extension.  There are complex issues involved which the arbitration process has not yet completed. When that is completed I will deal with the matter either in the Seanad or by using section 9(2).</P>

      <P>I mentioned the question of introducing amending legislation as quickly as possible because I was aware of section 9 (2) and the ministerial order required.  Under that section the Minister granted jurisdiction to one authority knowing he would change it.  I do not remember any precedent in that context where such changes were made as quickly as might have been indicated at that time.  That is why I was anxious to be further assured about the Minister's intentions.</P>

In those circumstances I am in a position to withdraw the amendment.  I look forward to the end of this historical saga with Foynes harbour authorities in the long run securing a reasonable outcome to its genuine demand.</P>

I do not consider it appropriate or necessary to include in primary legislation the provision to which Deputy Clohessy referred.  It is more appropriate to include it in the pilotage by-laws made under paragraph (b).

      <P>I thank all Members of the House who contributed to this constructive debate.  There was a general spirit of co-operation on all sides in getting the Bill through.  I thank the chairman of the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy, Deputy Bell, for the manner in which he facilitated the Bill's passage through Committee Stage.  I express my appreciation to the officials in the Department of the Marine and my ministerial colleague, Deputy Barrett, for their work and co-operation on the preparation and processing of the Bill.  This important legislation will establish the main harbours as commercial State companies.  It is the first major legislation dealing with harbours in almost 50 years.  It is opening up a new era for <Col N="2125" /> port development.  As we are aware, more than 90 per cent of our trade passes through our sea ports which are critically important to our trade, economy and competitiveness.  A two pronged approach is being taken by the Government to the development of our harbours; the legislative approach establishing the 12 major ports as commercial companies and a major investment programme through the deployment of EU funds in the development of the ports. That coupled with developments in shipping will mark the beginning of a new era for shipping and ports.  This legislation is a watershed.</P>
      <P>Many issues that we did not address by way of amendment on Report Stage were raised during the course of the debate.  Towards the end of Committee Stage Deputy Molloy raised an important question and sought to call my bluff regarding the definition of the term &ldquo;clow&rdquo;.  I undertook to provide him with a definition of that term on Report Stage.  I found a definition of the term in an old Oxford dictionary provided by the Galway Harbour Commissioners. The term &ldquo;clow&rdquo; appears in that dictionary immediately before the term &ldquo;clown&rdquo;.  There are two possible applications of it.  One is a dam for water, a sluice or flood gate, as I suspected when Deputy Molloy raised the question.  The other definition is an implement resembling a dungfork with the prongs bent at right angles and used for dragging dung out of cow stalls.  I suspect the definition included in the Harbours Bill is the former rather than the latter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2126" /> I thank his officials and the spokes-persons on all sides on their great effort to produce good legislation.  We probably underestimate the value of water, the seas and our rivers in the context of national development.  It is good to see a commercial ethos and new thinking in the way in which we are to transport goods, manage harbours and develop businesses in a more competitive manner. We often say we are a peripheral country but we are fortunate to have deep waters and we have a range of harbour facilities which need to be commercially developed.  Let us hope this Bill will play its part in expanding national development, providing employment and enhancing our environment. The use of our ports and seas in the context of trade is a more advisable way to proceed than cluttering up inland transport systems as Ireland and most countries have done in the past.  As an inland Deputy I was happy to become familiar with some of the terms but I have a long way to go to become totally familiar with them.  I am grateful to my colleagues for the support given to me during the debate.</P>

I compliment the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials who drafted the legislation.  Deputy Peadar Clohessy could probably have adopted a different attitude on the amendment relating to Foynes because he represents Limerick East which embraces Limerick Harbour. His stance indicates the quality of Deputy Clohessy in that he could see the validity of what Foynes was seeking. I look forward to seeing Foynes as a commercial port.  I am sure the Minister and his officials will grant what appears to be a logical extension to what the Foynes authorities want.</P>

Unfortunately, I was not available for Second and Committee Stages but I am pleased to be present today for Report and Final Stages.  Some 90 per cent of our trade comes through the ports.  Our ports are exceptionally good and are probably the best in Europe.  We should be mindful of that and ensure they are utilised to the utmost.  Shannon, Dublin and Wexford ports are excellent and handle a huge amount of shipping.  This is an important Bill.  It may not appear important to those living inland but to those around the estuaries it is of vital importance to the commerce of the towns and villages.</P>

We travelled through some difficult waters well charted by the Minister's officials.  We did not go aground; we dropped anchor occasionally, the crew threatened mutiny occasionally but we had an excellent pilot.

In the past we tended to see the refugee problem as a Third World or a Middle Eastern problem and certainly one a long distance from here. The fact that the refugee problem has moved to Western Europe has made us more sensitive to this worldwide problem. It is time to upgrade our legislation and move from working under the administrative procedures arising out of our signing of the Convention on Asylum Seekers in 1951, to giving a statutory framework for the treatment and support of people who might seek refuge here.</P>

    <P>The passage of this Bill will be a source of great satisfaction to a ministerial colleague of mine, Deputy Donal Carey, who has not been traditionally associated with major legislative reforms.  During the past ten years he has constantly raised the individual cases he came across directly as a result of representing the Shannon area.  It was often at Shannon that distraught and traumatised refugees seeking asylum found their way into this country and where many received an unfavourable reception.  That is what the Bill seeks to <Col N="2129" /> respond to and, therefore, it is welcome. It will put on a statutory basis the way in which we propose to treat those seeking asylum in Ireland as well as the rights of our special programme refugees who have additional rights and supports here.  The Bill is a full and proper response to our commitments under the convention and clarifies many of the procedures in relation to refugees.  It deals with the hearing of applications, the special treatment of family members and an issue which caused many difficulties in individual cases, namely, the question of adequate interpreter services. The Bill goes a long way in that regard.</P>
    <P>Detaining asylum seekers in our prisons for long periods of time did not reflect well on this country.  While there will be some improvement in this area under the Bill, non-governmental organisations, particularly Amnesty International, continue to be concerned. I hope further reforms will follow if the Bill goes through the House.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a humanitarian response to the question of refugees which is essential in any civilised society.  I recently returned from Sweden which has a long tradition of accepting refugees from Europe.  Its commitment in this regard commenced during the period immediately following the Second World War.  Many of the people who arrived in Sweden were economic as well as political refugees. Almost 12 per cent of the Swedish population is made up of immigrants and Sweden has a strong tradition of support for asylum seekers.  I am glad that Ireland is adopting a more active role in this regard than it did in the past.</P>
    <P>Some areas of concern remain in the Bill and Amnesty International, in particular, have identified four or five areas where it would like to see further progress. I wish to refer to those in detail because, while the Bill is welcome, its progress through the House will involve improving it by way of amendments.  It is a worth-while experience to be involved in the debate on a Bill from beginning to end, to table various <Col N="2130" /> amendments and to have some of them accepted.  This is not the type of Bill on which there should be resistance to conceding well made points.</P>
    <P>While the proposal to give legal effect to the 1951 Geneva Convention is welcome, I am concerned about certain sections of the Bill.  There has been a broad welcome for the new definition of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo;.  I welcome also the grounds for humanitarian leave to remain in the State because it indicates a more open attitude on the part of this country in giving refuge to people fleeing persecution in their countries of origin.  It is not always easy to give refuge to asylum seekers in a country with high levels of unemployment and other economic difficulties. To do so, however, is a sign of great maturity and generosity and I am glad the Government and the Irish people are responding favourably to various humanitarian problems around the world.</P>
    <P>One of the most important questions that has been raised concerns the treatment of refugees who arrive in Ireland without adequate documentation.  We all know from reading novels, Amnesty International documents or newspaper articles that in many cases the only way people can get out of their own countries when fleeing persecution is by forging documents.  The importance being attached to documentation in the context of whether a person is detained while their case is being heard is an area of concern to Amnesty International.  I hope this matter can be teased out on Committee Stage with a view to resolving the problem.</P>
    <P>In regard to legal representation, Amnesty International points out that refugees fleeing their own countries leave in the poorest of circumstances, in some cases with little more than the clothes on their backs.  Regardless of their previous financial status in their own country they often arrive here without any resources or access to resources. There are exceptions but this is true in the majority of cases, especially in regard to people most at risk.  Their properties may have been confiscated <Col N="2131" /> without the possibility of being returned in the foreseeable future.  To expect those people to pay their own legal costs will prevent them having access to legal representation which is provided for in the Bill.  This is another area to which we must respond.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International makes other detailed recommendations to which I hope the Minister will give active consideration; I know correspondence has been sent directly to the Minister.  It frequently refers to the question of documentation and makes the point that the provisions in relation to the need for proper documentation do not take account of the plight of refugees.  This becomes more relevant in the later sections of the Bill in relation to detention. This is an issue about which we were embarrassed in the past when refugees were detained for long periods in our jails.  The occasions on which this is allowed in the future should be limited and lack of documentation, in particular, should not be a reason for detention, as the Bill seems to suggest.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International makes further recommendations in relation to the Refugee Appeal Board which are worthy of consideration.  It looks forward to the progress of the Bill through the House and the acceptance of further amendments.</P>
    <P>When discussing the question of refugees, it is interesting to reflect on the reason for the increase in the number of refugees.  Many people become refugees as a result of war or various political upheavals in their own countries.  We have witnessed that in a most dramatic and horrendous form in Africa in recent years and also throughout Europe in the past decade.  If we are to ensure that refugees eventually return to their own countries, we must examine the causes of the conflicts which force them to become refugees.</P>
    <P>One of the critical issues to be addressed is justice in relation to the original problem forcing refugees to flee their own countries.  This is currently to the fore in the former Yugoslavia where <Col N="2132" /> two former leaders are facing charges on war crimes.  Any future for refugees can only be based on a just settlement. Economic instability is another reason for the increase in the number of refugees. That is an issue with which the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, is familiar.  If we are to see a reduction in the numbers of refugees in future, the question of the fair distribution of wealth and goods throughout the world must be addressed.</P>

      <P>The Attorney General, as a constitutional officer of the State, is independent in the performance of his duties.  Under Article 30 of the Constitution, the Attorney General is appointed by the President on the nomination of the Taoiseach, who has the power to request his resignation. The Taoiseach, therefore, has the political responsibility to be satisfied that the Attorney General's functions are being properly and adequately performed.  He also has responsibility under the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, in relation to certain staffing matters in the Office of the Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe it is his duty to inform the House of the basis upon which the Attorney General gives certain advice to the Government?  For example, would he regard it as his duty to tell the <Col N="2133" /> House why the Attorney General would tell the Government that a Minister should be indemnified at the taxpayer's expense when sued in his personal capacity for defamatory remarks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not consider it my duty to inform the House of advice tendered to the Government by the Attorney General.  The advice tendered to the Government by the Attorney General, and the advice tendered to previous Governments by previous Attorneys General, has always been a confidential matter between the client and the legal adviser and has not been the subject of responses to parliamentary questions in the House.</P>

      <P>The Deputy asked two questions and the answer to the second one depended on the answer to the first.  He asked if I had responsibility to tell the House of advice received by the Government from the Attorney General.  The answer to that question is no and I may not.  His second question was not relevant as I am not in a position to tell the House of advice tendered by the Attorney General to the Government. My understanding is that the assumptions being made by the Deputy are not correct.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that the general public is entitled to know the demarcation line in regard to this issue?  We are talking of possibly hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money in one instance and we may be speaking about millions of pounds in the future.  Does <Col N="2134" /> the Taoiseach believe he has a duty to tell the House where the demarcation line is?  In other words, can he tell the House the circumstances in which the Attorney General would advise that an alleged defamatory statement made by a Minister should be paid for by the taxpayer if it is found by a court to be defamatory?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is bringing the separate matter of indemnities into a question concerned solely with answerability to the House for the Office of the Attorney General.  The established practice is that if an indemnity is granted for whatever reason the person who avails of it &mdash; this applies to all public servants whether they are civil servants or ministerial appointees &mdash; may be covered for their costs but they will not receive any of the damages which will go to the State.  That is my understanding of the general policy which applies in regard to indemnities. The granting of indemnities has been a very rare occurrence in recent times. The Deputy's query about indemnities in particular cases is an entirely separate matter and there is no reference to it in the question.  He has, surprisingly, attempted with some success to introduce the issue of indemnities into this question where it has no place.  If he wishes to table a question about indemnities in respect of a particular case it will be answered by the appropriate Minister.</P>

      <P>Given the duality of the Attorney General's role as protector of the public interest on the one hand and legal adviser to the Government on the other, does the Taoiseach think there is a need to separate his functions?  The Government gave a commitment to do this in the Programme for Government and I would like to know if the matter is being examined.  On the letter recently sent by the Attorney General to RTE in advance of the broadcasting <Col N="2135" /> of a programme, was he acting in the public interest or as adviser to the Government?

      <P>In response to Deputy Harney, the Attorney General sent the letter to RTE in his capacity as guardian of the public interest and, as was proper, without consulting me.  It was not a matter upon which he should have consulted me as he was acting in an independent capacity.</P>
      <P>Deputy Harney raised the question of the possible division of the functions of the office.  This is one of the matters that will be dealt with in the report of the review group on the Constitution which will shortly fall to be considered by a committee of the House.

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a well established distinction between administration and policy matters.  &ldquo;Administration&rdquo; would exclude policy decisions and legal advice, but include the expeditious processing of business, such as how files were dealt with and moneys accounted for.  The Deputy should pursue these matters when the Bill is introduced when he will receive more information from the Minister concerned than I can give here on an extempore basis.</P>

      <P>This question relates to <Col N="2138" /> the circumstances in which the Taoiseach is accountable to the House for the actions of the Attorney General. Apparently, it is the Attorney General who offers advice on the question of whether there should be indemnity in a particular case.  If he indicates that there should be indemnity, the expenditure of hundreds of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money will be involved.  Does the Taoiseach agree that, in the interests of common justice, the taxpayer should be informed of the grounds on which such advice is based?</P>

    <P>At the invitation of Mr. John Hume, MP, MEP, I visited Derry on 27 October.  My principal engagements were: &mdash; a civic reception at the Guildhall, hosted by the Mayor of Derry at which I met a wide range of elected representatives and the leaders of the four main churches in the area, at the reception, I had an opportunity for useful exchanges of views on many aspects of the current political situation; &mdash; a walk through parts of the commercial centre of Derry which afforded an opportunity to see at first-hand the remarkable renaissance in the economic life of the city in recent years; &mdash; a visit to the Church of Ireland Cathedral, the <Col N="2140" /> Cathedral School and the Deanery at the invitation of Dean Orr; &mdash; a walk on the historic city walls; &mdash; a walk through the Fountain Estate including a visit to its new primary school; &mdash; a walk and drive through the Bogside and the Creggan where I had an opportunity to meet local community groups which were joined for the occasion by representatives of community groups from the Waterside and the Fountains area &mdash; the meeting with these groups included a most useful discussion on local development issues; &mdash; a reception hosted in my honour by the president and officers of the local chamber of commerce and North-West International, formerly known as the Derry-Boston Venture.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased to have the opportunity to visit both Nationalist and Unionist areas and to meet such a wide range of people, including political representatives, leaders of the main local Churches, community activists from both traditions and a cross-section of representatives of the local business community.</P>
    <P>I am happy to report to the House that I was warmly and courteously received everywhere and I hope that my visit contributed in some small way to the bridge-building that is so necessary if lasting peace and reconciliation is to be achieved.  I also wish to put on record my admiration for the impressive economic and social developments that have been facilitated in Derry by the spirit of practical co-operation that characterises the relationship between the political parties there.  It is a model for all of us and shows what can be accomplished when differences are put aside and people work together for the common good.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that John Hume declined an invitation to meet him at Government Buildings after he refused to hold a joint meeting with John Hume and Gerry Adams and that he had no option but to go to Derry?  Is that not the reason he travelled to the North?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is not.  John Hume was unable to accept the offer of a meeting with me at 8.30 a.m. on Friday, 13 October because he was ill.  I mentioned to him during a telephone conversation that day that I was due to visit Donegal and Leitrim on 26 and 27 October and suggested that it might be possible for me to visit Derry.  He was very interested in this proposal and immediately said that he would make the arrangements for the visit which he did in an exemplary fashion.  I take this opportunity of thanking him not only for the comprehensive and well organised nature of the visit, but also for the breadth of the contacts he was able to arrange for me at short notice.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe it is sensible to put forward different proposals to the British Government from those presented by John Hume today on his behalf and that of Gerry Adams given that Northern Nationalists are becoming increasingly concerned that he is allowing divisions to be created between the Irish Government and the Nationalist party in the North?  This matter has been the subject of many editorials since the subject of Northern Ireland was last discussed in the House two weeks ago.  Is the Taoiseach concerned that there may be a rift?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no rift.  The Government has its own functions to perform on its own authority and is doing so, having listened to everybody, in the interests of moving the process forward.  We have to take into account the views of all parties, not just one or two, in framing proposals.  The next <Col N="2142" /> group of questions, Nos. 4 to 9, inclusive, deals more substantively with the matters with which the Deputy is concerned. Questions Nos. 2 and 3 deal with the visit to Derry and it would be better if the Deputy confined his supplementary questions to the subject matter of those questions.</P>

      <P>During the Taoiseach's visit to Derry he met the north-west Border group, as he said.  Some members of the group were deeply concerned at his replies to questions on additionality to EU funding.

      <P>He is citing inaccurately what occurred at the meeting.  I made no comment about additionality other than the well-known fact that the Government has a target of not increasing public spending by more than 2 per cent over the rate of inflation in any year.  That is necessary to qualify for economic and monetary union and in order to keep interest rates low.  Deputy Leonard is well aware of that.  The comments I made at this private meeting were entirely unexceptional and no more than a restatement of known Govenment policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2145" /> This Government's clear and consistent aim in the peace process is to achieve the opening of round table talks with all parties present.  We believe that in this way a reasonable settlement to which all parties can give their consent can be agreed.  The Government has engaged in discussions and consultations to achieve its talks objective with the parties in Northern Ireland, with parties in this House and with the British Government.  In recent days, based on that consultation process, I have put, on behalf of the Government, certain ideas to the British Prime Minister. These ideas are intended to point a way of moving forward, in the short-term, to our goal of fully inclusive talks.</P>
    <P>I had a brief discussion with the Prime Minister, Mr. Major, in Jerusalem on Monday.  I am satisfied that with a constructive response on all sides, the two Governments can move quickly to holding a summit.  I do not believe it useful in the delicate present circumstances to give more detailed information. I also had a separate, very brief meeting with President Clinton in Jerusalem.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at speculative reports on the present situation in the peace process in recent days.  I need hardly remind the House of the sensitivity of the issue with which we are dealing.  We should do nothing to make it more difficult for any side to give its consent to the reasonable approach the two Governments are working intensively to achieve.  I am happy to offer to the Opposition parties in this House a fuller briefing on the matter within the next week or so, if they wish to take up that offer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his brief reply.  He will accept it is the obligation of this side of the House to ask reasonable questions and we do nothing to create difficulties for the peace process.  We wish to help it in every way.  In the last few days, Mr. John Hume, on behalf of Mr. Gerry Adams and himself, made it known that <Col N="2146" /> they were issuing proposals; the Taoiseach did not make it known until last night that he was issuing proposals.  Is it correct for those of us on this side of the House to assume that the Taoiseach's proposals differ radically from theirs?</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree the prolonged postponement of the summit represents a failure of diplomacy? When it was cancelled over two months ago we were told to expect a resumption in a few days or weeks.  We fully accepted that on this side of the House and did not raise the matter for a considerable time.  However, it keeps being postponed, despite the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Harney four weeks ago that he believed it was tantalisingly close.</P>
      <P>Is it fair to say that one difficulty the Taoiseach faces is carrying the Northern Nationalist parties with him in any agreement with the British Government? In briefings he continually says he wishes to carry everyone with him.  I understand that, but the Taoiseach is the leader of Nationalist Ireland and I do not see any great effort by the British Government to change its position of not moving anywhere without the Unionist parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The assumption underlying the Deputy's questions is false.  He is inferring that the two Governments represent in each case one side of the community in Northern Ireland only.  If he thinks back on recent developments he will see that his statement &mdash; that the British Government is not prepared to move without Unionist support &mdash; is not backed up by historical fact.  The British Government agreed to the Framework Document and the Anglo-Irish Agreement without any such support.  The British Government has shown, in common with this Government, that in the right circumstances it is willing to make a decision as to what it believes is right to move matters forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government is not the agent of anyone.  It is responsible to this House to act as it thinks best in the interests of <Col N="2147" /> peace.  I regard that obligation as also applying to the British Government.  We also have an obligation to be comprehensive in the consultations in which we engage to ensure any initiative we take has the maximum level of support.  I agree with those who suggest that moving forward precipitately, without engaging in extensive consultation, is unwise.  At the same time, at the final point of decision, the Government has a responsibility &mdash; which is its alone &mdash; to create a framework on which progress can be made.  That is a responsibility I take seriously and intend to exercise fully, as I have done in recent days.</P>
    <P>The Deputy is also entirely wrong in the assumption that this initiative I have taken as the Head of Government is in any sense an indication of difference or agreement with any document published by anyone else.  No such inference can be drawn.  The function and the role of the Government is to govern.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it the Taoiseach disagrees that the British position in the peace process is now driven entirely by their political dependence on Unionist votes at Westminster?  Am I interpreting briefings given by the Taoiseach outside the House correctly when I say he sees his position and the Government's role as one of facilitator?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy's view.  The British Government is acting as a Government, as we are, and while it must take account of its parliamentary position it has a majority in the House of Commons as this Government has in the Dáil.  Both Governments can act as they think appropriate in the interests of the wider community.  I do not see my position as one of facilitator.  I have never done so and would not put forward proposals on my own if I did so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree with the comments made by Mr. Chris McGimpsey to the effect that if <Col N="2148" /> the IRA were to rule out any first strike option it would add a new dynamic to unlocking the log jam?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>In September the Taoiseach said the Government may have to move ahead without having any other party on board.  Is that still the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Our overall position on the responsibilities we have as a Government has not changed.  As I stated earlier, we have a responsibility to consult as widely as possible to obtain the maximum degree of support for any initiative we wish to take.  Where we do not get such support we have a responsibility to make proposals in what we would regard as the best available knowledge of the views of other parties so that, if they are not prepared to be supportive straightaway, when conditions are such they can give support at a later stage.  That basically is the position and there has not been any change in my perception of the role of the Government in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not an exaggeration to say that the framework document is rarely mentioned nowadays by the Taoiseach or the British and that there has not been any attempt to movthe document forward in recent months. Does the Taoiseach accept that in dealing with the Downing Street Declaration or whatever new declaration he would like to work to he must display an even-handed approach to the representatives of the Unionist community and he should do so as the senior representative of nationalist opinion?  Is it not the case that the Anglo-Irish Agreement signed by the then Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald gave the Irish Government the role of being the voice of the Nationalist community?  Does the Taoiseach disown that position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated on many occasions that I take seriously the <Col N="2149" /> responsibilities I have under the Downing Street Declaration and the Anglo-Irish Agreement.  As the Deputy said, under that agreement the Government has responsibility in regard to the promotion of the best interests of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  I take that responsibility extremely seriously and for that reason I have had a large number of meetings with political parties representing Nationalist opinion in Northern Ireland. I do not believe &mdash; I hope the Deputy agrees with me &mdash; that the interests of the Nationalist community are served by promoting initiatives that cannot command the support of the Unionist community.  Perhaps the Deputy needs to be reminded in light of the questions he has put that the only way we will have a settlement in Northern Ireland is by agreement between both sides.  For an Irish Government to fail to intensively inform itself of the feelings of both communities would be for it to fail to serve the interests of either community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that it is time for him to state clearly and unequivocally that the creation of an assembly in advance of negotiations, which is where the difference lies between the Taoiseach's position and that of John Hume, was tried in 1975 and 1982 and failed?  Does he accept that John Hume, Séamus Mallon on behalf of the SDLP and Martin McGuinness on behalf of Sinn Féin rejected the idea in the most emphatic way I have heard them reject anything in the last decade and that it is a nonstarter from the Nationalist point of view?  Perhaps the Taoiseach will state that position publicly and openly to the British Government so that we do not waste time going down a non-road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not made any public comment on the proposal for an assembly or convention which emanated from the Unionist parties other than to say, given it is a proposal from those parties, that it should be studied <Col N="2150" /> carefully before comments of a dismissive kind are made.  I have not had an opportunity to have substantial discussions on the proposal with the Unionist parties.  We discussed other topics when I met them.  Therefore, I am not taking any view about the proposal other than to say I fully understand and have heard the strong objections to it from both the SDLP and Sinn Féin. Undoubtedly the Unionist parties would have to give serious thought and consideration to those objections in so far as they continue to advance the proposal for an assembly.  The most constructive and desirable way to get the best out of everyone's proposals is to sit down and talk about them and not adopt the approach of megaphone diplomacy where people discuss their positions on other people's ideas over the airwaves.  That is why I hope we can get to the preparatory talks phase quickly, where these positions could be discussed in a non-threatening way, and move towards all inclusive round table talks.  There is merit in having bilateral meetings between the parties in Northern Ireland where they could discuss their fears about the matter.  I remind the House that in the comment I made in Majorca on the idea of an assembly I emphasised strongly that no such proposal should be considered other than in the context of the three stranded approach &mdash; a North-South dimension must be inherent in it from day one and there is no question of an internal settlement or approach being given any electoral or other fair wind.  The problem can only be solved in the context of the three strands of the relationships that exist.  I will not support any proposal that will undermine, appears to undermine or is seen to undermine the three stranded approach.  Given the gulf that has existed for over 300 years in the two communities in Northern Ireland the best approach for everyone is not one of rejecting proposals emanating from the other side but rather one of cautious scepticism, questioning and dialogue.</P>

      <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern is getting better at distorting what I say than he used to be.  I did not say any such thing.  I referred to the statement made in Majorca when I urged people not to reject proposals outright but rather to look at them before making any dismissive comment.  That statement was made without reference to anybody in particular.  I have not made any reference of the kind to either of the people to whom Deputy Ahern referred and I would ask him not to make such an inference because it is unhelpful.</P>

      <P>The proposal put forward by Mr. David Trimble that an assembly should operate in advance of negotiations was tried some 20 years ago, and again 13 years ago, but failed on both occasions.

      <P>In regard to the matter to which the Deputy has referred, there is a difference of opinion or of emphasis within the Government in regard to our approach to the peace <Col N="2153" /> process or to Northern Ireland matters in general.  All decisions are taken jointly by the three party leaders.  The positive proposals I have conveyed to the British Government on this matter, designed to break the current impasse and move us forward towards inclusive talks, have been made with the full support and knowledge of the Tánaiste and the Minister for Social Welfare who act with me in all of these matters in a united way.  I think the Deputy will have to trawl even more assiduously in the British press than he has done to date to find evidence of the kind he indicates.

      <P>The strategy pursued by my predecessor of maintaining very close contact with both sections of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland was an extremely good one and it is one that I am following fully.  I would have to remind Deputy Tom Kitt &mdash; and I have had occasion to become more fully aware of this since coming into office than might have been the case when I was in Opposition &mdash; that my predecessor was quite willing, as head of a Government, to make his own decisions on issues too.  He did not feel obliged, as Taoiseach responsible to this House, to follow anything other than his own judgment for which he was willing <Col N="2154" /> to be accountable as head of Government.

      <P>I think I answered in the affirmative a question as to whether it would move things forward, not break the logjam.  I think it would be a very valuable, positive contribution.  It is a proposal which has already been put to Sinn Féin and the IRA.  I have mentioned it in the course of discussions with Sinn Féin but so far they have not been in a position to give an affirmative response.  However, we are pursuing other approaches which I hope would have an equivalent reassuring effect. The Deputy's suggestion is a helpful one and should be considered by the relevant parties.</P>

      <P>While we all recognise the primary constitutional obligation of the Taoiseach and Government is to act on behalf of the Irish people, the Taoiseach made the point that there comes a time when that primary responsibility means he has to make his own decisions. In taking such decisions and putting forward proposals, does he accept circumstances may arise in which it would be acceptable to him that such proposals would allow for Unionist participation in talks without full Northern Nationalist participation?  Is this something with which he would be prepared to live, whereas talks that would involve full Nationalist participation, without any Unionist participation, are something with which he could not live?</P>

      <P>No, Sir, that would not represent my view.  My view is that we should aim to have all parties at the table.  I take a more inclusive view of the Irish people than perhaps some others. <Col N="2155" /> I do not regard it as my responsibility to concern myself exclusively with one section of the community in Northern Ireland.  I would regard all of the people of Northern Ireland under the articles of our Constitution to which many Members on the far side of the House refer in approving terms as imposing an obligation on me to be concerned for the welfare of both communities and both religious traditions in Northern Ireland.

On the other hand, I reaffirm that the Irish Government has a special responsibility, under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, to be concerned about the views of the Nationalist community.  As I have said already in response to Deputy Bertie Ahern, the interests of the Nationalist community can be advanced only on the basis of an agreement. That agreement has to be with the Unionist community and, therefore, both communities are of concern to me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The live register total has always exceeded the labour force survey estimate of unemployment.  The difference was relatively small until the mid-1980s but has grown considerably since then. The latest figures, for April 1995, show that the live register exceeds the LFS estimate of the number unemployed by some 84,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The labour force survey, which has followed a consistent methodology since 1975, is the only objective source of information on numbers employed and unemployed.  The recent survey results are based on a classification of persons according to their own description of their situation &mdash; that is whether at work, unemployed, working in the home, retired, etc.  The live register, on the other hand, relates to persons who fall within the ambit of certain social welfare schemes designed essentially to cushion the impact on income of job loss.  Changes in the administrative rules <Col N="2157" /> and practices governing these schemes all have an impact on the live register.</P>
    <P>The most significant change in recent years was the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1985 which resulted in an increased number of women signing on, without any change in their labour force status. Other factors which are likely to have had an impact on the live register, and to have contributed to the divergence, include the introduction of signing on as an eligibility requirement for subsequent participation in employment or training schemes; the increasing number of part-time and occasional workers (other than those on systematic short-time) who sign on in respect of days when they are not employed; changes in the rules and practices in relation to means testing; changes in the levels of unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit payments; arrangements for splitting of entitlements between spouses.  These factors would tend, in the main, to exert an upward influence on the live register.  However, it is not possible to quantify the exact impact of any one of these factors.</P>
    <P>Given that the labour force survey, not the live register, provides the only objective measure of unemployment, a key policy implication which arises is the need for more frequent surveys. Proposals in relation to sub-annual surveys are currently being formulated by the CSO in consultation with the relevant Government Departments and agencies.  It is the Taoiseach's intention to bring a final set of proposals to Government in the coming weeks in this regard which would address, <i>inter alia</i>, the issue of the content of such surveys and the frequency with which they should be conducted.  Finally, the number of persons on home duties in the 1995 labour force survey was 625,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  He will be aware there were 84,000 people more on the live register than were measured as unemployed in the labour force survey. What are 84,000 people who are not <Col N="2158" /> claiming to be unemployed doing on the live register?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have explained this arises as a result of a number of divergences.  The live register is compiled monthly.  The labour force survey is carried out in April and May of every year, covering 5 per cent of the population and 45,000 households.  It is carried out in accordance with the best international standards and norms and it is generally recognised as the definitive gauge of employment and unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question as to the seeming contradiction is valid.  One has to look at the reasons the measures differ. Some persons who are unemployed may not be included on the live register while others who satisfy the administrative requirements for unemployment assistance or benefit may not be unemployed. The detailed results of the 1994 labour force survey indicate that 28,000 who described themselves as &ldquo;at work&rdquo; also said they were signing on.  It is possible for a large number of people who work part-time or occasionally to sign on in respect of days when they are not employed.</P>
      <P>The 1994 labour force survey also indicates that 23,000 persons who described their status as &ldquo;on home duties&rdquo; also said they were signing on. This is indicative of the impact of equality legislation in the mid-1990s.</P>

      <P>Which benchmark does the OECD use when examining Irish unemployment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>In its analysis of the Irish economy the OECD takes both figures into consideration.  It is in everybody's interest to ascertain the precise figure and it is recognised internationally that the figure we should use is the labour force survey.  The Government is looking at the possibility of moving to a more regular definitive assessment, in other words the labour force survey.  There is a cost implication of an additional £1.9 million if one <Col N="2159" /> moves to quarterly surveys.  I do not wish to pre-empt a Government decision but from the points of view of accuracy, economic analysis and satisfying people's understandable scepticism we should move toward a quarterly labour force survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would impress on the Minister of State the urgency of moving more quickly on this.  He mentioned the cost implication but the cost of a thousand persons on the live register is now £4 million per year and the cost of the survey must be put in proportion to that.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that ten years ago the gap was 6,000 and this year it is 84,000 and rising?  Is he also aware that such surveys are carried out quarterly in the UK whereas we carry them out once a year?  Will the Government examine the level of unemployment as indicated on the live register given that it is becoming a joke to have 84,000 drawing benefit in a way which conflicts dramatically with what the Minister of State describes as an accurate survey?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy's observation that the gap has grown &mdash;in 1987 the figure was 18,600, in 1988 23,000, in 1989 31,000, in 1990 45,000 up to 84,000 this year.  It is not, however, a uniquely Irish experience but is repeated in other countries.  In Belgium the figure is 163,000, in Denmark 130,000, in Greece 189,000, in France 111,000 and in Italy 2,420,000.  There is a recognition in those countries of the need for a more standard procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept there are 84,000 people getting dole who should not be getting it, in other words lying for a living. Many people signing on are simply exercising their right to do so.  They are stating in effect that they are available and able for work and are looking for a job, but they may not necessarily qualify for unemployment assistance.  Many people apply in the hope they will get a place on a community employment scheme or a FÁS scheme by signing on <Col N="2160" /> for a set period of time and this get some work beneficial to them or the community.  There are also many people who are signing on from the point of view of credits.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for the Minister for Social Welfare as to whether the matter can be tackled by trying to weed out people who are getting unemployment assistance or benefit illegally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The estimated cost of a quarterly survey is £3 million. Would that not be money well spent? Given that in 1992 the overpayments detected by the Department of Social Welfare were £6.7 million, in 1993 roughly £9 million and in 1994 almost £14 million, does that not suggest that fraud may be rife in the social welfare system?  Given the major divergence between the two surveys would it not be right and proper for the Minister, together with the Department of Social Welfare, to take far greater cognisance of overpayments and the fact that only 35 per cent of overpayments are recouped by the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The savings resulting from the detection of fraud are very welcome and show the vigilance of those policing the system.  Let me emphasise that people should not jump to the conclusion that the 84,000 people who feature on the live register but not in the labour force survey are in any way guilty of fraud.  Many people sign on for credits or other benefits and express their bona fide availability for work.  Very often there is income splitting in families and the social welfare payment is divided between the husband and the wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to kill the suggestion that the 84,000 people in question are guilty of fraud.  One has to look at the range of benefits through which that trawling takes place, for <Col N="2161" /> example people have been found to have been claiming disability benefit and disabled person's maintenance allowance who are not entitled to it. People may be claiming pensions without declaring on an annual basis that there has been an increase in their means.  To give that as a global figure and relate it directly to the 84,000 people is simply not accurate in the context of the information I have given in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a slightly different view from many others on the labour force survey.  I urge the Minister to look very carefully at expanding the annual survey.  If we were to have a quarterly survey the figures would be reconciled but we would not get the facts.  The annual survey should be used to find more information.  I think those who comprise the 84,000 is a very different question and I think the Minister has chosen the wrong way to tackle the problem in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The survey has been thoroughly examined in the context of its accuracy and the percentage difference of 5 per cent, that is 47,000 households. It is at a standard time of the year and is uniformly distributed throughout the length and breadth of this country. It is not an isolated hit or miss survey. In some cases the percentage surveyed here is higher than that in other countries. I think there is uniformity and consistency but I will look at the Deputy's suggestion of getting more detail and greater penetration into aspects that may not be looked at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that the figure is incorrect but that we need more depth.  If the question is asked every month people will give the obvious answer because they know how the information will be used.  That would ruin the valuable information we have.  That is the point I am making.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 75, 111, 127, 128, 129, 130, 132, 133 and 134 together.</P>
      <P>In deciding on the application of the free fees initiative I must have regard to the cost implications as well as criteria which require institutions to be recognised for the purposes of third level student support and to be part of the CAO entry system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Royal College of Surgeons is not at present part of the CAO entry system. The college has indicated its intention to join the CAO system but I understand that the earliest academic <Col N="2164" /> year in which it could participate in the system at this stage would be 1997-98.</P>
    <P>It would also be necessary to consider the implications of extending the initiative in the context of the existing quota on medical places.  My Department is arranging to meet representatives of the college at an early date to discuss these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this not discriminating against students attending the Royal College of Surgeons, given that it is an NUI affiliated college and that it intends to become part of the CAO system and that students attending it avail of the higher education grants scheme?  It seems a major anomaly that students who are entitled to apply under the higher education grants scheme will not be entitled to avail of the free fees scheme which generally has been applied and extended to such students. What is the actual cost of bringing these students within the ambit of the scheme?</P>

      <P>The college is not part of the CAO scheme, although it has indicated an interest in it and the Department is meeting with it.  Of course it is a recognised college and the courses are recognised for education grants.  It is designated under the Higher Education Authority Act and was in receipt of State funding until 1992.  The college charges an average fee of £3,400 to Irish students and £13,750 to other EU students.  The level of fees which the Exchequer would pay to the Royal College of Surgeons would be fixed at £2,450.  That would be for all European Union students.  There is also the question of the quota of places for medical students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give a costing for the inclusion of Royal College of Surgeons students from the EU in the scheme?  Similar arguments were made by the Minister in relation to the Milltown Institute, Mater Dei, All Hallows and the Pontifical University early last year and it took some considerable <Col N="2165" /> political pressure to change that and a campaign organised by the students of those colleges.  A similar campaign is being launched by the students of the Royal College of Surgeons.  At all the other colleges concessions were made and they were brought within the remit of the free fees scheme.  Schemes such as this are fundamentally targeted at the student, not the institute.  Whatever technical or bureaucratic shortcomings may exist in the institutions in terms of membership of the CAO system, the question still remains about the students who attend this college, particularly students who are in difficult financial circumstances.  We know that 29 students at the Royal College of Surgeons avail of the higher education grants scheme and clearly they could do with the extension of the scheme and feel discriminated against.  Concessions were made to a number of private colleges with the exception of the Royal College of Surgeons.</P>

      <P>The Royal College of Surgeons is not in the CAO entry system. It has indicated its intention to come into the system in the academic year 1997-98.  There are two problems. First is the quota of medical places. Second is that while I was able to give the striking difference in fees between Irish students and students of the European Union it might help the Deputy if I were to come back with a breakdown of the 156 students being trained there at present.  The Deputy could then do some multiplication sums.</P>

      <P>The leaving certificate Irish syllabus has recently undergone a fundamental and radical review. The leaving certificate ordinary level and higher level syllabuses have been revised and the new syllabuses will be examined for the first time in June, 1997.  A new leaving certificate foundation level Irish syllabus was introduced in September 1994 and will be examined for the first time in June 1996.  There is no prescribed literature on this new foundation level syllabus and the emphasis is entirely on basic linguistic skills and communicative needs.  I am confident these curricular changes will lead to an overall decrease in the failure rate and to an improvement in standards in Irish in second level schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was motivated to ask this question because recently I received a deputation and correspondence from 43 teachers of Irish in Cork who expressed frustration and anger at the quality of a recent in-service course they attended regarding the new Irish syllabus to be introduced next September. Will the Minister seriously consider the points they have made, their belief that the new syllabus will be more difficult for Irish students, not easier, that there is too much emphasis still on literature, poems and stair le litríochta with a corresponding lack of time available within the classroom for concentration on oral competence and language competence generally?  Does the Minister accept there is widespread concern among teachers of Irish about the new syllabus introduced?  They do not consider it radical enough to address the real problems affecting the teaching of Irish in our schools and they believe the subject will become less attractive as a result of the new syllabus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">

      <P>I am quite taken aback at the Deputy's question.  I was not asked to comment on the in-service <Col N="2167" /> course.  If the Deputy wants me to comment on the in-service course I will certainly do so.  The Deputy's question challenged me to introduce a fundamental change in the syllabus.  I am sure the teachers who visited the Deputy are aware there has just been such a fundamental and radical change.  That radical change has come through the Irish course committee of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment which is quite well weighted towards the teachers of Irish throughout the system. We have the Cumann Múinteoirí na Ghaeilge as Luimneach, two representatives from the ASTI and two from the TUI.  We have managerial people, the National Council for Education Awards, the heads of the universities and the Department of Education education officers.  The course committee on Irish comprises people who participate and teach in the classrooms.  They have brought forward a radical new syllabus. Rather than criticising, let us see it introduced.  Questions on the in-service course can be addressed to me at a future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>As a former teacher of Irish at second level, I need no lectures on the introduction of syllabuses.  The fact remains that the old honours paper had five questions and the new syllabus has seven.  It is the teachers who have said this to me &mdash; I am not making it up. I ask the question in the knowledge that a new syllabus is to be introduced. However, the syllabus is not radical enough; it does not represent the degree of change required to improve participation rates and result in higher assessments for the students and, above all, give students a desire to learn Irish and to make it more attractive to them.  As currently structured it is not radical enough and will not change the unfortunate trend of recent leaving certificate examinations in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The unfortunate trends referred to by the Deputy arose from an old syllabus that existed for a <Col N="2168" /> long time.  We have looked critically at the teaching of Irish.  That started with the Irish Course Committee of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment.  It recommended a radical and fundamental review of Irish.  That has now taken place and the results and successes cannot yet be judged because it will not be examined for the first time until 1997.</P>

I have confidence that the course recommended by the course committee, made up mainly of teachers, will respond to the needs of students regarding a subject about which we all share a common concern.</P>

      <P>My proposals will be based upon the White Paper on Education which, in Chapter 5, sets out a framework for the development of higher education and makes a commitment to introduce legislation for universities.</P>
      <P>As outlined in the White Paper, the legislation will provide for a revised structure for governing bodies aimed at broadening their composition so as to provide wider representation from society and the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2169" /> It will also amend the National University of Ireland legislation on the basis of proposals put forward by the senate of the NUI.  The aim of these provisions will be to give greater autonomy to the present constituent colleges and the recognised college at Maynooth.</P>
    <P>The legislation will also address issues of accountability and transparency while ensuring proper institutional autonomy and affirming the ethos, diversity and traditions of all of the university institutions.</P>
    <P>Over the past few months officials of my Department have been in consultation with the heads of the university institutions on the content of legislation.

      <P>The White Paper on education published in April 1995 contained an outline of proposals relating to university legislation.  In July a confidential working paper was drawn up by the Department of Education and it contained draft outline legislative provisions which were circulated to the heads of the university institutions. There followed substantial written observations from them.  On 29 August there was a meeting with the Provost and other senior officers at Trinity.  In September there was a meeting with all the heads of the universities.  Again this was followed by substantial written submissions from the heads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the beginning of October a revised outline and confidential legislative proposals were circulated.  A meeting took place on 10 October at which more written submissions were received.  It was more than signposted in April that we would hold discussions with the universities and I am conscious that when the legislation is introduced it will be debated line by line.  As my pattern in proposing changes has been to consult, I was pleased at the level of consultation conducted between officials of my Department and the universities affected.  I am also pleased that there has been a steady coming together of <Col N="2171" /> positions and consultations will be completed in the next two to three weeks.

    <P>
      <Col N="2172" /> The House will recall that I made a detailed statement to it on 20 September 1995 following the signing of an agreement on 6 September 1995 between the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, the Minister for Finance and ISPAT International to transfer all of the shares of Irish Steel from the Minister for Finance to ISPAT International subject to the approval and support of the Commission and unanimous support of the other member states at the Industry Council.  That agreement was welcomed by the management, workers and the trade unions in Irish Steel and the general community of Cobh.  The agreement was also welcomed by the Government and all of the Opposition parties.</P>
    <P>Immediately following the signing of the agreement, the European Commission was notified of the details of the agreement under Article 95 of ECSC Treaty and approval of the State aid involved was sought.  All requests for additional information by the European Commission were responded to promptly by my officials.  Following consideration by DG IV of the Commission, a draft positive recommendation was submitted to the meeting of commissioners recommending assent to the State aid application under Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty.</P>
    <P>The Commission appointed consultants to review the viability of the Irish Steel case.  The Government and Irish Steel had to pass stringent viability tests. The business plan put forward by the Government on behalf of Irish Steel passed these stringent viability tests and the commissioners accepted the positive recommendation of DG IV on 11 October 1995.  The Commission proposals were submitted to the Council of Ministers with a strong recommendation for assent to be given under Article 95.</P>
    <P>We realised that some member states had reservations about the nature of the State aid involved, the long-term viability of Irish Steel and the effect that a new Irish Steel-ISPAT International <Col N="2173" /> might have on the European steel market. These reservations were mentioned during the ECSC working group meeting held in Brussels which provided a forum for member states to express any concerns prior to the matter going before the Council of Ministers.  A number of countries expressed reservations which had to be dealt with by me and my Department.  Following further consultations, the remaining objectors were the UK, Luxembourg and Denmark.</P>
    <P>In the light of the views expressed by those member states, there was daily contact between ourselves and other member states to overcome the concerns mentioned by them.  In addition I undertook visits to the capitals involved. I met Minister Timothy Eggar of the UK in London on Tuesday, 31 October, Minister Mimi Jakobsen of Denmark in Copenhagen on Wednesday, 1 November, and Minister Robert Goebbels of Luxembourg in Luxembourg on Friday, 3 November.  The purpose of these visits was to ascertain the likely position of those member states at the Industry Council and to provide any information which would soften or overcome their objections to the Irish Steel Article 95 case.</P>
    <P>In addition, I met Commissioner Van Miert and the Irish Commissioner, Pádraig Flynn, in Brussels on Tuesday, 31 October to inform the Commission of the difficulties which had been expressed by some member states and to see if solutions could be found to overcome those difficulties.</P>
    <P>As well as my ministerial actions in support of securing a positive result in regard to Irish Steel's application, the House might like to know that the Taoiseach discussed the matter with the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Major, during the course of an EU summit of European leaders in Majorca in later September.</P>
    <P>At the Industry Council on Monday and Tuesday, 6 and 7 November the Commission's proposal recommending assent under Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty was on the agenda.  The unanimous approval of all member states was required.  Fourteen member states, <Col N="2174" /> including Ireland of course, were prepared to allow the State aid for Irish Steel subject to some conditions.  The UK indicated that it had major problems and during the course of the Industry Council bilateral contacts took place between the Irish and UK delegations to see if the gulf between the two positions could be bridged.  The main problems centred on production limits and other restrictions being imposed on Irish Steel-ISPAT International.  The UK wanted production limits which would make Irish Steel commercially unviable.  I, as the Irish Minister, was prepared to do a deal with the UK Minister but not at the cost of making Irish Steel unviable.  Following intense negotiations throughout Monday and yesterday, the position between the Irish and UK delegations narrowed but the UK was not prepared to finalise an agreement with Ireland which would have put both a cap on future Irish Steel production and ensure the viability of the plant.  At the end, we were prepared to accept a capping of sales of finished steel on the EU market over the next five years.  I cannot discuss the figures that were considered, in the interests of ISPAT International and Irish Steel. The response of the UK was to seek to impose a condition that production of finished or semi-finished product over a certain level would be exported outside the EU.  This imposition would be intolerable for Irish Steel and, despite reasonable goodwill on both sides, the gap between the Irish and UK positions could not be bridged because of the impact the restriction would have on Irish Steel over the five years for which restrictions were proposed.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers agreed, at the suggestion of the Spanish Presidency and the EU Commission, that the Irish and UK delegations should continue to seek agreement over the next few days which could then be brought to COREPER for approval and submission to a forthcoming Council for automatic ratification as an &ldquo;A&rdquo; point. The other member states were prepared to agree to the proposal on this basis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2175" /> In the next few days my Department will hold urgent meetings with top representatives of ISPAT International to discuss the matter.  I will be in contact with the UK Minister to see if the remaining gap between Ireland and the UK can be bridged.  It is hoped that with goodwill on the part of the UK, they will appreciate the special circumstances of Irish Steel and come to an agreement with us which will not threaten the viability of Irish Steel.  Because of the importance the Government attaches to reaching a solution for Irish Steel which ensures the future viability of the plant, protects the employment in Irish Steel and provides such an important input into the economy of the Cobh area, this has to be considered an important issue in our economic relations with the UK.</P>
    <P>I will do everything within my power to ensure that the difficulty with the UK authorities is resolved.  Although I was disappointed that a deal was not finalised, with goodwill on the part of the UK Government, we should be able to come to an agreement.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the positive support which the workers, unions, management and also the Opposition parties have given in my attempts to put Irish Steel on a sound footing and to secure agreement. I hope to see a continuation of that support in my efforts to convince the UK of the desirability of the UK joining all the other member states of the European Union in approving the very modest State aid involved in the Irish Steel case.</P>

      <P>I accept what the Minister has attempted to do to date.  My concern is that he would outline clearly the steps he proposes to take in the next three days, which will be crucial to the survival of Irish Steel.  In view of the stalemate that has arisen between himself and the British Industry Minister, who is clearly trying very hard to protect the position of British Steel, does the Taoiseach propose to address this issue with John Major in the immediate days <Col N="2176" /> ahead?  In light of what the Minister said about a capping arrangement, does the Government propose to revise the terms of the package offered to ISPAT? Does the Government propose to agree limits on the output of Irish Steel or impose constraints on the plant's future development capacity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course there are limitations on the production and capacity of Irish Steel.  That is an integral part of the agreement as put to the EU.  It is an absolute requirement of State aid applications that there are caps on capacity.</P>

      <P>As required in all State aid applications, production capacity of the plant cannot be increased for five years.  That was an integral part of the package agreed. Within that capacity Irish Steel-ISPAT set themselves production targets. Obviously certain member states feel that, whatever may be stated in a plan as presented, production levels might continue to increase, and they have sought assurances in that regard.  The Government requires that any upper limit on production would give ISPAT the opportunity for productivity and efficiency improvements, which it hopes to achieve.  On the other hand we have to be realistic because unanimity is required in this regard.  There must be give and take and certain caps are envisaged on production.  It is an area in which there is room for flexibility.  We cannot agree to an arrangement whereby production limits undermine the deal agreed with ISPAT.</P>

      <P>We are not willing to concede restriction levels on our proposals that would undermine the deal with ISPAT and render the proposal unviable.</P>
      <P>On the specific steps to be taken in the next three days, first I intend to meet ISPAT to discuss with it in great detail the position we have reached and to see if we can find an agreement with the UK and persuade it to lift its veto. Since the Council meeting I have made contact with Mr. Eggar and further contact will be made in the next couple of days with a view to breaking the deadlock. We will use every vehicle to persuade the British that it is fruitful to achieve a settlement.  The Taoiseach has, on more than one occasion, discussed this issue with the British Prime Minister.  It is a very important issue for the Irish people and we are treating it with the importance it deserves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  I accept the Taoiseach spoke to John Major on this matter in September last, but if the matter is so urgent &mdash; I accept the Minister is approaching it with great urgency &mdash; surely the Taoiseach should again directly approach John Major about it. I noted before he left for the sad funeral at the weekend the Taoiseach said he would raise with John Major the issue of the peace process.  While not wishing to be facetious, the Minister has ready access to the Taoiseach and on this occasion I would ask him to use it to ensure he telephones the British Prime Minister on this issue &mdash; we hear daily that he has interesting and fruitful telephone conversations with the Prime Minister on other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I watched Mr. Eggar last night on television and, to use an old fashioned Irish expression, I did not like the cut of his jib when talking about this matter.  I am not seeking to denigrate junior Ministers &mdash; I was in that position for three years and, I hope, fulfilled my role &mdash; but I suggest the Minister should get in touch with the senior British Minister in that Department, the President of the <Col N="2178" /> Board of Trade, because this issue is so serious that we should not deal with intermediaries if direct contact would have a more desired effect.</P>
    <P>On behalf of our party &mdash; I submitted a letter to Commissioner Flynn on this matter &mdash; I wish to put on record our fullest support for the Minister in his quest to ensure the agreed plan is the one finally accepted.  Any watering down of that should not be allowed because it would have serious consequences for employment.  Does the Minister envisage getting in touch directly with the senior British Minister and will he urge the Taoiseach today to get in touch with his opposite number on the matter?</P>

      <P>The issue of the reply is a matter between the two men concerned. At the end of the day we must deal with the position taken up by the UK Government.  I recognise the British have difficulties with this matter and we have made considerable efforts to meet those difficulties.  The British were not the only people whose economic interests were at stake in this matter; 14 of the 15 member states recognise the Irish Steel case and their concerns have been met.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must continue to work towards alleviating the remaining concerns of the British.  I will be working primarily with the Minister responsible, Minister Timothy Eggar.  I assure the House that if there is merit in further contact between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister, with Minister Lang or with anyone else, we will consider that.  Primarily, we must work on the substantive <Col N="2179" /> issues put forward and try to sell the strong merit of our case.  We will do that in every available forum.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the role of Commissioner Flynn in his support at an earlier stage in helping to get this proposal through the Commission.  It has been important to have support for this proposal at all stages.  The Commission is 100 per cent behind it and recognise the strength of our case.  I appreciate the expression of support from Deputy O'Rourke for our efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I need not repeat what has been said on this matter in the past 14 years about the concern for the security of jobs at Irish Steel.  Its workers breathed a sign of relief some months ago when the deal was reached with ISPAT.  Since then we all have been aware that some difficulties would be encountered at the Council of Ministers. I am concerned that up until last week there does not appear to have been any direct contact between the Minister and his opposite numbers to ensure that we would not have to wait another number of weeks before a final decision is reached.  That is causing grave concern and angst to many of my constituents in Cobh.  Will the Minister confirm what is meant in regard to capping production?  Will such capping relate to future increases in production or to a cutback on current production? The viability of the company depends on current production levels.  A cutback on present production would not augur well for the company's future.  I offer the Minister my full support on this issue.  We have worked together on this matter for many years and there has not been any division between the parties on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appreciative of the Deputy's question as there appears to be some misunderstanding in this regard.  There is no question of cutting existing production levels.  The main issue is how rapidly can production grow.  Everyone recognises there must <Col N="2180" /> be substantial increases in production in Irish Steel to secure its viability.  Some of our partners are concerned that if production increases were of an explosive nature they would damage the market and they are seeking assurances on restrictions on production growth.  We all recognise their concerns and where it is necessary to have unanimity, efforts must be made to address their concerns. The plan envisages significant production increases over the next five years.</P>
      <P>Under any State aid application restrictions will be imposed.  The primary restriction is normally in respect of capacity, but we cannot afford to cut capacity.  Normally a steel plant requiring State aid would have to cut back on its capacity and drop significantly its tonnage levels.  That is not possible when the plant in question has one mill and one furnace and our colleagues recognise that, but they want assurances that there will not be indefinite explosive growth from the level of current capacity.  We consider there is room to make agreement but, as Deputy Ahern said, we cannot allow unrealistic limitations to be imposed which would threaten the viability of the proposal.</P>
      <P>Regarding the Deputy's first question, I assure him that we did not start to make contact only in the past week, there has been continuous contact to try to get this proposal accepted. Obviously, as one gets closer to Council contacts must be intensified and I believe it was right and necessary that I should have visited the capitals concerned to bring negotiations to that level.  That illustrates how serious we view this matter and that means of communication, rather than any other, enables one to get to understand the other person's position.  We were pleased with the outcome of our meetings with officials in Denmark and Luxembourg and we must continue to work with officials in the UK.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>What proposal did the Minister put to the British Minister on Tuesday?  How wide is the gap <Col N="2181" /> between the Minister and his counterpart in the UK on this issue?  The plant's capacity is approximately 450,000 tonnes and the viability plan has been based on that and on further efficiencies to save the jobs of the 350 workers.  Do the British suggest that less than 450,000 tonnes of steel be manufactured at Irish Steel?  Will the Minister indicate the quantity of steel that will be manufactured to alleviate the fears of the staff and management and those who work in the service area?  I understand that as of today production will be reduced to satisfy the British requirement.  Such a decision would reduce the viability of the plant.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that the British have sought restrictions on the plant that would damage its viability.  We cannot agree to that and that is why we have not been able to reach agreement with the British. I will not outline figures or the gaps between the two sides.  There are areas of flexibility.  One can consider production paths into the future which would be consistent with the viability of the plant.  Issues concerning the destination of sales could be considered to address some concerns.  Some restrictions could be imposed on the amount of sales entering the EU market.  We will consider those issues and try to be flexible in that regard.  Viability must be at the forefront of our considerations. Within that parameter, while we are willing to discuss and make arrangements, we cannot jeopardise the plant's viability.  That is our bottom line.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that the attitude of the British Minister <Col N="2182" /> for Industry is purely one of British self-interest in that it amounts to 400 British jobs as against 300 jobs here?  Will he agree that it flies in the face of the notion of a spirit of European solidarity, as expressed at various European Council meetings, some of which I attended, to tackle unemployment on an EU basis?  Will he agree that we are at a watershed regarding EU policies on unemployment and if we lose the battle here it will have serious implications for the future?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposal we put forward was credible and deserved the support of the 15 member states.  It was credible because our plant has one mill and one furnace and it was always accepted that it would have to be considered as another State aid case.  Compared with cases that preceded it, it is a cheaper State aid case.  As it involved privatisation, there could be no question of future State aid.  That might be of concern to others, including British Steel, which would fear the possibility of the State continually supporting a plant to its detriment.  For those reasons, we put forward a strong and credible proposal which was accepted by the Commission and has now been accepted by 14 of the 15 member states of the European Union.  There is a strong onus on the British to be reasonable in its approach.  I understand it has concerns about its industry, but the other member states had such concerns also.  The other member states have recognised the reasonableness of our approach.  I am trying to strike a deal with the British. The system gives them a veto and we must deal with that, but our strong, credible proposal deserves their support. In the coming days we will be working to get that support.</P>

Is there a point below which their interest would no longer continue?  Will the Minister confirm to concerned workers and their families in east Cork and in Cork generally that he is in constant communication with ISPAT with a view to keeping the deal intact?

      <P>Is it the Minister's perception that we have a trade war between British Steel and Irish Steel and, if so, does he perceive that to be anti-competition and against the spirit of the EU?

      <P>The Deputy has put a number of questions to me, some of which have been answered.  Yes, I have had discussions with ISPAT, following the Council meeting and I have arranged for further discussions with the company.  They are still interested in the plant.  Obviously, there is a point beyond which they could not sustain their interest and that relates to the whole issue of viability.  Reference to trade wars, and that type of language, is not helpful to finding a solution.  As I <Col N="2184" /> said to Deputy Kitt, a strong credible proposal is being put forward under an article of the Coal and Steel Treaty which has been used on six occasions during the past two and a half years. Within that context it is a reasonable and small case and one that stands on its merits.  I assure the Deputy we will use whatever methods are available to us to influence a favourable outcome.</P>

I admit I am by no means an expert on the subject, although often I have felt the utmost sympathy for those who arrive at places such as Shannon Airport in a panic and try to make themselves understood using a language that nobody knows.  The person very often is put back on the next plane and returned home.  As an observer I would have no way of knowing whether the person was a genuine refugee, in fear of his or her life, or a desperate criminal on the run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today I was supplied with a four-page leaflet published by a group known as &ldquo;Rescue Trust&rdquo;.  I presume this is a respectable and well informed organisation and that other Deputies received the same document.  Unfortunately, I have not had time to study it properly but I note it lists what it regards as various shortcomings in the Bill.  For example, it quotes section 3 (1) which deals with the rights of refugees to various services in health, education, social welfare, etc.  It stresses that refugees who do not speak English or Irish would be at a distinct disadvantage in availing of these services, particularly education, <Col N="2274" /> and that there is not any provision in the Bill to provide appropriate English language lessons through the medium of their own language.  I appreciate this might be feasible if a refugee's native language was French, German or some other well known language, but if the refugee were from, say, China we would be unable to provide a suitably qualified teacher.  This would also apply to refugees who arrive here with severe psychological disorders, perhaps as a result of torture in their country of origin, requiring appropriate medical treatment. That would demand as much communication as possible from the patient to ensure successful treatment.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with travel documents. If the Minister refuses to issue a travel document, have refugees the right to know the reason?  Is there a right to appeal and to whom does one appeal?</P>
    <P>On section 5, will the Minister be required to consult human rights experts before making a decision to expel a person, as distinct from that person having a right of appeal after the decision?  What is the definition of a &ldquo;serious assault&rdquo;?  How serious must an assault be and who decides what happens to a person if they are returned? What constitutes a &ldquo;serious assault of a sexual nature&rdquo;?  Who decides, prior to returning a person to their country of origin, that that person will probably be the subject of a minor or petty assault of a sexual nature?</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with applications for declaration.  Throughout the Bill the right of a refugee-asylum seeker to be given information in a language he or she understands is only given &ldquo;where possible&rdquo;.  Giving information in any way other than in a language a person understands can never constitute giving a person information.  If a person does not understand what has been said to him, he cannot be construed as having received any information.</P>
    <P>Section 11 deals with the investigation of applications by a commissioner.  If an asylum seeker is also a torture victim, and if he or she has been receiving treatment from a health professional, will <Col N="2275" /> that health professional be forced to surrender case notes to the commissioner? If so, it follows that under subsection (6) those confidential case notes must then be passed back to the torture victim in his or her guise as &ldquo;applicant&rdquo;.  Apart from destroying the doctor-patient relationship, a person may also have been given information which might have a detrimental effect upon his or her physical and psychological well-being.</P>
    <P>I call for the inclusion of a let-out clause as a matter of urgency whereby an exception would be made in cases where the passing of medical care case notes to an applicant who is also a patient-client would be prohibited if this was not in the client's best interest.</P>
    <P>I do not draw attention to these matters merely to be awkward but I appeal to the Minister of State to examine the Rescue Trust document carefully and, if necessary, table amendments to correct as many of the flaws as possible.  She will then be in a position to make subsequent orders which will have the effect of making life a little less stressful for refugees we accept into our country. None of us would invite guests to our homes without ensuring that their stay was pleasant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the House.  It marks a turning point in our treatment of refugees.  Our history in this regard has been appalling but the Bill sets new standards and puts the rights of refugees on a statutory basis.  That is extremely important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill builds on the work done by Deputy Shatter in 1993, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn in 1994, a committee of this House which examined the legislation last year and the current Minister.  It is important that we have brought the treatment of refugees to the standard outlined in the Bill before us.  In looking to the future it is important also that we <Col N="2276" /> reflect on how we treated refugees here in the past.</P>
    <P>In contributing to the debate on a Bill that came before the House in 1993 I referred to the case hardened approach we seemed to be adopting in regard to refugees at that time.  We have been slow to deal with the human rights issues involved and to ensure people were treated fairly and well.</P>
    <P>Some of the events that took place here in the past were appalling. Amnesty International has taken up individual cases, particularly that of the Kurds who arrived in Shannon some years ago.  Those events were more reminiscent of the Dark Ages than a country approaching the year 2000. Some of the children present on that occasion saw sights they should never have seen.  The adults involved were traumatised and they were denied their basic human rights.  That was regrettable.</P>
    <P>A number of other cases were dealt with in a less than satisfactory manner. That is not to say all our dealings with refugees were similar but it is curious that we have not put the rights of refugees on a statutory basis until now.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a good one and quite comprehensive. It gives clear guidelines, outlines key standards and it will help us to deal with this issue positively from now on.</P>
    <P>Ireland has not had to deal with as many refugees as other EU member states.  Because of our geographical position, few refugees sought asylum here.  One could say that economically also we did not have much to offer. Although we are not talking about economic refugees today obviously that can be an influencing factor in where refugees choose to go.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see the variations in the numbers of refugees over the years.  The numbers were not great and we should have been able to deal with them in a far more satisfactory manner. Compared with the numbers who seek asylum in other EU member states, the numbers who seek asylum here are <Col N="2277" /> quite small.  In 1988 there were 49 applicants, 36 in 1989, 62 in 1990, 31 in 1991 and 38 in 1992.  Those numbers are quite low although the latest figures are much higher.</P>
    <P>Under the Geneva Convention we have an obligation to respect the human dignity of each applicant and to ensure not only that each applicant's legal rights are protected but that they are treated in a humanitarian way and with respect.  The various groups involved in this area here have carried out sterling work over the years.  They include Amnesty International, the Irish Refugee Council and the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace.  For many years these organisations sought the necessary protection for refugees.</P>
    <P>That is the background to the Bill whose purpose is to give statutory effect to our obligations under the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the status of refugees.  We have been party to that UN convention since 1956 and until now we have implemented it on an administrative basis.</P>
    <P>Provision is now being made for a statutory procedure to determine refugee status and for an independent authority to examine applications, in addition to an independent board to hear appeals.  It is important that these provisions are being included.</P>
    <P>In her opening remarks, the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, spoke about the new standards being set and the important safeguards being built into the Bill.  She set out the internationally accepted definition of a refugee as follows:</P>
    <P>... &ldquo;a refugee&rdquo; means a person who, owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his or her nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of that country; or who, not having had a nationality and being outside the country of his or her former <Col N="2278" /> habitual residence, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it...</P>
    <P>One can only imagine the plight of people who find themselves in these circumstances. Sadly in recent years an increasing number of people have suffered persecution or torture in their own country.  I congratulate Amnesty International on the work it carries out in this area.  Its reports set out in detail the horrific torture suffered by individuals in many countries.  The Government must look at the UN convention on torture and ensure that we undertake the necessary work.  It is important that we ratify this convention.</P>
    <P>The terror experienced by refugees was very well illustrated by the people who attended a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. The reports of their experiences and the torture and persecution suffered by them are extraordinary.  They made the very important point &mdash; I hope the Minister responds to this in her reply &mdash; that while this issue is being put on a statutory basis, clear guidelines are being set for officials who deal with refugees and proper procedures are being put in place to enable them to benefit from our social welfare services as soon as they have submitted their applications for refugee status, specialist medical and rehabilitation services must also be provided for them.  It is important for us to give consideration to how these services can be developed. Specialist services must also be provided for the large number of people on refugee programmes.  While it is important to ensure that there are high standards in this area we must also look at the services required by people who have been given refugee status and are settled here.  Unfortunately, problems do not just disappear and specialist help is required.  The Minister said she is satisfied that progress is being made in regard to the provision of legal aid.  I ask her to clarify the position in regard to this very important service.</P>
    <P>This Bill replaces the 1994 Refugee <Col N="2279" /> Bill which had similar objectives.  The new provisions in the Bill are very welcome. For example, they provide that all applications will be examined by an independent refugee application commissioner with a right of appeal to a five person appeals board.  Clearly this is a great improvement on the previous position.  I welcome the right to be heard in principle and the specific right to an interview with an authorised officer of the commissioner.  If a refugee is the subject of a negative recommendation and wishes to appeal against it he or she has the right to an oral hearing before the refugee appeals board.  These provisions are an improvement on the proposals in the earlier Bill.</P>
    <P>I am glad the families of refugees will be treated in a more sensitive manner under the Bill.  Unfortunately in such situations families are broken up and members become separated.  We do not have many refugees and it is only right that the law should deal with them in a sensitive way.  Given the goodwill extended by other countries to Irish emigrants, it behoves us to deal in the most sensitive way possible with people who seek refugee status here.  We know from experience the importance of providing adequate services for people who have had to leave their own countries and of ensuring that they are given a good reception here.</P>
    <P>The lack of adequate interpretation facilities has been a problem for refugees who do not speak English.  It is very difficult to understand why we did not deal with these people in a more humane way in the past.  It is also very difficult to understand the thinking behind the rigid application of the law and our inability to improve the law over many decades.  Much concern has been expressed about detention and we have heard stories about people who have broken arms and legs while climbing out windows in an effort to escape and who have refused to board planes which would take them back to their own countries.  The Bill provides that detention will only be resorted to in <Col N="2280" /> exceptional circumstances and additional safeguards have been built into the law in this regard.</P>
    <P>Having said that, we must also protect ourselves against international crime and ensure that people escaping justice in other countries do not seek refuge here.  Clearly safeguards in this regard must be built into a refugee Bill.  Hopefully these provisions will not have to be used too often but we must be vigilant and ensure that there is good contact between the Garda and the police forces in other countries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the extension of the definition of a refugee to include persons who have been persecuted because of their gender, sexual orientation or membership of a trade union.  I was very disappointed to learn at the conference in Beijing that the UN has not yet managed to include in international conventions protection for people who are persecuted because of sexual orientation; it is to its shame that it has not done that. While it was decided at Beijing not to provide protection on the basis of sexual orientation it was agreed to provide strong protection for people on the basis of sexual rights.  The decision to extend the definition of a refugee to include persons persecuted because of their gender, sexual orientation or membership of a trade union is a positive development and should be a source of comfort to people persecuted on those grounds.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome as it adopts a strong human rights perspective and lays down clear guidelines on how those who are forced to leave their country of origin because of persecution should be dealt with.  It also contains safeguards to ensure that those seeking asylum or refugee status will not be moved from country to country.  Clear guidelines are laid down as to which country is responsible for dealing with their applications. This ought to bring to an end the practice whereby an applicant can end up in France having previously been in Spain and Ireland.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten that those who have to leave their families and <Col N="2281" /> friends, often at short notice, with little or no money and without a passport, are in a vulnerable position.  It is extremely important, therefore, that we adopt a humanitarian approach and provide good training for those who deal with refugees at points of entry so that they are clear on their rights under this legislation.</P>
    <P>The highest standards should be applied.  I am aware I am being harsh, but this issue has been handled badly in the past.  There is no point saying otherwise. Now that we have moved to a higher plain I hope this will be followed by a change in behaviour and attitudes.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister on introducing the Bill and I am pleased it has the support of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this legislation which outlines the way in which applicants for refugee status should be dealt with.  Too put the matter in context, it is important to recognise that the Exchequer has provided considerable support, through international agencies such as the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, for refugee programmes. Total assistance this year amounts to the substantial sum of approximately £10 million.</P>
      <P>There are 1,000 programme refugees in this country, comprised mainly of Bosnian refugees and Vietnamese boat people.  The Government recently sanctioned the entry of an additional 250 refugees under this category.</P>
      <P>The Bill will allow us to meet our obligations under the Geneva Convention by putting the current administrative procedures on a statutory basis.  We can all recall the horror stories which received media coverage whereby persons who had arrived at Shannon Airport seeking refugee status were deported to their country of origin, where their fate is unknown, without receiving a fair and just hearing because of the hardened attitude adopted under the administrative system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of efforts have been made in recent years to legislate in this area. The Bill produced by my colleague, <Col N="2282" /> Deputy Shatter, in 1993 was followed by the Refugee Bill, 1994, introduced by the previous Government which has now been replaced by this Bill.  The committee system has been the subject of much criticism &mdash; it is argued that it is not working satisfactorily &mdash; but this Bill, which is a significant improvement on the 1994 Bill, proves to a certain extent that it has much to offer.  When the 1994 Bill was dealt with in committee trenchant views were expressed which, fortunately, have been taken into account by the Minister of State, Deputy Burton.</P>
    <P>This is comprehensive legislation containing over 30 sections.  It contains for the first time a defination of &ldquo;refugee&rdquo;. It is right and proper that those who flee their country of origin because of persecution on the grounds of gender, sexual orientation or membership of a trade union should be granted refugee status.  This is a welcome development.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the provision under which an applicant for refugee status will have the right to be heard.  There will also be an obligation to provide an interpreter, where necessary.</P>
    <P>This Bill forms a necessary part of the legislative framework in a rapidly changing world.  In the recent past there was less uncertainty between the political systems in the East and West.  The world is now a different place; there is more turmoil and uncertainty in economic and political terms.  As a consequence, there is a greater need to put procedures on a statutory basis to deal with those affected.  We only need to consider what is happening in the former Yugoslavia to realise just how much the world has changed in a short space of time and that we were ill-equipped to cope with the changes.</P>
    <P>Our credibility as a nation has also been affected because of our attempts to lecture the rest of the world on the need for intervention in international conflicts without being willing to take part ourselves.  War and intervention can be just in certain circumstances. Those of us who watched in <Col N="2283" /> horror the tragedy in Srebrenica must question our moral authority to lecture others about their inactivity when our nation is unwilling to participate.  To put it bluntly, we are not prepared to have body bags arriving back to our country. Our moral authority is compromised in clinging to our neutrality in a fashion which is not clearly defined and does not take cognisance of a changing world.  It is high time we had a reasoned and constructive debate to see if a positive role can be determined for an Irish policy of neutrality.</P>
    <P>I have some reservations about the Bill which I hope the Minister can take into account on Committee Stage.  The Bill ratifies the Dublin Convention, under which a person who arrives here seeking refugee status may be transported to another EU country where it is felt the application can be more properly dealt with.  There are internationally documented cases of people who have been put on this merry-goround and ended up in the country from which they originally fled.  There is the danger that a &ldquo;Pontius Pilate&rdquo; mechanism may be included in the legislation so this provision should be tightened up, especially as the authority will be vested in the Minister of the day.  The impact of the Bill will be undermined as legal due process will not be given to the applicant if we follow the Dublin Convention procedures as I understand them.  I would like assurances and, if necessary, changes in that regard.</P>
    <P>The other provision about which I have reservations is that which allows people arriving here to be fined, imprisoned and ultimately returned to the country from which they have fled if they arrive here on the basis of false, forged or inaccurate travel documentation. That fails to recognise the plight of refugees who, because of the circumstances they are attempting to flee, often find it impossible to get proper documentation to assist their flight from their country of origin.  I ask for assurances from the Minister about the <Col N="2284" /> implementation and effect of those provisions.</P>
    <P>Overall, I welcome this overdue legislation. It has had a long gestation since my colleague Deputy Shatter attempted to enact a Bill in 1993.  This is the third much improved Bill.  I wholeheartedly recommend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  My constituency does not have a problem with refugees; a number of people from different parts of Europe are buying homes and settling down in the area but they are not refugees.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Committee on Migration, Refugees and Demography of the Council of Europe, I attended a sub-committee meeting on refugees in Zagreb, Croatia some weeks ago. Included on our itinerary was a field visit to a refugee camp in Kladusa, where 25,000 people live in deplorable conditions.  Some of the accommodation consists of makeshift timber houses with a canvas-type roof and many of those dwellings were built on the back of tractor trailers.  This was only one of the many camps we visited.  Can the House imagine that 25,000 live there, in the most deplorable conditions I have ever witnessed?  I never thought I would see anything like it.</P>
      <P>Large families live in these trailers, with only canvas overhead.  They are facing a harsh winter.  The land on which the tents are erected is poor and extremely damp at this time of year. They have no electricity or sanitary services. Water was brought to the site in trucks but it is now being pumped through 2 inch plastic pipes.  I have taken great interest in this part of Europe since I was there.  It has been snowing in the area this week and the temperatures are below zero.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this camp there are over 5,000 young children, 350 pregnant women and over 1,000 people who have limbs missing.  The remainder were mainly teenagers and young adults, fine young men and women.  When I was there in beautiful weather I saw them try to play <Col N="2285" /> football on a poor surface but the weather is harsh now.  Can the House imagine that such a place exists in the centre of Europe, only two and a half hours flying time from Dublin where once people lived happily and contentedly? It is a sad story.</P>
    <P>On our journey from Zagreb we saw the awful devastation of villages where people no longer live.  It was nothing compared to what we witnessed in Bihac, Bosnia-Herzegovina, where over 15,000 homes were destroyed and every school was bombed.  The position has improved slightly in Bihac in the last month since the siege was lifted.  Aid is now getting through and with the help of the UNHCR a number of refugees have returned.  Makeshift classrooms have been organised for the children but tens of thousands of children in Bihac have not received education for the last few years and since the war started in 1991 no one has received any second level education.  Because of the devastation caused to the schools in the area in recent years, Switzerland, Germany, Saudi Arabia and other countries are helping to reconstruct the schools for the people of Bihac.  Could we help by sending those who are registered with FÁS to rebuild some of the schools?  If the Minister has not visited Bihac she should do so.  I and others were devastated when we saw the living conditions of these poor creatures.  We visited Knin where Operation Storm was launched in August.  We met the army general in charge of the operations and toured the town.  We saw at first hand the devastation of that beautiful area.  Hundreds of Serbs fled as a result of the fighting. We visited Serb villages where houses were burned.  It was tit for tat.  Croations burned Serb houses and Serbs burned Croatian houses.  We visited the wine fields and saw Serb women picking grapes and taking them home in creels on the back of donkeys.</P>
    <P>The Red Cross, UNHCR and other agencies are doing an excellent job.  I met Bridghin O'Rourke, a Garda sergeant working in the UN protection force and she spoke at the meeting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2286" /> The 25,000 people in the camp consider themselves the forgotten people. Europe cannot forget about them.  We must help them and play our part in ensuring a war like this will never happen again.  I never thought I would witness such atrocities in Europe.  We should do everything we can to help these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill which contains several important principles and I commend the Minister for implementing it.  I was always surprised that we failed to deal adequately with this area of law over the years.  As Deputy Creed said, this Bill has been in gestation for three years.</P>
      <P>To appreciate and fully understand the importance of the Bill it is prudent to examine the current mechanisms and arrangements in place to deal with refugees.</P>
      <P>At present there is no law dealing with refugees.  The Government operates the terms of the Geneva Convention on the status of refugees.  This is done on an administration basis and the purpose of the Bill is to put that convention on a statutory basis.  We need not only to treat refugee applications properly but to be seen to do so.  The procedure appears to be that an applicant for refugee status applies to the Department of Justice which consults the Department of Foreign Affairs and the UNHCR. The UNHCR makes a recommendation and the Minister makes the decision. The recommendation made by the UNHCR is invariably followed as this organisation is accepted by the NGOs as being authoritative on the subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If an applicant is refused refugee status he or she has the right to appeal to an interim appeals board under the chairmanship of retired Circuit Court judge Peter O'Malley.  It is only lately that this interim arrangement was put in place during discussions with the last Government in response to Deputies' concerns, including mine, on the issue pending enactment of the Refugee Bill which is now before the House.  If the <Col N="2287" /> appeal is upheld the applicant is given refugee status.  If not, the Minister has the option of giving him or her a &ldquo;humanitarian right to remain&rdquo;.  In the past refugee applicants were often detained pending the outcome of their applications.  This is no longer the case although it is possible to detain them if evidence of criminal or terrorist activity exists.</P>
    <P>All applicants were entitled to social welfare and health services such as the supplementary welfare allowance and rent allowance if necessary and on the same basis as Irish people.  Children have a right to education.  However, adults did not have the right to work.  If refugee status was granted they had the same rights as Irish people, except the right to vote.  They can work, be selfemployed and avail of education, work schemes, etc.  It is only in the last 15 months or so that those small improvements came into operation.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give statutory effect to our obligations under the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the status of refugees. Ireland has been a party to the UN convention since 1956 and, as I have outlined, we implemented it on an administrative basis.  Under the Bill provision is being made for a statutory procedure to determine refugee status, an independent authority to examine applications and an independent board to hear appeals.  These are important advances.</P>
    <P>There are a number of new provisions in the Bill which provide that all applications will now be examined by an independent refugee application commissioner with a right of appeal to a five person appeals board set out under sections 15 and 16.  These provisions are particularly important because of the &ldquo;right to be heard&rdquo; Principle which they enshrine.  The applicant will now have a specific right to an interview with an authorised officer of the commissioner and with the aid of interpreters.  If he or she is the subject of a negative recommendation and wishes to appeal against it he or she will have the right to an oral <Col N="2288" /> hearing before the refugee appeals board.</P>
    <P>These provisions represent an important advance on the 1994 Bill which provided for the establishment of a three member Refugee Application Board and a one member Refugee Appeal Tribunal.  My recollection of a major flaw or omission from the provisions of the 1994 Bill is that an applicant did not have a guaranteed right to either an interview or oral hearing before his or her application was determined.</P>
    <P>It is important that a country such as ours be generous in providing for the reunification of families of refugees.  We are providing that not only close family members &mdash; where a dependency relationship exists between the refugee and family members &mdash; but family members permitted to reside here will be entitled to rights similar to those provided in the Bill to persons granted refugee status.  Those rights, set out in section 3, include the right to reside and travel freely in addition to health, social welfare, housing, education and employment entitlements, religious freedom and access to the courts.  Thus family members and refugees will enjoy rights similar to those of Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>The Bill imposes the highest practicable obligation on the authorities concerned to provide interpretation facilities, considered essential to allow an applicant to accurately present his or her case.</P>
    <P>The detention provisions, invoked in exceptional circumstances only, have been modified to incorporate significant additional safeguards.  One circumstance in which detention may be deemed to be necessary is whenever an applicant may be suspected of having committed serious offences in a foreign country.  With regard to such safeguards, regulations will have to be drawn up by the Minister for Justice governing the treatment of persons in detention in addition to specify places of detention. A person under 17 years of age may not be detained and intervals at which continued detention must be reviewed by a <Col N="2289" /> court have been reduced to ten days from the 21 provided for in the 1994 Bill.</P>
    <P>This Bill will also make it clear that the definition of &ldquo;a refugee&rdquo; will be taken to include persons persecuted because of their gender, sexual orientation or membership of a trade union.</P>
    <P>The provisions with regard to deportation have been revised to ensure the highest standards of natural justice are observed.  While recourse to deportation occurs very rarely, nevertheless it is crucial that the standards of natural justice we take for granted be complied with in this area also.  It is also inevitable that there will be applicants, in compelling humanitarian cases, who may fall outside that definition.  In order to provide for them, this Bill will enable the Minister to permit such persons to remain here on humanitarian grounds.</P>
    <P>I have one or two additional points the Minister might address when replying. For example, the Bill does not address the issue of legal aid for applicants. It is important that the Minister indicate her intention to provide it because such people should be covered by our legal aid system even if it involves some extension of it.</P>
    <P>A number of Members have expressed various concerns which I noted carefully.  Deputy Creed was concerned about the Dublin Convention, drawn up to provide a mechanism to cater for refugee applicants being sent from one state to another, sometimes described as &ldquo;refugees in orbit&rdquo;.  That convention aims to guarantee an asylum seeker that his or her application will be dealt with in one of the member states of the European Union in accordance with the 1967 Protocol relating to the status of refugees.  In the Dublin Convention member states specifically reaffirmed their commitment to the United Nations Convention and undertook to co-operate with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in its implementation.</P>
    <P>The text of the Dublin Convention is included in this Bill and does not change asylum law, but sets out the rules for <Col N="2290" /> determining which European Union state will deal with an application. Member states who ratified the convention are bound to accept responsibility for dealing with appropriate applications but, as a safeguard, this Bill specifically provides that an application cannot be transferred to another state unless that state has accepted responsibility for it.  In other words, we are ensuring that an applicant will not be &ldquo;in orbit&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>While we accept responsibility for an application sent to us from another member state of the European Union, if it is in accordance with the Dublin Convention, we are not obliged to transfer such application.  Even if we could transfer an application we have the authority and discretion not to do so if we deem it inappropriate, which may allay some of the well founded concerns Members have expressed.  When replying, perhaps the Minister would clarify that matter for the benefit of Members who made a number of important points on that aspect.</P>
    <P>Section 12 which deals with manifestly unfounded applications, aims to safeguard the rights of asylum seekers and ensure that all applications are dealt with in accordance with the highest standards of natural justice while at the same time safeguarding the interests and safety of our citizens.  Applications submitted by asylum seekers adjudged to be &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; do not deprive applicants of their right to put forward their case.  The Bill provides that an applicant whose application has been found by the Refugee Applications Commissioner to be &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; will have an opportunity to put forward a case that his or her application is not manifestly unfounded in addition to being afforded an opportunity to appeal against the decision to the Refugee Appeal Board.</P>
    <P>Section 12 (4) details a number of circumstances which would give rise to a view that an application is &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo;, for example, where an application does not show any grounds <Col N="2291" /> for the contention that the applicant is a refugee.</P>
    <P>Therefore, very important safeguards are now being put in place.  While this Bill had a long gestation, I fully support its provisions and ask the Minister to take on board my observations and concerns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill because our attitude to it gives an indication of the type of country this is. Are we a closed country, concerned solely with our own problems?  Are we a parochial nation with little or no concern about the problems of other parts of the World?  In the past, we probably could have been accused of having a parochial attitude.  It occurred to me to wonder if Jesus Christ had landed on our shores as a refugee, what type of reception would he have received here? Would he have been regarded as a social malcontent, as somebody uttering treasonable statements against the regime from whence he had come or as an economic refugee, somebody who came with probably no more than a satchel on his back and scandals on his feet?  Would he have been accepted here?  Somehow, I doubt it.  Given that we regard this as a Christian country it is no harm sometimes to examine our attitudes and ask whether we are truly Christian in the way we deal with problems such as this.</P>
      <P>Ireland has an obligation to be outward looking, caring and concerned in dealing with the issue of refugees and asylum seekers.  There has been much publicity lately about commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the Famine &mdash;indeed, there has been ridiculous talk of apologies.  We should be more concerned about examining our attitudes now in the light of what occurred at that time: about one million people died.  They should be remembered. Those in my home town were known as the donkey eaters, an expression which goes back to the Famine times when people there resorted to eating donkeys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look back we should not <Col N="2292" /> just think of the million who died but also the million who emigrated.  They could not have emigrated to the US, Australia and other countries in Europe unless they had been accepted into those countries.  What would have happened if the US or those other countries had a closed door policy then and refused to accept our emigrants?  Many of those countries could justly have claimed that those fleeing Ireland in coffin ships were economic refugees.  They might have claimed there was no political persecution and those involved were merely fleeing from disease and famine.</P>
    <P>In considering our attitude to refugees today we should think back to the history of our own country and what our situation would have been had there not been an open door policy for the million who had to flee in the dark days of the late 1840s.  The numbers who died might have been twice as great if people had been unable to flee the awful conditions which prevailed.  That is the background against which we should consider the issue of refugees today.</P>
    <P>We should also look back on how we treated asylum seekers and refugees over recent decades.  I do not fully accept that we are just underpinning the administrative procedures we had in the past.  Those administrative procedures were quite appalling in a number of ways.  They were Kafkaesque in the way in which they were administered. Kafka's <i>The Trial</i> gives a fair outline of the way in which a refugee or asylum seeker was dealt with in Ireland &mdash; they did not know what the procedures were; there was no openness, transparency or accountability.  While I accept those procedures have improved in recent years, they were not something of which we could be proud.</P>
    <P>There has been a welcome change at administrative level in recent years. There has also been a sea change in attitudes among sections of the public.  I get a considerable amount of correspondence on this issue, some of it from unusual places, possibly because I have indicated an interest in refugees over the years.  It is understandable there <Col N="2293" /> would be interest from university groups or groups such as Amnesty International in Dublin, but it is encouraging to receive letters from towns and villages in my constituency such as Bandon, Ballydehob and Schull.  Indeed, I have an active correspondent on this issue on Cape Clear.  I find it encouraging to see such a widespread interest in this issue in peripheral areas.  It accords with the opening up we need in our attitudes. Perhaps leadership on this issue is coming from rural rather than urban areas, and if it is so much the better.  It reflects our history on other issues.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the 1994 Bill went to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security for consideration and that this Bill arises from that. This justifies the existence of the committee system.  It was because of the discussion at the committee that a decision was made to take on board many of the numerous points raised there and to come up with a new Bill.  That is the committee system at its best.  The experience in relation to this Bill is a vindication of that system.</P>
    <P>It has been fashionable to condemn the committee system.  Such criticism arose recently when there was reference to it being a waste of time having an inquiry before a committee.  The £35,000 spent on the inquiry of the subcommittee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security last December and January was a good bargain when compared with the £35 million cost of the beef tribunal.  There were limitations on the powers of the committee but it was a bargain.  We need to develop the procedures to ensure the committees can produce stronger reports on any such inquiries.</P>
    <P>As a result of the committee's input this Bill is a much improved version of the 1994 Bill.  What I like most about the approach adopted on this occasion is the inherent openness and transparency which removes the worst aspects of the Kafkaesque approach of the administrative procedures.  There will be clear guidelines as to what is to be done and clear statutory rights will <Col N="2294" /> be established for asylum seekers and refugees, such as the right to interpretation. I understand the need to temper that with the phrase &ldquo;where possible&rdquo;. Somebody involved in dealing with refugees might come across an impossible situation where another deliberately tried to outfox the authorities with the use of language.  I would expect interpreting facilities to be available in every case.</P>
    <P>Other aspects of the Bill are attractive, in particular the appeals procedure. This Bill represents a sea change in how we deal with refugees and asylum seekers. There is no reference in the Bill to legal aid and it is important that the Minister should confirm that legal aid will be available in all cases.  There is no point in having proper procedures unless a person can legally avail of them.  It is unthinkable that somebody with language problems who lands on our shores should be expected to find their way around these procedures on their own without having access to legal aid.  I should declare an interest as a lawyer but I make this point not on the basis that it will mean a great deal of money for lawyers but because of the civil and legal rights of those seeking asylum.</P>
    <P>Generally there has been an improvement in our approach to refugees.  Apart from the provisions of the Bill, the sum of £10 million is available under our overseas aid programme which directly or indirectly goes to refugees.  We can be reasonably proud of that and it is certainly a vast improvement on the money that was available when I had charge of the overseas aid programme.  The virtually unamimous support of the House for the overseas aid programme is one of the better developments in recent years.  Having left office in 1987 I recall my horror when the incoming Fianna Fáil administration slashed the aid programme. I am glad that Fianna Fáil has reversed its approach and that the figures have been improved annually with the unanimous consent of the House.</P>
    <P>Our approach to programme refugees is mildly encouraging.  I do not think we <Col N="2295" /> can pat ourselves on the back undully for what we have done in that regard.  We took in 500 Vietnamese years ago but our reaction to the Bosnian crisis was not adequate.  The recent announcement of our willingness to accept another 250 refugees is a welcome improvement, but it is only that.  Metaphorically speaking we bled with the Bosnians during their trials in recent years and we felt for them in their agony and I think this country would have been prepared over the past three or four years to back Government action on a more open door policy for refugees from Bosnia.  I do not think we have anything to be very proud of.  I hope we will be prepared to increase the number if required in the months and years ahead.  At this stage our hopes are pinned on a peace settlement and I hope the current discussions will bear fruit.  If not, we should be prepared to do more than we were prepared to do in the past.</P>
    <P>The number of individuals who land on our shores whose application for asylum is successful is very small.  I accept that many of those who were refused asylum in recent years were allowed to stay on humanitarian grounds and that nowadays there is nobody in jail, as happened in the past.  Very few asylum seekers are now asked to leave the country. Things have improved but the number granted asylum is small.  As a consequence the number coming here seeking asylum is very low.  We are not known internationally as a country with an open door policy.  If we compare ourselves to Sweden we can see the difference. At most a few hundred will seek asylum here in any year but in Sweden I understand the figure is 20,000.  This is indicative of how we are regarded internationally. I am not encouraging an increase in the number but I believe in the light of our past we should have a more open door policy.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that we will have a separate Dáil debate on the Dublin Convention which was specifically designed to deal with what are known as refugees in <Col N="2296" /> orbit, that is those sent from one country to the next.  The end result of the convention was probably restrictive as member states reached agreement on how to deal with refugees, in particular those who went from one state to the next.  I understand that refugees will be dealt with under the procedure of the country in which they first land.  We will have to be very careful in dealing with the Dublin Convention and we must ask if we are prepared to send refugees back to a country which has a more restrictive approach than we have.  I suggest that refugees should not be sent back to a country with a more restrictive approach than ours and where they might be sent back to countries that do not have a good human rights record. Some countries in Europe are flooded with refugee applications.  It is easy for us to criticise the restrictive attitudes that those countries may be adopting but we are not in a position to do that. There is a problem with a unified harmonised European approach to the issue.  We should be trying to encourage a more liberal approach among the member states of the European Union and we should be prepared to go beyond the agreed procedures and indicate clearly that anybody seeking asylum will be dealt with according to our procedures rather than being sent back to a country where the procedures are more restrictive.</P>
    <P>The ideal situation would be a world where there are no refugees.  In a small way we have a role to play.  We can use our voice at European and UN level to draw attention to breaches of human rights in other countries and be supportive of moves such as the establishment of war crimes tribunals.  In our own way we can be to the forefront of those opposed to breaches of human rights no matter where they occur.  That is the role we can play internationally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a short contribution because I took a personal interest in the affairs of <Col N="2297" /> asylum seekers and refugees as difficulties occurred in my constituency at Shannon Airport.  As a result of the succession of incidents there I sought changes in the law, and I am glad the Minister for Justice decided to introduce this Bill.</P>
      <P>This is an amended version of the 1994 Bill which the previous Minister dealt with in committee.  So many amendments were tabled on Committee Stage that the proper course has been taken by the Department in introducing a new Bill.  The Minister was not experiencing many difficulties, but she was reluctant to change the old system and this is the result, to a certain extent, of our association with the British regarding mobility and the possibility that people would have access to the UK by the back door.</P>
      <P>Different rules and regulations began to be operated when Aeroflot and the old Soviet Union airlines started to use Shannon Airport, giving access to Third World refugees who, from time to time, dropped into Shannon Airport and found themselves interned in Limerick Jail.  This happened because the law was being administered remotely from Dublin.</P>
      <P>Regarding this Bill, I would like to see an effort to divert some of the financial resources towards the provinces.  In the case of Shannon Airport at least, there is a continuing crisis.  Much attention has been given in the Bill to examination of family member applications. That is a significant improvement. However, I would like this to apply to the Cuban refugees in this country, some of whose wives and children are in Havana.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the lifetime of the previous Government the authorities negotiated what is called a transit visa whereby people in, say, Cuba, could not come to Ireland, and this prevented the unification of families.  A proper review of this matter should be undertaken right away as this has caused great stress and worry.  Most of the applications received in Ennis are bona fide and the people involved have every intention of setting <Col N="2298" /> down in Ireland principally because they feel that in this country they can follow their religious aspirations.  The transit visa is a shock to the system for these people.  There may be those in the Department who feel that when the Refugee Bill is passed we will get agreement with America and that Cubans here will be assimilated.  However, this will be an ongoing problem.  Very soon other Asian refugees will be pouring in this direction.  The issue of transit visas should, therefore, be clarified on Committee Stage, and I would like the Department to give particular attention to the Cubans here.</P>
    <P>Since I first raised this matter in the Dáil great improvements have been made in the conditions under which refugee applications are examined here. Originally this State, I am sorry to say, depended almost totally on money provided by the Red Cross through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and very little was raised in taxation.  I am glad that there are now sums for the programmes for refugees, that £5 million has been allocated by the Government for Emergency humanitarian assistance and a further £3.5 million for rehabilitation.  This is a major step forward.</P>
    <P>I compliment the volunteer agencies, particularly the Red Cross in Ennis, the Department of Social Welfare and the Mid-Western Health Board officials who have been very understanding of the dilemma of these people, have looked after their health which has been a major issue from time to time, and seen that families have settled in well in reasonable comfort.  There have been noises from time to time in the constituencies from people who regret that refugees seeking asylum in this country are getting minuscule aid from the Department of Social Welfare fund or from the health board fund.  Those people who complain should consider the effect of this on Irish people going in the other direction.  We have had much debate in this House about emigrants.  Irish emigrants were treated very well in the United States.  Indeed, we have been <Col N="2299" /> using the good offices of the United States for many years to help us with our peace process.  I am glad this Government has taken the initiative of publishing this Bill.  There are many people awaiting its progress.  Students want a purer definition of refugee. Others have reservations about the Bill as it stands.  I would like to see the Department examining the aspirations of those people to see whether the Bill can be amended to make the improvements sought.</P>
    <P>Amnesty International in Ireland has been very responsible and has at all times stood by in defence of the refugee.  I admire the work, particularly the voluntary work, done by the many people in Amnesty International in their free time to assist asylum seekers to gain a knowledge of the English language or to acquire some kind of skill.  Many voluntary teachers assist refugees and are generous with their time.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to say something positive about those who have shown great humanitarian tendencies towards refugees.</P>
    <P>Refugees who apply for asylum should be afforded legal representation when they arrive on our shores.  There should be a panel from which lawyers could be selected to assist with processing of applications.  Refugees would then have the confidence to tell the full story when they arrive here.  Due to fear it often takes eight to ten interviews to discover the real story.  Trust and confidence is important for asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>I requested previous Ministers to establish a refugee court, similar to that which operates at the main airport in Los Angeles, although we would not have the throughput to operate such a system at Shannon Airport.  While the provisions of the Bill guarantee legal representation at the appeal stage, refugees should be guaranteed representation from Amnesty International or a legal representative at the first interview after they arrive on our shores. Amnesty International has not called <Col N="2300" /> for such representation, but many problems could be avoided by adopting such an approach.  We have a great pool of translators to call on for assistance when interviewing refugees.  A lecturer from the University of Limerick was called on to assist in interviewing a refugee form Eritrea, and that person would still be in jail if we had not been able to find a person to translate what he was saying.</P>
    <P>While some have expressed reservations about helping refugees, in general we show great generosity towards them, indeed, many have critised my attitude towards them.  People have expressed the view that I should not make representations on their behalf. However, Members of this House were quick to whinge when Irish refugees who landed in the United States spent many hours in jail.  Representations were made on their behalf.  I am sure those refugees were not treated with kid gloves, but there has not been a disaster in so far as Irish illegal immigrants to the the United States are concerned.  It is not my wish that there should be animosity towards asylum seekers.</P>
    <P>Despite the great deal of time spent talking about the refugee problem and the emotion generated in this debate, the number of successful applicants is very small.  There were 259 applications received in 1995, 355 in 1994, 91 in 1993 and 39 in 1992.  While there has been a significant increase in the number of applications, the number that are successful is minuscule.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I am sure amendments will be proposed on Committee Stage, The Irish Refugee Council has also welcomed it and expressed concern about the implementation of provisions for detention and legal aid, which the Minister has promised.  The Dublin convention was referred to by other speakers.  I compliment The Irish Refugee Council, Amnesty International and volunteers and State agencies who do a great job in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MoosajeeBhamjee" hpid="Dr. Bhamjee Dr. Bhamjee">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Bhamjee</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to follow Deputy Carey in this debate because I <Col N="2301" /> know the extent of his work on the refugee problem in County Clare.  Long before I was elected I heard of his work and following my election I directed many people to him who were experiencing difficulty in this area.  I am sure he will recall the Iraqi doctor whom we both helped and who is now practising here.  I congratulate the Minister of State on his work in this area, for which he will not receive any votes.  Amnesty International has been protesting to us about this matter for a long time.  That organisation must be congratulated for its active work and the pressure it put on politicians from all parties to ensure the passage of this Bill through the House.  The last time a Bill of this nature was introduced was in the 1950s.  I am pleased the Minister considered proposals from all sides in drawing up this worthwhile Bill.  It also complies with UN conventions and the latest European laws on refugees.  The number of refugees in Europe is increasing.  Many refugees from eastern Europe are seeking asylum in Germany where, until recently, the laws on refugee status were very lax.  We have caught up with the rest of Europe in this regard.</P>
      <P>Shannon Airport is well known for the number of refugees who arrive there, Dublin Airport does not have that problem.  Therefore, Shannon can be regarded as an international, rather than a regional airport.  Refugees from Cuba, Ethiopia, Sudan and Somalia arrive on our shores.  Muslim refugees who arrived from Sudan recently are in isolation, and Pakistani doctors practising in Ennis meet and pray with them every day.  These refugees have made friends with the Pakistanis and feel at home with the Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some refugees arrive here alone. There is provision in the Bill whereby a spouse or children can be brought here at a later stage.  This is a welcome, progressive measure which grants normal rights to these families.  The people of County Clare, immigration officers and those working at the airport have been hospitable to refugees, although occasional lapses have occurred, which <Col N="2302" /> were referred to earlier.  The Bill outlines the difference between economic and political refugees and caters mainly for the latter group.  It provides for applicants for refugee status who do not have the proper documents.</P>
    <P>One criticism of this matter relates to the amount of time it takes to grant refugee status.  I know one lady who has been waiting at least four years and in the meantime she cannot work and cannot leave the country.  To do nothing for years is not good for one's spirit.  Some programme should be devised for people in this position.  One such person has become the high jump champion of County Clare and has won medals for her club in other counties.</P>
    <P>Credit should be given to the Red Cross who have done much work for refugees.  There is a famous meeting place in County Clare for refugees and the landlord of the house concerned should be congratulated for the work he has done for these people.  Friendships have developed between Irish people and refugees.  My daughter has developed friendships with Cubans and people from the Eastern bloc.  The children of County Clare benefit from these friendships because they learn new languages and cultures and get to know how other people live.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of the commissioner and the setting up of an appeals board.  Previously when applications for refugee status were rejected even TDs were not given the reasons. That was a very unsatisfactory system which will be improved by setting up the appeals board.  Refugees have been coming here since World War I and a number of them have contributed to society.  In the past people have come here from Vietnam and more recently from Bosnia.  Many of those people came here for medical treatment and some of them remained.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey referred to the problem of interpreters.  It is not possible to provide interpreters for all languages but perhaps a voluntary agency could be set up whereby people who speak other languages could contribute to this area. <Col N="2303" /> It is a source of comfort for refugees to meet somebody who speaks their language. Perhaps the Minister would consider that matter.</P>
    <P>Up to recently the number of successful applications for refugee status has been reasonably low.  Many people who are granted refugee status do not understand their entitlements.  For example, are they entitled to an Irish passport?  If they wish to travel to another country is that possible or will they be prevented from doing so?  If a Cuban wishes to go to America but is turned down by the American Embassy does that person become a liability to this State or what is the position?  Perhaps the Minister will look into that matter and come back to me on it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision on granting refugee status on humanitarian grounds. In the case of a Libyan student who came here and was refused admission, the Irish authorities tried to put him back on the plane but the captain would not take him.  That is one person who should be allowed to remain here on humanitarian grounds.  Refugees living in Ireland can appeal to the Minister for Justice and that is welcome.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that legal aid is being provided for refugees.  These people should be made aware of the services available to them.  In County Clare there was no legal aid board until this year when the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, provided funding for such a service.  Perhaps that money will be used not only for the divorce referendum but also to help refugees.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this Bill.  We were promised it would be introduced by December 1995 and for once the Government kept its promise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Justice (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate, particularly those who acknowledged that we kept our promise.  There has been a very broad welcome for this <Col N="2304" /> important Bill which was introduced to ensure that our procedures for dealing with applications for asylum will meet the highest possible standards.  This is an issue on which all parties agree.  The Bill represents a significant step in terms of achieving that objective.</P>
      <P>Members referred to the widening of the definition of a refugee to include issues such as the admission of family members, questions of legal aid, procedures, the appointment of a commissioner and matters relating to the board.  All those issues reflect details of my meetings with NGOs, such as The Irish Refugee Council, Amnesty International and the Irish Red Cross.  These organisations have for a long time taken a detailed, serious and practical interest in the welfare of refugees.  The Bill is partly a reflection of my meetings with those organisations.  I acknowledge the advice and the information they made available to me.</P>
      <P>The work of my predecessor in the Department of Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, and the debates and discussions during the process of the 1994 Bill on Committee Stage were a major influence in the drafting of this Bill.  A substantial number of amendments have arisen from the work undertaken by Deputies on the former Bill together with my review of it and contact with the NGOs I have mentioned. This Bill is a product of that influence. Many Deputies in addressing the Bill have talked not only about its subject matter but about Ireland's position regarding refugees.  While the Bill is confined specifically to asylum seekers who arrive here, I assure Deputies that my approach is based on our overall responsibility to refugees.  Given our traditions and experiences in regard to refugees, including those who seek asylum status in Ireland specifically dealt with in this and the earlier Bill, and our responsibility as a small independent member state of the European Union, our approach is one of addressing the broader issue of refugees throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2305" /> Currently our assistance to refugees falls under three headings.  Through the overseas development programme we have to respond to an increasing number of crises which we wish could be avoided.  We spend just less than £10 million as part of our overseas aid and development programme on refugees in places like the camps in Goma.  A Deputy spoke of refugees in the former Yugoslavia.  On behalf of Irish people, Irish Aid is proud to be assisting refugees in parts of the former Yugoslavia. The amount of money being spent there is significant.  We are also assisting refugees in Palestine and under the care of UN agencies in that area. Hopefully, that will be of substantial assistance to the Middle Eastern peace process.</P>
    <P>The second leg of our commitment to refugees is our admittance of programme refugees, groups who arrive as a result of a Government decision.  Currently there are approximately 1,000 programme refugees here, approximately half of whom are Vietnamese and half from the former Yugoslavia. When programme refugees arrive in Ireland they are entitled to the same entitlements as an Irish person in relation to health, education, welfare and social services.  I compliment the various agencies and social welfare services from health boards to community welfare officers, particularly in Dublin and in Clare, who deal with such cases.</P>
    <P>We have a refugee agency under the Department of Foreign Affairs which is one of the agencies under my responsibility. That agency deals with the social and economic development of programme refugees.  I am pleased that the Vietnamese and Bosnian programme refugees have active associations which, with Government financial support, address issues of social development, integration, language and particularly training to ensure those with programme status can ultimately enter the job market.  Many Deputies identified that as a critical issue, a point with which I agree, and it is being addressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2306" /> The Government has given permission for another 250 refugees to be accepted from the former Yugoslavia, together with their families in due course.  We have made a number of offers to family members of Bosnian refugees based here to join their families and we look forward to their arrival. Our concerns in terms of international relations should be to assist in the achievement of human rights and democratic standards throughout the world to ensure that it will not be necessary for people to flee their native countries in fear of persecution and in terror for the safety of their lives and those of their families.  That remains a fundamental principle of Irish foreign policy.</P>
    <P>This Bill is closely modelled on the Refugee Bill introduced by the previous Government.  It contains a substantial number of additional provisions to safeguard the interests of persons applying for refugee status.  I am glad these measures meet with the approval of Members.</P>
    <P>There is a limit to the number of issues that can be addressed in reply to a Second Stage debate.  I am aware that a number of matters raised are more appropriate to Committee Stage, Deputies will have an opportuntiy to table specific amendments to the Bill on that Stage and I assure the House that I will give full consideration to any tabled.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers expressed concern about the Dublin Convention set out in the Fourth Schedule to the Bill. While it is a matter we can discuss in detail on Committee Stage, it might be helpful if I were to clarify the position in that regard.  I would like the House to be clear about its purpose.  Its primary one is the protection of the right of an asylum seeker to have his or her claim determined in accordance with the 1951 UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.  We are all aware of cases where asylum seekers have been sent back and forth from one state to another.  That is the phenomenon that has become known as refugees in orbit. <Col N="2307" /> The Dublin Convention was drawn up to address that problem.</P>
    <P>The stated aim of the convention is to guarantee that an applicant who makes an asylum claim in the EU will have his or her application examined in one of the member states in accordance with the terms of the UN Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.  In the Dublin Convention member states specificaly reaffirm their commitment to the UN Convention and undertake to co-operate with the UNHCR in its implementation. I draw the attention of the House in particular to the fact that in August 1991 the UNHCR adopted a formal position on the Dublin Convention welcoming its principles including the guarantee that an asylum application will be examined by one of the member states.</P>
    <P>The second point relates to the ratification of the Dublin Convention.  As Deputies will be aware, there is a requirement in Article 25.5.2 of the Constitution that the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of that agreement have been approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>As the Dublin Convention would be regarded as being within the scope of Article 29.5.2 it will have to be specifically approved by the Dáil and enshrined in Statute before it can be ratified by Ireland and its terms implemented.  This will require bringing a motion before the House seeking such approval.  That will facilitate a full debate on the convention and I am sure Members who addressed the question of a convention will contribute at that stage.  Accordingly, we have provided in section 22 for making orders to enable the convention to have effect.  These orders are in the course of preparation. When the motion seeking approval to ratify the convention is brought before this House, I plan to make available to Deputies drafts of the orders to be made to bring the terms of the convention into effect.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go into detail now <Col N="2308" /> on the contents of the Dublin Convention but it is important to bear in mind that it does not change asylum law or the obligations on member states of the European Union.  It sets out rules for determining the State responsible for examining an asylum claim.  For example, if Ireland had issued a visa to a person who then travelled to France and lodged an asylum claim there, Ireland would, under the convention, be responsible for examing the application for asylum.  If the position was reversed and France had issued a visa and the application was lodged in Ireland, then France would be responsible for the examination.  The responsible state must accept responsibility before an applically can be transferred.  We have specifically provided in section 22 that an application cannot be transferred unless the other state concerned has agreed to accept it.  Furthermore, while bound to accept an application for which it is responsible, a state is quite free to decide not to transfer an application to another member state and to assume responsibility for examining it.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have voiced a concern raised by Amnesty International that if, under the Dublin Convention, we were to transfer an application to one of our European partners that country might send the applicant back to his or her country of origin.  In that context I would point out that all EU states are parties to the UN Convention in relation to the Status of Refugees.  The Dublin Convention's starting point is that is guarantees that the member states will honour their obligations under the UN Convention which specifically provides that an applicant will not be returned to a state where the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.  This is known as the non-refoulement principle and Deputies will appreciate, therefore, that it will not be open to any member state to return applicants to countries where they may face persecution.  Deputies will no doubt <Col N="2309" /> be interested to note that the EU member states have agreed that a threat to bodily integrity is covered in the nonrefoulement principle.</P>
    <P>I would be concerned if Members suggested we could not trust our fellow member states to live up to their obligations under the UN Convention.  It is extremely important for Ireland that we and all our EU partners play a full and responsible role in the affairs of the Union and that we operate in a climate of mutual trust and co-operation.  For our part we have entered into a commitment to ratify the Dublin Convention which was signed on behalf of this country by the Minister for Justice in June, 1990.</P>
    <P>I realise there is a need for a full debate on the Dublin Convention.  We can have that debate on Committee Stage and we can have another debate when I bring the motion for ratification of the convention before the House.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed concern about manifestly unfounded applications. I would remind the House that the UNHCR support special procedures for dealing with manifestly unfounded applications because they are concerned that the asylum process should be reserved for genuine applicants and that it should not be undermined by applications that are wholly without merit. The executive committee of the UNHCR adopted a conclusion in 1983 to the effect that national procedures &ldquo;may usefully include special provision for dealing in an expeditious manner with applications which are considered to be so directly without foundation as not to merit a full examination at any level&rdquo;.  In this Bill the grounds on which the Refugee Applications Commissioner may form a view that an application is manifestly unfounded are rebuttable and an applicant will have an opportunity, which includes the facility of an interview, to put forward a case that the application is not manifestly unfounded.  Some of the grounds on which an application can be regarded as manifestly unfounded have been redrafted to take on board the <Col N="2310" /> Deputies' concerns that genuine asylum seekers could too easily fall into this category. For example, because genuine applicants may, in certain circumstances, have no option but to use forged documents, I have amended the relevant provisions so that only those applicants who do not have reasonable cause for having such documents could find themselves having their applications treated as manifestly unfounded.</P>
    <P>Where the commissioner finds that an application is manifestly unfounded, the applicant will have a right of appeal to the appeal board and a right to an oral hearing before the board.</P>
    <P>I will give a practical example of the whole question of manifestly unfounded applications.  Recently I was with President Robinson in Rwanda and in Zaire where we met numerous groups of refugees. There are more that 2 million refugees in the countries around the borders of Rwanda.  At present an international tribunal is seeking to address the question of war crimes in the genocide in which nearly one million people in Rwanda lost their lives in four months. If a war criminal, somebody involved in the genocide in Rwanda who had committed crimes against humanity was a terrorist or a person who would put the Irish public at risk applied to this country for refugee status in such a way as to seek to escape from the international tribunal and from justice it is correct that we protect ourselves from such an abuse of the refugee applications system. That is what the &ldquo;manifestly unfounded&rdquo; regulations seek to do. They take into careful account the points made by Deputies in the debate on the 1994 Bill when it was before the House.  Deputies referred to the need to provide access to interpreters.  The advice available to me is that the wording in the Bill places an onus on our authorities to provide interpreters while allowing for situations where it would simply not be possible to have an interpreter available and the rare and exceptional cases where a person refuses to co-operate with the authorities. In effect, the wording will ensure the <Col N="2311" /> provision of interpretation as a matter of course.  Information leaflets containing the type of information which would be required by asylum seekers will be made available in a wide range of languages. This was an issue which arose in the course of the discussion on the 1994 Bill.  The Bill has been drafted so as to reflect the advice and the points made by Deputies at that time to put an onus on the authorities in Ireland to provide interpretation facilities.  Access to an interpreter is critical to a refugee in terms of his ability to make his case in a country with different cultures and customs.</P>
    <P>On the issue of family reunification, Deputy Lynch raised the question of whether children under 18 years who are married should be automatically excluded for family reunification purposes.</P>
    <P>She had in mind asylum seekers from countries where the age of marriage is very low, either because children are married off at a young age by their parents&mdash;this happens in regions of the Indian sub-continent&mdash;or they simply marry at a very young age.  Deputy Lynch pointed out that in certain cultures, child marriages are common and the child remains under the protection of his or her family.  I appreciate the Deputy's point and I propose to seek the Attorney General's advice on this matter because, under our legislation, we do not permit marriage before 18 years of age.</P>
    <P>Deputies also rightly raised the question of the funding of a scheme of legal assistance for asylum seekers.  While there are not any provisions in the Bill relating to this, I am pleased to tell the House that the Government has agreed to provide funding for such a scheme. Officials of the Department of Justice have been holding talks with the UNHCR on this matter and are currently considering proposals.  Further consultations with the UNHCR and other relevant organisations, including those with a specific interest in the welfare of refugees, will be required before <Col N="2312" /> an appropriate scheme can be finalised. I hope to be in a position to provide more information on this issue in the course of the passage of the Bill through this House.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to the aliens section of the Department of Justice, the way it currently operates and how it operated in the past.  While the term &ldquo;alien&rdquo; has a specific legal meaning both here and abroad, it is not a term with which I am happy.  I am pleased, therefore, to advise Deputies that the name of the division in my Department dealing with individuals in the general immigration area, including asylum applications, was altered during the previous Minister's term of office and is now called the immigration and citizenship division.  We have also sought to make certain improvements in that division in the process.</P>
    <P>I have responsibility in the Department of Justice to provide information to the public on immigration matters.  In regard to asylum seekers, an information leaflet given to such people sets out the application procedures and provides a list of useful contacts, including the Irish Refugee Council, the Red Cross, the Eastern Health Board and the Mid-Western Health Board.  The application forms for asylum seekers have been altered following consultations with the Irish Refugee Council and are available in a number of languages including Arabic, French, Romanian, Russian, Spanish and Turkish.  On the general immigration side, a number of information leaflets are close to finalisation.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised points regarding immigration matters, generally. Deputies will be aware that an interdepartmental committee on non-Irish nationals was established to examine <i>inter alia</i> the policy and practice in relation to the admission to residence and right of work in the State of both EU and non-EU nationals.  The first report of this committee laid the foundations of the Bill before the House <Col N="2313" /> today.  The second report of the committee dealing with other immigration matters is expected to be presented to the Minister for Justice shortly.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the points made by Deputies, particularly in this year when we begin a cycle of commemorating the great Irish Famine, the people who died as a result of it and those who were forced to flee Ireland to seek a better life abroad.  Those people now form the Irish Diaspora of which we talk so much and are rightly proud.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an appropriate response by us in this year of the Famine commemoration to meeting our international obligations and setting them out clearly in statute law.  It simply deals with those people who arrive here and make application for political asylum.  We give those people the same rights as Irish citizens while their application is being processed, including access to welfare, health, education and other services.</P>
    <P>This is only one element of our support for refugees.  In terms of overseas development aid we are now spending almost £10 million, most of which has gone to help refugees of countries such as Rwanda, the former Yugoslavia, Somalia and the Sudan.  Where possible refugees should be facilitated to remain in their own country where there are now many internally displaced persons, to use UN jargon, or to stay as close as possible to their country of origin.</P>
    <P>As a voice in international affairs, we must also seek to assist in the establishment of universal standards of human rights, justice and democracy which I hope will mean that in the next century we will not have the spectre of millions of people moving from one country to another because of persecution.  That is one of our roles as a country which has also experienced great trauma.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to continue my contribution to this debate.  Given that Asia was hosting the women's conference this year, it was appropriate that it was held in China despite the concerns about civil rights in that country.  Holding the conference in China ensured there was a focus, not just in China but world-wide, on civil rights issues.  The focus on the rights of the girl-child, which emerged primarily because the conference was being held there, was very important.  The mass media controls and the restrictions in China continue to be very strong, but despite that I am hopeful that the holding of the conference in China will have a beneficial effect in the long term on civil rights in that country.</P>
      <P>The question must be asked: was the UN conference on women a success and worthwhile?  I believe it was.  The initiatives which flowed and will continue to flow from the conference are important nationally but also internationally in relation to the development of human rights and women's rights.  There is an increased focus on the girl-child, a phrase with which we are not very familiar because we do not have to face this issue in the way it must be faced in many countries where baby girls are so devalued that their very lives are threatened. I will speak about this in some detail later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another initiative I believe will attract increasing focus in the attempts world-wide to deal with the increasing poverty of women.  The enormous problems that subsistence economies create for women in particular means that they carry the brunt of poverty.  Women are <Col N="2315" /> very vulnerable and this is evident when major crises occur in countries such as a famine or a war which result in a large movement of women and children in particular.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues featured prominently in the conclusions of the conference.  For example, consideration was given to the involvement of women in decision making and new strategies to prevent and eliminate violence against women and girls.  Ireland has made great progress in dealing with many of the issues tackled at the conference and we are far ahead of some countries in many aspects.  Consideration was also given to the elimination of unequal access to health care and related services. While there is scope for further improvement we have made great strides in developing very good health services.  There was a great deal of focus on the steps necessary to ensure the advancement of women in the context of peace and the attainment of general and complete disarmament.</P>
    <P>I believe the points made at the conference would have the support of many men.  The reports on the conference did not refer to the number of men from all over the world who participated in the discussion on equality.  There needs to be more discussion on how women and men can work together to ensure an equal society.  The conference focused mainly on the contribution which can be made by women.</P>
    <P>The conclusions reached at the conference were given the title &ldquo;Platform for Action&rdquo;.  On the question of women's health, important new responsibilities were placed on governments. Ireland is the first county in Europe to publish a document on women's health and to engage in the process of developing a women's health policy.  This is in line with the recommendations agreed at the conference.</P>
    <P>More work could have been done at the conference on the issue of disarmament and the problem of landmines. Unfortunately the EU was divided on this issue.  We must adopt a much <Col N="2316" /> tougher position in relation to this terrible scourge.  Countries such as Sweden and Finland have a particular interest in this area.  Landmines have been laid along the Finnish border while both countries are engaged in their production. It was difficult for these countries to take a strong stance on this issue at the conference.  Further work needs to be undertaken at an EU level to ensure that this issue is properly tackled.</P>
    <P>The cohesion among EU countries was much stronger at this conference than it was at the Nairobi conference ten years ago.  This is to the advantage of both women and men and it reflects the post-Maastricht situation.  The EU presented its views on the development of women's equality in a very strong way.  This was to the advantage of women throughout Europe.  However, this is not to say that the EU got its own way on everything, and this was important in some respects.  After all, the conference was about negotiation and compromise on what should be done at a world level.</P>
    <P>A total of 185 countries participated in the conference and the level of consensus between countries with divergent views such as Iraq, the United States, Ireland and India was extraordinary. The situations in these countries are very different.  For example, Iraqi women do not have the freedom to decide what clothes they wear, yet they spoke about how the education system is paying more attention to women.  In spite of their obvious political differences, countries are faced with the same issues.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some of the issues raised at the conference.  The points made by the women from Asia and India were very different from the issues raised by us.  Nevertheless there was dialogue and the previous agreements reached in Cairo and Vienna were built on.  The preparatory work carried out by women's groups in Ireland and at a European and international level meant that there was 95 per cent agreement on most issues.  While there were different <Col N="2317" /> ethical approaches to women's health we still managed to emerge with a stronger definition of women's rights in the area of health.  One of the recurring themes of the conference was that women's rights are human rights. Improving the lives of women and girls is an incredibly important goal which will help to alleviate poverty throughout the world and ensure that all children are wanted and cared for.</P>
    <P>While most of the media coverage of the conference was excellent some of it was superficial and dismissive of the amount of work done.  It is important to realise that the discussions were very detailed.  In this respect I pay tribute to the officials of the Departments of Foreign Affairs, Equality and Law Reform and Health who worked incredibly hard and maintained a strong voice for Ireland throughout the negotiations. The conference dealt with issues such as the economy, politics, human rights, education, health, the environment, science and technology etc., on which there is ongoing work.</P>
    <P>It is important to make available information on the Platform for Action, to ask Departments what they are doing about the recommendations and to set up a monitoring committee to ensure that the work is carried on.  I have spoken at a number of meetings since the conference and there is a great interest among women in what happened, a desire to get more information on the issues agreed and on the proposed action for tackling the many problems still facing us.  It is important to make that information available.</P>
    <P>The inter-parliamentary union held a day long meeting which focused on the role of parliamentarians in furthering equality for women.  More than 600 women and men parliamentarians came together to discuss how our work within parliaments can ensure that the measures agreed at Beijing are implemented.  It was agreed that women still play a minority role in decision making, particularly in politics where there is still a major imbalance.  I welcome the strong programme for action <Col N="2318" /> adopted by the inter-parliamentary union to ensure that action is taken to redress this imbalance.  This issue is not out of our control; it can be tackled if there is the necessary political will.</P>
    <P>According to surveys carried out by the inter-parliamentary union, women account for only 11.3 per cent of world parliamentarians, a slight improvement on the position 50 years ago.  All countries must ask why the disgraceful situation whereby women are so under-represented in parliament has been allowed to continue.  We have a responsibility to tackle this issue.  As long as there are so few women parliamentarians we will have unfinished democracies.  Women account for more than 20 per cent of parliamentarians in only 20 countries, a woman presides over a parliament or parliamentary chamber in only 17 countries and there are only 15 women heads of state or government world-wide. These figures clearly indicate the total imbalance in decision making.  The parliamentarians at the conference pledged that this issue would be addressed and it is clearly one which should be given priority in this country.</P>
    <P>I said I believed much more attention would be given to the rights of the girl child as a result of the Beijing conference.  It is extremely disturbing to note that in parts of southern India approximately half the new born baby girls are killed, sacrifices to the cult of the boy child.  All things are not equal for baby girls in parts of Asia, northern Africa and China.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Cowen on Tuesday, 7 November 1995:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, acknowledging the crisis in the Irish sheep sector and mindful of the many thousands of <Col N="2319" /> jobs on farms and in factories dependent on the industry, condemns the Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry for the sustained indifference they have demonstrated to the needs of the industry and hereby calls for urgent steps to be taken to address both the immediate crisis and the long-term structural problems of the Irish sheep sector.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann endorses the effective measures which have already been taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry to address the difficulties which have been experienced by sheep producers this year and commends the intensive efforts by the Minister at the Council of Agriculture Ministers to secure further support for the sector.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Having attended public meetings in my constituency where I come in contact with farmers almost on a daily basis, I am very much aware of the serious problems confronting sheep farmers, particularly in the lowlands.  I am not sure if the same could be said of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, or his Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, as little action has been taken in recent months.  Sheep prices also collapsed in 1992 when I was Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, but the difference is that the then Minister, <Col N="2320" /> Deputy Joe Walsh, recognised the enormity of the problem and secured a top-up payment of £6 per ewe to ease the burden.</P>
      <P>According to the Minister, sheep prices have fallen by 6 per cent this year. They have fallen dramatically since March, this at a time when incomes in every other sector of agriculture have increased substantially.  Sheep farmers in my constituency, which I share with the Minister, are up in arms.  They are frustrated and disillusioned and many, including some of the Minister's supporters, no longer see a future for themselves and their families in sheep production.</P>
      <P>Prices rose in October, but this was too little too late for many sheep farmers who were forced to sell their stock early in the year at prices as low as 93p per pound.  The Minister, who is surrounded by an American style PR team, has lost the common touch.  He does not seem to realise that the sheep sector faces a major crisis.</P>

      <P>The Minister should seriously consider the request made by the IFA for the extension of the rural world premium, a single method of calculation of ewe premium, a top-up payment of £8 per ewe or, alternatively, a permanent top-up mechanism.  On the question of carcass reclassification, what is the current position?  Although there has been much talk about the need for quality the Minister has not delivered on his promise to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2321" /> Were it not for the efforts of the Wexford branch of the IFA, sheep farmers would have been abandoned long ago not only by the Minister, but also by the IFA at national level.  The Wexford branch deserves great credit.  It has been a lone voice on behalf of sheep farmers, particularly in the lowlands.  I think the message is beginning to get through.  We will offer the Minister our full support in his attempts to secure a top-up payment of £8 and the extension of the rural world premium.</P>

      <P>In the mid-1950s when people worked a half-day on Saturdays, the price of a pound of wool was ten shillings, the equivalent of one-eighth of the average weekly wage of £4.  Last year it was 18p with which one could buy less than one and a half cigarettes at a cost of 14p each.  It cost £2 to have a sheep sheared.  All the farmer gained in return was £1.30 approximately, which meant he was losing 70p per sheep.  This is an indication that the bottom has fallen out of the market.</P>
      <P>In 1988, according to the figures produced by Teagasc, a farmer made a profit of £35 per ewe.  By 1994 this figure had fallen to £22 or by 35 per cent.  This is an indication that the bottom has also fallen out of the lamb market.</P>

      <P>This issue is of importance to the sheep farmers of Wicklow and east Kildare.  I wish to emphasise three main points.  A top-up payment of £8 per ewe would make all the difference to many sheep farmers, who will either sink or swim depending on whether it is paid.  It would, however, only be a short-term solution.  The Minister should press for the introduction of a single method of calculation.  As there is no price convergence throughout Europe, in the words of George Orwell &ldquo;some are more equal than others&rdquo;.  The <Col N="2322" /> increase in the volume of New Zealand lamb imports has had a detrimental effect on the Irish sheep sector.  It needs to be drastically reduced.  We should not allow ourselves to be sold out in this manner.</P>

      <P>I never thought I would speak on the crisis in the sheep market, given that I represent part of Cork city which is severely disadvantaged but one subject on which it does not face a crisis is the price of sheep.  I was asked by the Whips' office if I would like to contribute to this debate. I said I would have to think about it and decided there was a connection between my area and the farming industry.  The subject before us in overproduction in the sheep industry in the first part of 1995 and the rationalisation in the second half of the year.  I decided if the matter concerned grants and intervention I should speak on it.</P>
      <P>I am concerned that periodic crises in the agriculture sector such as currently experienced by sheep producers lead to further patching up and selective expansion of the Common Agricultural Policy. The cracks in the CAP will not be resolved by the &ldquo;band-aid&rdquo; approach. Despite our reservations about his departure to Europe the former Commissioner, Mr. MacSharry introduced some excellent reforms.  However, there is still need for a root and branch overhaul of the CAP, which is fast becoming unwieldy, unsustainable and unworkable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I categorically deny Fianna Fáil's assertion that this Government has failed to tackle the problem facing Irish sheep producers.  With the average price of lamb falling by 6 per cent in the first half of this year because of over-production last year, sheep producers are <Col N="2323" /> facing a serious problem and they have my sympathy.  The position was slightly alleviated in May when the Minister, Deputy Yates, successfully lobbied for the introduction of aid to the private storage scheme for the old season lamb, which was followed by a further scheme in June.</P>

      <P>The Minister has argued for a supplementary premium to be paid if market prices in any member state drop 10 per cent or more below the average EU price.  Such a premium would undoubtedly alleviate many of the temporary hardships experienced by producers in the face of fluctuating prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, it is on a wider level that I see the correlation between this sector and the area I represent.  I am concerned that the periodic crises experienced by various agricultural sectors <Col N="2324" /> tend to result in patching-up and arbitrary expansion of what is already an unwieldy system of doubtful efficiency. Within the CAP framework this Government has succeeded in obtaining a good deal for Irish producers; the concessions obtained by the Minister in respect of sheep producers are just one example.  However, there is a need for the CAP as a whole to be reviewed.  The time is fast approaching when neither Irish nor European taxpayers &mdash; the people I represent &mdash; will be able to afford to subsidise the CAP unless it is subjected to a root and branch overhaul.</P>
    <P>This year we are commemorating the famine; in August we witnessed 2.5 million tonnes of fruit and vegetables, produced at a cost of nearly £500 million in subsidies, being destroyed in an effort to artificially boost world prices.  The scandal of set-aside allows farmers to claim an average of £3,292 in respect of land let fallow, a waste.  These are only two examples of what can only be termed &ldquo;mad CAP disease&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that proportion is steadily increasing.  This year over £700 million in taxpayers' money will flow into farmers' pockets, and the figure is set to increase next year.  The artificially high prices engendered by the CAP, with the subsidies needed to <Col N="2325" /> support the scheme, mean that householders in Ireland pay an average of £20 extra per week in higher food bills and taxes.  A recent consultancy report for the European Commission recommended a radical reform of the CAP, yet Governments throughout Europe have put the issue on the political back burner for fear of offending powerful farming lobbies.  Unless EU member states grasp the nettle of CAP reform, EU taxpayers may find themselves unable or unwilling to continue subsidising a policy which has gone out of control.</P>

      <P>As a Member of the European Parliament in the early 1970s, I was on its agriculture committee and one of the few people on that committee who demanded, successfully, that the Parliament should accept a regime for sheepmeat, which was excluded from the other agricultural schemes.  The then Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Mr. Mark Clinton, pressed for this through the Commission.  It has continued since to bring the benefit of the European regime to the sheep farmers of Ireland.</P>
      <P>It was of particular benefit to people from my county.  I now represent the larger constituency of Wicklow-East Kildare and it is one of our main industries, especially in County Wicklow.  The industry is worth £30 million and should be protected and defended.  In upland Wicklow there is little alternative to sheep farming; the topography means there is little chance of moving into other agricultural activities.  When an industry such as sheep farming is in trouble it rebounds severely on Wicklow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current Minister, assisted by his Minister of State, has probably been the most successful Minister in this area since Mr. Clinton.  His work for other sectors is well recognised and he will not let Irish sheep farmers down.  Nevertheless there is a problem and it would be <Col N="2326" /> foolish not to recognise it.  We have a difficulty and the Minister is taking action in several areas, as mentioned by the previous speaker, and I commend him for that.</P>
    <P>Whether it is imports from New Zealand or the difficulties last summer, where exports did not reach the expected levels, there is a problem.  The Minister's aggressive style in European meetings will have raised the issues where they matter.  We cannot do much in this House as regards agriculture; it is in the corridors of power in Brussels where changes must be made.  Will the Minister continue to air the problems facing sheep farmers?  The losses in that sector affect farmers who do not have an income from other sources. However, I recognise that the matter rests with Brussels and there is little we can do here.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will keep a close eye on non-elected bodies taking over the uplands in my county to the detriment of farmers.  I know he is aware of some of the difficulties and representations have been made to him but the demands made by the IFA on behalf of sheep farmers should be taken on board.  The Minister will make the strongest possible case in Europe.  I know he has successfully negotiated with the Commissioner on behalf of other sectors and I look forward to him improving the market for sheep producers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share time with Deputies Theresa Ahearn, Hogan, Crawford and Boylan.  It goes without saying that 1995 was a disastrous year for sheep farmers.  In County Galway we depend largely on income from sheep.  The sheep trade was somewhat better in the last three or four weeks due to the demand for good quality ewe lambs.  I hope ewe lambs will be eligible for the ewe premium next year. However, as a result of the number of hoggets that might come on to the market in 1996 early lamb producers may not have it so good next year either.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last July and August many farmers <Col N="2327" /> had to sell 27, 28 or 29 lb lambs and they did not make much money.  I was involved on the periphery when the ewe premium scheme was negotiated in Brussels.  It has stood Irish farmers very well and the trade would be scuttled without it.  However, the mechanism used is the average price across Europe and as the Irish sheep price is worse than it is anywhere else it works against us.  It must be adjusted and I know the Minister has spoken to the other Ministers of Agriculture who will not have the same domestic pressures when they attend the meeting in December because continental sheep farmers are not as badly off as the Irish.  We need a top up premium but it must be organised quickly.  If early lamb producers are forced out of the market, they will go back to mid and late season lambing and there will be a bigger lamb glut than ever.  I have every confidence in the Minister and wish him the best of luck at the December meeting in Brussels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PhilipHogan" hpid="Mr. Hogan Mr. Hogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my colleagues and endorse the sentiments expressed in urging the Minister to ensure the plight of the lowland sheep producer is recognised in future price negotiations.  The Minister will have an opportunity at the meeting in December to use the number one priority he expressed at various farm Council meetings during the last few months and get some respite for the lowland sheep producer.  He deserves the support of farm organisations.</P>
      <P>Since coming to office he has sought a top up premium to be paid at the market price in any one member state when it dropped more than 10 per cent below the average EU price and an extension of the rural world premium.  He set those objectives as far back as last May. We need a decision one way or the other now and I hope the Minister will not suffer the lapse of memory from which others suffered but will deliver the goods for the sheep producer.</P>

      <P>The Minister for <Col N="2328" /> Agriculture, Food and Forestry set himself two targets when he was assigned the ministry of agriculture: he wanted to make the Department farmer friendly and he committed himself to being the farmers' representative.  I challenge any Opposition Deputy to debate that he has not lived up to those commitments.</P>
      <P>This debate could have been fruitful and useful but the tone of the Opposition sent a signal to Brussels that the crisis in sheep farming was caused by the Minister.  The Opposition would have done a good job for sheep farmers if it sent a signal to Brussels expressing its deep concern.  That would have strengthened the hand of the Minister at the negotiating table.  I have full confidence in the Minister.  He will debate the matter strenuously with a deep sense of sincerity and commitment since the sheep industry must be rescued.  He demonstrated that in the summer when the steps he took stabilised the price of sheep.  I have no doubt that the future of sheep farmers is in excellent hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Fianna Fáil for raising this issue.  Agriculture has not always been afforded the importance it deserves in the House.  Sheep farmers especially have suffered not only throughout this year but in recent ones.</P>
      <P>I found it strange that the main Fianna Fáil speakers tried to put across the case last evening that the problems of sheep farmers, and of farmers generally, had occurred as the present Minister assumed office.  I might remind them that not until some lambs entered Agriculture House did the Minister's predecessor realise how serious was the then crisis.  I would not have agreed with such action but it was a indication of the farmer's frustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present disastrous position possibly has its roots in decisions taken in Brussels in 1989.  Obviously, it had become more difficult to get a sympathetic hearing from the European Parliament or the Commission to have changes in our favour implemented. Nonetheless, I have no doubt that the present Minister will deliver the goods <Col N="2329" /> if at all possible and it will not be his fault if that is not the case.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the frustration of sheep farmers, particularly in recent days, when the Minister did not give a categoric assurance that he would be able to guarantee the top-up they require. However it is better that the Minister and Government commit themselves to make the best possible efforts on our behalf in Brussels.  I was a junior spokesperson on agriculture when in Opposition, and heard the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Joe Walsh, guarantee on 24 February 1994 that our pig farmers would be catered for immediately.  We all know that, when he left office, nothing had happened.</P>
    <P>I also remember that when I was in Opposition the port at Greenore was closed.  I should like to avail of the opportunity of thanking the present occupant of the Chair for support in bringing this to the attention of the House.  It was through such support that we managed to have the port reopened. I do not wish to take from some achievements of the Minister's predecessor but the suggestion that the present Minister has been an absolute failure because he has been unable to deliver on the sheep package is unfair.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on overall marketing. I spent seven years when I was involved with the Irish Farmers Association as a member of a meat and livestock board.  There were then many opportunities but there was a dearth of Government funds.</P>
    <P>Our budget on that statutory body was cut from £700,000 annually to £300,000.  Did that indicate a commitment to the marketing of beef and lamb?  The Minister has allocated millions of pounds to An Bord Bia to promote our food industry and that is to be continued in 1996.  That investment will bear fruit.  However, there is an onus on producers although they may not have had sufficient support from the Department in the past.  I endeavoured to promote producer groups and I am proud to inform the House that one such group which is very active in County <Col N="2330" /> Monaghan dealt with in the region of 15,000 to 20,000 lambs in the past 12 months and obtained somewhat better prices for them.</P>
    <P>There is need for much greater commitment on the part of the Department to promote the establishment of more properly organised groups thereby ensuring better quality lamb reaches the marketplace.  I am disappointed that the meat industry has not done very much to encourage such groups.  It appears they are interested only in getting lambs to their factories, regardless of price, so long as they make a profit.  There is need to ensure production of better quality lambs and that we do not lose out on early production thereby maintaining our position in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>I recommend we continue to support the Minister who has done a tremendous job within a few months in implementing the charter of rights for farmers which has benefited sheep farmers and others.  Applications for headage payments and so on are being dealt with more expeditiously.  I assure all farmers that the Fine Gael backbenchers will ensure the Minister does everything possible to obtain a European Union commitment to better structural support for them.</P>

      <P>The Minister reminds me of one of his predecessors, former Minister Mark Clinton, a man who brought home the bacon.  He is seen as a capable negotiator, the type of Minister we want representing our farmers, a person who understands his brief, who can take on the European Union, debate the relevant issues and get his points across. With him at the helm sheep farmers, like all sectors of the farming community, can have every confidence that the problems confronting them will be resolved.</P>
      <P>The Minister inherited the problem from the previous administration, a spillover of many of the ills from 1994. At that time no market could be found for hoggets and they were dumped on our market in the spring of this year thus depressing lamb prices.  The Minister took immediate action to rectify that position.</P>
      <P>The statistics quoted can be confusing but the Members who quoted them are not fooling anybody, certainly not visitors to the Public Gallery because they know who is representing them, that they have a Minister who will conduct business satisfactorily on their behalf. They told me so in Buswells Hotel today.  They are delighted they have a competent Minister who has a tremendous grasp of his brief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been in the livestock marketing business for many years, having worked with the Galway co-operative livestock marts and the private marts in County Meath.  I am aware of the many ups and downs that may occur in farm incomes &mdash; one year may be good and the next two may be bad &mdash; but there has been a serious decrease in income for many sheep <Col N="2333" /> farmers.  The IFA is a strong lobby group when it comes to farm incomes.</P>
      <P>Sheep farmers are experiencing very difficult times and I appeal to the Minister and the Government to assist them as quickly as possible.  Sheep farming incomes have fallen by 36 per cent or £13 per ewe.  Early lamb prices are down by almost £10 per head and mid-season lamb prices by almost £6 per head.  Over the last three or four years almost 5,700 flock owners have gone out of sheep production because of the high labour costs and small returns.  If the Minister is not prepared to assist sheep breeders now this trend will continue.</P>
      <P>Ewe numbers have decreased by 240,000 in recent years.  I understand the anxieties of sheep farmers but at the same time we must appreciate and develop our international trade.  I appeal to the Minister to make strong representations to his counterparts in Europe that sheep production in Ireland is only a small percentage of total EU production and, therefore, an overall calculation of prices to decide premia is unfair to a small producer like Ireland. Why should Irish milk producers, who only wet the bottom of the EU milk tank, have to comply with general EU reductions and new regulations?  As a result of the system of calculation Irish sheep farmers need a top-up premium of £8 per ewe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The County Meath sheep farmers are lowland producers.  They find themselves in a position in which they have little or no control over market conditions. The Minister's counterparts in Europe do not seem to take into account marketing management.  There is an urgent need for a change in the present EU rules regarding the date on which a lamb becomes a hogget.  The date this year was 18 April which meant that hoggets could not be sold until after that date or they would not qualify for the hogget subsidies.  As a result the marketing system we had has changed. The hoggets which would have been sold in January, February and March, as in previous years, now come on the market at the start of the early spring lamb <Col N="2334" /> season.  Prices for early spring lambs, therefore, reduce accordingly because of over supply at that time.</P>
    <P>We should go back to the old system whereby a lamb was identified as a hogget on 1 January each year.  This would allow the hoggets to be sold in January, February and March as usual and, therefore, not interfere with the early spring lamb trade.  The usual seasonal lamb trade in May, June and July would also be less affected by over supply.  It is obvious that this closing date interferes with our own trade and brings down lamb prices.  The EU may have it reasons for choosing the date of 18 April but changing it back to 1 January would not cost the EU any extra money as the sheep breeders can only fill their existing quotas.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Yates became Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry expectations were high. Within a few weeks, if one was to believe what one read in the newspapers, one might have believed agriculture's ills had been cured because the Minister put in train a PR effort the likes of which had not been seen before. Unfortunately, appearances seemed more important than substance and it may come as a surprise to many to see the present crisis in the sheep sector.</P>
      <P>A number of speakers have outlined the seriousness of the problem.  The IFA has listed its demands to right the present wrongs and Fianna Fáil supports those demands.  This is a very important industry which has unfortunately experienced a difficult year. Urgent attention must be given to the problem and assistance provided.  There is a serious lack of confidence among sheep farmers as a number of them have gone out of business over the last couple of years.  This cannot be allowed to continue. It is important that confidence be restored in the industry and that it receives proper attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In County Kildare, particularly on the Curragh, one can readily see the importance of sheep farming, related processing industries and the wool industry. <Col N="2335" /> Over the last ten years we have gone about building up the breeding flock but it has declined in the last 12 months. The Fine Gael Members express great confidence in the Minister going to Brussels and I hope that confidence is well-founded.  The serious problems have been outlined in this House and by the IFA, and I hope the Minister will take the necessary action to restore the confidence which is badly lacking in the sheep sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this subject. I have noticed that in respect of measures which were in train before Fianna Fáil left power, such as the extension of the disadvantaged areas, credit is claimed by the Government. However, when discussing those measures which might not have been taken before we left power but should have been taken by now blame is laid on the previous Government.  It is about time the Minister realised he has been in Government for almost a year and accepted the responsibility of Government. The Minister should be big enough to admit the work that was done before he took office and big enough to direct his attention to the problems that face him now which have not been dealt with.</P>
      <P>The problem we are discussing tonight has become acute so it could not have been dealt with before we left office.  The Minister will have to deliver. When this problem arose previously in 1992 the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry was able to have the problem dealt with in Europe.  We understand the Minister boasts of his relationship with the Agriculture Commissioner but if it is that good he should deliver on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sheep farming is indigenous.  The Minister has to ensure that families who depend on sheep farming are given a stable and adequate way of life.  It is the Minister's responsibility to ensure that a mechanism is put in place that will trigger a response when prices in Ireland <Col N="2336" /> drop beneath a certain level and that farmers will get automatic compensation.</P>
    <P>We have tended to concentrate on the problems of the lowland farmers but I will stress the needs of the hill farmers, whose problems are not being dealt with.  It might come as a surprise to the Minister to find out that the average price of lamb in Connemara is between £10 and £19 for uain fhireann or wethers and for uain bhaineann £25.  An average mountain ewe would yield 2 lbs. of wool and this sells for 35p per lb.  I have calculated that a farmer with 100 ewes has a gross annual income, including subsidies, before expenses are paid of approximately £4,360.  When the expenses are taken from that very little is left.  No wonder so many of our farmers have to rely on social welfare to supplement their income.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the speech of the Democratic Left Member.  I have a question that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and his colleague the Minister for Social Welfare failed to answer.  Will the Minister confirm whether farmers in receipt of unemployment assistance, who need that money just to survive, will be assessed on moneys received under the REPS scheme?  It is about time that the small farmers were given an unequivocal answer to that question.  The Minister said he was favourably disposed to them but being favourably disposed never put money in anybody's pocket. It is about time he persuaded his colleague in Government to make a decision on that matter.  If farmers are to be assessed on a pound for pound basis on their income from the REPS the Minister should admit that will be done.</P>
    <P>The Minister recently came bearing gifts for the west &mdash; I have a copy of the press release.</P>

      <P>Subsequently a meeting was held to which the farmers were invited and they attended.  The Minister's colleague &mdash; and fair play to him &mdash; also produced a very nice document. The Teagasc advisers were asked about the details of the scheme but they did not know how it would work.  They asked me to contact the Department and ask for the regulations but when I did so there was a problem &mdash; there were no regulations.  There is no scheme, it is a PR job.  Furthermore, when the Minister comes to draw up the regulations it might be a good idea to consult hill farmers on the realities of hill farming in the west.  They have questions to ask, for example, if they reduce their quota from 100 to 70 and take the money and the scheme comes to an end in five years' time they will have two years to again increase their herd to 100 but a hill farmer cannot do that.  The Minister may not realise that but the hill farmers do.  One cannot buy ewes and put them on a hill because they stray and the Minister has not ensured there is adequate fencing of our hills and effective division of commonage.  The Minister is not willing to provide the staff for that.  We want to see the small print of new schemes and ensure they are workable.</P>
      <P>The Minister has destroyed the REPS scheme because he will not make a decision on whether the income from it will be assessed as means for social welfare purposes and this scheme will be destroyed because there are no regulations for it.  All that glistens is not gold.  I call on the Minister to deliver on his promises and go to Europe to get the top-up premium.  If the Minister is successful we will stand behind him but if not we will rightly criticise him.  We are also looking for an extension of the rural premium to cover lowland farmers who have been very badly hit this year. A permanent mechanism needs to be put in place that will ensure that if a similar situation recurs there will be a mechanism to deal automatically with the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will give credit when the Minister <Col N="2338" /> delivers because, unlike him, we are big enough to give credit for achievement. We will not claim the credit for his achievements as he has been doing.  If he does not achieve this he will be held responsible.  Those who are trying to survive will know where the responsibility lies.</P>
    <P>I have raised another issue that the Minister has chosen to ignore, the case of a small farmer who returned from England to take up farming on the family holding.  His father had died prior to 1992.  He has a hill farm with commonage but the only thing one can do with the hills is put sheep on them.  He applied to the national reserve but was told he was too old at 43 years of age.  I made the point to officials that it is wrong to say that people are too old at 35.  I accept the rule existed before this Government took office but the Minister had a chance &mdash; which he did not take &mdash; to change it.</P>

      <P>The suggestion was that the Minister would change the criteria for 1996 and I have no doubt that if the Fianna Fáil Party had remained in power the Minister would have listened to my pleas, particularly for commonage farmers, and dealt with the issue.  The Minister chose not to deal with it.  It is a tragedy that someone who has returned to farm a small hill farm is deemed too old and is outside the criteria to be eligible for even a small ewe quota that will get him back to farming the traditional family holding.</P>

      <P>I thank Members on the Fianna Fáil benches for sharing their time with me.  We are all aware of the difficulties facing sheep producers in this country.  Those most severely affected are small farmers, many of whom are totally or mainly dependent on sheep for their income.  In many instances these farmers are working poor land and switching to alternative farm enterprises is not a realistic option. The sheep sector is in deep crisis.  It is <Col N="2339" /> not only producers who are seeing their profit margins fall and many are producing sheep only to sell them at a loss.</P>
      <P>To put the matter in context, prices for producers of early lambs are down this year by 15 per cent compared with 1994, and the total net margin per ewe is estimated to have fallen by one third in the same period.</P>
      <P>This crisis has been brewing for some considerable time.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry has been in office for almost a year now and has had plenty of time to acquaint himself with the developing situation.  The solution to it lies in Brussels and that is where he should exert himself.  Has he presented any practical proposals to resolve this crisis to the Council of Agriculture Ministers, or has he raised the matter in the Council at all?</P>
      <P>The demands made by Irish sheep producers can be comfortably met without any increase in the overall budget for the Common Agricultural Policy. Buoyant market conditions for grain and dairy commodities have relieved the pressure on the CAP budget and there was plenty to spare to accommodate the needs of our sheep farmers.</P>
      <P>The difficulties facing the sheep sector were highlighted only last week with the publication of the Farm Management Survey of 1994.  It showed the average income per acre for different types of farming enterprise.  For dairying the figure was £233; for tillage it was £130; for cattle it was £87; and for sheep it was just £80.  Since then, that figure is likely to have fallen even further, pushing the country's 48,000 sheep farmers to the brink of economic disaster.</P>
      <P>It was estimated last year that 92 per cent of sheep-farm incomes derived from direct headage and premium payments. With many sheep farmers expecting a loss, that figure could now have risen to 100 per cent.  The real question now is whether the EU will maintain this level of direct payments and continue to support the sector in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2340" /> Brussels has a responsibility to act in what, in effect, is a breakdown in the single European food market due to currency fluctuations.  Ireland's principal export market is France.  Last year, we shipped over 50,000 tonnes of sheepmeat to the French market, with a total export value of more than £104 million. France accounts for 80 per cent of our total exports in the sheepmeat sector.  It is a market which is becoming increasingly competitive, but our main threat comes from the British.  The weakness of sterling has helped British exporters to increase their shipments to France. During the first six months of this year, for instance, British exports to France increased by 6,000 tonnes, a rise of 10 per cent over the same period the previous year.</P>
    <P>An Board Bia is now forecasting that for 1995 as a whole, British exports to France will be up by about 8 per cent on 1994 levels.  These increased British shipments are effectively crowding out Irish produce and forcing down market returns for Irish producers.</P>
    <P>The fall in Irish exports to France in the current year has been dramatic.  Figures from the Central Statistics Office show that in the first quarter of 1995 Irish sheepmeat exports to the French market were down by 44 per cent in volume terms and 42 per cent in value terms compared with the first three months of 1994.  This represents a catastrophic decline in our single most important export market.</P>
    <P>Naturally enough, the current situation has also affected the ability of Irish exporters to sell into the British market. In 1993 we sold more than £11 million worth of sheepmeat into Britain; last year, that figure had halved to just £5.5 million.  The currency disadvantage is especially important as Britain is the largest producer of sheepmeat in Europe.  British output is greater than the combined production of the second and third largest producers &mdash; Spain and France.  It is more than four times greater than Ireland's annual output.</P>
    <P>The value of sterling is clearly having a devastating impact on our ability to <Col N="2341" /> compete on equal terms on the French market and in European markets generally. Accordingly, the Government should press for compensation for Irish producers who are being disadvantaged by sterling's weakness.  It is up to the Minister to stress to his colleagues on the European Council the importance of sheep-farming to the economy. Although Ireland has only 1 per cent of the EU population we account for more than 8 per cent of sheepmeat production.</P>
    <P>Solving the short-term problem is one thing, but we also have to look at the longer term.  Irish sheep numbers have exploded over the last ten years in response to CAP incentives.  Total sheep numbers have risen from 4.1 million in 1984 to 8.4 million in 1994.  We have to ask ourselves if Ireland can support a sheep population of this size on a long-term basis.</P>
    <P>The present regime has created an artificial economy in which, in some cases, sheep are being bred purely to qualify for the premium and headage payments available, without taking any congnisance of prevailing market conditions. This explosion in sheep numbers could not have taken place without having some effect on the natural environment. Overgrazing has done considerable damage to upland areas, particularly in the west.  Experts have stated that it could take several generations to remedy the damage done. These are areas with a heavy dependence on tourism and where tourism related projects offer major potential for future economic development.  It is vitally important that we balance the respective needs of agriculture and tourism.</P>
    <P>We must also be aware that things are changing in Europe and on the world food market.  Mr. Chris Haskins, the head of Northern Foods and one of the most important figures in the food processing industry on these islands, spoke at a conference in Dublin last week.  He made it clear that GATT reform would lead to a free world market in food even though this might damage the prices <Col N="2342" /> achieved by farmers.  He felt the move to free trade was inevitable.</P>
    <P>As he is one of the key figures in the European food industry, the view expressed by Mr. Haskins cannot be ignored.  If, as he says, Europe is heading for a market economy in food, then that will have consequences of the utmost importance not just for our sheepmeat sector, but for every aspect of the food industry.  We need to start debating these issues now, and the Minister should take the lead in this matter. Political developments will propel this issue to the top of the agenda in any event.</P>
    <P>Plans are already under way to expand the European Union eastwards. Enlargement of the Union could bring in as many as ten new states, stretching the EU from the Baltic to the Balkans, Some of these countries such as Poland and Hungary have substantial food-production and food-exporting industries. The cost of maintaining the present array of price supports would rise dramatically in the wake of enlargement. For the people who have to pick up the bill&mdash;the taxpayers of Germany who fund some four fifths of the EU budget&mdash;this is not an attractive prospect. All the indications are that enlargement is likely to accelerate moves towards a more market-based pricing system for all agricultural produce, including sheepmeat.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a major sea change in European agricultural policy, it is important that we get our act together now.  What kind of regime will replace the present one?  What transition arrangements will apply?  I would be interested to know what views on this subject our Minister for Agriculture Food and Forestry is putting to his European counterparts, or is he adopting a complacent attitude and assuming the present regime will continue forever? Other countries have already made the transition from farm supports to the free market, New Zealand being a notable example.  If this process is not properly managed and properly prepared for, we could be headed for <Col N="2343" /> trouble.  We receive about £1,400 million in agricultural supports of one kind or another from the European Union every year.  This is a huge sum for an economy the size of ours and is roughly equal to 15 per cent of current Government spending on supply services.  The loss of this huge level of financial support would have dramatic consequences for the economy, but we are carrying on as if this money was guaranteed to us for a long time.  I am sure it is not.</P>
    <P>The Council of Agriculture Ministers will meet in Spain on 11 and 12 April next.  The Minister should come out of that meeting with a package of measures designed to alleviate the hardship currently experienced by this country's hard-pressed sheep producers.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Yates has enjoyed something of an extended honeymoon with the farming organisations during his tenure of office to date.  If he fails to deliver the goods next month, I can assure him that his honeymoon will be well and truly over.</P>

      <P>During the debate we witnessed hysteria on the Opposition benches about the extent of the problem in the sheep industry, but in the real world that attitude does not solve anything. Members on both sides agree that the problem centres around spring lambs which were mainly produced in high cost production systems and came on the market when prices were disappointing. It is this group in particular that has suffered the most severe income losses.  During the summer market prices were sustained at a constant level, although below last year's price level.  By September the market began to pick up and in the past six weeks prices have been approximately 5 per cent above those of 1994.  Provided they hold until the end of the year &mdash; the outlook is good &mdash; a substantial number of sheep sold this year will have been sold at prices better than those that obtained last year.  This is not to understate the <Col N="2344" /> extent of the problem but merely to put it in context.</P>
      <P>The Opposition motion does not reflect reality because the truth is that the matter has been tackled head on and action taken.  The accusation of indifference or lack of action is a complete misstatement of the facts.  My Department's response to the serious market position was quick and effective and no effort was spared to find solutions.  The European Commission was quickly persuaded to introduce an aid for private storage scheme for Ireland by the end of April, a practical measure to take the overhang of hoggets off the market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It quickly resolved that problem.</P>
      <P>Prior to this, having investigated the ewe premium payment system, the Minister submitted a memorandum to Commissioner Fischler setting out clearly Ireland's problem and seeking compensation for our sheep farmers for the inadequate support provided by the ewe premium.  At every opportunity we highlighted the absence of price convergence under the current system and the need to redress the imbalance arising from this.  In July, at the Minister's request, the Commission launched a further aid for private storage scheme that put strength into the market at a crucial time.</P>
      <P>The value of these APS measures has been fully recognised and acknowledged by the industry and that is a matter of record.  Members of the Opposition have attempted to denigrate the effectiveness of those measures.  What would have happened if they had not been taken?  The answer is clear.  The position would have been considerably more difficult.  Contrary to what has been said, the APS measures did help prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the June Council of Ministers a key commitment was secured that the operation and level of ewe premium would be reviewed.  This commitment, secured after considerable effort, is the <Col N="2345" /> basis on which current negotiations are focused.  It was also due to these demands that the earliest ever payment of the first two advances of the ewe premium was made.  Important adjustments have been made to retention periods under the ewe premium scheme which will help the more orderly selling of lambs next year.</P>
    <P>The problems of Irish sheep producers have been firmly kept on the negotiating table.  I can say with confidence that every Minister with responsibility for agriculture in the European Union as well as the European Commission is fully conversant with the difficulties in the Irish sheep market and we will not rest until this effort has delivered tangible results.</P>

      <P>Because of the budgetary position in Brussels we were always aware that there was no scope for special concessions until the 1996 budgetary year which began in November and that a solution is not likely until the December Council meeting. Any solution depends on the Commission coming forward with a proposal and it receiving sufficient support at the Council of Ministers.  This is why so much effort has been devoted to convincing the Commission and individual EU Ministers of the merits of our case.</P>
      <P>Apart from looking to Europe we must see what we can do to improve the position at home.  A working classification system that rewards the producer for quality is crucial to the improvement of the standard of Irish lamb production. It is essential that it is workable and effective.  A voluntary scheme would stand a better chance of being effective.  There is no question of surrendering to vested interests, as was alleged.  We are making substantial progress on this issue.  The intention is that the carcass classification will be standard practice in the industry by 1 January next.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I came to listen to the debate, not to contribute because there is a sufficient number of Fianna Fáil Members who wish to speak.  However, I requested permission to speak for two minutes because I am appalled at the Government's complacency about this crisis.  I expected at least to hear an admission that there is a crisis and an expression of concern for farming families who depend on the sheep industry and have suffered greatly in recent times.  It has become normal practice for the Government to wheel in members of the Democratic Left.  Government members smiled gloriously as Deputy Lynch denigrated the farming community, expressed concern that subsidies were not slashed and promoted consumer resistance to subsidies.  I wish to put one question to Deputy Lynch and members of that wing of the Government who lack knowledge of, and do not care about, the current crisis in the sheep industry, and they are supported by other Government members in this regard.  If the subsidies are so worth while and farmers are doing so well, why are so many of them getting out of farming?  There is no other business that people are leaving so fast.  Why do farmers find it difficult to encourage their sons or daughters to follow them in farming?  When a genuine motion is put down by the Fianna Fáil Party to deal with this crisis it is a shame that it should meet such complacency and unadulterated ignorance about the current problem in the sheep industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make one plea and it is not about public relations, politics or the <Col N="2347" /> Minister of State's solution which is so long-term that farmers will have forgotten they were ever in the sheep business by the time they benefit from it.</P>

      <P>We make no apology for raising this issue.  It is disappointing that Government members should indicate that we should not have tabled this motion.  Where have they been for the past six months?  This matter is of major concern to all sheep farmers and members of the Government know that.</P>
      <P>We want to strengthen the Minister's hand when he goes to Brussels and to encourage a change in attitude.  Fianna Fáil will support any attempt to improve the lot of sheep farmers.  The former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, once remarked that the way to become a success in politics is to be in the right place at the right time.  By any standards, the Minister, Deputy Yates, is a very lucky politician.  No Minister for Agriculture in modern times took up office with a better sense of timing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is rich testament to his predecessors that virtually all the Minister had to do in 11 months in office was travel around the country announcing good news, with his powerful media machine making more noise on the roads than the old threshing mill.  Years of Fianna Fáil Government have left Irish agriculture in the best state it has been in years.  The generally healthy state of the agriculture industry results from Fianna Fáil courage in Government to face the issues without fear of sectional interests. Fianna Fáil Ministers went to Brussels with vision and courage.  It seems the Minister, Deputy Yates, is determined <Col N="2348" /> to rest on the laurels so hard won over seven years by successive Fianna Fáil Ministers.</P>
    <P>I spoke already about the buoyancy in Irish agriculture, which is general but not absolute.  There is one serious exception, the sheep sector.  Recently the Minister has been busy playing down the extent of the problem.  A meeting organised by the IFA recently in Enniscorthy was attended by about 400 sheep farmers.  I compliment the IFA and ICMSA for the pressure they have applied on all of us.  On that night all we heard were excuses for the nondelivery of their request.  Today in Buswells I heard the same old line.  I do not know whether it was evident to the Minister or whether it was out of respect that the people at today's meeting did not tell him that there is much disappointment, disillusionment and anger about his defeatist attitude.</P>
    <P>The Minister's spin doctors have been pouring cold water on the fading hopes of him bringing home a desperately needed solution from the Council of Ministers' meeting on 11-12 December. When he came into office the Minister identified the crisis in the sheep sector as his number one priority, and rightly so, given the excellent conditions in other sectors and having experienced the best weather in years.  Not only was the sheep sector his most important problem; it was his only major problem. In the cereal sector there were tremendous yields of sugar beet and in the dairy sector there were good yields and good prices.  As the Minister said last night, pig prices are cyclical, and he came into office just as they increased. It is important to put the crisis in context in terms of the Minister's agenda. In 1995, apart from claiming credit for the achievements of his predecessors, the Minister had little else to do.  The bottom line is that doing something about the crisis in the sheep sector was not an easy photo opportunity and therefore nothing was done.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil put this very important issue on the top of its agenda but the Government ignores it.  When opening <Col N="2349" /> the debate on the Fianna Fáil motion our party spokesman, Deputy Cowen, made a persuasive case on why intervention in the sheep sector is necessary. The measures that must be taken are well known and were put to us at today's meeting as well as in the recent past.  Sheep farmers and Fianna Fáil demand the extension of the rural world premium to non-disadvantaged areas. Just as important is the £8 top-up needed on the present premium.  Fianna Fáil is not asking the Minister to do anything that it did not do in power.  In 1992 Fianna Fáil in office delivered the ewe premium top-up when it was desperately needed.</P>
    <P>I wish to set out what is being requested.  On the rural world premium, of a national flock of 4.75 million, 74 per cent are in disadvantaged areas.  The extension of the premium to the remaining 26 per cent of the flock or 1.2 million ewes, would cost £6.6 million.  This would surely be a small price to get our lowland producers out of the present abyss &mdash; that is no exaggeration of the depths of the crisis.  The number of sheep farmers leaving the land is unbelievable and very unsatisfactory and the number of people who have lost jobs as a result, or possibly will lose them, must be of great concern.</P>
    <P>I was very interested to hear Deputy Lynch attacking the farming community, as has been done many times in the past by Democratic Left.  Does she represent the working class?  Does she agree that a fall in sheep numbers will result in a reduction in the number of workers in factories?  I was disappointed with the attitude particularly of the Fine Gael Party &mdash; they sneered and laughed &mdash; to Deputy Lynch's contribution.  If they walk through the same lobby this evening as Democratic Left, shame on them.  If they have any respect for our biggest industry now is the time to show it.  I call on them to dissociate themselves from the remarks of Deputy <Col N="2350" /> Lynch and her colleagues.  I am sure the people of Galway will be very interested in Deputy Browne's support for that party.</P>

      <P>In 1995 40 per cent of early lambs were sold at a loss.  If the Minister is in any doubt about that, he should talk to his neighbours in the constituency of Wexford.  The position of our sheep farmers is desperate.  A conference was held in Wexford in the summer at which many promises were made.  The big machine rolled in and aid for private storage was promised, but I have yet to hear anyone in the farming community or the industry say that was a success.</P>
      <P>To put the total package requested into context, both elements add up to £44 million.  The total EU sheep budget is approximately £2 billion.  Irish farmers are effectively looking for the crumbs from the rich man's table.  I hope the Minister's statement of last night and detail of his attitude do not reach Brussels before he does.  I plead with him to visit, between now and the Brussels meeting, all the agriculture Ministers in their own capitals to seek their support.  He said he does not have their support; the way to get it is to visit each one of them on their home ground. That must be done before the Minister attends the next Council of Ministers meeting.  I repeat that Fianna Fáil will support any attempt to improve the lot of sheep farmers.  This is the best case ever presented in that regard.  The Minister should believe in the cause and go out with all guns blazing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity to raise a matter that is of fundamental importance to us in Cork. There is incontrovertible proof of major gaps in the obstetric services in Cork which could lead and may have led to infant deaths.  One specialist may be on duty serving two maternity hospitals in the city and in the event of complications arising in both hospitals simultaneously the patients involved could be left without vital life-saving specialist services.  No Minister for Health can allow such a serious risk to infants and mothers in public maternity hospitals in Cork.  Is not the normal stress which is experienced by expectant mothers before childbirth sufficient without adding to it?</P>
      <P>The Minister will also be aware of the concern openly expressed by obstetricians in Cork about the serious danger to life.  The position is so serious that obstetricians, gynaecologists and paediatricians made Oireachtas Members aware of the difficulties at a specially convened meeting under the auspices of the Southern Health Board where they outlined the enormous consequences if this situation is allowed to continue.</P>
      <P>There are approximately 700 admissions annually of women who miscarry. We are all aware of the trauma, the sense of loss and the depression suffered by those women.  The situation is exacerbated when mothers who have experienced the great joy of having a healthy baby are put beside a mother who is experiencing great sorrow and grief at having lost a baby.  The Minister will clearly understand that this heightens the sense of loss experienced by a woman who has had a miscarriage or stillbirth.  That is totally unsatisfactory and it is a practice known to occur in other health board hospitals.</P>
      <P>There are practical difficulties in the provision of suitable accommodation because of the physical layout of both St. Finbar's and Erinville Hospitals. While every effort is made to meet the concerns of women in this position, it is generally not possible to accommodate separately expectant mothers and women who have miscarried.</P>
      <P>In the past, the Minister indicated to the Southern Health Board, and in response to me on a previous occasion when I put down this question, that he required the agreement of the various hospitals in Cork.  The Minister is aware that agreement has now been reached to locate the obstetrics unit in the grounds of Cork University Hospital. We must have immediate confirmation from the Minister that he will approve the appointment of a design team.  I realise the Minister is seeking additional information but the appointment of a design team indicates that we can proceed immediately with this project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We urgently request the Minister to also make interim arrangements to <Col N="2355" /> improve the service being provided to ensure that, for example, specialist services for maternity patients are available in Cork.  I ask the Minister to proceed as quickly as possible with the proposals to provide this particular service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Keeffe for sharing his time with me on this important matter.  The Minister is familiar with the situation in Cork. For a number of years it was not clear where the obstetrics services would be located in Cork.  The position has now been clarified but some consultants providing maternity services in the area continue to be concerned.  They called the various public representatives to a meeting recently to express their concern about being unable to provide facilities to which women are entitled because of the fragmentation of the services.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to move immediately to allow planning and development proceed as quickly as possible so that these facilities can be provided at Cork University Hospital.  I assure the Minister there is genuine concern about this in Cork.  Women do not have the facilities to which they are entitled.  If they become ill, doctors in another location cannot get across the city in an emergency and the Minister will agree that is unsatisfactory.  I hope the Minister has some positive news for us tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Deputies, particularly Cork Deputies, will be aware that one of my first engagements when I became Minister for Health was to visit the Mercy Hospital in Cork.  On that occasion, I was told the maternity facilities in Cork were a cause for concern.  I indicated then that I would like to see the interested parties working out an agreed proposal.  Earlier this year I formally requested the agencies in Cork to enter into round table consultations to <Col N="2356" /> agree on a set of proposals on the amalgamation of the maternity and neo-natal services in Cork.</P>
      <P>I was pleased, therefore, to learn recently that consensus has been reached between those agencies to amalgamate the services on the Cork University Hospital site.  I welcome that decision and reiterate my commitment to putting in place the appropriate resources to support it.  It is understood by all parties concerned that this is a long-term solution which will now require detailed planning and examination by the Southern Health Board, in close consultation with the Department. This process is already under way in full co-operation with officials in my Department.</P>
      <P>In the interm, the board is considering a number of proposals to address the immediate staffing and safety concerns of the current fragmented service. I look forward to receiving further details of those interim proposals.  Once I have received a full report from the board I will be in a position to proceed with the necessary steps for the development of the maternity and neo-natal services in Cork.</P>
      <P>My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, has asked me to meet a delegation of all Oireachtas Members in the Cork and Kerry constituencies.  I am making arrangements to do that and I invite the two Deputies here tonight, and all the Cork and Kerry Deputies, to attend that meeting because the initial impetus to the solution of this longstanding problem came from the Cork and Kerry Deputies from all parties.  I would like to hear the views of the elected Members before we proceed to act on the request made tonight.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Office of Director of Public Prosecutions.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me raise this important matter on the Adjournment.  Recent reports on the failure of the Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute in a number of <Col N="2357" /> high profile cases has caused great public unease.  For example, the doctor at the centre of the Drogheda hospital sex scandal was reportedly the subject of a number of complaints which went to the DPP's office but did not result in a prosecution.</P>
      <P>We have also seen reports recently of a number of horrendous child sexual abuse cases where a conviction would probably have been achieved much earlier had the DPP's office been prepared to prosecute on foot of earlier complaints. The public unease surrounding the DPP's decisions in these cases is largely due to the fact that the DPP's decision was taken in secret and he was not answerable to anybody.</P>
      <P>The DPP is statutorily independent in the exercise of his functions.  That has been taken to mean that he can take decisions in secret and not be accountable to anybody for those decisions. That is a false conclusion.  Independence and accountability are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they are complementary.</P>
      <P>The accountability deficit in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is all the more remarkable when set against international comparisons. All other common law jurisdictions provide for a system of prosecutorial accountability.  In these other jurisdictions, the public prosecutor is accountable either to a parliamentary, judicial or administrative forum.</P>
      <P>This secretive, unaccountable decision-making process in the Irish DPP's office must be abandoned.  The Government should allow for a proper system of judicial review of decisions of the DPP.  I say that because the Supreme Court abdicated all responsibility in this matter in a decision in 1986. In addition, the Government should provide a mechanism whereby the DPP should be forced to explain his decision, in certain but not all circumstances, to prosecute or, more likely, not to prosecute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Transparency of procedures is an essential prerequisite for full public confidence in the administration of justice. <Col N="2358" /> Nobody would suggest, for example, that the Taoiseach or his Ministers should be anything other than independent in the discharge of their functions, yet it could not be reasonably argued that this means they should not be accountable to the Dáil for the exercise of those functions.  There is nothing inconsistent in saying that a person may reach an independent decision but that he or she must then be prepared to justify that decision to another forum.  This will not compromise the independent nature of the decision-making process; it will merely ensure that the decision has been reached in a proper and fair manner and will be seen to have been so reached.</P>
    <P>It is of paramount importance in a democracy that the public should have full confidence in the administration of justice.  Secrecy, lack of openness and lack of accountability in the decision-making process in the Office of the DPP have inevitably brought about a situation where public confidence in that office has been badly shaken.  That is a potentially catastrophic development. Procedures to redress this fundamental accountability deficit at the heart of the criminal prosecution system are long overdue.  I ask the Minister to accept that proposition and to outline the Government's proposals for dealing with the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie) Austin Currie">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter which has been the subject of recent discussions inside and outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions was established by the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, the main purpose of which was to ensure that decisions in relation to criminal prosecutions would be taken by a completely independent DPP who would not be subject to control or supervision by any other person or body.  Accordingly, section 2 of the 1974 <Col N="2359" /> Act specifically provides that the DPP shall be independent in the performance of his functions.</P>
    <P>Deputies may be aware that the 1974 Act also provides that the Attorney General and the DPP shall consult together from time to time in relation to matters pertaining to the functions of the DPP.  However, it should be made clear that this does not entitle the Attorney General to override a decision of the DPP in a particular case or to instruct the DPP to initiate, or not to initiate, a prosecution.</P>
    <P>Particular concern has been expressed about the fact that the DPP has decided not to institute criminal proceedings in certain cases where a considerable delay has elapsed since the alleged criminal conduct.  In that context the Minister has been assured that every case referred to the DPP is considered on an individual basis with reference to its specific facts and to the sufficiency of legally admissible evidence available in the light of the requirements of our criminal and constitutional law and, in particular, to the considerable corpus of case law in the High and Supreme Courts on the subject of delay, lapse of time and the constitutional right of an accused to a trial with reasonable expedition.  There is no question of a policy decision having been taken not to prosecute offences that may have occurred many years ago.  Deputies will appreciate that, for example, where a lengthy period has elapsed it could be very difficult for a person to produce evidence to rebut a criminal charge.</P>
    <P>The question of giving reasons for decisions not to prosecute is one of the points that has frequently been raised. The DPP has indicated that his general refusal to embark on that course is not based on any reluctance on his part to be accountable for his decisions but on the fact that a policy of giving reasons would inevitably mean serious damage to the reputations of individuals in many cases.  This is the approach that had been adopted by successive Attorneys General who, before the appointment of <Col N="2360" /> the DPP, discharged the functions now discharged by him.</P>
    <P>The functions of the DPP and his office were discussed in the House in supplementaries to questions to the Taoiseach on 24 October 1995, Official Report, Volume 457, columns 919 to 923.  On that occasion, the Taoiseach made it clear it was essential that the independence of the DPP should be preserved.  The Minister believes that this view would be shared by all Members of the House.  The question of finding a satisfactory mechanism whereby additional information concerning decisions of the DPP could be made available without doing an injustice to individuals is a difficult and complex one and it will undoubtedly be further explored.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment and the Minister of State for being present.</P>
      <P>The Programme for Government agreed between the three Government parties approximately one year ago gave a broad commitment to a fundamental reform of the court system from District to Supreme Court level and the modernisation of the criminal justice code to take account of new methods of information gathering, judicial skills, use of video and audio equipment etc.  I acknowledge the progress made in these areas during the past year but it is fair to say that any of the unacceptable delays in the civil and criminal courts have been a matter of discussion and deliberation by way of reports and debates inside and outside the House for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The absence of firm statistics, or doubts about the statistics which have been published, is totally unacceptable during these days of modern technology. When this matter was raised previously by Deputies on all sides of the House the Ministers for Justice of the day gave a stock reply to the effect that the cost of providing these basic <Col N="2361" /> crime statistics and information on them would be excessive.  In the context of the need for a root and branch reform of our criminal justice system this reply is bizarre.  In recent years there have been great advances in the House in the area of information technology and it is difficult to understand why a procedure has not been put in place in the criminal justice system, which could allow for the compilation of statistics and analysis of them without the Minister saying that the cost involved would be excessive.  If reform of the type needed is to be carried out then we must start from a baseline and I cannot think of any more important baseline than the provision of basic statistical information.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and the Minister of State will agree that the type of statistics to which I am referring are essential for the proper administration and development of the criminal justice system.  Society has charged us with the responsibility of ensuring that we have an efficient criminal justice system.  A strategic information technology plan must be developed and put in place within the criminal justice system to allow for the compilation of these essential statistics and facts.  We will not be able to achieve the necessary reform of the criminal justice system without this basic information.  It should be possible for elected Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and interested groups such as the Probation and Welfare Service, the Garda Síochána and other bodies involved in the administration of justice to tap in on a daily and ongoing basis to up-to-date and accurate statistics which, unfortunately, are not available at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this important matter.  On a previous occassion in the House the Minister indicated her dissatisfaction with the procedures in place within the criminal justice system for the compilation of statistics.  She has always acknowledged that there is a real need for a more sophisticated and informative statistical system in this area as a <Col N="2362" /> whole.  As the Deputy rightly indicated, the best way of achieving such a system is through the use of information technology. In this regard the Minister is carrying out a major expansion in the use of information technology in the Department of Justice, the Garda, the prisons and the courts.</P>
      <P>A Garda Research Unit was established in 1994 to contribute to the objectives of the Garda Síochána by carrying out police related research, by supporting research of others and by making research findings widely available.  The unit is manned by three lay researchers and three members of the Garda Síochána and carries out research in a number of areas including crime and criminology, Garda management and development and the changing role of the Garda Síochána in society.  This unit has the Minister's full support and it plays a vital role, through the projects it carries out and the statistics which it makes available, in the efficient management and future development of the Garda.</P>
      <P>The prison record system which has now been in place for a number of years is also under review to ensure that it will, in the future, be able to compile, collate and make available statistics relevant to the prison system.  As soon as the system in place has been fully reviewed it will be expanded and updated as necessary to allow for the provision of meaningful statistics quickly and easily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the courts, the Minister announced on Monday the establishment of a working group on a courts commission with terms of reference which specifically asked it to review, among other things, the information technology in place in the courts.  The use of information technology has developed at different rates over the years in the various courts and while some progress has been made in the District and High Courts very little progress has been made in implementing an information technology system in the Circuit Court.  A committee comprised of County Registrars and officials from <Col N="2363" /> the Department is conducting a feasibility study on the computerisation of all aspects of the work of Circuit Court offices.</P>
    <P>It is not simply a matter of producing more and more statistics.  Of critical importance is the quality of the statistics produced and the requirement that everybody using the available statistics should be clear as to what is involved. Let me mention two examples &mdash; one in the area of the courts and the other in the prisons.</P>
    <P>Court statistics, by and large, are kept primarily for the purpose of measuring the volume of business in the court, the extent of the arrears, etc.  These are the figures given by Justice Ministers in reply to questions and so on, but they may not give the actual figure the researcher is looking for.  In the case of judicial separations, to take an example of one statistic, if one looks at the total figures given by Circuit Court offices over the years since the 1989 Act came into force one comes up with a figure of about 11,000.  The Minister has given these court statistics many times which are a measure of the actual volume of business before the courts year by year, but if one wants to isolate the number of new cases year by year, to the exclusion of cases already going through various stages of the courts process, the figure is in the 6,000-7,000 range.</P>
    <P>In the case of prisons, there tends to be ongoing misunderstanding of various statistics.  About 10,500 people are committed to prison each year, but the daily average prison population is at or about 2,000.  The number of people committed to prison for failure to pay their debts or pay fines is about 2,000 per year whereas the number in custody at any one time is about 20.  My point is that the quality of the statistics produced is crucial, as is the need for everybody who has occasion to use statistics to know what exactly is represented by the various figures produced.</P>
    <P>It will take time and expertise to reach the stage where we have an <Col N="2364" /> adequate set of criminal justice statistics, but it will be time and expertise well spent.  The Minister is determined to secure progress in this matter in any way she can.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Designated Areas Reclassification.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Prior to the announcement of the areas to be reclassified as more severely handicapped it was expected that the entire constituency of Cavan-Monaghan would be reclassified. While County Cavan was so classified only 73.1 per cent of County Monaghan was granted this status.  This is hard to understand.  The comparable figure for County Longford is 100 per cent, 94 per cent for County Clare and 86 per cent for County Kerry.</P>
      <P>This announcement was the source of much frustration and anger.  In common with other Oireachtas Members, I have been inundated with telephone calls during the past week or so.  My problems were compounded by the fact that I only received from the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry ten of the 14 pages listing the townlands to be reclassified.  I duly forwarded these pages to the secretaries of the various cumann who wanted to know why I had sent incomplete information.  I have now received the full list, ten days after the announcement was made, which I will forward to them with a letter of apology.</P>
      <P>The problem in County Monaghan is that while some of the best land has been reclassified some of the worst land has not.  Let me give one example.  In the 1960s three parishes were selected for inclusion in a pilot scheme.  It was accepted by agricultural officers at the time that the soil in the area of land stretching from Clontibret to Aghabog was shallow, yet it has not been reclassified. I ask the Minister to put an appeal structure in place as small farmers in particular have a legitimate right to have their farms included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In reply to a question tabled by me on 11 October the Minister stated that <Col N="2365" /> the Government made submissions to the EU Commission on the extension of disadvantaged areas and the reclassification of certain areas from less severely handicapped to more severely handicapped status in November 1993 and October 1994; that the Commission asked for clarification of some aspects of the submissions and additional information to assist it in its examination of the proposals; that the Government's response was transmitted to the Commission in April 1995 and that a number of meetings have since taken place. What was the purpose of these meetings?</P>
    <P>There are 6,500 herd owners within the country where the average farm size is 40 acres.  In 1950 about two-thirds of farmers supplied milk, but this figure has since been reduced to one-third or less than 2,000.  Two-thirds of these are entirely dependent on income from dry stock and suckler cows.</P>
    <P>There was much discontent following the publication of the results of the 1989 review, so much so that I and other members of my party conducted our own study of DEDs as did the IFA.  I asked the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry to compare the fact sheets compiled by its agricultural officers with those produced by us, but this was not acceptable.</P>
    <P>In 1991 when the appeals panel was established &mdash; it comprised representatives of the farm bodies &mdash; the criteria were broadened to include notional farm income, etc.  It should have been brought in.  When it was set up I wrote to Mr. Liam Conlon, the secretary, as follows:</P>
    <P>In 1993 the economic and social committee of the European Communities visited the Border areas and in a subsequent report recommended that all of County Monaghan should be designated as severly handicapped. [I sent him a copy of the report].  The British-Irish Interparliamentary Body at its meeting in February 1990 in a discussion on the need for infrastructural development in Border areas, <Col N="2366" /> recommended that the criteria for qualification should be revised... I also request that your committee contact Teagasc, which has reports of the result of the pilot scheme carried out in the north-west Monaghan area in the 1960s, none of which were ever designated as severly handicapped.  I also enclose a copy of a report from the North-Eastern Regional Development Organisation related to land quality.</P>
    <P>That was definite information and I do not want the Minister to speak about criteria.  We have clear, irrefutable evidence that a wrong has been done to small farmers in that area.  I made the same plea when my party was in power but at that time its hands were tied.  On this occasion the base has been broadened and I thought the area should have been included.  I appeal to the Minister to set up the mechanism I suggest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand and sympathise with the Deputy's disappointment.  I have similar difficulties in my county and I am reminded of them every day. It is unfortunate that the then Minister did not consult Deputy Leonard when he sent the proposals to Brussels in September 1984 because the entire proposal was accepted.  To answer the Deputy's question, the difficulty was with the extension of disadvantaged areas.  I understand there was no problem with the reclassification, everything submitted was accepted.  If the 27 per cent of Monaghan which was excluded had been submitted, I am sure it would also have been accepted.</P>
      <P>As part of its terms of reference, the disadvantaged areas appeals panel was asked to examine the possibility of reclassifying areas of the country from less severely handicapped to more severely handicapped status.  Appeals were invited from areas which felt they were deserving of reclassification, and almost 700 such appeals were received, covering 2.2 million acres in over 7,000 townlands.</P>

      <Col N="2367" /> In discussions with the farming organisations it was agreed that, since this exercise was an appeal against the decisions in the 1991 reclassification which caused certain areas to be omitted, it would be appropriate to examine the appealed areas using the same data but with the selection criteria suitably modified.</P>
    <P>The selection criteria agreed were that the income threshold would be raised from 40 per cent to 60 per cent of national average income; the requirement that at least 40 per cent of the working population be engaged in agriculture would not be pursued; on a land quality scale of 0 to 9, selected areas would have to be rated as 4 or lower&mdash; the Land Commission inspectorate had provided a quality rating for every townland in the less severely handicapped areas; and areas meeting the above criteria would have to be contiguous to existing or proposed more severely handicapped areas, or else form a block of at least 15,000 hectares in extent.</P>
    <P>Using the above criteria, the appeals panel examined each area which submitted an appeal.  Where possible, large areas comprising groups of district electoral divisions which satisfied the criteria were proposed.  Where it was not possible to satisfy the criteria in this way, townlands were examined, and if their results were putting the larger areas at risk of rejection, they were removed.</P>
    <P>The appeals panel was conscious at all times of the need to recommend the largest area possible, while ensuring that <Col N="2368" /> the proposal would be acceptable to the EU Commission as meeting the criteria set.  It achieved a remarkable result in presenting a proposal which was ultimately accepted in its entirety and resulted in the reclassification of one million acres in 3,195 townlands.</P>
    <P>The reclassification of 38,700 hectares in County Monaghan is the second largest area of any county to be reclassified, exceeded only by Cavan.  Of those counties which are not fully classified as more severely handicapped, Monaghan has the third highest percentage at 73.1 per cent of total land.  Areas which were omitted in Monaghan either exceeded the income limit of 60 per cent or were separated from the more severely handicapped boundary and under EU rules could not be proposed.  A small number of areas also had a land quality rating above four.</P>
    <P>Following this reclassification, almost 60 per cent of the less-favoured areas in Ireland are classified as more severely handicapped.  In terms of both budgetary constraints and credibility of the EU Commission, I believe it would not be advisable to go back to Brussels with any further requests for reclassification of additional areas at this time.  I understand the Deputy's frustration.  There are many frustrated farmers across the length and breadth of Ireland following this announcement.  I am conscious of this and will be looking at possibilities for the future but it does not seem that any immediate action can be taken.  I am glad the Deputy raised the matter.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 9 November 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together because I understand that Deputy Kitt's question refers to the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>Population levels and trends are important elements of the overall economic and social fabric of any country. Rising population levels require certain policy responses while declining levels require different responses.  The decline of population in the West of Ireland has been identified as a key policy issue.  As Minister of State for Western Development and Rural Renewal I have been given the brief to address these issues.</P>
      <P>It is generally recognised that the forces that are responsible for declining population levels are many and the relationship between those forces is complex.  As population levels fall, essential services are eroded or withdrawn altogether.  This discourages young people in particular from staying in an area and this can result in a move to larger centres of population.  Along with them moves the resources and potential for economic and social development and the basis for providing a broad range of services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is precisely because of the seriousness of this situation in the West of Ireland that one of the key recommendations of the Government Task Force on the Crusade for Survival was the <Col N="2188" /> establishment of the Western Development Partnership Board with the specific objective of achieving population stability by the end of the decade at 1991 Census levels on a county basis.</P>
    <P>The board is, at present, preparing an action plan for the Region which will develop proposals to achieve this objective. This action plan may also serve as a model for addressing population trends in other areas.  The board's action plan is nearing completion and will be presented to Government shortly.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State for Western Development and Rural Renewal, I am responsible for overseeing the activities of the Western Development Partnership Board.</P>
    <P>The board's overall objective is to develop a strategic focus for economic and social development in the Region. The composition of the board, including as it does all the key State agencies operating in the Region as well as local development organisations, reflects the co-ordinated approach which underpins the preparation of the action plan and its future implementation.</P>
    <P>I have consistently given support and encouragement to the work of the Western Development Partnership Board in the preparation of the action plan.  My officials and I have been in regular contact with the chairman and chief executive of the board to discuss progress.</P>
    <P>As part of this ongoing support for the work of the board in the context of the preparation of the action plan, I have had meetings with organisations at national, regional and local level.  I am confident that these discussions have resulted in a wide range of contributions and inputs to the planning process.  As Minister of State I keep the Taoiseach directly informed of developments concerning the work of the board.</P>

      <P>In response to a recommendation by the National Economic and Social Council in its report <i>New Approaches to Rural Development,</i> as Minister of State for Western Development and Rural Renewal, I undertook the initiative of organising four one day public seminars during May and June 1995 on the theme &ldquo;Rural Renewal: An Integrated Approach to the Provision of Public Services&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The seminars were an integral part of the consultative process necessary to determine the scope and extent of a pilot programme of service centres in rural areas recommended by NESC. Four seminars were held in Roscommon, Sligo, Galway and Ennis during May and June 1995.  The seminars provided an extremely useful forum for bringing together service providers and service users to examine at first hand the issues to be addressed in this area.</P>
      <P>Subsequently, I had compiled and circulated a report on the findings of the four seminars and associated workshops to all participants with the aim of stimulating the maximum response at local level to the issues which need to be addressed.  I also invited seminar participants and other interested parties to send me detailed proposals for the pilot projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The findings and recommendations of the seminars are being used to inform the next stage of the process and the selection of the individual pilot projects. I have received a number of pilot project proposals and detailed proposals for action are being formulated at present. Appropriate management structures are also being established.  I hope to have the first pilot programme in action before the end of the year.  This will <Col N="2190" /> enable us to examine how adequate access to public services can be maintained on a cost effective basis in rural areas with a low density of population. This will help to arrest the downward spiral whereby population decline and withdrawal of public services reinforce one another.</P>

Provision has been made for an additional 450 youthreach places in the education sector in 1995-96.  Vocational education committees are being invited to submit proposals for filling these additional places.  In this context, an emphasis will be placed on maximising co-ordination with the activities of other agencies in <Col N="2194" /> the region and with the plans of the local area based partnerships under the local urban and rural development operational programme.  An information day was held on 10 October, 1995, with the chief executive officers of the vocational education committees to outline this approach.</P>
      <P>All the services including the Garda, probation services and the social services may, subject to the availability of places, make direct referrals to the individual youthreach centres.  Particular priority is given by my Department, in the allocation of places, to proposals to cater for young persons in the most disadvantaged and &ldquo;at risk&rdquo; categories. The vocational education committees are being advised that their proposals should give particular attention to the needs of special youthreach groups such as eligible lone parents and young offenders.  In addition they are being advised that consideration will be given to special initiatives, in association with the health and welfare agencies, for young persons with drug addiction or other substance abuse problems.</P>

      <P>My Department recently decided to support the activities of the association for children and adults with learning disabilities by paying the remedial teachers involved in a part-time teaching scheme organised by the association.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently reviewing the range of services provided for children with specific learning difficulties. The object of this review is to determine what additional educational provision, if any, needs to be made to better meet the needs of the children in question.  I am very much aware of the valuable work carried out by the association for children and adults with learning disabilities.  Representations received from the association will be fully considered in the context of the review to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>Tá fúm an dá cheist ón Teachta a thógaint le chéile.</P>
      <P>Tá soláthar ann do dheontas le haghaidh chostas aíochta i gcásanna áirithe. Baineann sé le daltaí a bhfuil cónaí orthu lasmuigh de raon seirbhísí iompair chuig scoil dara-leibhéal a bhfuil oideachas oiriúnach ar fáil inti.  Daltaí ó na hoileáin a fhaigheann formhór mór na deontas faoin scéim seo.</P>
      <P>Is é £1,750 (míle seacht gcéad caoga punt) an méid is mó is féidir a íoc le dalta ar bith don scoilbhliain 1995-96. Faigheann gach dalta atá ináirithe deontas de ocht ós cionn a cúig déag (8/15) den táille aíochta a ghearrtar ar thuismitheoirí.  Tá soláthar faoi leith sa scéim d'iarratasóirí fíor-ghátaracha. Faigheann siadsan nach bhfuil de theacht isteach acu ach íocaíochtaí leasa shóisialaigh deontas aíochta céad faoin gcéad (100%).  Ar an gcuma chéanna, faigheann iarratasóirí nach bhfuil teacht isteach thar £9,360 (naoi míle, trí chéad seasca punt) sa bhliain acu deontas aíochta céad faoin gcéad (100%).  Tá soláthar ann freisin gur féidir an uasteorainn ioncaim seo a árdú faoi £308 (trí chéad is a hocht punt) i gcás gach páiste i ndiaidh an chéad pháiste atá ina chleithiúnaí. Táim sásta go bhfuil an scéim dírithe orthusan atá ag brath ar chabhair ón gcóras leasa shóisialaigh agus go dtógtar líon na bpáistí i dteaglaigh ar cleithiúnaithe iad san áireamh.</P>
      <P>Mar is eol don Teachta, tá tuarascáil don Rialtas á cur le chéile ag Coiste Idirrannach um Fhorbairt Oileáin.  Maidir le soláthar chun costais taistil a chlúdach, nó leasuithe ar an Scéim Deontais Aíochta, déanfar iad sin a athbhreithniú i láthair na tuarascála sin.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the case to which the Deputy refers.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was employed by the boards of management of ten primary schools between January and June of this year as either an untrained substitute or an unqualified temporary teacher.  He acted as a substitute teacher in the school to which the Deputy refers for five days in January last.  He neither sought nor obtained permission to teach in these schools from my Department. He is not a recognised primary teacher, nor did he seek to become one.  The appointment of substitute teachers is a matter for individual school authorities.</P>
      <P>There has been no suggestion or allegation that this person engaged in any inappropriate or illegal behaviour while employed by any of the schools concerned. Once alerted to this particular case, my Department immediately investigated the matter and contact was established with the Garda authorities at a senior level.  When this issue arose I gave an assurance that, in view of the serious nature of the matter, my Department would contact the management, teacher and parent representative bodies in order to have appointment procedures reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A working party comprising management representatives, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation and the National Parents' Council (Primary) has already begun an examination of this <Col N="2198" /> issue as part of a wider review of all procedures relating to child abuse allegations which concern primary schools. Among the issues which the working party will address are the suitability, training and formal pre-registration of persons wishing to act as substitute teachers.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to have whatever procedures are devised by the working party replicated for schools at second level with appropriate adjustments to suit the management structures involved.</P>

The survey will provide useful data for my Department in assessing the needs of the youth service.</P>

      <P>Applications for entry to the teacher training colleges are processed through the CAO/CAS system. Places are awarded on the basis of points.  The candidates must also meet certain minimum requirements in the Leaving Certificate grades in Irish, English and Mathematics.  This has been the position since 1992.</P>
      <P>The points levels required for entry in 1995 ranged from 330 to 480.  This is very reassuring.  It indicates that high calibre students continue to be attracted to teaching.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The selection system has evolved over the years.  Prior to 1992, a competitive interview was part of the process.  From <Col N="2200" /> 1992 to 1994 the colleges held qualifying interviews but no additional points were awarded for those interviews.  In 1995 the interviews were dropped in all the colleges with the exception of the Church of Ireland College of Education.</P>
    <P>The interview process was considered to be over elaborate and time consuming for both the colleges and the applicants. Generally, out of over 2,000 applicants only a very small percentage failed to qualify.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that serious attention and consideration continues to be given by the colleges to selecting the most suitable candidates.</P>
    <P>The suitability of students for a career in teaching is carefully monitored and assessed by the colleges of education during the training course, with the objective of identifying those who are unsuited to teaching.  The responsibility of the colleges of education in that regard is reiterated in the White Paper on Education which indicates that a key responsibility of the colleges of education will be to evaluate students' teaching potential.</P>

This co-operation is already particularly well developed in the area of home school community liaison activity.

It is my intention to continue the expansion of the home school community liaison scheme to embrace additional disadvantaged schools.</P>
      <P>In addition, as outlined in the White Paper on Education, all schools will be required to develop a formal home school links policy as part of their school plan.  This will further enhance the process of co-operation between primary and second level schools in areas of disadvantage.</P>

In view of the significant cost implications I have no plans to extend the scheme to any other school or area at this time.

I regret that it is not possible, at this stage, to indicate the likely staffing situation at the school for the 1996-97 school year.  This is because the staffing schedule for the 1996-97 school year has not been determined.  The schedule will be finalised by February 1996, at which time a full response will be made to the board's submission.</P>

This charge varies from college to college and ranges from £35 to £135 per student.</P>
      <P>This charge is a matter appropriate to CERT and the colleges.  The students in question are recruited through CERT which pays the tuition fees to the colleges for both full time and part time students.  All full time students receive a weekly training allowance, which is not means tested, from CERT.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 122 together.</P>
      <P>In May of this year I advised the House of a range of proposed developments aimed at improving current provision in the young offenders area. Apart from the measures planned for the Oberstown site, my proposals envisaged the development of an additional eight to ten places for young male offenders at the site of the Finglas Children's Centre.</P>
      <P>I fully recognise the valid interest of local residents in any developments proposed for the Obertstown campus.  This interest is already recognised in the fact that the local community council is represented on the boards of management of the three centres located on the campus. It would be my intention that the local community council be kept fully informed of all new developments.</P>

      <P>The following projects were approved for funding by my Department in 1995 under the recreational facilities scheme: Baltinglass GAA Club, County Wicklow, £10,000 for a clubhouse and dressing rooms; St. Saviour's Hurling &amp; Football Club, Ballybeg, Waterford, £20,000 for completion of a community centre and dressing rooms; Leeds United Football Club, Cork, £17,500 for dressing rooms and Glenmore Community Centre Committee, County Kilkenny, £10,000 for completion of the community centre.</P>
      <P>These grants were allocated subject to the terms and conditions of the recreational facilities scheme.  The criteria used for these allocations includes the priority and the need for the proposed improvement-facility in relation to the organisation's existing facilities; the availability of similar facilities in the area and the ability of the organisation to undertake the project, particularly in relation to the amount of local funds available.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Education provides that &ldquo;Work in progress to establish modern financial, management and administrative structures will be continued and completed in Regional Technical Colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology&rdquo;.  Following the coming into effect, on 1 January 1993, of the Regional Technical Colleges Act, 1992, and the Dublin Institute of Technology Act, 1992, management of the regional technical colleges, and the Dublin Institute of Technology passed from the local vocational education committees to the institutions <Col N="2214" /> themselves.  That legislation, together with the 1994 amending legislation, provides a statutory framework for new management structures in those institutions.</P>
      <P>It was necessary to address the management structures and staffing needs of regional technical colleges and Dublin Institute of Technology as modern institutions of higher education in the context of an independent evaluation carried out by the Institute of Public Administration, by reference to the norms in analogous colleges of higher education.</P>
      <P>On the basis of the IPA's recommendations I have approved, <i>inter alia</i>, the creation of posts of secretary/ financial controller and finance officer in the regional technical colleges and director of finance and finance officer in the Dublin Institute of Technology.  I am satisfied that the creation of these posts will ensure acceptable financial control arrangements in the colleges.</P>

      <P>My Department has provided substantial additional funding in recent years for the adult literacy and community education scheme which is the Department's main instrument for helping adults who have literacy problems. It has also provided substantial increases in funding for the special initiatives for disadvantaged adults scheme which is a related scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Literacy and numeracy tuition is also provided under other programmes such as Youthreach and the vocational training opportunities scheme.  These <Col N="2215" /> schemes have been expanded significantly in recent years as well.  I am committed to further expansion of all these schemes to meet demand as resources permit.</P>
    <P>My Department is keeping the operation and effectiveness of the schemes under ongoing review, including the issue of co-ordination.  This is being done in consultation with those who are operating the schemes and with the National Adult Literacy Agency which plays an important role in this area.</P>
    <P>The new structures which are to be put in place arising from the education White Paper will, as indicated in the White Paper, have responsibility for co-ordination at various levels of the programmes in question here.</P>
    <P>As indicated previously, a national literacy survey has been commissioned as part of an international initiative.  The report from this, which is due next year, will help greatly in charting the way ahead in the adult literacy area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 61 and 83 together.</P>
      <P>The final Government decision on the funding of initiatives in the White Paper, <i>Charting Our Education Future</i>, is as set out in my foreword to the White Paper.  The implementation strategy for the White Paper reform programme involves the prioritisation of reform measures within the context of available resources and within the wider context of the Government's social and economic programme.  As I pointed out in my reply to Deputy Martin on 28 September 1995, I do not intend to publish a cost framework or series of cost projections for the White Paper.  Any such exercise would not be very meaningful, and would not contribute to the implementation of the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have indicated previously, it is important to point out that many key changes in the White Paper will not involve additional resources.  Rather, they involve the establishment of rights, <Col N="2217" /> responsibilities, roles and functions to create a modern framework for the management of the educational system. In this regard, I am giving priority attention to the tabling and enactment of legislation.</P>
    <P>In his reply to Deputy Michael McDowell on 19 October 1995, my colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, confirmed that he participated in the process of consideration by the Government of the White Paper and that this process included consideration of the cost implications of the White Paper.  The Minister correctly pointed out that proposals to implement specific aspects of the White Paper reform programme must be accompanied by detailed costings as and when they come before Government for approval.  Costing exercises for proposals that might have resource implications in the future are contingent on a range of variable factors, such as the timescale within which proposals are implemented, the outcome of discussions/negotiations with concerned interests and expert advice on the detailed implementation strategies.  Also, as the Minister for Finance has pointed out, the cost of education measures are determined to a large extent by pay costs, which in turn reflect numbers employed in the sector and pay rates at any given time.  In this context he indicated that it would be neither useful nor appropriate to comment on what the cost elements might be into the future.  I agree.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 125 together.</P>
      <P>Payments in respect of in-service education for both primary and post primary in the period in question amounted to £4.45 million.  There are, in addition, commitments to expenditure in respect of which claims for payment have not yet been received.  It is not possible to identify separately the total payments relating to the primary and post primary sectors.</P>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 107 on 14 March last, the allocation for in-service training is programme driven in accordance with the objectives agreed with the European Commission under the Human Resources Operational Programme.  In line with this, a range of the activities and programmes supported is cross sectoral. Funding for these activities is, accordingly, not allocated on a sectoral basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 123 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order for an additional permanent teacher to be appointed to a special school, it is necessary that adequate enrolment numbers be maintained for two consecutive quarters.  In the case of the school in question, an increase in enrolments took place in October of this year.  If this increase is maintained <Col N="2220" /> through December, an additional permanent teacher will be appointed to the school.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the staffing levels at the school is a principal, three assistant teachers and a temporary assistant.  At its current enrolment of 57 children, this staffing allocation is well within the pupil teacher ratio of 14:1 applicable to the school.  The excessive class size referred to by the Deputy should not arise in this situation.</P>
    <P>The temporary assistant post was allocated in May of this year as an exceptional matter to meet the needs of a particular child then enrolled at the school.  The child in question subsequently transferred to another school. However, the temporary post was left in place because of an anticipated increase in enrolments at the school.</P>
    <P>My Department will review the staffing position of the school in January 1996 and if warranted, the temporary post will be made permanent at that stage.</P>

      <P>At present my Department operates a number of measures aimed at alleviating hardship arising from the payment of examination fees. A provision of £400,000 was made available to schools in order that entry fees for the 1995 exams could be waived or reduced in the case of those experiencing financial hardship.  An additional provision of £600,000 for reduced fees in the case of candidates who are repeating the Leaving Cert was also made available.  These candidates would normally be required to pay a higher fee than first-time candidates but where the candidate, parent or guardian holds a medical card, the maximum fee payable is the fee payable by first-time candidates. It is my intention to improve provision in this area on an ongoing well <Col N="2224" /> targeted basis and as resources become available to me.</P>

      <P>Schools may access Internet in two ways, through NITEC or using a commercial service such as Ireland On-Line.</P>
      <P>NITEC is a schools' computer communications network which is funded by my Department and managed by Dublin City University.  Schools accessing through NITEC pay the following charges; local telephone call charge, an access tariff of approximately 5p per minute and Telecom EIRPAC account cost of £7.50 per quarter.  In addition there is a registration fee of £40 when opening an EIRPAC account.</P>
      <P>Schools accessing the internet using a commercial service pay the following charges; telephone call charge which depends on the location of the school and the nearest dial-up point for the commercial service, and a fee per month for the service, approximately £10 per month.</P>
      <P>An information pack and NITEC newsletters have been circulated to all second-level schools.  An internet guide was circulated to schools which are members of NITEC in 1995.  I intend to issue a circular to all schools on the services available through NITEC.</P>

      <P>Since my appointment as Minister for Education I have attached a high priority to improving the quality and level of support services available to children with special educational needs both in mainstream and special schools.  I am satisfied that substantial progress has been achieved in this area. Measures which I have introduced include: the appointment of an additional 241 remedial teachers at primary level and a further 98 remedial teachers at second level; the appointment of an additional 29 resource teachers to support children with disabilities in ordinary primary schools and a further 56 resource teachers at second level; the appointment of an additional 150 child care assistants to special schools dealing with children with disabilities; a substantial increase in the rates of special capitation funding paid to special schools and schools with special classes; a one unit reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio for all special schools and classes dealing with pupils with disabilities; and the reduction in the number of teaching posts required before a special school can obtain an administrative principal post.</P>
      <P>As Minister for Education, it is my intention to maintain this momentum. The measures set out in the White Paper on Education will further enhance the range and quality of services available to children with special needs and provide the necessary framework for future development in this area.</P>

      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to higher diploma in education courses.  The Higher Education Authority has the statutory responsibility to advise me on the demand and need for higher education.  The authority set up a committee to review the demand and need for second level teachers.  The review committee, having examined all the relevant factors, proposed that the intake quota for Higher Diploma in Education courses in 1995-96 should be 800.  The Higher Education Authority accepted this proposal and recommended it to me.  Following examination by my Department I accepted the authority's recommendation.  I am satisfied this is the most appropriate approach having regard to all the circumstances. I will of course keep this matter under review in liaison with the Higher Education Authority.</P>

      <P>It is not intended that Montessori trained teachers be appointed to the early start pre-schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The early start pre-schools are being <Col N="2229" /> developed as an integral part of the primary schools to which they are attached.  Each pre-school is therefore staffed by fully qualified primary teachers and qualified childcare assistants.</P>
    <P>My Department recognises the Montessori diploma awarded on successful completion of the three year course at the Montessori College, Mount St. Mary's, Dundrum Road, Milltown, Dublin 14, formally Sion Hill.  Persons holding this diploma may be granted exceptional recognition in special schools for children with mental handicap, emotional disturbance or hearing impairment.</P>
    <P>However, the qualification does not meet the training qualification requirements of primary school teachers.</P>
    <P>Primary school teachers appointed to the early start programme must be qualified to maintain deployment mobility within the schools' staff and in the primary school system generally. Consequently, the Montessori teachers cannot be appointed to the early start programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is precisely because of the lengthy training-in period for parliamentary draftsmen who are recruited to permanent posts &mdash; and as I informed the House on 17 October 1995, a competition has recently been held for the recruitment of five new draftsmen &mdash; that it is necessary to recruit experienced draftsmen on a short-term contract basis.  A number of potential candidates have been identified in other common law jurisdictions, including <Col N="2230" /> Canada and Australia, and their suitability is in the course of being evaluated at present.  These are very senior persons who already have many years experience of drafting legislation and their experience is itself a valuable training resource for the new permanent draftsmen who are due to take up employment in the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>Legislative drafting at its most complex is a highly skilled activity.  There is not a sufficient pool of retired draftsmen in this jurisdiction from which to recruit persons on contract, hence the requirement to draw them from other jurisdictions with a similar legislative framework.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I presume the Deputy is referring to the amount of money, referred to as patients' private property, which is being held in safekeeping by health boards on behalf of long-stay psychiatric and elderly patients.</P>
      <P>The amount of money, the combined principal plus interest accrued, held on behalf of these patients by the eight health boards at 30 June, 1995 is approximately £16.5 million.</P>
      <P>An accounting standard was prescribed by my Department in 1994 governing the presentation of health boards' annual financial statements. This standard imposes an obligation on each health board to clarify, in its annual financial statement, that patients' private property is not the property of the health board and to set out the legal basis on which it is administered by the board.  It must also state whether patients' private property accounts have been independently audited, give the date of the last audit and a copy of the auditor's report must be appended to the statement.  The accounts are available for inspection by the Comptroller and Auditor General in the course of his annual audit of health board accounts thereby ensuring transparency in the accounting procedures applying to these moneys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is also currently drafting, in consultation with the health boards, a uniform policy on the management of patients' private property which will complement the requirements of <Col N="2238" /> the accounting standard referred to above.</P>

    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Medical Council has statutory responsibility which it exercises through its Fitness to Practice Committee to inquire into the conduct of a registered medical practitioner on the grounds of alleged professional misconduct or on the <Col N="2239" /> grounds of unfitness to practise by reason of physical or mental disability.</P>
    <P>Therefore, where the question of fitness to practise of a registered medical practitioner arises it is statutorily a matter for the Medical Council to investigate rather than for an employing health board.  Where allegations of a criminal offence against a registered medical practitioner arise that is a matter for the Garda and the appropriate prosecuting authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over and above the specific DTI traffic management measures, I believe that more effective action on <Col N="2243" /> traffic management and enforcement, including parking restraint, is essential, particularly in Dublin city, if the DTI strategy is to be successfully implemented, and if its objective of shifting commuters from private cars to public transport is to be achieved.  The existing arrangements under which a number of agencies have responsibility for individual aspects of traffic management and enforcement have clearly failed to adequately tackle congestion problems in Dublin and fundamental changes are necessary.</P>
      <P>I announced, therefore, last August that the Government has decided there should be a Director of Traffic for Dublin who would take over responsibility from the Garda for the administration of the traffic warden and tow-away services, and for the fines-on-the-spot system, introduce wheelclamping, and have overall operational responsibility for traffic management in Dublin city.  A special consultancy study is to be undertaken to define the organisational structures required to ensure that the director can fully and effectively discharge his/her functions and that the new unit within Dublin Corporation will have optimum operational capacity, functional independence, and self-financing capability.  Arrangements for commissioning this study are now well advanced.  When it is completed, firm decisions can be made on implementation matters generally, including the precise role and functions of the director <i>vis-à-vis</i> other officials and elected representatives.</P>
      <P>It is intended that the director will function initially in relation to the administrative area of Dublin Corporation and I would expect an appointment to the new post to be made in the first half of 1996.  Consideration can be given at a later stage to extending the mandate to areas in the adjoining counties, on the basis of agreements or agency arrangements between the authorities concerned.</P>

      <P>Section 31 (1) (a) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963 provides that, where any development, which is not exempted development, takes place without planning permission, the planning authority may and shall, if so directed by the Minister for the Environment, within five years of such development being carried out, serve a notice on the owner and occupier of the land requiring that the land be restored to its condition before the development took place.  It has never been the practice for the Minister to issue such directions and I do not think that it would be appropriate for me to do so in this case. The enforcement of planning control is, essentially, a matter for the local planning authorities and complaints about <Col N="2245" /> lack of enforcement can be pursued with them, at official level or through the elected members.</P>

The manner in which a local authority collects or arranges for the collection of waste within its functional area is primarily a matter for the authority.

      <P>The Higher Education Authority has the statutory responsibility to advise me on the need and demand for higher education.  The authority recommended that 800 higher diploma in education places be provided in 1995/96 and I accepted this recommendation.  A total of 4,420 applications were received in respect of the 1995/96 academic year.  The number of applicants would be considerably lower than this figure as many candidates apply to more than one college.  The breakdown of places by reference to college, subject and subject groupings is shown in the following tables.  The college authorities reserve the right to select the students they admit to any course.  I understand that in selecting students for the higher diploma in education course the colleges have regard, <i>inter alia</i>, to academic attainments, the appropriateness of a student's degree subjects, relevant teaching experience and the quality of a student's application.</P>

      <P>The decision on the abolition of undergraduate tuition fees covers tuition fees paid by full-time undergraduate students attending publicly funded and certain other designated third level institutions.  I am sympathetic to the position of night students and other part-time students, including those involved through distance education, but it was necessary to focus Exchequer support because resources are limited.  I would hope that, as resources become available, it will be possible to provide more Exchequer support for third level undergraduate students attending courses at night and on a part-time basis or through distance education.  The funding for the undergraduate fees initiative was secured by redirecting savings from the abolition of tax covenant reliefs.</P>

      <P>The total amount provided under the national plan for incareer development at first and second level for the period 1994-99 is £36.5 million, at 1995 prices.  This provision is co-financed by the European Commission under the Human Resources Operational Programme to the extent of £27.4 million or 75 per cent.  The funding provides for in-service training for teachers and also for management training, including parent training.  In addition, the running costs of the education centre network are funded under this programme.  The main priority areas for in-service training are set out in the White Paper, <i>Charting our Education Future.</i> Broadly, these fall into the areas of facilitating the major curricular changes and reforms and advancing the professional development of teachers, in addition to training for managements and parents.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 116 and 117 together.  Negotiations with the teacher unions on their claim for early retirement and other claims are taking place within the parameters of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> agreement on pay and conditions of employment.  Discussions on the claims resumed in September on the basis outlined in the joint Government-ICTU statement issued on 13 July last.  It was specified in that statement that &ldquo;Both sides agreed that all issues involved had to be satisfactorily resolved before any particular element was implemented and that that satisfactory resolution had to take place within the relevant parameters of the <Col N="2251" /><i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, I do not propose to comment on these discussions other than to say that progress is being made. Until final agreement is reached it would not be appropriate for me to make further comment.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to be precise regarding the number of places required for juvenile offenders. Demand for such accommodation can vary from day to day depending on decisions taken by the courts.  Experience with the operation of the present industrial school facilities indicates that the 130 places currently available in these schools are adequate to meet present and likely demand.</P>
      <P>In the case of reformatory school places, there is growing pressure on the 60 places currently available for young male offenders in the 14 to 16 age group.  There is also occasional pressure on the 16 places available for young female offenders.</P>
      <P>To address this issue, Minister of State, Deputy Currie, recently announced proposals to develop an additional 28 to 30 reformatory school places for boys and seven additional places for young female offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that approximately 100 instances have arisen over the past six months where admission to a young offender centre was initially declined due to lack of accommodation.  The great majority of these cases related to short-term remand placements where <Col N="2252" /> accommodation was subsequently provided, usually within a short period of the initial referral.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that where short-term remand places are concerned, the availability of places can vary significantly from day to day and even from hour to hour.  This is best illustrated by the fact that over the period in question, in excess of 190 children were accommodated in the 39 remand beds available in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that I am of the view that no young offender should have to be released because of lack of suitable accommodation.  I am satisfied that the measures which I have outlined will make a significant contribution to ensuring that adequate accommodation will be available in the future.</P>

      <P>I informed the Deputy in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 24 of 3 <Col N="2259" /> October 1995, that while official figures for 1995 are not readily available, provisional figures for 1994 show that there were ten convictions for indictable offences under section 15 of the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  These convictions were obtained in the following Garda Divisions (as the Garda Síochána is not administered on a county basis, it is not the practice to record the distribution of these cases on such a basis):</P>

      <P>Trade with Algeria has fluctuated considerably in recent years, reaching a low of £8.7 million in 1992 after a peak of £44.4 million in 1989. This may be partly explained by the commodity-based nature of trade <Col N="2263" /> between our countries: our main exports are beef and milk power, and the biggest import is mineral fertilizer. The total value of trade in 1994 came to £25.3 million, made up of £24.2 million in exports and £1.1 million in imports.  I would be hopeful that the development of closer economic ties between the EU and Algeria will lead to a more diversified pattern of trade in the future.  An Bord Tráchtála will continue to monitor the market and provide appropriate assistance to Irish exporters as the need arises.</P>

      <P>Australia is among our top 20 export markets, and despite the difficulties of distance, some 500 Irish companies have traded with Australia over the past five years.  Total trade with Australia has grown from £99.5 million in 1990 to £145.2 million in 1994. <Col N="2264" /> Exports have increased from £88.7 million to £129.5 million over the same period. There are ten Australian firms operating in Ireland who between them account for up to 1,300 jobs, and more recently there have been some significant investments in Australia by Irish companies.</P>
      <P>The explosion of economic growth and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region has inevitably led Australia to shift its trade focus away from Europe, but I have no doubt that Australia's relationship with the European Union Single Market will continue to be of major importance to both parties.  The successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the establishment of the World Trade Organisation should provide an excellent basis for the harmonious development of future trade relations between the EU and Australia, and I am confident that Irish exporters can, with the assistance of An Bord Tráchtála, take advantage of this positive trade climate in the years to come.</P>

Argentina is undergoing a process of economic reform and trade liberalisation which, together with its membership of the MERCOSUR group of countries, makes it a very interesting market prospect for many Irish companies.

      <P>The Local Government Act, 1991, provides for each local authority to engage in such activities as it considers necessary or desirable.

      <P>Since taking office I have engaged the services of one public relations firm, Heneghan Public Relations Consultants.  The cost incurred in this regard was £800.  As this sum falls below the threshold with regard to Government tendering procedures, no tenders were sought.  There was no expenditure by either of the Ministers of State at my Department with regard to public relations/media advice.</P>

In return financial compensation for the quantity of quota surrendered was paid to the producer.  My Department cannot restore quotas thus surrendered.</P>
