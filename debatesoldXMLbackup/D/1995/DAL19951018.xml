      <P>I wish to advise the House that there is a parliamentary delegation from the State of Kuwait with us this morning and I am sure Members would wish to join with me in extending to them most warm greetings for a happy and successful stay in Ireland.  I extend to you, in the Gaelic way, a hearty céad míle fáilte &mdash; a hundred thousand welcomes &mdash; to Ireland.</P>

      <P>Before proceeding to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn whom I call to state the matter of which she gave notice to me.</P>

      <P>I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 30 to raise the following serious matter; the proposal by the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to charge higher premiums to older people.  VHI has increased premiums by 18 per cent in the last 14 months which is almost seven times the rate of inflation and is now planning to levy higher premiums <Col N="298" /> on older people who are least able to afford it.</P>

      <P>I assure the Taoiseach that we welcome the first sign of movement at last on the part of the British Government to break the impasse on decommissioning.  As I said during my speech at Bodenstown at the weekend, we will require international help to assist with that.  We should all be grateful for the continued efforts of President Clinton's administration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased at the progress and wish to compliment everyone involved particularly the Tánaiste who had a very successful meeting with the Secretary of State, Sir Patrick Mayhew.  There are problems which remain to be overcome but, as I have said repeatedly, there is the will on all sides to overcome them however difficult they may be.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not arise now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It does and I will tell the Chair why.  All our affirmative action programmes and legislation for women is affected by this decision.  Will the Taoiseach review or examine the decision today and what form will that review take?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Anyone who listened to &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; heard Ms Carmel Foley deal with the concerns raised by the Deputy much more eloquently and with greater knowledge than I could. She explained that our programme of positive action as distinct from positive discrimination is not affected.  Differential training arrangements to ensure women are given adequate opportunity to compete equally is in order.  What is problematic in light of the decision is deciding that one gender should be chosen over the other where candidates are equal.  As she explained this morning, we are not pursuing that here and therefore the concern raised by the Deputy does not arise.  The Deputy would have been in order had he raised this under the Equal Status Bill which is promised legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the matter is being raised under the Equal Status Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will talk about that or any other Bill but there is other legislation on the Statute Book.  I would prefer to hear the Taoiseach take his briefing from his Minister rather than from &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  I put two Bills on the Statute Book and I remember enough about them to know how they are directly affected by this decision.  I would like the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to look at these matters during the course of the day.  I will give the references if he requires them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government will examine this and all other relevant court judgments as a matter of course.  It is <Col N="301" /> important to bear in mind that we have had a very clear statement this morning by a distinguished public servant who is an authority in this area.</P>

      <P>Given that the CIE board under a new chairman has stood over its original decision on the Cork site, additional information has not been given to the Garda and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has misled the House on three occasions, what action does the Taoiseach propose to take in the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to promised legislation and particularly the programme for Government.  Will the Taoiseach agree there has been a change in the proposal in the programme for Government regarding a third banking force and matters relating thereto in light of a report in this morning's newspapers which quotes a spokesperson from the Department of Finance <Col N="302" /> to the effect that the Minister for Finance will not factor in any income from the sale of&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>To what legislation, if any, is the Deputy referring?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for Government refers to a third banking force and changes in the banking sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney asked several questions on this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It will not happen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I have answered them with the same degree of repetitiveness as they have been posed. I welcome Deputy McCreevy's interest in the matter too, but the position has not changed from the answer I gave to Deputy Harney which is that no decisions have been taken on the matter at this juncture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct.  A spokesperson for the Department of Finance said yesterday that the Minister for Finance will not factor in any income from the sale of banks in the 1996 budget calculations.</P>

      <P>I would like to bring to the attention of the Taoiseach a very serious matter in Cork city and county relating to the city prison which is overcrowded, with prisoners sleeping on the floor.  Considering that there is a vacant site in the city will the Taoiseach recommend that it be made available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Title>Electoral Bill, 1994: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyKilleen" hpid="Mr. Killeen Mr. Killeen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>Nuair a bhí mé ag caint ar an mBille Toghcháin aréir rinne mé dearmad ar chúpla pointe ginearálta a bhí i gceist agam a lua.  Cuireadh meascán mearaí orm taréis an turais trí iarthar Chorcaí agus rinne mé dearmad orthu.  Everyone who has spoken favours the establishment of a commission. However, there are other provisions that ought to have been considered in the context of this Bill.  A number of Deputies referred to the necessity for improving the system of counting votes and ensuring more speedy results.  This applies in particular to recounts.  There is no reason not to consider using the available modern technology which is used successfully in other countries. Apparently our electoral system, with the transfer of votes, makes that relatively difficult but I am quite sure it could be incorporated in the system and it ought to be.</P>
      <P>There has been a substantial number of complaints about the difficulties voters experience in locating the access point to the polling station.  That applies in particular during winter elections when the lighting in the vicinity may not be particularly good and arises from the provisions of the 1992 Act which outlaw the erection of posters in the vicinity of the polling station.  If this is to continue it is incumbent on us to ensure that people who take the trouble to go to vote should be able to find the polling station without an embarrassing search for it.  The election count is of great interest to many people but access to it is generally limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 (d) states, &ldquo;the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable&rdquo;, but there are occasions when it is impossible not to do <Col N="307" /> so.  In that instance it would seem sensible to provide that local electoral wards or local election area boundaries would not be breached and if it was necessary to transfer a part of a county into a new constituency an entire local electoral area or an election ward would be transferred. I believe there is very good reason to extend the remit of the commission to examining local electoral areas.  There have been changes in these areas on a number of occasions and sometimes this has resulted in the creation of local electoral areas that do not appear to have anything in common and are of such a configuration that it is difficult to give an explanation.</P>
    <P>Last night I referred to section 37 which sets out the penalties for offences under the Bill.  Section 37 (5) states:</P>
    <P>It shall be a defence to a prosecution under subsection (2) (a) to show that a person did not know and could not reasonably have known that he or she incurred election expenses above the specified limit.</P>
    <P>While I have no difficulty with the limits because there is no danger I could aspire to spend £12,000 on an election in a four seat constituency, this provision in a sense makes a mockery of the entire section and strengthens my view that it is only a sop to the people because it is feared that State payments to political parties might be unpopular and come under attack.  I believe it is very poorly thought out and will lead to a huge amount of frustrating paperwork. Inevitably when there is litigation the defence will try to show that the candidate could not reasonably have known that this expenditure was being made on his behalf.  This seems to imply that there could never be a successful prosecution.  Subsection (6) provides:</P>
    <P>Proceedings for an offence under this Part shall not be instituted except by or with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>The DPP undoubtedly would be likely to judge that subsection (5) would <Col N="308" /> make it impossible to have anyone successfully prosecuted under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Whereas there is a limit on the expenditure of candidates there does not appear to be any attempt to limit the influence of those who engage in anti-candidate activities.  It may well be difficult to legislate for this but I submit it is no more difficult than legislating for the limit to be imposed on candidates.  It could in certain circumstances have a much more serious effect on the outcome of an election.  People may tend to think that this is unlikely to happen but there are lobby groups who may be deeply offended by a politician who takes a view opposite from theirs.  During the 1991 local elections a letter was circulated in part of my constituency by a group who felt that my views on an issue did not accord with theirs and this had a substantial effect.  There are specific constraints on the candidate who puts his name forward for election and the lobby groups who wish to influence the outcome should come under the ambit of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made for those who are unable to attend their polling station and this is very welcome. There are people who wish to exercise their franchise but genuinely would be unable to do so because of their occupation &mdash; third level students would be the largest number affected.  They tend to live a distance from their home area and have relatively little interest in the electoral area in which they reside but would have a strong interest in their home area.  Making provision for them is fraught with difficulties and is open to abuse.  I very much welcome the proposed changes which will be successful if they are carefully monitored.  It is only right that those who are genuinely interested in voting should be facilitated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonWalsh" hpid="Mr. E. Walsh Mr. E. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Electoral Bill, 1994 and wish to address all five headings of it, the establishment of the commission, the funding of political parties, <Col N="309" /> the provisions relating to disclosure of payments to political parties, the proposed limits on election expenditure by political parties and candidates, and the provision of voting arrangements for people who have difficulty in voting because of their employment.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposal to set up a commission because all politicians have to live with the possibility that their constituency will be dramatically altered as a result of population changes with the consequent danger of losing their seat. This is a significant factor given that nowadays most people involved in politics invest a substantial amount of their time in that profession.  The existence of a commission would remove any public suspicion about the changing of constituencies, and politicians would be assured that any changes would be fair and above board.</P>
      <P>There are dangers inherent in making changes to constituency boundaries which we must recognise.  Politicians may have difficulty in committing themselves to representing particular areas when changes are pending and that may be detrimental to their political future. For example, in my constituency of Dublin South-West, there has been a debate as to whether Clondalkin should be part of that constituency, and the uncertainty has made it difficult to properly represent the people living there. That is not to say that the politicians in Dublin South-West short-change the electorate, but there is a perception among the people that they are not receiving the representation to which they are entitled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish also to address the question of overlapping of constituency and local electoral boundaries which makes it difficult for the public to identify their public representatives.  For example, the large Terenure electoral area crosses the two constituencies of Dublin South-West and Dublin South-Central.  A candidate elected to the county council may have been elected to the Dáil from a different base, and people may be confused by the fact that they are represented on the county council by two <Col N="310" /> representatives from different Dáil constituencies. Such questions should be considered when drawing up constituency boundaries and, if possible, local electoral areas should be totally encompassed in Dáil constituencies.  That would solve the difficulties I outlined.</P>
    <P>My final point on the commission is that the names of places in district electoral divisions should be clearer because occasionally the public are unable to understand the terms used in creating the electoral divisions inside each constituency. Attention should be paid to that when providing for constituency reviews.</P>
    <P>The second heading I would like to deal with is the provision of funding for political parties.  This is a significant step forward as it will enable us to become more professional in the business of politics and not have to depend on charitable donations in order to continue with the very important job of upholding the democratic process and representing people nationally and locally.</P>
    <P>The many members of political parties will understand the difficulties involved in fund-raising.  In rural areas annual collections for political parties are taken up outside churches.  In the city, where I am mostly involved, we have to knock on doors seeking donations to enable us continue our work in the democratic process.  People find it difficult to understand why anybody involved in politics should have to do that because there is an assumption that politicians are in some way or another a part of Government and, therefore, have access to funding. However, the fact that we will be funded by the State and that the amounts will be clearly specified will give people more confidence in the political process and give a sense of professionalism to the business of upholding the democratic process and representing people at local and national level.</P>
    <P>The third item I would like to address relates to the disclosure of donations.  It is important that we make the public <Col N="311" /> aware of all details relating to financing. People have been reluctant to disclose donations because of the implication that there were strings attached to it, and that anyone making a donation was in danger of being accused of trying to influence issues in which a public representative was involved.  The requirement to disclose donations will eliminate that difficulty.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention briefly the proposal to limit the expenditure of parties and candidates at election time, another significant and important step forward.  People are sick and tired of the useless but expensive glossy literature that is put in such large amounts through their letterboxes.  It is no wonder they are cynical about political parties and their sources of funding.  We must think about the waste involved when politicians are able to present their case through today's modern media.  There is a difference between the city and rural areas which I should mention.  In rural areas politicians have access to local radio and local newspapers. In Dublin city they do not have access to those two important vehicles for imparting information, and this should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>My final point relates to the fact that for the first time we are recognising the efforts people make to cast their votes by including a provision to allow them do so in whatever way they can.  That important step will enhance the democratic process and ensure that those who are eager to cast their vote are given the Opportunity to do so.  I hope this will set a trend for those who live close to polling stations but do not bother to vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is a step towards ensuring that the democratic process is well served by our political system, and the public support that through the ballot box.  It allows the process of representation to continue and ensures the public is well served at national and local level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCrowley" hpid="Mr. Crowley Mr. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to contribute and I also thank Deputy Walsh for sharing time with me.  I welcome the Bill for a number of reasons.  It is good for democracy and will ensure the public is aware that power and political donations are not abused.  Many large companies, particularly in Great Britain, donate up to £250,000 to political parties.  They do not do so for the good of their health, they expect something in return.  This Bill, which caps contributions to political parties at £4,000, will prohibit such donations being made here.  We must not allow the public to become cynical about politicians.  If people hear rumours about a company contributing, say, £50,000 or £100,000 to a particular party, they will wonder why.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the provision regarding the amount of money a candidate can spend in the run-up to an election, how will it be enforced?  Must candidates take into account money spent on meals and drinks?  If so, it will be impossible for candidates, their agents or the political parties with which they are involved to determine the amount of money spent.  That provision is impractical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Candidates standing for election incur a great deal of expense, probably more than when they are elected.  If the deposit for standing in elections is too large, people will believe politics is a rich man's club and if it is too small many candidates with no hope of being elected will stand for election.  More consideration should be given to this matter.   During one of the last elections <Col N="313" /> a candidate stood in five or six constituencies. That is crazy and the Bill will not make it more difficult for people to do likewise in the future.  The candidate in question was not elected.</P>
    <P>We should devise a more efficient system for counting votes.  The count continued for four or five days following the last general election and this is cruel for the candidates involved.  In the United States, Great Britain and various other places the result of the count is available at approximately midnight on polling day, thus reducing the number of hours candidates and their supporters spend anxiously waiting for a result.  It is not too late, consideration should be given to this matter in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not know why voting in general, local authority, Presidential and European elections cannot be done on Sundays. That would alleviate many of the difficulties for truck drivers, fishermen and others who are away from home during the week and would add substantially to the number of people who cast their votes.  It would be worthwhile to hold at least one election on a Sunday to determine if the number of voters increased.  While a facility has been provided for people who work away from home they do not know where they will be from one week to the next and more consideration should be given to the question of Sunday voting.</P>
    <P>Public funding of political parties is long overdue.  It will eliminate the perception that something sleazy or peculiar is taking place.  It is extremely difficult for members of parties to knock on doors asking for contributions year after year when the public are becoming more cynical about them.  I hope the provision regarding public funding will restore people's respect for political parties and politicians in general.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State a number of Presidents, for various reasons, did not complete their terms of office.   Will the Minister consider providing a facility whereby people could vote for a vice-president as well as for a president in Presidential elections.  The public would welcome such a facility <Col N="314" /> and if the president elected did not serve his or her full time, a total of £1 million or more would be saved.  I welcome the Bill and compliment the Minister on introducing it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>The late Congressman Tip O'Neill, probably a good friend of the Chair's, in his famous statement claimed that all politics are local.  It is understandable that when politicians speak about boundary commissions, revision of boundaries and so on, they reflect on their personal experiences.  In your long and distinguished career, Sir, County Tipperary has been divided in many ways.  The revision of boundaries dominates the thinking of most politicians when discussing this type of legislation. My first awareness of the meaning of such divisions was during the period of the 1973-77 Government when the late Minister for Local Government, Jim Tully, initiated a review of boundaries.  He opted for small three seat constituencies, the reverse of the present strategy, but we opposed his decision because we felt it was the gerrymander of all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the late 1960, my party, under the then Minister for Local Government, Mr. Kevin Boland, was accused of undertaking similar boundary reviews. The revision conducted under Mr. James Tully created a great furore.  We were competing vigorously to return to power.  We saw the three seat constituency strategy as being unhelpful to our ambitions and intentions and vigorously opposed what the Minister had proposed, so much so that we talked ourselves into what the incoming Government in 1977 had committed itself to in the heat of the debate in objection to the boundary review of the 1973-77 period. We set down a market that never again should the politicians with the responsibility for boundary revisions be left a free hand.  We committed ourselves before the electorate to introduce a boundary review commission.  The incoming Taoiseach, Mr. Jack Lynch, followed through and we are now casting that particular decision into a more <Col N="315" /> formal structure of legislation with this Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>As time has proven, our concerns, objections to and negative comments about the review undertaken by the late Mr. Tully were completely unfounded. <i>The Irish Times,</i> on the morning of the count of the 1977 general election, had a headline that the Coalition was to be returned to power by the narrowest of margins, when we in effect had a 20 seat majority.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>It pales in significance against Dr. FitzGerald's prolific spending when he got his opportunity, but that is not the issue.</P>
      <P>The issue before us is that we collectively assumed it was not correct for a politician in a ministerial position to have the right to review boundary constituencies. We are dealing with the practical realities and looking back over the works of the boundary review commission.</P>
      <P>I understand the complex task that such a commission has and how it wishes to strike a balance.  Members of the commission rightly see elected Members of the Dáil as national legislators. They do not see it as a great infringement on the role of a national legislator if a local boundary is moved or there is a slight breach in a county boundary because of the constitutional requirements.  They see the Members of Dáil Éireann being elected to do a legislative duty and they assume that local government representation covers these local areas.  That is the theoretical aspect of the work a boundary review commission undertakes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a constituency that is unique in that, in the early 1970s, it was decided that the west side of Dublin would be the area to take the substantial population growth.  As a result, three new satellite towns were proposed: Tallaght, Clondalkin/Lucan and Blanchardstown.  They were in a unique <Col N="316" /> category within the overall strategic planning for population placement.  The satellite town of Tallaght was projected in 1972 to have a population of 100,000 by 1991 and the other two satellite towns were to do likewise.  With the oil crisis of the 1970s, emigration and other factors, the population growth did not meet the original target but went reasonably close.</P>
    <P>Tallaght's population grew to in excess of 70,000 and is now probably creeping up to the originally intended 100,000.  The two satellite towns of Clondalkin/Lucan and Blanchardstown happen to be in my constituency and, despite what I thought were logical, competent, and comprehensive submissions to the boundary commission on two occasions, it sought to ignore the logic of integrating these satellite towns in one Dáil constituency.  Part of Clondalkin is in Dublin South-West and north Clondalkin is in Dublin West.  A canal, an artificially created waterway, was used as a boundary.  I understand that, when it comes to the mathematics of boundary reviews, the commission or its advisers and statisticians come up with various options as to how the balance can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the terms of reference which state that the large five seat constituencies should be in urban areas should be looked at.  I do not understand the reasoning behind that decision, but it has been written into the terms of reference for the various boundary commissions.  As a result, there has not been a competent conclusion, for understandable mathematical reasons.  The commission has an unenviable task and it will not please everybody.  Its task is to produce a revision reflecting the population movements. In Mayo, because of its falling population level, the boundary commission was left with no choice but to revert to a five seat constituency, reducing the number of Deputies by one.  The boundary review commission is constrained by the constitutional requirements and that was the conclusion it <Col N="317" /> came to.  The commission should probably be given more flexible terms of reference. If the terms of reference restrict the consideration of a logical argument, the commission cannot consider the strategic importance of a satellite town, the need for cohesion and the need for logical representation.</P>
    <P>It is a practical fact of political life that the interrelationship between the national and local political systems is unique.  In the UK and various other countries, the local and national political systems are not so closely inter-woven as is the case in Ireland.  The single transferable vote, the multi-seat constituency, the regularity of change between colleagues within parties, local councillor colleagues standing on the same tickets with outgoing Dáil Deputies and the internal competition and rivalry mean there is a close, interrelated, competitive situation in Irish politics, which is unique.</P>
    <P>When looking at the boundary commission's work, it is difficult to reflect these political considerations.  This is why every elected Member goes into detail about his or her specific situation and how illogical they regard certain decisions of various boundary commissions. The terms of reference should not be as restrictive as in the past.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to what I assume is possible but does not yet seem to have been given effect to.  That is the change brought about by legislation introduced by the then Minister for the Environment, and current European Commissioner, Padraig Flynn which changed various electoral procedures &mdash; including activities at polling stations and other matters &mdash; like legislation introduced by another former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith.</P>
    <P>We have relaxed the rules for people who are justifiably entitled to vote but who were denied it.  In the past, well known members of the public often complained that their names were not on the electoral register even though they had been voting for 20 years.  They <Col N="318" /> were disenfranchised because of a mistake. I hope the Bill will introduce an understandable flexibility giving a returning officer, or whoever is formally responsible for the polling station, the discretion to grant the right to vote to a legitimate elector on production of a driving licence, passport or some other authenticated documentation.</P>
    <P>The fact that it may be possible to produce almost instant election results by the computerised reading of ballot papers will provoke negative comment. It will probably phase out the mystique of the tallymen and their ability to forecast transfers of second and third preferences which determine the remaining seats in constituencies.  The role of the tallyman has become a unique achievement in Irish political folklore.  One hears of elections in France and Germany where polling stations close at 9 p.m. and the final result is known by 10.30 p.m. or shortly after.  Such countries have sophisticated computerised count procedures and I am sure there is room for such improvement here.</P>
    <P>The formalising and regularising of many such matters in this legislation is desirable.  I welcome the Bill in principle. We have taken an irreversible step since the establishment of the boundary commission in the 1977-81 period of Government.</P>
    <P>I have great reservations about the continual diminution of elected politicians' responsibilities and their delegation to various other supposedly independent experts because politicians, unlike the others, are accountable.  I do not know of any other profession where you are automatically sacked every four years or so and then have to reapply for your job.  If that is not on-line accountability I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>We have decided that the elected politician should not have that function which instead will go to a team of experts known as a boundary review commission but I do not believe the work they have done has been any more spectacular than when it was in the hands of politicians.  It just means that if it is done by the politicians it is open <Col N="319" /> to political criticism and a much more intense debate in the House.  In practical terms one will not please everybody in undertaking this task.  In comparing the work of politicians and the boundary review commission in this regard, the terms of reference should be relaxed to achieve an acceptable conclusion to the complex and difficult task facing any such commission.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which will regularise many deficiencies as well as being more flexible about the voting rights of those who, through no fault of their own, are away from their home areas on polling day.  That sort of flexibility is most desirable.</P>

    <P>For that reason it is important to view that change in a sensible way.  The constituency review commission must also be sensible in its approach.  Previous speakers referred to the fact that when constituency revision was done politically it provoked outrage.  No matter who carries out such a review it is not easy to do it without offending someone.</P>
    <P>I have difficulty with the terms of reference given to the commission &ldquo;to protect county boundaries as far as possible&rdquo; because in the case of Carlow &mdash; the second smallest county with a population of just 40,000 &mdash; the commission deliberately decided to shift some of our number to another constituency.  It decided it would not break county boundaries in Kilkenny, Waterford or Tipperary region, and when it came to Wicklow decided it would not break the Dublin county boundary even though 3,500 people out of the population of Dublin is a drop in the ocean.</P>
    <P>Despite the terms of reference and the sacredness with which they held the county boundaries of Dublin, Waterford, Tipperary and Kilkenny intact, the commission decided to transfer 3,500 people from Carlow to Wicklow.  I do not appreciate the fact that it moved almost 10 per cent of our county while preserving much bigger counties.  In the case of Dublin, which has several constituencies and is broken into different sections, it decided it would not break the county boundary to help Wicklow. Dublin and Wicklow have almost unbroken stretches of population and housing.</P>
    <P>It is important for the constituency review commission to be set up as an independent body with independent views, but I am not sure it is infallible <Col N="321" /> either.  We can, of course, blame Ministers who, if they did something like this, would be suspected of doing it for political purposes.  An example of what is wrong with constituency reviews is Roscommon where the River Shannon divides a European constituency.</P>
    <P>This Bill contains much detail about the contributions Deputies and candidates receive.  It gives the impression that we look forward to elections because the postman will bring envelopes full of money and people will ask us to accept £1,000 or £5,000 and we will not have to disclose it.  That is a terrible impression of what happens during elections. Anyone who has been a candidate knows it is an expensive time.  While some people may be lucky to receive cheques, most people are in debt after the elections.  I am sure most people would not object to taking £490 from a willing donor.  In tightening up this area, we are giving the impression that all Deputies receive money.</P>
    <P>Politicians are under a great deal of pressure, particularly at election time when people tell them they will not get any of the 150 votes in an area unless they do what is requested of them.  If a candidate has no independent means and relies on his Dáil salary, he will be under pressure to do something with which he might not agree.  I am glad many people have something other than a Dáil salary to fall back on.</P>
    <P>It will be a disaster if business people cannot get involved in politics because we need their experience in borrowing, interest rates and investments.  We may have theories, but we have no practical experience.  People may declare their interests so that the Opposition knows how well or how badly they are doing, but it will not encourage business people to get involved in politics.</P>
    <P>There will be great difficulty assessing the value of contributions, although there is no trouble counting money.  If a candidate receives £40,000 in donations, he should resign from politics and invest it or go to a warmer climate.  The Bill includes a provision to assess the value of contributions.  Are there different <Col N="322" /> categories of contribution?  If someone is unemployed and wants to canvass, is he assessed as having contributed a certain amount?  How will a person who takes holidays to canvass be assessed? There will be problems if people do not agree with such assessments.</P>
    <P>Advertising is a waste in most cases. Some years ago political parties thought that if a competing party had a full page advertisement in the newspaper, it needed a page and a half the following day.  Common sense now seems to prevail. Advertisements in newspapers are only of interest to a party's activists; those who have no interest in politics will not read them.  I do not know why newspapers increase their advertising charges during an election since political parties no longer think it is worth the price to advertise because the people to whom they want to talk will probably not read it.</P>
    <P>Posters had desecrated the countryside for years.  I pay tribute to all the political parties who take down their posters after an election.  Posters, which may be lying around until 9 o'clock, are gone by 9.30 p.m.  The new regulations mean that people go out of their way to ensure that posters are removed.  In the past smaller parties paid someone to put up posters.  There would be posters all over the place for a candidate who might get 200 votes.  Posters or advertising campaigns do not play a role in the election of individual candidates.  We must stand on our record and on whether the people believe we contribute to our democracy.  It is no harm to put a limit on what people spend, although parties have more commonsense nowadays.  At one time advertising gave the impression of strength, but now the quality of the advertising makes a difference.</P>
    <P>There is no reference to holding elections at a certain time but serious consideration should be given to holding elections at weekends.  Sunday was mentioned, but that may not suit some people because of their religious beliefs. The referendum is to be held on a Friday and that is a good idea because <Col N="323" /> people home for the weekend will be able to vote.  Midweek elections do not suit so many people.</P>
    <P>Certain speakers mentioned how long election counts take.  It seems to take twice as long if one is a candidate waiting for transfers.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to introduce the European system of voting.  While we hope to modernise our proportional representation system, it is not as easy as it seems.  It is amazing to watch European elections and to see the results coming in so quickly.  Proportional representation by single transferable vote is not an easy system.</P>
      <P>I compliment the tally people who know the results of elections well in advance.  Some years ago my colleague, Deputy Nealon, beat the computers on television by forecasting the results, although he was not doing a tally at the time.  People have a nose for these things and it fascinates me how accurate the tally can be.  Tallymen leave aside political allegiances and tell the story as they see it.  I have often looked at the figures after an election in my constituency and it is amazing how close the tally figures are to the final results. Although this is a skill, people must be careful.  Whenever the possibility of transfers occurs political bias may enter but it is incredible what can be done on the first count.</P>
      <P>I very much welcome the provisions of Part VII allowing people unable to attend polling stations to vote by post although in the past farcical circumstances arose when people, actively involved in politics, who regarded their franchise as a very serious matter, were unable to exercise it because of their working hours, hospital appointments or the like.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> Likewise, circumstances arose in towns bordering on neighbouring counties when some people acted as presiding officers in a different constituency and were unable to vote.  Everybody interested in casting their vote should be afforded every facility to do so.  We should ensure no barrier is placed in their way although many people though living within five yards of a polling station, are not interested in exercising their franchise.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to some voters' names being omitted from the register, an earlier decision to introduce a voting list within some 14 days of election day is an enormous achievement, by which time most electors will know whether their names have been included.  From the point of view of candidates the last two weeks of an election campaign afford them an opportunity of meeting their constituents and informing them whether their names are included on the voting list.  It is very embarrassing when somebody whose name has been on the register for years finds it has been omitted. I made the case here before, reiterated by Deputy Lawlor, that some method should be devised by which the registrar should have power to allow an elector, who may have lived in the same area for anything up to 50 years, an opportunity to cast his or her vote. While recognising that the compilation of the late voting list may have eliminated that difficulty no doubt the names of some electors will continue to be omitted.</P>
    <P>The onus to ensure the list is comprehensive and up-to-date is on those who compile it and ensure that what may have obtained over the preceding 30 or 40 years is not changed without good and adequate reasons.  In my constituency I remember two important people coming to a polling station to discover their names omitted from the list, which is unfair to them, an embarrassment to everybody and gives a wrong impression.  As so many people have no interest in exercising their franchise, we should endeavour to ensure that any <Col N="325" /> voter who does turn up is afforded his or her right when qualified to do so.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the proposal in the Bill for public funding of political parties thus rendering them more independent in many aspects.  This Bill is long overdue and will save many people having to attend meetings, sell raffle tickets and engage in other collections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanDoherty" hpid="Mr. Doherty Mr. Doherty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Doherty</NameTxt>
      <P>While generally welcomed by all Members this Bill raises important questions about our overall electoral system and its attendant difficulties for all politicians.  It is now well recognised that, to a large extent, our electoral system generates enormous pessures on individual politicians, creates confrontational type politics, necessitating an extraordinary expenditure of energy within a competitive arena that yields little and does not contribute anything to Members' primary legislative function.  These must be reflected on within the context of this Bill.</P>
      <P>In the past all sides of the House have been slow to protect the institution of politics.  On many occasions, Members have abused, insulted and demeaned one another in the public eye, tending to get away with it, on the basis that it is politics and expected of them.</P>
      <P>For some considerable time in excess of one million of our population have been in full-time education but we must acknowledge that the public does not respect us for what we have done to the institution of politics by exploiting a bad system.  After all, politics should be, and I believe is, a noble profession.  Generally I believe Members want to make a valuable contribution which many do in difficult personal circumstances.  They are subjected to extraordinary pressures, costs, obligations and duties, engaging in a role that intrudes enormously on their time outside the House which means they may get little recognition for their efforts, an essential component of political life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the perception of politicians worldwide is poor, I hope it is somewhat <Col N="326" /> better here.  Nonetheless, media concentration on politics within a society as confined as ours is very obvious.  For example, on radio, at 8 a.m. beginning with the early morning news, we are introduced to the first political debate of the day, proceeding to light entertainment programmes in which politics can take a small, medium or large part, followed by the news at 1 o'clock, incorporating political debates of one kind or another.  Again at 5 o'clock in the evening, politics often make the headlines and, on television later on, there is further political debate.  Therefore, it is vital that there is a political institution in place which protects its members who give valuable service, make a real contribution, thus ensuring their profession is not diminished.  I know of no other profession that would tolerate so many false, untrue and inaccurate perceptions being created in the public mind.</P>
    <P>I met a second level female student recently who, among other things, was engaged in studying the representation of politics and politicians, people inclined to be perceived as wrongdoers, somewhat shady or dodgy types.  It is indeed tragic that our second-level student population should be exposed to a curriculum that would misrepresent and create a general impression of politics that would diminish in the public eye politicians and the institution of politics.</P>
    <P>While the Bill makes a valuable contribution, it raises a series of questions about issues which must be addressed if we are to protect this institution.  At the commencement of the summer recess we hear media comments that politicians have gone on long holidays.  A check list is presented on who has gone where and the next question asked is who has gone with them.  The fact that committees of the Houses meet until the end of July and reconvene in early September or that political constituency work continues appears to be ignored. Our political system requires Deputies to continue to do political work not as <Col N="327" /> legislators but as public representatives in their constituencies.</P>
    <P>We all recognise that we do not have any of the great powers often attributed to us.  Ministers have significant and special constitutional powers, more particularly in the context of their Government or Cabinet function.  As individuals, they are governed strictly by legislation and established practices. Dáil Deputies have a collective legislative role to play and while numbers are the basis on which legislation proceeds through the House, the power of backbenchers or members of Opposition parties is no more than the important one of highlighting issues and making the opposing case to impress upon the Minister the need to make changes.</P>
    <P>Many people outside the House have important legislative functions and jobs. They are not compelled by ethics legislation to behave in a particular way or refrain from engaging in certain activities. On many occasions I made complaints in that regard.  For example, local authority engineering staff should not engage in outside work which could conflict with their duties if they were dealing directly with the processing of planning applications.  Others who have responsibility for enforcing legislation should be required to maintain an ethical distance from private enterprises in which they might have an interest in the performance of their work on behalf of the State or the public service.  Those matters must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>Professionals, such as solicitors, doctors, teachers and so on, on election to the House must end their involvement in their private employment to the detriment of their business due to the pressure of political work.  We have seen repeatedly that after one, two or three years such Members are turfed out and in many instances do not have a successful business to which to return.  The business may have failed or suffered some loss.  In that regard, small businesses are at serious risk and the absence of the person in charge may have serious consequences.  Allowances, <Col N="328" /> protections or fail safe mechanisms are not provided for such Members.</P>
    <P>This Bill must be considered in the context of what we want to achieve.  It should not be introduced as a legislative formula to prevent corrupt practices as if they were an every day occurrence in the political system.  We know that is not the case and that is a hallmark of the quality of those who are elected to the Houses of the Oireachtas and an acknowledgement of the quality of our electorate who elect them.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the Bill will create serious difficulties in the future.  We must acknowledge that it is necessary and proper to introduce some controls, limits and require accountability for contributions made to political parties. Small political parties or individuals whose personal financial positions may prohibit them entering politics should not suffer as a result of changes that may be introduced.  It is increasingly the case that unless one is well-heeled one will encounter great difficulty in getting elected and participating in this House on a full time basis, now a requirement for all Dáil Deputies.</P>
    <P>There are no professional back-up services, research facilities and so on. Dáil Deputies' salaries are despicably low.  Apart from the provision of a secretary and some technology in Members' offices, little or no allowances or facilities are provided.  With the exception of a small allowance of approximately £2,000 per annum, Deputies must pay the costs of their telephone calls.  That does not make a real contribution to the cost of providing a constituency service.  Those who are aware of telecommunication costs in private businesses will recognise the cost that must be borne by Dáil Deputies to service their constituents. That will remain the position until we change our electoral system to one that will allow us be legislators in the real sense rather than play our other role, often described as that of a messenger boy.</P>
    <P>The imposition of limits on contributions give rise to considerations about <Col N="329" /> the setting of limits and their effects.  I do not believe that such limitations will create serious problems, but I am concerned about how such a system will be monitored.  How can we ensure the necessary requirements are met to provide for accountability in law?  Such a system will require the recruitment of a new inspectorate to deal with the resulting correspondence, invoices and necessary accounting processes.  It will not be possible or realistic to administer such a system in a constituency in which there may be nine, ten or 14 candidates whose agents will be required to submit various receipts.  We are exposing that system.  Those who may not like a Deputy will be in a position to make accusations and, in the case of politicians, they do not always have to be proved.  To point the finger is sufficient on occasions to create the wrong perception and we will run into this type of difficulty.  Frivolous or false charges may be made against individual politicians.</P>
    <P>It has been acknowledged that traditional fund raising takes up much of a politician's time and most funds are expended at election time.  Usually these have come from the people who support the party by attending party run functions. We will now have to account for all of those functions and show the source of all funding if it exceeds certain limitations.  This is ridiculous and it is impossible to comply with.</P>
    <P>If Deputies engage in professional lobbying, which is a feature of politics in Europe and throughout the world, and become involved on a fee basis or as a business, will they have to make disclosures and account for what they are doing?  As a business I presume they would make their returns to the Revenue Commissioners in the normal course of events.  There can easily be conflicts here.  Persons may engage in a function that may not necessarily be taken into account in this legislation. That should be examined on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The independent commission has to be looked at in the context of what it <Col N="330" /> will achieve.  As our spokesman, Deputy Noel Dempsey, pointed out, that the commission is not described as &ldquo;independent&rdquo;, as provided for in the Ethics in Public Office Act, is significant.  To ensure that an improper meaning is not read into this, it should be described as &ldquo;independent&rdquo;.  Also there should be a time limit on the introduction of legislation dealing with any report produced.</P>
    <P>There must be a better way of ensuring that the integration of a county or a region is not destroyed by the redrawing of constituency boundaries.  It is terrible that a Dáil Deputy who has worked diligently and made a real contribution can lose his or her seat at the stroke of a pen in the boundary commission but I do not know how it can be avoided. Health boards, tourism boards, regional IDA authorities and all the regionally based semi-State agencies should be recognised and constituencies within the regions should not be damaged.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, we have done well in Longford-Roscommon in that both of us have been returned as Dáil Deputies.  I avail of the opportunity to say there is little doubt but that you will be returned the next time, whatever about myself.  I will have to rely on your surplus.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  It is important to recognise there have been problems within the electoral system as well as some financial problems for all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the issues raised in the explanatory memorandum I take the point made by the previous speaker about the danger of a statutory commission changing a constituency which could mean that somebody would not be elected at the next election.  That is much easier to accept if it is done by an independent commission rather than by the party in <Col N="331" /> power.  The independent commission has much to offer and has proved to be a useful body.  It is important that it is now being put on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker also referred to confrontation.  There is no doubt the present system leads to confrontation within constituencies.  It is unfortunate that people are returned in many cases, solely because of the amount of work they do and the number of public meetings they attend in their constituencies and that others lose their seats because they are unable to attend public functions in areas where they are expected to work.  That leads to confrontation not between parties but within parties.  I welcome the fact that our five seat constituency in Cavan-Monaghan has not been changed.  The boundary is intact and we do not experience the problems about which others have spoken regarding council areas crossing the boundaries etc.  To cover a vast area from the upper end of Cavan at Glangevlin to Inniskeen on the Dundalk side is an enormous task.</P>

      <P>That it has to be covered if one is to retain one's seat creates a major workload for any person. It means there is no question of Deputies putting time into studying the legislative programme, planning for the future and many other things we should do.  However, the system is much better than that in the North or across the water in the UK where they operate a first past the post system.  This means that the Liberal Party, which has a proud record at local government level, fails to get virtually any recognition in national government elections and this is unfair.  While our system has some limitations and needs to be re-examined the other system is definitely worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome that the referendum on divorce will be held on a Friday.  It gives students and young people in jobs an opportunity to vote.  In almost every <Col N="332" /> rural area bus loads of young people travel to Dublin every Monday morning and return home on Friday evenings. The possibility of polling booths remaining open for an extra hour should be examined.  This would facilitate even more voters.  I would not like elections to be held on a Sunday.  That would be a retrograde step for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the issue of payments to political parties.  The Bill is a major step forward in that regard for a number of reasons.  Political party meetings will no longer be taken up with discussing the question of fundraising. They will now be free to discuss the real needs of the country and what they should be doing to address them.  There will no longer be any need for church gate and other outdoor collections and we can rely on party functions to raise the money needed to run our constituencies.</P>
    <P>Political parties should not be run by people donating money in bags; they should be run independently.  In the past, people donating large sums of money demanded &mdash; and no doubt received &mdash; preferential treatment from politicians.  That leads to undue pressure which is not for the benefit of politics in general.  For election purposes, proper disclosure of funds will be required.  I agree with previous speakers who said this may lead to some problems because of the possibility that money may not be easily traced, but it is a step forward which must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>It is not appropriate that people must have a wealthy background or be in contact with prominent business people to remain in this House.  The provision in regard to funds for electoral purposes and party structures is welcome.</P>
    <P>The method by which Deputies are elected to this House is important for democracy.  Deputies should be elected because of their ability and the work they can do on behalf of their constituencies, not because they have close friends in high places.  The Bill goes a long way to rectify any such problem which existed in the past, although I am <Col N="333" /> not saying it did.  In comparing the current salaries of Dáil Deputies to those of senior civil servants or others, it must be remembered that we are answerable to the public seven days a week, 365 days a year.  That puts an enormous burden on politicians and particularly on their families.  I support the suggestion that we must examine the possibility of providing research workers and general backup facilities to Deputies and Senators.  If that does not happen, democracy will suffer in the long term.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the change in the voting system for those who are required to be away from home at the time of an election, including people working in the transport area, fishermen, etc.  In the past, I engaged in lobbying at EU level and was unable to vote in a number of elections, which annoyed me greatly.  When can those people who may not know where they will be on polling day apply for a postal vote?  That is an important question.  We now have a provision whereby people not on the register three weeks before an election can have their names added to it, but I am not sure of the process involved in adding to the register the names of people wanting a postal vote. If it is to be backdated to 24 November, it will be of little use to many people.</P>
    <P>A previous speaker referred to the problems experienced by people with medical appointments.  Some people are required to be in hospital at the time of an election but they may not get much notice of their admission.  People who are required to attend meetings abroad often do not get much notice of them. Those people are often personally involved in electioneering and are committed to the democratic process.  I ask the Minister to seriously examine this whole area before the Bill is finalised.  I realise it will put pressure on the staff involved but it will be worthwhile. Where people can justify their absence from home at the time of an election, every effort should be made to facilitate them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the general thrust of the Bill.  It represents a major step forward <Col N="334" /> in the provision of funds and in regard to voting opportunities but I accept there will be problems in its implementation and in ensuring it works in a proper manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I have been a successful Dáil candidate in 11 general elections.  I have fought by-elections, European elections and ten local elections.  The only election remaining for me to contest is the presidential election.</P>
      <P>This Bill is long overdue but my one criticism is that it does not go far enough.  I welcome the setting up on a permanent basis of the constituency review committee.  The establishment of this committee is the only way to tackle this problem.  I realise its findings will always be subject to some criticism but it will invite submissions which will be seriously taken into account.  That will continue to be the case.  Some submissions may be more reasonable than others&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the commission is limited by the Constitution in what it can do.</P>
      <P>When I first stood for election the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny included a large area of County Wexford, to be eligible as a five seater.  That position obtained up to 1981 when we lost that portion of the County Wexford constituency because the population in Carlow-Kilkenny was sufficiently large for it to be retained as a five seater. However, the increasing population resulted in our losing part of the constituency on the last occasion which was regrettable.  Despite the fact that we all knew we would have to lose some area, no submission was made to retain that part of County Carlow we subsequently lost.  Perhaps the outcome would have been different if a submission had been made but we will never know.</P>
      <P>Another nettle in our electoral system which we in this House will have to grasp concerns the issue of by-elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="335" /> We have dealt with the issue of by-elections in the context of elections to the European Parliament.  Regardless of what party is in power, the Taoiseach, Ministers and Deputies from other constituencies migrate to the constituency in which the by-election is being held. The system for filling casual vacancies in multi-seat constituencies is not fair as it is essentially a straight voting system with a transferable vote and serious consideration must be given to devising a new system.  By-elections invariably distort the level of support for parties and general elections, which are held on average every three of four years, should be a sufficient test of public opinion.</P>
    <P>It would be very wrong if the Bill gave the impression that all one needed to be elected to this House was plenty of money.  If I had to depend on money only I would never have been elected and could not have stayed here.  Nonetheless, it is a major factor in helping political parties and ensuring that people in the democratic process do a proper job.  Money is not the only prerequisite for election to Dáil Éireann or any other forum but it is important in ensuring that one has the necessary expertise to develop policies, criticise other policies, build up political programmes and keep them up-to-date. Times are changing and policies which were relevant some years ago may not be relevant today.  This means that more expertise is required all the time.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision relating to disclosure as it will help to eliminate the false impressions created in the past and ensure that misleading information is not given out.  In the 1961 and 1965 general elections it was legally binding on candidates to make a return of election expenses and for all election literature to contain the name of the election agent.  I am not sure if Deputies will still be required to do this under the Bill. There has been a reference to issuing anonymous leaflets and newsletters and it should be illegal during an election campaign to issue a document which <Col N="336" /> does not contain the name of the person or agent who has issued it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new voting arrangements and the introduction of Friday voting which I hope will become a permanent feature of the electoral law.  Political parties hold opinion polls prior to elections.  I have never held one but I understand they are an expensive undertaking.  Will they be included in election expenses?  I welcome the Bill which is a major step forward in purifying the democratic system.</P>

      <P>I welcome the general spirit of the Bill but its detail leaves much to be desired.  I am particularly concerned about the setting up of a central fund which will definitely favour the larger parties in the House.  One could apply the term &ldquo;cosy cartel&rdquo; with a great deal more validity on this occasion than has been the case in recent times.  The section dealing with the central fund is the direct product of a cosy cartel between the large parties in the House, namely Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour. This is wrong and anti-democratic. As an Independent Deputy I am not here to speak for small parties but they have the same amount of research to carry out, the same amount of work to do, the same number of questions to put and the same number of Bills to respond to as large parties.  If the central fund is being set up in the interests of democracy then there should be greater equity in how it is distributed between the various parties elected to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last thing I was elected to do was to represent the interests of parties. However, the logical extension of what I said is that Independent Deputies, who experience greater difficulty than anyone else in being elected &mdash; this can be seen from the number of us here &mdash; are treated with little more than contempt <Col N="337" /> in the Bill.  This has dangerous implications. Section 15 (5) (a) states: &ldquo;The Minister may, by regulations made with the consent of the Minister for Finance, provide for the payment in each year out of the Central Fund...in respect of the discharge of parliamentary functions to each non-party member of the Dáil who applies therefor&rdquo;.  The important word here is &ldquo;may&rdquo;; in other words, it will be at the discretion of the Minister as to whether an Independent Deputy, duly elected after great difficulty, may be funded from the central fund.  When I was elected in 1982 all the major parties sought my support because I held the balance of power.  This provision has very dangerous implications in that context. Consequently, the Minister should ensure that it is changed appropriately. I hope it will not be necessary for me to table an amendment on Committee Stage to ensure that.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that allocations will be made from a central fund to allow Members discharge their parliamentary functions.  In this context, a small party with one Member in this House should receive the same allocation as an Independent Member.  I see no difference between the two.  I am not happy with the proportion it is proposed to allocate to small parties.  Consequently, I hope changes will be made on two fronts.  I have to represent the interests of Independent Members in this regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision under which the electoral commission will be established on a statutory basis.  The boundaries of my constituency have been altered dramatically, to such an extent that I find it difficult to understand how it could be described as Dublin Central. The arguments I made in submissions to previous electoral commissions were totally disregarded.</P>
    <P>The electoral commission will comprise a judge of the Supreme Court or the High Court, the Ombudsman, the secretary of the Department of the Environment and the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad.  Of this grouping, the secretary of the Department of the Environment has access to critical resources, <Col N="338" /> information and back-up facilities.  He or she is the one member who is aware of the effect changes in constituency boundaries can have on election results. I do not know whether the members of the electoral commission rubber stamp decisions when they come to agree the broad outlines of particular maps, but I hope they will consider this issue and ensure that no individual member will be able to exert undue influence.  It is their duty and responsibility to ensure that this issue is resolved.  It is a matter of grave concern that it is possible to determine the outcome of elections in different constituencies in favour of different parties and individuals.  This matter has to be dealt with if the electoral commission is to have the support of all the Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of the proposal that elections should be held on Sundays.  I do not know what the arguments against this are as it would give everyone an opportunity to cast their vote.  There should be no electioneering, canvassing or issuing of leaflets and posters between Friday and Sunday.  This is counterproductive as people are usually sick to death by the time election day arrives.  While I welcome the fact that limits are to be imposed on election expenditure I would restrict all candidates to circulating one leaflet, poster and newspaper advertisement.  If we fail to do this, the effectiveness of a campaign will be determined by the amount of money available to individual candidates and parties.  This is anti-democratic.</P>

      <P>The principle behind this Bill is a noble one but, unfortunately, it is not carried through to its logical conclusion in order to prevent political favours being repaid by the exchange of funds.  It is the perception of the public that where limits are not imposed and disclosure is not required there is an overwhelming temptation for vested interests to make donations to further a particular political point of view.  This is unsatisfactory and undemocratic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="339" /> There is a need to change specific provisions of the Bill.  This could be done by way of simple amendments which I hope will be seriously considered. For example, in relation to donations by private companies, trade unions etc., the thresholds are very high. The figure of £4,000 for political parties should be reduced to no more than £1,000.  Other members of my party argued in favour of a lower figure, but if we are to be reasonable the figure should be reduced.  The figure of £500 for an individual should be reduced to no more than £100.  This is not too much to ask.</P>
    <P>On one occasion my party was offered £100 in respect of its activities on Dublin County Council.  When I asked if any other member or party represented on the council had received the same amount all hell broke loose.  There is no doubt, therefore, that legislation is required to ensure disclosure in which political parties are reluctant to engage, particularly the larger parties who caused a furore when I asked the simple question at Dublin County Council if anyone had received a cheque by way of donation or inducement.  I hope the people who will enforce this legislation will not meet with the same violent response.</P>
    <P>Some members of the larger parties have been animated in discussing this legislation.  I can understand the reasons for this.  As well as being entitled to a large sum under the Leader's allowance they will receive enormous amounts of money compared with what the smaller parties or Independents will receive. There is a pretence that it levels the playing pitch but it really increases the slope.  It will be an uphill struggle for members of smaller parties to do the job they were elected to do which is the same as that of members of larger parties whether in Government or Opposition. The Government will receive extra funding by virtue of being in Government.  That it not acceptable.  It perpetuates inequality.</P>
    <P>Many of my constituents cannot vote.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="340" /> It is not that they do not wish to vote but their work commitments are such that they must leave home in Balbriggan, Skerries or Rush early in the morning and do not return home until late in the evening when the polling stations are closed.  There is a strong case to be made for Sunday polling although it may not suit everybody as so many people do shift work and work ungodly hours.</P>
    <P>As regards election literature perhaps we should look at the Danish system. They designate a section of a town or locality as an electioneering playing field and everyone knows where to go if they wish to receive information on any aspect of the election or on any candidate.</P>
    <P>As the sole Deputy for my party I am expected to attend meetings, table questions to Ministers and so on.  I put up with a lot of stick for not being in two or three places at the same time. However, my job would be easier if it were recognised that, proportionately, I do more work than a member of a larger party.</P>
    <P>There is a stipulation that an auditor must audit the account but there is nothing to say that because one party has one Deputy and another has 66 Deputies the auditor will charge one sixty-sixth of the fee charged to the larger party.  That is inequitable.  The 10 per cent funding for the Opposition attempts to address the inequality but if it is divided proportionately it will be inequitable.</P>
    <P>Will the penalties for non-compliance be outlined?  If there is a delay in making a disclosure the money will have been spent and a party will be in power. Will the Government be dismissed from office because it spent too much money on its election campaign?  There is a limit on the amount to be spent on elections but it is difficult to understand why there is a limit of £10,000 on a by-election and £25,000 on a general election. One does not need to spend as much on a general election as on a by-election.  I am sure Deputy Coveney thinks the limit is much too low as he spent £25,000 <Col N="341" /> in the Cork by-election.  Some candidates who spent more than that were not elected.</P>

      <P>The Deputy knows as much about them as I do.  The Bill needs to be significantly amended on Committee Stage.  The Government must look at this proposal closely because it sounds as if politicians are giving themselves money out of the taxpayers' pockets.  It must be stressed that what is needed is a minimum amount and it should be much smaller than what is proposed.</P>
      <P>The funding should not be proportionate to the number of Deputies in a party &mdash; backbenchers also help to pay into the coffers which are full enough with contributions from big businesses &mdash; but in accordance with the amount of work parties, including small parties, are expected to do.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It did but it could not afford to.  The first part of the Minister's statement sounds like an apology for politicians and political parties.  There is no need to apologise for giving Exchequer funding to political parties.  I wish it were accompanied by measures such as the banning of church gate collections and other fund-raising tactics which cause such pain and so little gain.</P>
      <P>It is not in order to have a system where political parties are open to influence by individuals, groups or businesses. They must be financed in such a way that everything is above board. There may be an inclination for big businesses to contribute to parties in the belief that if they need a favour in time to come they will be able to call the tune.  That is a reprehensible and undesirable attitude but people believe that it exists.  I have not seen that in my capacity as a Deputy, Minister or Senator but I know that people think they will receive favours if they contribute to a political party, particularly one that is in power.  By and large it is a false perception.  There may be some individuals or parties who succumbed to the temptation and took money &mdash; they would be in the minority &mdash; but I hope they never tried to repay it by granting a favour or giving special status to people. That would be absolutely illegal and criminal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister does not state how much money political parties will receive and on what basis it will be given.  I imagine it will be based on the number of seats won.  A point of view expressed a couple of years ago, when the legislation was first mooted, was that it would be on the basis of the number of votes each party receives.  A figure mentioned previously was £1 per vote, which seems reasonable, but there is no mention of a specific amount in the Minister's speech.  It behoves us to ensure that political parties are properly financed so that the begging bowl mentality does not prevail.  That can be most unpleasant, undesirable and demeaning. I look forward to the proper financing <Col N="343" /> of political parties in terms of elections, advertising, campaigning and research, an area in which funding is very badly needed.</P>
    <P>Some matters are not clearly spelt out in the Bill or in the Minister's speech. On benefits in kind, specific figures are referred to as regards the amount of donations received from an individual or a company.  Benefits in kind could be very valuable to a political party or a candidate and it would be interesting to know if they can be quantified and identified. The contribution of a person who puts a fleet of cars and drivers at the disposal of a candidate on election day could be considerable but it is not clearly stated in the Minister's speech whether such a benefit in kind will be taken into account.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of allowing people who, because of their occupation will not be able to vote on election day, to vote prior to polling day.  The words &ldquo;by reason of their occupation&rdquo; are very important.  Previously when a postal vote was allowed for people who could not poll on election day there were widespread abuses. For example, in the local elections of 1974 people who pretended they were going away on holidays or on business for a day or two were allowed a postal vote.  One county councillor in a northern county was reckoned to have been elected on the basis of the postal vote which, in his case, amounted to about 500 votes.  That is a vote that could be very easily manipulated in those circumstances. A postal vote allowed by reason of a person's occupation, which can be easily checked, is very desirable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That trick was practised by a certain political party in the old days when the dead rose and voted. However, we will not be unkind to the dead or anybody else.  All sorts of malpractices took place down the years but, <Col N="344" /> thankfully, they have been largely eliminated. The present restriction on people who may vote without going to the polling booth is very stringent &mdash; people who are certified as invalids by their doctors are practically the only people, apart from gardaí, diplomats and members of the armed forces, who may vote in this way.  It is totally unsatisfactory that the tens of thousands of people who travel for a living and fishermen at sea who do not return until after polling booths have closed do not have the same democratic right as everybody else.  That opportunity must be afforded to every citizen of the State.</P>
      <P>I am unhappy about votes for emigrants, referred to in the Minister's speech.  He said there are proposals to provide three seats for emigrants in the Seanad, but that is not sufficient.  This area needs to be considered with great care and considerable compassion.  Very few people have as much vested interest in the running of the country as people who have had to emigrate because of economic circumstances and three seats in the Seanad is not sufficient representation for them.  Many countries in the western world make provision for people working abroad and they have much greater representation than we are advocating in the proposed legislation for our emigrants.</P>
      <P>Our population is approximately 3.5 million people.  An interesting statistic would be the number of people born in Ireland who are now living abroad.  Is it 500,000 or closer to one million?  Could those people justifiably demand 20 or 25 per cent of seats in this House?  That is probably a little extravagant, but certainly three seats in the Seanad is not sufficient representation for a huge segment of the Irish race.  Those people should be represented in Dáil Éireann and the number of seats should not be derisory &mdash; perhaps ten, 12 or as many as 20, but it should be significant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Seanad is a very exclusive forum, and to put emigrants on a par with the graduates of Trinity College is insulting. Trinity College graduates have the right to elect three members to Seanad <Col N="345" /> Éireann, as have graduates of the National University of Ireland, but at least the number of graduates of the NUI, which runs to tens of thousands, is representative of that number of seats. To compare the graduates of Trinity College with the hundreds of thousands of Irish emigrants abroad is not fitting or proper.  Those people should be represented on the floor of this House. People who have had to emigrate are as entitled, and in many cases much more entitled, to voice their opinions here because they had to leave the country through no fault of their own as there were no job opportunities.  It is a vexed issue and many people would resent emigrants having significant representation but it is a valid point.  There are few who do not have some family members living abroad who would love to come home and be involved in the affairs of this State.  This will probably have a very good effect because they will feel they are represented and their voices heard in Dáil Éireann.  This is a very worthy cause which is not getting due recognition.</P>
    <P>We should make more sweeping changes in this Bill.  The changes introduced following the 1992 Bill such as the ban on canvassing on the approaches to polling stations and on posters in the vicinity of the polling station were very desirable.  It stopped the mayhem on election day especially before the closing of the polling booth. The provision that allowed a person to enter his name on the register 18 days prior to the election was very progressive. Prior to that if his name was not on the register on 15 April he would have to wait a full year to get on the register. This measure is another step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I might even go so far as to suggest that canvassing should be banned and we might imitate some of the European states where electioneering is done through the medium of television, radio and newspapers.  I see Deputy Kirk smiling.  He too would love it, and we would not have to suffer the joys of three weeks canvassing and being <Col N="346" /> abused and insulted &mdash; a primitive practice. Elections should be fought on issues which can be aired by the media. I would also be in favour of the list system. If we had a list system and votes for emigrants that would leave fewer candidates to be elected by foot slogging. There would not be a great deal of room for the ordinary Joe Soap, particularly if he was not well in with the party leader &mdash; there are Members who are not well in with the party leader.</P>

      <P>In his reply, the Minister might allude to the Australian system where people are fined for not exercising the vote. Now that we have postal voting for those who are invalided or cannot attend by reason of occupation, the day has come when people should be fined for not exercising the franchise.</P>
      <P>Will the non-party candidate who has failed to get elected get a contribution towards election expenses from the State coffers?  It might be borne in mind that Independent candidates show great courage in putting their names forward, go to considerable expense and put in a great deal of effort but they may end up being beaten by a handful of votes and have nothing to show for it.  They may feel aggrieved that the political party candidates who get fewer votes would benefit from this new provision.</P>
      <P>There is no need to be apologetic for State funding of political parties.  It is a very civilised thing to do and may eliminate the miserable fund raising activities that we have to engage in against our will and will lead to a healthier political system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry Deputy Deasy had not more time to elaborate on his radical views on the electoral system. This Bill affords Members the opportunity to focus on the functioning of the <Col N="347" /> political system.  It proposes the establishment on a statutory basis of an independent constituency commission for Dáil and European elections.  It deals with State funding for political parties and proposes to impose a limit on election expenditure by political parties and individual candidates.  There are proposals to introduce new voting arrangements for voters who are unable because of their occupation to cast their votes in their local polling station.  There are proposals for more expeditious methods of dealing with the count.</P>
      <P>One of the more significant proposals is the establishment on a statutory basis of the Constituency Commission.  The principle of an independent constituency commission review is long accepted and it is not realistic to expect that the recommendations of any commission will find favour with every individual Member, aspiring Members or political parties.  It will not be possible to bring forward recommendations that will placate and please everybody in the political arena.  One may ask why it is necessary to establish a constituency commission on a statutory basis.  Are we effectively saying we are dissatisfied with the present arrangement and that the proposed arrangement will be more satisfactory?  No matter what system we operate the most important thing will be to set down terms of reference because all subsequent decisions will be dictated by the terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One or two Members referred to the protection of provincial and county boundaries.  It is clearly a sensitive issue to take a slice of one county and make it an adjunct of another county to make up a deficiency in population in a constituency. In the past, portions of my constituency in County Louth, together with a portion of County Meath, were redefined to make up a deficiency in numbers in the core constituency of Monaghan.  There was much dissatisfaction among the people living in the portions which were redefined, and a yearning to get back to their natural home.  The same problems exist in other <Col N="348" /> constituencies which are similarly affected.</P>
    <P>Contact with Oireachtas Members is determined by the geography of a constituency. I represent what could be classified as the most urbanised rural constituency in the country because approximately two-thirds of the electorate reside in Dundalk and Drogheda, not so speak of other significant towns such as Ardee.  In many ways the constituency is a microcosm of the country, containing the whole spectrum of social and economic life in a relatively small geographic area.</P>
    <P>Yesterday Deputy Sheehan outlined the hardships of representing a huge farflung constituency such as the one he represents in that beautiful part of County Cork.  One could compare that with the population of the constituencies in the capital city where Dáil Deputies are virtually within walking distance of every elector.  Will the new commission have regard to this, or will it merely deal with the population density within already existing bands?  I do not envisage any significant change, but in the context of the debate on this Bill this is something that should be considered. There is huge movement of population towards the east coast, with a consequent impact on constituencies on the western seaboard and in the south.  It begs the question whether the political system should take account of population movement.</P>
    <P>Other Members have correctly stated that this country and the UK are the two remaining states in the European Union that have no State funding for political parties.  The provision of such funding is a move in the right direction because it is becoming increasingly difficult for political parties to raise money to keep the general administration and operation of their parties functioning. There has been much adverse comment about the proposal to provide State funding for political parties, but the political party system is the core of our democratic system.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that Fine Gael, and my <Col N="349" /> own party, Fianna Fáil, have been having problems with accumulating debt in recent years, due to increased expenditure on general administration, combined with the increased expenditure involved in fighting elections which have been called with great regularity in recent years.  All parties have probably expended too much money on postering and advertising generally because it was the consensus that spending money on election campaigns would ensure success. Experience has taught us otherwise, and a new prudence has crept into the attitude of those in political parties who make decisions regarding expenditure.</P>
    <P>Most, if not all, politicians would admit that the biggest single danger is the mood of cynicism among the public about politicians and the political system which does not make it easier for election candidates to operate.  The mood of cynicism is a matter of degree, but if it were to grow, it would make it very difficult to campaign, not to mention raise money to keep the political parties going.</P>
    <P>Most Members of the House would agree that there is a deficiency of research and backup facilities for Opposition parties and politicians.  There is no such thing as a free lunch any more &mdash; good research facilities cost money.  It may be possible to get people to operate voluntarily over a short time, but to have a research facility available on a continuous basis one must have resources.  It must be to the betterment of the political system to have such backup available to the parties and politicians in Opposition.  I have limited experience of meeting delegations and deputations including, for example, representatives of the IFA, the trade union movement and the employers' organisation, IBEC.  Such organisations have considerable resources available to them.  The economic units within those organisations are very significant and clearly do an excellent job.  The representatives of such organisations coming to meet a Minister or Minister of State are often better informed than the <Col N="350" /> Minister about the issues they want to discuss.  It is a sign that the political system is collapsing if the Minister of the day is bereft of such up-to-the-minute knowledge, but that has been the experience of many politicians meeting such groups.</P>
    <P>The ending of dependency on private funding is a step in the right direction. The perception is that if there is an over-dependence by politicians on private funding, there must be an inherent payback.  If funding from the public purse helps to eradicate that perception, we will have done a good day's work.  Section 4 of the Bill deals with disclosure of donations.  I support the maximum disclosure principle in the interests of transparency and openness.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before awarding a consultancy contract my Department generally invites at least three firms to tender, in line with the general rules for their engagement as set out in the Department of Finance's <i>Public Procurement</i> booklet. However in exceptional cases, where clear justification exists for engaging a person with particular expertise, such <Col N="351" /> specialists are engaged without competitive tendering.  The total cost of such a contract would not usually exceed £5,000 but where it does, the sanction of the Minister for Finance is secured before payment.</P>
    <P>The outturn, or expected outturn, on consultancy services in recent years has been: £10,500 in 1991, £6,000 in 1992, £113,500 in 1993, £362,000 in 1994 and £90,000 in 1995.  In 1993 the increase was caused mainly by the engagement on contract of Nemesis and Carr Communications, to provide additional expertise within the Department to assist the then Taoiseach and the then Ministers of State.  In 1994, £259,000 was spent on consultants, engaged by the Efficiency Audit Group, to carry out a review of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The total 1995 expenditure to date on consultancy services amounts to £48,000.  The projected outturn for the year is £90,000.  The major expenditure has been £20,000 to Andersen Consulting for a study on internal audit systems in the Department and £20,000 for consultancy work commissioned by the Constitution review group.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>May I take it from the Taoiseach's response that, with the exception of the appointment of an expert &mdash; if there is only one expert there cannot be competitive tendering &mdash; the appointment of consultants is always put out to tender?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In respect of small items of business, where the administrative and other costs involved in seeking tenders would be excessive, a fee is often agreed.  Such contracts would not normally exceed £5,000, but where they do the sanction of the Department of Finance is sought.  The overwhelming majority of consultants are appointed on the basis of a tendering procedure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach saying that there is not often a commercial reason for not putting projects out to <Col N="352" /> tender?  Is the Taoiseach saying that tendering is the normal commercial behaviour?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Tendering is the normal way to proceed in any case in which one wants to get value for money. However, there may be exceptions in respect of small business items, when a person with special expertise is sought or when one must act quickly.  However, the overwhelming majority of consultancies awarded by the Department are done on a tendering basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a widely held view in semi-State companies and elsewhere that the best commercial bargain is not always got by way of tender and that there are other ways of dealing with the matter.  Will the Taoiseach comment in that regard?  Is he saying it is tender or nothing in all cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Competition is good for business in any area of life and if a number of people are allowed compete, one will obtain the best price.  That is common sense and is provided for in the Department of Finance guidelines on public business.  It is also important to point out that when dealing with public business, as distinct from commercial private business, one is dealing with somebody else's money.  We must be seen to be more careful in such dealings than in the case of a private business deal and that applies to Government and State companies.  When State companies sell assets or place business they are dealing with assets that ultimately belong to the people and, therefore, great care must be taken to be transparently competitive, effective and cost conscious in the way the business is placed.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The two Governments are continuing our intensive efforts to advance matters towards allinclusive talks on a settlement.  Within that context, we are working with all the relevant parties, including the US Administration, to find a way forward on the basis of the `twin-track' approach, which would address the issue of decommissioning and the groundwork for all-party talks.  As that work is ongoing, I believe it would be unhelpful to give further details at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed with <Col N="356" /> the Taoiseach's response, because Government sources have been briefing the media overnight.  The Taoiseach should have been more forthcoming here.  Have the two Governments reached agreement in principle on the establishment of this commission and have they asked particular persons to serve on the commission?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not asked any particular persons to serve on the commission, nor have we agreed on names of persons who might serve on a commission or panel or whatever it is to be described as.  The Tánaiste had a constructive meeting yesterday with the Secretary of State, on which he will report to the House later.  There was a welcome agreement between the Tánaiste and the Secretary of State on the &ldquo;twin track&rdquo; approach.  A common hope was expressed that, an international body could take an objective and creative look at the arms issue to see how the deficit of trust that currently exists between some of the parties on the arms issue could be overcome. As a result of the Tánaiste's work with the Secretary of State, openness was expressed by the British Government subsequent to the meeting, which was welcome.  It probably bears out the guarded optimism I have been expressing on this subject in the House and for which I have been criticised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is too early yet to answer that question.  We have not agreed on a format, description, or detailed terms of reference that would enable me to answer the Deputy's question precisely, but it is fair to say there has been quite an amount of movement in recent times, notably in the Tánaiste's meeting yesterday with Sir Patrick Mayhew.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that there will be detailed terms <Col N="357" /> of reference for the commission?  In recent weeks, there has been speculation about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two stages to this.  We have to get everybody to agree to co-operate with the commission to give undertakings to the commission that will be capable of being transmitted to others by the commissioner panel on a basis that will be acceptable to other people.  Arising from that, there will be a detailed or otherwise description of the <i>modus operandi</i> of the body, commission or panel.  The second stage flows, to some degree, from the first.  I am not certain at this stage, and we could not say how detailed the terms of reference will be but they will be sufficiently detailed to enable everybody to work constructively with the commission, to accept its bona fides and to accept that it will take an objective and creative look at the arms issue and help all to find a way through the distrust around that issue.  I cannot say at this stage whether the terms of reference will be one, two or ten paragraphs long and the Deputy would not expect me to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Without pursuing that, the Taoiseach will recall that the matter of the terms of reference created the great difficulty last time around.  I will not push the issue now but I will watch what happens.  On the &ldquo;twin track&rdquo; approach, it seems to have been pursued overnight.  Will the Taoiseach confirm if we should read into that, that the decommissioning panel will commence work prior to President Clinton's visit and certainly prior to Christmas and that all-party talks will start after Christmas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be cautious in reading dates into anything said at this stage, because we have not finalised the matter.  While much progress has been made, notably at the meeting on Monday, there still remains an amount of work to be done.  We have to get all the relevant people to agree or <Col N="358" /> indicate a sufficient level of agreement so that we can proceed.  As I have explained this is not simply a matter between the two Governments; there are other parties whose co-operation is essential if this process is to work.  While the Governments might be able to reach agreement comparatively easily, that does not mean we have agreement.  We have to be sure that others whose co-operation is equally important also go along with what is being done.  That is part of what is going on at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>So we know what &ldquo;twin track&rdquo; means.  Would it be correct to say that the decommissioning group, body, agency or panel &mdash; whatever the Taoiseach finally calls it &mdash; would commence its work prior to all-party talks or are we talking about parallel issues? Up until now, we believed the &ldquo;twin track&rdquo; approach was a decommissioning panel working first and then all-party talks within a number of weeks.  I accept that we must get everybody on board but what is the plan?  What is the Taoiseach trying to achieve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The plan is, broadly speaking, the same as previously in so far as the commission or panel will do some of its work prior to the start of round table talks, but that does not mean that, in the earlier period, all parties might not talk to one another.  The round table phase where all parties are talking to one another in the same room will not commence until there has been an initial amount of work done and reports given by the body in question. That has been the approach all along and it has not changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not.  There will not be a summit within the next week. On the other hand, I am ready to meet the Prime Minister at any time when we have all the necessary work completed. If the Deputy asked me to anticipate if there would be one within the next week, I would say &ldquo;no&rdquo; although much progress has been made.  I expect to talk to the Prime Minister during the week to further advance discussions I have had with him recently and to build on the progress made by the Tánaiste.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach try to bring all the parties together?  Will he continue in the intervening period, before the decommissioning panel commences its work, with the phase two talks between the Dublin Government and the Northern parties?  Is it his intention to keep that process moving?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a problem of nomenclature here.  The talks we had with the various Northern parties were free-standing talks with an open agenda to which we invited them.  They were not necessarily part of any process. They were not a part of phase two.  If we had billed them as being part of the second strand <i>per se,</i> they might not have occurred.  They were free-standing justifiable contacts between this Government and the parties in Northern Ireland, which is something we should have all the time.  It is a great pity there has been a gap of a quarter of a century between the last meeting of a Taoiseach and the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party and my meeting with Mr. David Trimble, but that gap has now been bridged and we have had those meetings.  I hope we will be able to have further meetings but I would not wish to place them in any strand; they are meetings justifiable in themselves.</P>

      <P>Would it not be advisable, under strand II or in informal talks, to try to get the parties in Northern Ireland to agree with the terms of reference you are putting forward to the panel?  Otherwise you are running straight into the difficulty you were in before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that, in principle.  However, bearing in mind that my meeting with Mr. Trimble was the first between a Taoiseach and the leader of the Unionist Party for 25 years, I would not have expected us to reach agreement on everything on the agenda during the first such contact. Many other contacts, informal and otherwise, are taking place between the Governments and all the parties in Northern Ireland with a view to reaching agreement.  We are looking for all inclusive talks which means not just having republicans and Nationalists at the table but Unionists too.  It is very important that they should participate because common sense suggests that you cannot have an agreement with people who are not present.</P>

Such persons are excluded from the live register because of their strong job attachment.</P>
    <P>(c)  UA smallholders had been excluded from the Register since 1966.  Other self-employed persons in receipt of UA as a means of income support were also excluded with effect from May 1992.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accept that, when one includes those on community employment schemes, there are approximately 60,000 people who do have a real job and who are not included in the live register figures?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>People working on FÁS schemes of a community nature or otherwise, and who are very fruitfully employed, would find the experience of employment very invigorating indeed. No one could seriously suggest that, in <Col N="362" /> terms of the work they do or the benefits they derive therefrom, they are not gainfully employed.</P>

      <P>I am asking the Minister a statistical question which both his Leader and the Minister for Enterprise and Employment raised on this point when they were in Opposition.  At the time, they forcefully said that our figures grossly underestimate the extent of unemployment in this economy.  Would the Minister accept that is a fact?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The fact is that FÁS and community employment schemes have become a feature of modern life.  They were introduced specifically to help communities as well as providing gainful employment to people who are legitimately unemployed.  In terms of their contribution to the economy, to the community and to themselves, such people can be categorised as being very gainfully employed indeed.  The Deputy will also be aware that there have been substantial revisions of the conditions applying to the schemes enabling people to continue the work in which they are currently involved.</P>
      <P>Most of the recommendations concerning the exclusion of those on pre-retirement schemes, week on/week off and the self-employed, were made by way of a commission and study carried out when the Deputy was a Minister of State in the Government up to 1992.</P>

    <P>The Minister may not have the information, but statistics for employment, as opposed to unemployment, are woefully inadequate.  The last on employment date from spring 1994.  No school leaver surveys appear to have been conducted <Col N="363" /> in the recent past either.  Perhaps the Minister of State would look into that.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, there is an ongoing review of the accuracy of statistics.  The definitive survey of unemployed and employed people is the labour force survey which is carried out once a year.  While this is the subject matter of another question, we are actively looking at this at present.  However, the up-to-date statistics in terms of timeliness are the live register figures because they are compiled on a monthly basis.  The checking, cross-checking, monitoring and evaluating of statistics is an ongoing process in the Central Statistics Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 60 together.  The Central Statistics Office produces a wide range of economic statistics.  I am satisfied that these are reliable and generally compiled in accordance with international standards. The methods used in compiling these statistics are the subject of continuous review at both national and international level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office published the findings of its detailed study of the accuracy and consistency of the statistical data, particularly trade data, available from the largest companies <Col N="364" /> last June in conjunction with the publication of the 1994 national income and expenditure results.  I will forward a copy of their report to the Deputies.</P>
    <P>The forthcoming report of the Inter-departmental Committee on Trade and National Income statistics will incorporate the findings of the Central Statistics Office's detailed study.  The work of the interdepartmental committee is complete and the report is being finalised for submission to the Government in the coming weeks.  I expect that following consideration of the report by the Government, it will then be published. The terms of reference of the report did not include consideration of the adequacy or otherwise of employmentlabour force statistics.</P>
    <P>The Central Statistics Office is also organising, with the Irish Economic Association, a conference on measuring economic growth to be held in November at which the current methodology of national accounts will be discussed.</P>

      <P>Is an investigation under way in the Department of the Taoiseach in relation to our GDP figures? When I asked this question some six months ago I was given an answer of that kind although, unfortunately, I do not have it with me.  If my memory serves me correctly, I was told an investigation was going on at the Department of the Taoiseach and that it would be completed shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies have queried the relevance of the adjustments in terms of GDP and growth.  However, any reservations expressed about the accuracy of the overall trade figures, following the introduction of the Interstat system in 1993, have proved to be unfounded.  The Central Statistics Office's detailed examination of various statistical returns received from the most important companies, who together account for over 50 per cent of total exports, produced two conclusions. The first was that the accuracy of the overall trade statistics was confirmed <Col N="365" /> and, second, that some very minor adjustments are required for balance of payments purposes to take account of the increasingly complex trading and accounting practices engaged in by a small number of major companies. However, these necessary adjustments had only a very slight impact on our trade balance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, the Minister did not answer my question.  The Minister may be aware that in the German Parliament, in February this year, questions were asked about the Irish GDP figures.  When I made inquiries I was told that a high level group in the Department of the Taoiseach was examining this matter.  I asked the Minister of State if he could tell me why, uniquely in Ireland, there is a 14 per cent gap between our GNP and GDP figures. Will he accept that the gap exists because of the impact of transfer pricing on those figures and that, therefore, GDP is not a reliable statistic for use in this economy in relation to key decisions we will make, like joining the European Monetary Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already acknowledged that some adjustments have had to be made.  The trade statistics have been minuscule.  The growth rate for recent years was revised in the 1994 national income expenditure release, for technical reasons.  In line with normal practice, the base year for valuing the national accounts was updated from 1985 to 1990.  The effect of this technical rebasing and associated methodological improvements was to reduce annual growth rate between 1988 and 1993, as measured on the expenditure basis, by approximately 1 per cent per annum.  The effect of the output base measure was significantly less than that, at approximately 0.2 per cent per annum.  Overall the growth rate in recent years was shown to be around 0.6 per cent lower than that shown by the 1985 base series.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, this type of rebasing is a normal feature of the compilation of <Col N="366" /> national accounts.  On this occasion it had a greater than usual impact because of the differing trends in prices over the 1985-90 period.  The revised growth estimate provides a credible picture of the performance of the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>As regards the point made by the Deputy about the impact of transfer pricing on trade statistics and the measurement of economic growth, as I said in my initial reply, the interdepartmental group was asked to look into these matters.  Its report is now being finalised.  The CSO and the Irish Economic Association, which I already mentioned, will present papers on a range of relevant issues, including transfer pricing. These matters are the subject of discussion and examination and the results will be published in due course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Harney asked an important question because this is a live debate internationally.  I accept what the Minister said, although the people who gave him his briefing notes know my views on this issue.  I set up the interdepartmental group, but it is difficult to sustain its arguments.</P>
      <P>Ireland has the worst record of up-to-date statistics.  For example, the latest trade figures are for April.  How can economic policy decisions be formulated from out of date data?  What measures are being taken to isolate the impact of the sector on GDP and GNP figures?  The impact of the sector on GNP growth rates seems high.  GNP growth in 1990 is estimated to have been 8 per cent, yet the number employed remained unchanged that year.  No other country could have an 8 per cent growth rate without a change in employment.  When I was Minister for Finance last year GNP was estimated at 7.4 per cent.  Such high growth rates are rarely achieved anywhere else in the developed world.  I cannot say I was the best Minister for Finance in the developed world, although I know I am brilliant.</P>

      <P>As regards the profits of multinationals and the possible distortion of the figures, some 80 per cent of the profits of foreign owned corporations are repatriated and not included in the calculation of GNP.  If 100 per cent of such profits were excluded from GNP calculations, it would reduce the rate by only 0.3 per cent, which is minuscule.</P>

      <P>I set up the working group to try to deal with these problems. The overstating of GNP has the potential to cause serious problems for the country as regards grant negotiations in the EU because most of the grant criteria are based on the country's GNP and the European Union average. The Tánaiste should note this because he must negotiate the next round of Structural Funds.  If we overstate our GNP figures, we will disqualify ourselves from EU grants.</P>

      <P>The overseas tourism and travel statistics published by the Central Statistics Office are based on returns from transport companies which give the total passenger movement by route of travel; the country of residence survey which is used to estimate the distribution by country of residence of each route &mdash; the survey covered 142,000 inward and 150,000 outward passengers in 1994; and the passenger card inquiry which is used to estimate for various areas of residence the reason for the journey, the length of stay, expenditure and fare costs.  This survey covered 114,000 inward and 162,000 outward passengers in 1994.  The three sources are combined to provide quarterly and annual estimates of the number of visits to Ireland by persons who are usually resident overseas.</P>
      <P>It is worth noting that Irish residents returning from visits abroad and the number of visits abroad by Irish residents are excluded.

      <P>The only source of comprehensive information on employment and unemployment is the labour force survey, which covers a sample of about 45,000 households.  The 1995 survey is currently being processed by the Central Statistics Office and preliminary results will be published on 24 October 1995.  This survey is, however, only conducted annually.  While some direct sectoral surveys of businesses and other employers are conducted more frequently none of them provides an economy-wide picture of the current employment situation as does the labour force survey.</P>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office, in conjunction with the National Statistics Board, is examining the feasibility and cost of conducting a quarterly household survey covering labour force and other social topics to replace the existing annual labour force survey and will submit proposals to Government shortly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The definitive source of data on employment and unemployment is the labour force survey, comprised of an annual sample of the employment circumstances of 45,000 households.  The relevant fieldwork is undertaken in April.  The live register is compiled monthly.  From the point of view of co-ordination and synchronisation of the two surveys, we are examining the feasibility of producing comprehensive sub-annual employment estimates, in other words, quarterly labour force surveys, with a view to reducing the disparity between the two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="372" /> However, in any such exercise one must take into consideration the present cost of the annual labour force survey, at £1.3 million.  Any proposal to compile such a survey more frequently would entail a considerable cost factor which must be taken into account.  The general wish would appear to be far more regular labour force survey returns and data in the interests both of accuracy and of portraying a true economic picture.</P>

      <P>The timeliness of economic statistics is a matter of the <Col N="373" /> highest priority for the Central Statistics Office, whose objective is to ensure the key economic data are available with the minimum possible delay.</P>
      <P>In the case of the external trade statistics, and by extension the balance of payments statistics, for which the merchandise trade balance is the main component, I want to give a brief explanation of why the timeliness deteriorated in 1993.</P>
      <P>When the Single Market was completed in January 1993, customs declarations were no longer required for the movements of goods within the European Union.  Since these declarations were the source of the trade statistics, a new system was needed to collect the data.  This new survey system &mdash; called Intrastat &mdash; was introduced in all EU countries in January 1993.  The Intrastat survey is conducted by the Revenue Commissioners, while estimation, data analysis and publication is the responsibility of the Central Statistics Office. Trade with non-EU countries continues to be based on customs documents.</P>
      <P>Before 1993, trade statistics were far more timely than most other economic statistics because traders had to complete customs documentation in order to ensure the speedy movement of goods.  The Intrastat data collection system has lost this advantage, and is subject to the non-response and timeliness difficulties common to all direct statistical inquiries.</P>
      <P>The delays experienced in the publication of the monthly statistics in 1993 were severe: the average timelag was 33 weeks, compared with eight to ten weeks under the old system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the first year of operation, efforts were necessarily focused on consolidating the new system.  When a full year's results had been published, a joint CSO/Revenue review group was established.  One of the main issues examined was timeliness.  The review group reported in December 1994.  As a result of the review, additional resources have been allocated to the VIMA Office &mdash; the branch of the Revenue Commissioners responsible for the <Col N="374" /> Intrastat survey &mdash; and greater emphasis has been placed on the earlier compilation compliance by traders.  Progress has been made in recent months.  The most recent release, for April 1995, was published with a timelag of 23 weeks.  It is anticipated that the monthly timelag should be down to 16/17 weeks during 1996.  The ability to make further improvements beyond this point will be completly dependent on traders sending in their returns more quickly.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not the only country experiencing delays in the publication of trade statistics.  The change from an administrative to survey-based system of collecting the basic data has resulted in all EU countries being confronted by major problems in the collection, compilation and analysis of their trade statistics.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I commented on aspects of this matter earlier.  During his period in office will the Minister of State do all he can to ensure that our general statistics are up to date?  Appropriate decisions cannot be made on economic policy when working on figures which in some cases may be 18 months and are usually six months out of date.  Apart from the excuse given about what happened in 1993 or 1994, I am sure those statistics are correct.  Will the Minister ask the CSO to ensure we have up to date trade statistics and seek to secure necessary figures from traders and others who do not comply with its requirements?</P>

      <P>What the Deputy is seeking is desirable and necessary, but as he will appreciate from his perspective when in Government there will be some teething problems when there is a dramatic change from one compilation system to another.  Although there are major teething problems in this regard, we are not alone in that as other countries have experienced similar problems. The CSO is trying to ensure the maximum level of compliance.  Following a review group's report a number of steps are being taken to improve the <Col N="375" /> timeliness of the response from traders to ensure we receive necessary documentation and answers to queries.  Traders, particularly the large ones, are being pursued more virorously by the Revenue Commissioners to submit their returns.  Traders who have not responded are being contacted by telephone or by personal visit.  Such contacts have been made on an earlier occasion and are being pursued to a greater extent now than was the case in the past.  The Revenue Commissioners have a number of court cases pending involving traders who persistently respond late or do not respond at all. They are contacting larger traders who still submit paper returns to persuade as many as possible to submit their returns electronically as early as possible.</P>

Given that he is unable to give accurate employment statistics for the timber industry, will he arrange for the position to be reviewed and return with correct information, particularly having regard to the fact that his colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, said that in 1995 the number of jobs in that industry will increase by only 58, bringing the total employed in it to 1,258?</P>

      <P>Developments during the year have related mainly to the implementation of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development.  The operational programme was formally launched on 2 February 1995.  I have overall co-ordinating responsibility for this operational programme and specific responsibility for Sub Programme II, <i>Integrated Development of Designated Disadvantaged and Other Areas,</i> which is managed by an independent intermediary company, Area Development Management (ADM) Ltd.</P>
      <P>In relation to the designated areas I have confirmed the boundaries of the 35 areas where the Partnership Companies will operate.  This includes the new area as well as the original 12 pilot partnerships, six of which are being extended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="379" /> ADM Ltd. is proceeding with the process of assessing applications from community groups and sectoral organisations under Sub Programme II which were not covered by the partnerships and has recently allocated technical assistance funding to a number of community groups.</P>
    <P>On 3 March 1995, I announced a new framework for the operation of community employment in the partnership areas.  In these areas community employment now operates on the basis of an annual programme agreed between FÁS and the partnership.</P>
    <P>The operational programme provides that in each county the local development initiatives will be co-ordinated through the mechanism of the county strategy groups.  A liaison team has been established in the Department of the Taoiseach to contact the relevant organisations and groups, make arrangements for the first meeting and act as the link between the groups and the Department. To date nine county strategy groups have met.</P>
    <P>A seminar &ldquo;Working Together in Partnership: Local Development in Ireland&rdquo; was held in Galway on 14 and 15 September last.</P>
    <P>I have invited the OECD to undertake a comprehensive review of national policies to promote local development.</P>
    <P>The URBAN Initiative is a European Union initiative intended to help find solutions to the serious social problems in urban areas.  In July last I was able to announce that agreement had been reached with the European Commission that three areas in Ireland would be helped under the initiative.  The detailed arrangements for the implementation of the initiative in those areas are at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15, 42, 47 and 52 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to respond <Col N="382" /> to these questions, all of which address important security and defence policy issues that arise for Ireland, and indeed for our EU partners, in the context of the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference (IGC).</P>
    <P>I visited Finland between 2 and 4 October, and had meetings with President Athtisaari, Prime Minister Lipponen and Foreign Minister Halonen. We had very useful discussions on a range of issues, including the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference review of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, which will include, as specified by Article J.4. of that Treaty, the &ldquo;question of a common defence policy for the Union, which might in time lead to a common defence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Among the elements that emerged from these discussions were the following: first, both Ireland and Finland support a comprehensive concept of security and believe this should provide the context for the further development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. Second, both Ireland and Finland have made an important contribution, over the years, to international peace-keeping and humanitarian operations, and we have both identified this as an area in which we could make a contribution at the European level.</P>
    <P>Third, both Ireland and Finland find observer status in the Western European Union to be useful, particularly as the preparations for the Intergovernmental Conference are advancing.  Finland has made clear that it is willing to contribute to the Western European Union Petersburg talks in regard to peace-keeping and humanitarian operations, and search and rescue tasks.  This is an area where I see potential for Ireland, in view of our accumulated expertise in peace-keeping and humanitarian work, to make a contribution. Finland, along with Austria and Sweden, are providing police for the Western European Union policy component of the EU Administration of Mostar.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="383" /> Fourth, on the question of the future institutional relationship between the EU and the Western European Union, both Ireland and Finland see this as a matter for the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations themselves.  While the various institutional options are currently being explored in both the Reflection Group and in the Western European Union &mdash; which is preparing its own input for the Intergovernmental Conference &mdash; we have made it clear that it is our preference to avoid any attempts to prejudge or narrow down the options at this stage.  As would be expected, it was clear from our discussions that Ireland and Finland, two neutral countries who have remained outside military alliances, have much in common in our analysis and approach to these issues.</P>
    <P>I also had the opportunity while in Helsinki to outline our approach to the range of issues that arise in the Intergovernmental Conference context, including the review of the CFSP.  I addressed the Paasikivi Society &mdash; a forum for the discussion of foreign policy issues similar to the Institute of European Affairs here in Dublin.  The topic was, &ldquo;The 1996 Intergovernmental Conference: an Irish view&rdquo;.  In summary, I outlined the Government's policy, based on the six principles which underlie our approach to any developments in the security area.  The Taoiseach and I outlined these principles in a number of speeches and statements over the past year.  A copy of my speech has been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>
    <P>Deputies may recall that these principles do not envisage membership of any military alliance.  They make clear that the Government is committed to putting to the people in a referendum any outcome of the Intergovernmental Conference that would involve Ireland in a common defence policy.  This will ensure that Ireland's policy of military neutrality will remain unchanged unless the people themselves decide otherwise.</P>
    <P>As to whether Ireland has been asked <Col N="384" /> to join a European Army, in the European Union or an other context, the answer is no.  The Government is not aware of any proposals for a European Army, and even if such proposals were to be forthcoming, which is highly unlikely, they would not form the basis for agreement in the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister continues to make great play of the fact that any proposals that emanate from the Intergovernmental Conference will be put to the people if there are indications of any change in our military neutrality stance but avoids telling us his attitude and what proposals he will be putting to the Intergovernmental Conference and to the Western European Union where we have observer status.  What is his preference?  Will he elaborate on the comprehensive concept of security he shares with the Finns?  What point of view is he putting on behalf of the people which might eventually result in the need for a referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware from comments his party leader made on the speeches made by the Taoiseach and myself on comprehensive European security architecture.  It is worth recalling the component principles of Ireland's foreign policy on which our negotiations will be based: we want to play a constructive role in the negotiations in the run up to the Intergovernmental Conference; the primary objective of the common security and defence policy must be the preservation of peace in accordance with the UN and OSCE principles; European Union security and defence arrangements must form part of a comprehensive co-operative security framework in Europe and must not lead to new divisions in Europe; European security must be examined in the broadest context possible taking environmental and economic considerations into account and European security and defence policy must be compatible with Ireland's objectives in the areas of disarmament and arms control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="385" /> The outcome of any negotiations which would involve Ireland's participation in a common defence policy will be put to the people in a referendum as was the case in the Programme for Government between the Deputy's party and the Labour Party.</P>

      <P>Before calling Deputy Burke again I must state I am anxious to facilitate the Deputies who have tabled the other priority questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important fundamental question for the Irish people who believe in a non-military alliance.  I accept the principles the Minister listed but what is his bottom line in relation to the negotiations?  Is he recommending that Ireland join the Western European Union as a full member.  Is he recommending a Western European Union alliance or is he recommending partnership for peace? Where exactly does the Minister stand on the question of military neutrality?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to Deputy Burke, who has been a Member of this House for a long time, he is asking me to outline the bottom line in relation to negotiations which are eight or ten months away, if not longer.  As the Intergovernmental Conference may not conclude until 1997 the Deputy would regard that as unwise.  I see a particular role for Ireland.  We have enjoyed the role of observer status in the Western European Union; a decision which was made when Deputy Burke was in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We have looked at the contribution we can make to the Petersburg talks in regard to humanitarian operations, peace-keeping and search and rescue tasks.  We need to elaborate, in a positive way, on the contribution we can make.  We do not have to apologise to anybody for the stance we took in the post.  We have a proud record of service <Col N="386" /> in the United Nations and we have a great deal of experience.  In both the Reflection Group and the Western European Union &mdash; which is carrying out its own review &mdash; a range of options is emerging on the future institutional relationship between the EU and the Western European Union.  They range from a full merger, which has been suggested, through to maintaining each as separate organisations which would enhance co-operation between them.  At this stage the Reflection Group and the Western European Union are expected to come forward with possible options. This would be consistent with out preference that there should be no attempt to narrow the options or to prejudice the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations.  That is the position and I think the Deputy understands the Government's stance in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the principle of participation and that we make ourselves available at EU level, as we have done with regard to the UN.  We have a proud record of participating in peace-keeping and other exercises on behalf of the UN.  I see no reason that cannot be done at EU level or on a case by case basis.  I put down a marker to the Minister, my party will not support any idea of joining partnership for peace, full membership of the Western European Union or full membership of NATO.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Taoiseach made clear in his statement to the House on 28 September, the meeting of EU Heads of State or Government which took place in Majorca on 22 and 23 September was an informal meeting.  It was not a meeting of the European Council and Foreign Ministers were not present.</P>
      <P>No specific decisions were taken or conclusions adopted at Majorca.</P>
      <P>In his statement to the House on 28 September the Taoiseach also set out, against the background of the Majorca meeting, the general Irish approach to future enlargement and made it clear that the timescale foreseen by the European Council meetings in Corfu and Essen with regard to enlargement negotiations remains unaltered.  In this regard the Deputy will recall that the Corfu and Essen European Council conclusions refer to the need to create the institutional conditions for ensuring the proper functioning of the Union at the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference, which for that reason must take place before accession negotiations begin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the informal <Col N="388" /> meeting which took place in Majorca but may I ask the Tánaiste about the need to reassure the Russian Federation that its interests will be protected and not jeopardised by enlargement of the European Union?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Union, both at Foreign Minister and Heads of State level, is conscious of the necessity of maintaining good relations with the Russian Federation.  In fact, I participated in discussions with Foreign Minister Kosyrev when I was at the United Nations in New York recently and that necessity was reinforced.  All the negotiations with the central and East European countries will have that in mind. As the Deputy knows, we have signed the economic agreement with the Russian Federation and there are prospects for developing that relationship. Obviously we do not want to create new divisions in Europe in terms of the future of the European Union or indeed the relationship with the Russian Federation and I believe there are prospects for enhancing that relationship in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Tánaiste raise the question of the concern of the Irish people about the ongoing French nuclear tests in the South Pacific at the Majorca Summit?  If so, was there any satisfactory response from the French in relation to cancelling the remaining tests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware that I raised the matter of the French nuclear tests at every available opportunity from Cannes to the more recent meeting at Santander.  The Taoiseach also raised it at his meeting.  The matter will continue to be raised to express the genuine and deep-rooted concerns of the Irish people which I share.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 33, 67 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's consistent objective has been to secure the total decommissioning of all illegally-held weapons and explosives.  The question is how this essential objective of removing all arms from the equation is to be achieved.  It is our considered view that this goal is, regrettably, unlikely to be attained other than within the dynamic of a negotiating process.  At the same time, we fully understand the real fears and anxieties which surround the issue, and the absence of trust which it generates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason we have advocated a &ldquo;twin-track&rdquo; solution to the present <Col N="390" /> statement, and this approach is now being constructively explored by the various parties.  It envisages that an international body would make an evaluation of the arms issue, hopefully in a way that eased some of the fears to which I referred.  At the same time the Governments would jointly launch an intensive effort to lay the groundwork for the earliest possible start to the round-table negotiations which are essential if the peace process is to be underpinned by an agreed political settlement.</P>
    <P>It is of course crucial that such negotiations take place exclusively on the basis of democratic values, and without recourse to threats of violence by any of the participants.  Beyond this key requirement, and the obvious need for a generally acceptable basis and format for talks, the Irish Government has no requirements of its own to put forward and we would not wish to set preconditions for talks.</P>
    <P>This Government and the previous one has consistently taken the view since the cessations of violence last year that Sinn Féin and the loyalist parties have met the criteria for entry to full political dialogue.  The sustained observance of the IRA ceasefire since August 1994 makes its own significant point in that respect.  The President of Sinn Féin has a made a number of statements, including joint statements with the Irish Government, confirming his party's commitment to exclusively peaceful and democratic means.  Nevertheless, I am aware that others do not fully share our confidence, and for that reason I welcome all efforts by Sinn Féin, and by the PUP and the UDP, to respond meaningfully to the anxieties expressed.  Mr. Adams's statement of 9 October represented a welcome and constructive attempt to offer further assurances regarding his party's intentions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the present position that the Government is sponsoring a new approach in which a solemn declaration might be substituted for actual physical decommissioning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="391" />
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have been aware from questions answered by the Taoiseach earlier that a very satisfactory meeting took place in Belfast yesterday between myself and the Minister for Justice and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and his colleagues. The Secretary of State and I were in agreement that the twin-track approach offered the best way out of present difficulties.  We reviewed the various discussions on how the details of such an approach could be worked out to the satisfaction of all concerned.  Our hope is that an international body could take an objective and creative look at the arms issue and how the deficits of trust associated with it could be made good.</P>
      <P>If this exercise it to be meaningful, the results of the work of the body must be examined in an open-minded way and on its merits without any attempt to pre-empt it.  The Secretary of State made clear to me that this was the approach of the British Government and I welcome that.  All-party talks have been the consistent goal of both Governments.  It would not be either appropriate or accurate to speak at this stage of any shifts in policy or otherwise in our joint efforts to remove the obstacles in the way of that goal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked has not been answered.  I asked the Tánaiste to tell us if this is a new approach in which what is envisaged is some form of solemn declaration rather than any actual physical decommissioning. Is this the approach of the British Government and is the Tánaiste aware of the statement this morning, as reported at lunch time, of the Minister of State in the North, Mr. Ancram, who seemed to suggest that whatever interpretations were put on yesterday's meeting, the views of the British Government had not changed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not heard any statements today as I have been engaged in other matters in my office. On the question of interpretation, the <Col N="392" /> Secretary of State gave a press conference after the meeting, as I did, and one can take what was said by both the Secretary of State and myself, which was absolutely consistent.  We have been working with the British Government over a number of months to resolve the present impasse and to move as rapidly as possible to the launch of all-party talks.  We set out yesterday that the considered views of both Governments would be to get on to a twin-track approach, establish the international body or commission to examine the question of the decommissioning of arms and get the parties into either bilateral or trilateral talks with the Governments in relation to setting the agenda for all-party talks at the negotiating table.  That is the approach and, as the Taoiseach said, there is reason for optimism.  There is now a prospect that the impasse which has held up this process for a number of months can be broken and we should all do our utmost to ensure that happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I suppose there is little point in my repeating the question for the third time.  The fact that it has not been answered has its own message. Will the Minister state if the imminent visit of President Clinton at the end of November is seen as a time constraint in regard to these discussions?  Is it proposed that the twin-track approach will be in operation before President Clinton arrives in Ireland?  Can he give some indication of whether any agreement has been reached, even provisionally, on the structure of the decommissioning commission or other arrangement and who might constitute its membership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley, who is a very experienced Member of the House, will appreciate the complexities involved in terms of bringing all the parties into the framework set out yesterday and negotiations will take place to ensure that we are successful in that regard.  He will also appreciate the sensitivities involved and will have seen the statements made by various parties, <Col N="393" /> some of whom have expressed objections to the framework and others who have welcomed it.  That has been one of the difficulties in dealing with the situation in Northern Ireland over the years. Deputies will appreciate that it is probably wiser at this stage not to engage in wide-ranging debate in this House until we can bring all the parties with us.  I trust the Deputies will appreciate the reasons I say that.</P>
      <P>President Clinton's visit to Ireland at the end of November is obviously very important.  The United States has played and continues to play a very constructive role in reaching out to all the parties in Northern Ireland in an even handed way.  The impasse on the twin track approach which has gone on for several months has not been healthy and I hope these matters can be resolved before President Clinton arrives in Ireland.  The time and effort spent by him and his administration in trying to secure economic development and political co-operation in Northern Ireland have been beyond the call of duty.</P>

    <Title>Electoral Bill, 1994: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I had dealt with the provisions in Part IV before the debate was adjourned.  Part V deals with the expenditure by candidates in elections.  This provision contains all the ingredients necessary to give rise to a bureaucratic <Col N="516" /> nightmare as it will not be possible for candidates or their parties to compile a list setting out all the items on which expenditure was incurred in an election campaign.  Given the proposed ceiling on the amount which can be spent during a campaign the potential for false accusations against the candidate or the party he or she represents is very real. As we know from experience, it is easy for unfounded allegations to be made in the political arena.  The obligation then passes to the individual who is the focus of the allegation to refute it.  This Part clearly gives rise to potential difficulties and the Minister would be well advised to give further consideration to it between now and Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the position of people who will not be able to cast their votes on polling day due to occupational considerations etc.  Two days ago I received correspondence in this regard from a constituent who will be in hospital on 24 November.  There is no provision in electoral legislation under which such people can apply for a postal vote.  There is still some time to go before polling day and it should be possible to make some provision for people who will not be able to cast their votes on that day.</P>
      <P>Some Members have referred to the need to initiate a debate about the electoral system as operated.  Even though they may not say it publicly, many Members have stated privately that the potential for waste and duplication on issues which are of no tangible benefit to the public is very real in multi-seat constituencies.  I have no preconceived ideas on a new system but we have reached the stage where urgent consideration should be given to amending the electoral system.  In the past attempts were made to change the system. However, some of these attempts were rooted in proposed constitutional amendments which were not effected at the time for various reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public representatives in multi-seat constituencies make representations on <Col N="517" /> the same issues to local authorities, Government Departments and State agencies and the same response is issued to all of them.</P>
    <P>Some time ago a retired civil servant wrote at considerable length about the enormous waste of time and effort under the current system.  Most Members would concur with that point of view.</P>
    <P>The amount of time Members can devote to dealing with national and constituency issues &mdash; which will have farreaching implications &mdash; and to the preparation of their contributions in this Chamber is minimal.  I do not think this is what the originators of our electoral system had in mind.  Ministers and Ministers of State have a wide range of responsibilities.  I am sure the Minister of State present is looking over his shoulder to see what his constituency colleagues are doing while he is dealing with matters of State.  The electoral system should not be framed in such a way that Ministers and Ministers of State are placed in such a difficult position.  If Members fail to prioritise, they will not last very long.</P>
    <P>There is a range of different systems in use in Europe and beyond.  At a time when the Government is considering possible constitutional changes this is one of the areas that should be addressed urgently.</P>

      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill which will allow some of the remaining problems in politics to be dealt with.  The payment of donations to political parties will be controlled, which is desirable.  It is also desirable that those who make large donations to political parties should be required to declare the amounts involved and there should be limits on the amounts that may be donated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Pattison, has <Col N="518" /> been a Member of this House since 1961.  He made the valid point that if money was the sole criterion he would never have been elected.  Money talks, however, and there have been some classic cases where people with bags of money felt they could buy their way into this House.  The Bill strikes a reasonable balance between the need to get the message across to the public and prevent people making attempts to buy votes.</P>
    <P>The provisions dealing with the disclosure of donations at election time are important.  It is widely believed that there is a certain elite which can buy power and influence by making donations to political parties.  I suspect this is a slight exaggeration, but disclosure is important to help clarify matters.</P>
    <P>Some years ago when Mr. Tony Ryan was accused of supporting a particular political party he responded, if I remember correctly, by writing a letter to the newspapers in which he declared the sums donated to the three main policical parties.  These were in accord with their level of support in the ratings.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been introduced at a time when there is considerable cynicism about politics.  Deputy Deasy claimed that the initial part of the Minister's speech amounted to an apology on behalf of politicians.  The Bill represents another attempt by politicians to justify themselves and to prove their honesty.  When politicians feel they have to do this in many ways they do more harm than good and look even less credible. They should stand up for themselves because if people cannot accept them for what they are, they will not be convinced by an attempt at justification.</P>
    <P>It is time that those who ascribe base motives and venal behaviour to politicians spelled out exactly what they mean and produced the evidence.  During the summer there were hints and allegations of corruption in the planning process.  I do not know if these allegations are true, but the time has come for those who have made them to produce the proof or, alternatively, to desist because of the undesirable effect <Col N="519" /> they have had on the political process. They have proved damaging.</P>
    <P>Politician are no longer able to exert the influence that they could 20 or 50 years ago.  To some degree, they have been marginalised in relation to where the centre of power lies.  In this context I resent the portrayal of politicans as having enormous power and influence and being engaged in low life activity by those who know the score.  This is most unfair and is proving corrosive of the entire political process and dangerous. The public have the right to place power in people's hands.  It is alarming that their confidence in the process has been diminished.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas does not have the significance that it merits in setting the political agenda.  This is being set by certain vested interests, such as the business community and various lobby groups.  In recent times politicians have latched on to this agenda in the hope they will attract some attention.  They have a craving for media coverage which gives rise to undesirable behaviour.  Of necessity, the matters on which emphasis should be placed in this House are quite different from the matters on which emphasis is placed in the media. The agenda is, however, being set in the boardrooms and committee rooms of the various lobby groups.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not address that and perhaps it is beyond the scope of any Bill to do so.  Neither does it address the emphasis placed on political rows, arguments and disagreements.  If we are concerned about making progress we must make a greater effort to seek agreement rather than emphasise discord which has its own short, shallow superficial attractions. There are clear differences between the way politics is conducted in this country and in the UK with its emphasis on Government and Opposition - opposing almost for the sake of it - and the way it is conducted in the European Union where agreement is sought as a way of resolving political differences.  I wonder if the row involving the Minister for Transport, <Col N="520" /> Energy and Communications is of such significance that it should have dominated the business of the House since Deputy Lowry made his statement last August.  It does not merit that level of attention and many people are bored by it.  It is hard to see how it can be justified in view of the high levels of unemployment and the enormous developments taking place which are the subject of debate in Europe.</P>
    <P>It would be useful if research were carried out into what is important in determining the way people vote.  It would save much foolish and futile activity.  Money, time and effort were wasted pressing election literature on people on their way into a polling station and that practice has now been banned. Is it credible that someone going into a polling station would be undecided on the way to cast their vote?  It should have been obvious that people would not be influenced by canvassers giving them literature and shouting names at them at the entrance to polling stations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy mentioned the value of supporting those who legitimately contest elections and do well.  The Bill discriminates against such people.  There are many Independents who command 4,000 or 5,000 votes but fail to be elected.  They have a valid claim on funding when compared to the big political parties and Independent Members of the House.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kirk spoke about the electoral system and the need for change. There is a strong case to be made for a full objective analysis of our electoral system, its anomalies and benefits. However, it is essential to retain the principle of proportional representation as people would not tolerate a change in the system which would allow for a serious deviation in representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the legislation which proposes to alter key areas in the electoral system, particularly as regards funding for political parties, candidates, donations and the constituency boundary commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The establishment of a constituency <Col N="521" /> commission, its terms of reference and constitution is mentioned.  The last census report issued in 1991 and the boundary commission report was published in 1995.  We will probably have an election in 1997.  Since 1991 approximately 8,000 new private apartments have been built under the incentive scheme in the inner city and approximately 3,000 to 4,000 houses have been built by the local authority which means that approximately a quota and a half extra voters were not considered by the commission when it carved up the constituency.</P>
    <P>Time is of the essence.  It is important that the commission is established immediately following the census report and reports within six months.  I am glad that it is an independent commission. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court nominates a Supreme Court or High Court judge, the Ombudsman and the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad sit on the commission by virtue of their office, as does the Secretary of the Department of the Environment, irrespec Minister.  It is as close to  commission as one  terms of reference oblige the commissioners to adhere to natural boundaries in determining constituency boundaries.  The river Liffey is the most natural boundary in the city of Dublin but that boundary is constantly breached in the Dublin Central constituency. It is inexplicable that this should be so.  I am delighted that the commission is being put on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>The funding of political parties is an important matter.  It could be argued that there is a negative side to it in that taxpayer's money will be used but there is the enormous benefit of ensuring transparency as accounts must be audited. There will be no innuendo, insinuations or evidence that certain companies and individuals bankrolled political parties for their own gain, as may have happened in the past.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kirk spoke about the disclosure of donations and the bureaucracy associated with it.  This system operates in Britain, Northern Ireland, the United <Col N="522" /> States and on the Continent so there is no reason it cannot do so here.  As regards the ceiling on expenditure, in common with other Labour Deputies I would like to have £25,000 to spend in my constituency at election time.</P>
    <P>We were reluctant to extend the postal vote in the past.  We are now providing for the thousands of people unable to go to the polling station to vote by virtue of their occupation, and that is highly desirable.  It is proper that people be identified in a Garda station before transmitting their vote by post.</P>
    <P>We have avoided regulating voting by prisoners.  There is no statutory obstacle to prisoners voting, but we have not facilitated them in this regard.  Since they cannot go to a polling booth there is no reason that postal facilities should not be provided for them.  In establishing the democratic system in South Africa the first thing done was to introduce voting for prisoners.  Such a facility here would have the knock-on benefit  ensuring that candidates visit prisons,  thereby learning about the circumstances there.  Considering that 75 per cent of crime is drug related, it is important of find out what is happening in our prisons.  Providing for postal voting by prisoners would be one way of ensuring a focus on this matter and politicians' interest in what goes on there. As a result reforms might be made.</P>
    <P>Political parties and canvassers no longer stand outside polling booths with posters, enticing people in, giving them literature and so on.  As a result polling booths are not identified in a specific way and new voters may not know where they are.  I suggest that we identify each polling booth with the national flag on election day.  That would be an appropriate sign of the democratic electoral process.  Perhaps it will be considered in the forthcoming referendum and other future elections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which needs substantial amendment.  I am sure on Committee Stage our party spokesman, Deputy Dempsey, will put <Col N="523" /> forward sensible and reasonable amendments and I hope the Minister or Minister of State will give them careful consideration.</P>
      <P>I welcome the basic provision of State funding for political parties, a measure that is long overdue.  Political parties are in reality State institutions, but no State funding is provided for them.  They are a very important part of our democratic system.  Since the foundation of the State in 1922 our political system has been stable, and elected public representatives and party activists have contributed enormously to that success. In this State the electoral system has not denied people the right to vote based on colour, creed or wealth.</P>
      <P>That civil right was not always given equally to people living a few miles up the road from my home in County Fermanagh. The outrageous gerrymandering of wards and electoral boundaries for local and parliamentary elections caused serious discontent and understandable resentment among the Nationalist community in the Six Counties. It was one of the many grievances that gave rise to the campaign for civil rights.</P>
      <P>The provisions in Parts V and VI are unnecessary, ridiculous and a charter for bureaucracy.  In recent years there have been constant attacks on our political system and on public representatives. As a person who has been a Member of this House for almost three years I know that the standard of representation by all Deputies is high.  Regardless of political affiliation, Members of the House come in here to work to the best of their ability on behalf of their constituencies and their constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities provide a very important means of representation. Unfortunately the role of councillors has been severely diminished in recent years.  The power to make decisions at local level is being increasingly taken from local public representatives.  As one who has no vested interest in this matter, since I have not sought election to a council nor have I been a member <Col N="524" /> of any of their sub-committees, I can speak very clearly on behalf of councillors. My father was a councillor and my brother succeeded him, therefore I know at first hand the demands placed on local public representatives.  We are very fortunate in County Cavan to have excellent councillors committed to improving the standard of their county and the lot of their constitutents.  The past ten to 11 years have not been easy for them, with difficult local issues including road problems and so on.  It costs councillors money to do their job properly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael Smith as Minister for the Environment started a process of putting the appropriate expenses and allowances on a proper footing.  Councillors should be adequately rewarded with travel expenses and compensation for phone charges and postage.  Apart from the expense incurred travelling to local authority meetings there is also substantial travel involved for councillors in attending local community functions and meetings as well as political party meetings in the electoral areas they represent.  The denial of adequate payment for travel, phone and postage makes it very difficult for people on low incomes to seek election.</P>
    <P>It is important that all sectors be represented. Much too often we hear glib and snide remarks about councillors being nominated to semi-State boards and other bodies, but they are fully entitled to participate in the workings of those companies.  The impression is given nowadays that anybody may be considered for such bodies accept councillors and known party activists.  People who go before the electorate and gain the confidence of the public should be given every consideration with regard to such vacancies if they have the relevant knowledge and experience.  Not only have journalists and commentators contributed to weakening the role of local elected representatives but successive Governments have also done so.  I include my party in that.  When in government it brought legislation before this House which specifically <Col N="525" /> excluded public representatives from participating in certain boards and bodies. That is a practice with which I totally disagree.  Civil servants who draft Bills and members of Government who bring legislation before this House should be conscious of the important and constructive role played by public representatives.</P>
    <P>Another trend in recent years has been the establishment of a greater number of authorities, bodies, commissions and so on, all of which lessen the powers of this House and weaken the role of Members.  The people whom the electorate send here to represent them should make the all-important decisions.  It is incumbent on us to pay tribute to the role played by members of political parties.  They become members in a voluntary capacity and their efforts play a major part in maintaining our strong democratic system. The reward they receive for their efforts is the pride they feel when their political party is successful or their local candidate is elected.  I am a member of a party that has at least one cumann in every parish in the Twenty-six Counties.  That means we have a direct link with every parish and our party members can bring to the attention of their local council member or Teachta Dáala the needs and difficulties of their areas.</P>
    <P>Year in year out the energy of many dedicated party members is taken up almost entirely with fund-raising.  I am referring not only to the national collection, which I regard as a relatively easy fund-raising event, but to raffles, card games and functions which must be organised on a constant basis to meet day to day expenditure and to pay off debts from the previous election.  As with voluntary and sporting organisations, political organisations also find it difficult to meet their ongoing commitments. The provision in the Bill for State funding of political parties is long overdue and necessary.</P>
    <P>Opposition parties have very limited research facilities.  The Opposition party leader and Front Bench spokespersons <Col N="526" /> should have adequate expertise available on a permanent basis to enable parties in Opposition to provide the necessary opposition which is good for democracy.  Every Member should have access to a proper research facility.  The daily demands on a Deputy make it virtually impossible to read valuable and important reports from the National Economic and Social Council, the Economic and Social Research Institute or IBEC, farming organisations and trade union news letters.  Most days Members have hardly enough time to read the daily newspapers never mind the volume of material on their desks every morning.</P>
    <P>Most lobby groups have experts in the relevant disciplines and obviously Oireachtas Members and members of political parties should have adequate research facilities.  Such a provision would help to improve the standard and delivery of public services.</P>
    <P>There is a myth surrounding the contributions to political parties from big business.  My party organisation in County Cavan does not have the luxury of receiving substantial contributions. Our election expenses are met in the main by the hard work of party members in organising various fundraising functions.  I referred earlier to Part V of the Bill which contains unnecessary measures which, if implemented, would help to stifle normal healthy political activity.  We are a democracy and the efforts of party members to raise funds in an open manner to promote their party is laudable.  The imposition of a limit on expenditure during election campaigns is not necessary.  I believe most parties and candidates try to limit the expenditure to the minimum and its provision in legislation is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>In recent years there has been a growing awareness of the lack of impact which posters and other election materials have in influencing voters. The production of expensive literature will not determine who the people return to this House.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in Part VII of the Bill for those unable to attend their <Col N="527" /> local polling stations on election day. Effectively people in certain occupations such as commercial travellers and fishermen were disenfranchised in the past.  The facility for disabled voters has been improved in recent years but I support the call of other speakers for further improvements in that facility.</P>
    <P>We do not need to apologise for the provision of State funding for political parties.  Parties will still need to carry out substantial fundraising and the State grant will by no means bankroll the parties. The facilities in this House are totally inadequate.  I know the former Taoiseach, Mr. Charles Haughey, instigated much needed improvement but much more needs to be done.  There are practically no rooms where a Member can meet a deputation, instead the Member has to bring them to the visitors bar which is not suitable in most instances for conducting negotiations in confidence.</P>
    <P>Middle-ranking civil servants and officials in State agencies have their own rooms which can accommodate meetings. People who have the honour of being elected to their national Parliament should have proper accommodation. Inadequate and out-of-date facilities demean the role of a Member. The extra demands on Members is amply borne out by the fact that an increasing number are full-time public representatives.  As a Member who is not on the local authority or a subcommittee, I find the job demands hard work every day, work that is most fulfilling and enjoyable.  This country needs strong political parties &mdash; parties whose time and energy is not caught up fund-raising almost on a full-time basis to pay off debts.  Elections should be held on a Saturday and this would enable students at home for the weekend to vote without putting the burden on political parties of sending buses to Dublin and other third level education centres to bring home students to cast their vote. It would ease the demands on party members who traditionally have taken the day off work to help on polling day. <Col N="528" /> I see no reason polling day should not be on a Saturday as from many points of view it makes sense.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment on a statutory basis of the Constituency Commission.  This again raises the perennial question of our electoral system. There are many systems, some which I reject out of hand, but problems arise in our system that we do not take into account.  I am totally opposed to a list system in any type of election because it gives pre-eminence to the parties, not to the people.  The beauty of our electoral system is that in all circumstances the people choose their elected representatives, with the exception of Seanad elections.  For that reason I dismiss the list system.  I am also opposed to the single non-transferable vote. Problems arise in that system that are detrimental to our political way of life, for example under it one party could predominate in one part of the country and another in another part whereas under our system the bigger parties in this country have representatives in the Dáil from all parts of the country.  This gives cohesion and balance when a Government is formed that is not normally present under the British system where huge areas are effectively excluded from Government by virtue of the fact that there are no MPs from those areas in the Government parties. At one stage I would have favoured the single seat transferable vote but I think it could give rise to problems, particularly the possibility of large areas having no representation in Government parties when certain parties are in Government.  That would not be a good thing because parties could comprise predominantly TDs from the east coast with very few from the west coast or <i>vice versa.</i> It would not be good to have such fragmentation of the system and <Col N="529" /> could lead to great tensions between different areas of the country.</P>
    <P>I think problems arise in our system in the large five seat and four seat constituencies. It is fair to say that the larger the constituency the greater the tension and duplication.  For that reason, even though there is no constitutional ban on it, we do not have six seater, seven seater, eight seater and nine seater constituencies, although they were a feature of our system of PR in the 1930s.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether we should have constituencies of uniform size, for example a four seat or three seat constituency, because one cannot compare the difficulty of servicing a huge five seat constituency, particularly if it is one county, with a three seat constituency. There might be a case for making all constituencies the same size.  It might pose difficulties with the county boundaries but it is worth considering because, by doing so, one would create uniformity, in other words equal work burdens as well as reducing the tensions and difficulties that arise in the larger multi-seat constituencies.  I think the problem in relation to county boundaries could be dealt with if we were slightly more tolerant in dealing with constituency population.</P>
    <P>We should examine the problem in terms of constituency size, geography and whether there should be uniformity between Deputies from different constituencies.</P>
    <P>Because of our multi-seat constituencies system and the internal competition between candidates from the same party, there is much more contact with the people than there would be if we operated single seat constituencies. This contact is a good thing; if it were ever to disappear, Irish politics would be the poorer.  However, such contact means more work and a need for extra facilities.  We have not been willing to admit that the nature of the politics and representation provided by Deputies in the Dáil creates a need for much better facilities than are at present available. Some people who contributed to the <Col N="530" /> debate seem to dream of a day when they can become legislators without having to have contact with the people, constituency clinics or Cumann in every parish.  They envisage a nice cosy system where we can do what we want here without bothering about people.  God forbid that we should ever arrive at the day when legislators work in ivory towers and have no time for ordinary people.  Anyone who has travelled knows that the one thing most people abroad who have any idea of politics envy is the close bond between our politicians and the people.  People often complain about politicians in general but most think their own local politicians are OK because they know them, and know that they work hard and respond at a most basic level to the requirements of their constituents.  It is interesting that people who want to distance politics from the people are the ones who are most concerned about the influence of big business on politics. That, however, is a contradiction in terms.  In my short experience in politics I have not been influenced by big business interests.  We depend on ordinary people to elect us, and were we to lose contact with them our chances of getting elected, particularly in a rural constituency, would be very much reduced.  The nature of our politics ensures that the will of ordinary people prevails.  The quick response by Members of this House on issues that concern their constituents illustrates that we have a very responsive system.</P>
    <P>I have no problem with providing resources to allow public representatives to function properly, but I have slight reservations about these provisions which give the impression that the money is not being given to political parties to enable them to function properly as Government, as Opposition and as political parties but to help run their organisations.  We must not give that impression.</P>
    <P>Some Members seem to look forward to the day when we will not have to take up national collections.  I do not believe that day will come.  There is no way <Col N="531" /> money provided under this Bill to a huge organisation such as Fianna Fáil will filter down to cumann level to be used in the operation of its day to day business.  Neither would that be a good thing.  We want people to become involved in politics, and the strength of the two major parties in this House has been their involvement with ordinary people.  A local branch of a party must have some function, some part to play. There is a saying that there are no votes without taxation.  Likewise, part of having a say within a political party is one's willingness to become involved in national collections and fund-raising at local level.  It is about participation, and participation must be a two way process. If local branches were not obliged to carry out such functions they would just sit and pontificate without being involved in the day to day running of their party.  For that reason we must make it clear that this money will not be in substitution for the collections taken up by political parties.  It is meant to substitute for major donations which are becoming few and far between, to prevent parties getting into debt and to ensure that from Oireachtas level down parties can perform more effectively.  If the message is put across that this is what we are doing, that would not be a bad thing.</P>
    <P>As well as cash funding we need increased resources in this House. When I was first elected to the Seanad, having been manager of a small rural co-operative, I was asked what I thought of Leinster House and of Dublin to which my quick reply was that it was technologically disadvantaged compared to rural Ireland.  We had to share telephones, we had no computers and no access to fax machines.  Photocopiers had to be shared among large numbers and one was lucky, in the Seanad, to share a secretary with two other Senators.  As somebody who had worked efficiently with few resources in a small co-operative, I found the facilities here Spartan.</P>

      <Col N="532" /> It is amazing that the elected representatives of the people under proportional representation, most of whom engage in a huge volume of work and belong to organisations with large branches which are the life blood of politics in the community, should have to operate a system like this.  If a Deputy's secretary is in the constituency he has nobody here to answer the telephone or to look after constituents who come to see him in Leinster House, and if his secretary is here and a constituent at home wants to contact him that constituent is expected to telephone Leinster House.  That is ludicrous in this day and age.  It is ludicrous also how little money we provide to cover the cost of telephones, travel etc.  Most politicians I know travel the country year in year out at their own expense attending meetings, functions and so on.  We should not have to beg or be beholden to anybody for the money to cover the cost of such travel.  It is part of our job to travel, particularly when in Opposition, although I did a fair share of it even when Fianna Fáil was in Government. Front Bench spokespersons travel literally day and night from one end of the country to the other and all we get is a constituency travel allowance which, in my case, does not cover the cost of travel within a constituency in a year, when the cost of getting to the islands is taken into account.</P>
    <P>In fulfiling their functions as public representatives, many Members travel from one end of the country to the other and pay the cost themselves.  Most Members do not wish to become millionaires from politics, but we would like to have enough money to rear our families and pay our monthly bills.  We merely want to enjoy the comforts that those on similar salaries enjoy.  It is farcical that a large proportion of our salaries goes on travel expenses.  The true cost base of politicians must be reviewed to ensure they are not out of pocket.  Otherwise, it will be too expensive for full-time politicians to carry out their duties.  The number of such politicians is increasing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="533" /> The provisions relating to disabled voters are welcome but do not go far enough.  Why must a disabled person place his or her name on the register when it is being compiled?  People's health can change radically in a short period and that is particularly so in the case of the elderly.  When a person over 65 years or a permanently disabled person is on the register they should not have to register again.  Furthermore, there should be a facility to allow a person who becomes ill or incapacitated between the compilation of the register and the election to obtain a disabled person's vote.  I visited the Ukraine last year and was very impressed by their voting system.  As well as having a box in the booth on polling day, an additional presiding officer brought a polling box to houses in the area.  The same could apply in cities here.  In rural constituencies one box could be used to collect votes in five or six different areas and party scrutineers could ensure the vote was properly conducted.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to hold the divorce referendum on a Friday.  As elections are not held frequently, it makes sense to hold them on Fridays and to close third level colleges, thus maximising the vote.</P>
    <P>When a census is taken, it is traditional to count the number of people at home on a Sunday night.  Many people go to college and work in urban areas but rural Ireland is their home.  As such people return to college or work on Sunday nights, the census should be held on either a Friday or Saturday night.  This would lead to a correct balance in representation for urban and rural areas.  It is important that those who call, say, Cornamona their home are counted for the purposes of a census. Having regard to strict tolerance levels in setting up constituencies such people would have a major impact on the size of rural constituencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose giving the Bill the warm welcome it received from many other speakers.  I have grave <Col N="534" /> reservations about it and seek clarification in relation to certain aspects.  I do not disagree with the principle of establishing the commission to revise constituency boundaries on a statutory basis or the proposal to provide public funding for political parties.  The measures that deal with the disclosure of donations and how they will be calculated are a cause of concern.  While I am sure nobody would disagree with the principle of disclosure, I have some difficulty with what constitutes a substantial donation and how one must account for it.  I am sure all Members are aware of the commitment given by friends and families in support of candidates in the run-up to an election.  There is also a network of constituency members who assist throughout an election campaign.</P>
      <P>Before they are declared candidates members of political parties must appear before a convention or a party meeting where they may either submit a paper or make a presentation.  In some cases those voting in the convention may meet them on a personal basis.  If a person is successful he or she is declared a candidate in a multi-seat constituency and must canvass in a general election. Other party members may canvass with such candidates and, while they would like to give of their time voluntarily, their work commitments do not allow it. They may decide to make a place available for a candidate as an election headquarters or may invite the candidate and his or her party members to their restaurant for a simple cup of tea or something stronger later in the night.  That happens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not necessarily know what candidates on my party ticket would be doing on a daily or hourly basis in my constituency in the course of a general election campaign, nor would I know what my election officers would be doing.  I would not know what is happening in an adjoining constituency.  In the real world once an election is called candidates are interested in getting to meet as many constituents as possible to outline what has been achieved as their <Col N="535" /> representative and why one is seeking re-election.  Candidates who are not Members of the Dáil must explain why they are seeking election.  It is the electorate that candidates should focus on. Candidates tend to leave other important matters to officers of the party such as the registration of the name of the candidate.  Heretofore, the party of which I am a member, Fianna Fáil, looked after the election strategy. The Front Bench, in conjunction with the parliamentary party and our national executive, prepared the election manifesto.  Others looked after other aspects of the campaign, whether it be television advertising, printing of posters or a leaflet drop campaign.  Candidates beaver away in their constituencies and try to meet as many people as possible and present their case to them.  I am concerned to ensure that there will be a level playing pitch for all who wish to contest a Dáil election.</P>
    <P>The proposals before us do not represent fair play or result in a leveling of the playing pitch.</P>
    <P>A number of issues do not come into the equation such as money spent in the course of an election campaign or postage, secretarial assistance and back-up services which are available to Members of the House.  While I agree with some of the sentiments expressed on the back-up services and facilities for Members, I recognise that others seeking election do not have these facilities. That discrepancy should be rectified. Outgoing Members have an advantage over other candidates in regard to office accommodation in the House.  Is it fair that one Member has a large staff and support services that other Members do not have?  If we are to be honest and fair, we should be treated equally.  I have built up a reputation for being a hard worker.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with that reputation.  I visit two local DART stations periodically outside of election <Col N="536" /> time and I hand out informative literature. I hold a number of clinics, distribute constituency newsletters, and go on walkabouts.  Is there to be a limit on the amount of constituency work I can do? I would like clarification from the Minister on such matters.</P>
      <P>As a public representative I intend to continue to provide the best service possible for my constituents.  I will give them whatever information I deem appropriate.  I do not want to find myself in a situation where, either before or after an election, I am told that I have exceeded my expenditure limit and I have thus breached certain regulations.</P>
      <P>Earlier, I referred to how a candidate must present his or her case for election to the Dáil.  Has any consideration been given to that in the Bill?  They are real issues.  Deputies do not like to disagree with the principles contained in a Bill, whether it be in regard to disclosure of donations, imposition of limits, payments to political parties or the setting up of the commission I have no problem with most of those principles but I am concerned about the problems and the complexities of some sections. There will be much confusion and many disputes about their interpretation.  The Minister should clarify the matters I brought to his attention.  I do not think I am unique.  Most public representatives in one way or another keep in regular contact with those who elect them. I want to ensure that every Member knows exactly how the imposed limits on election expenditure for political parties and candidates will be calculated and how they will apply on an individual basis.  I would also welcome clarification in respect of voluntary time.  I know this is mentioned in the Bill but I asked about people who are not able to provide voluntary time but who provide something else in lieu such as a cup of tea.  Are we talking about calculating this on normal retail values?  Is that the way we are going forward?  These are real issues that I want clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other issue that I warmly welcome is the provision for people unable <Col N="537" /> to vote at polling stations.  There is a huge number in this category.  For a number of years I had to travel many miles to come home and cast my vote. Many of my colleagues involved in selling and marketing products around the country also had to travel up to a hundred miles to exercise their right to vote because they were out of their constituencies on a rota basis over eight or 12 weeks.</P>
    <P>I welcome that aspect as it also relates to clerks and presiding officers who, heretofore, had difficulty in exercising their right to vote even though they played a central role in ensuring that others who wished to vote could do so.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister clarify the aspects I have raised by way of a letter to my office?  That would help me to present my case, if I need to, on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Many Deputies welcomed the provisions of the Bill in principle but expressed doubts about the workability of certain sections, particularly those relating to the disclosure of donations and the limitation of election expenses. They complained about the complexity of the provisions and maintained that an army of accountants with a battery of computers would be required to deal with them.</P>
      <P>Members have a great deal of experience of elections and I look forward to specific suggestions from them on how the provisions of the Bill can be simplified and made more effective.  I am open to any suggestions that Deputies may have.  Deputy Dempsey and several of his colleagues expressed strong reservations about the provisions relating to the control of election expenses.  The Deputy saw these provisions as wrong, unnecessary and an example of bureaucracy gone mad.  I find myself in an odd position in defending the proposals against Fianna Fáil because that party had a central role in framing them and were present at the birth of this offspring of a broken marriage.  There should be a limit to the amount that parties and candidates can spend on elections. The limits and procedures set out in the Bill are, on the whole, reasonable, and the majority of Deputies share that viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>However, I will be happy <Col N="540" /> to deal with specific suggestions and constructive amendments.  Deputy Dempsey made the interesting suggestion that there should be talks on this matter between now and Committee Stage.  I do not know if this is the appropriate way forward but certainly I will take note of his suggestion.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has indicated its intention to table an amendment providing for votes for emigrants at all elections but this is a little strange.  This difficult question has been debated several times over the last four or five years and a consensus seems to have emerged that, initially at any rate, emigrant representation should be via the Seanad.  A specific proposal enabling emigrants to elect three Members of the Seanad has been developed and is expected to be put to a referendum next year.  The proposal appears to have broad cross-party support and the emigrant organisations, while not entirely satisfied, are prepared to row in behind it.  Therefore, I find Fianna Fáil's U-turn on the matter hard to understand, particularly in view of the party's attitude to the Bill introduced by my late friend and colleague, Gerry O'Sullivan, in 1991 and the statements made by various Fianna Fáil spokespersons on this subject at that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In his contribution, Deputy Deasy was at least consistent in his viewpoint.  Several Deputies sought improvements in the arrangements for registering electors, a supplement to the register and other electoral practices, including weekend voting and having photographs of candidates on ballot papers.  These questions are included in a range of electoral matters which the Minister has referred for consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>For Deputy Molloy's information, I said before he came in that I am open to suggestions.  We will consider any amendments which are put forward in a reasonable and open way. It is in the interests of all the parties and the Independents to bring forward a Bill which will be compatible with their needs and views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the major points raised was donations, including the value of property, goods or services provided free of charge or at a reduced cost and monetary contributions.  All contributions <Col N="542" /> made by a person or organisation in the course of a year, or in relation to a particular election, will be treated as a single donation.  Contributions made to different branches, elected representatives, candidates or officers of a party will be treated as a donation to the party.  I stated that in my speech.</P>
    <P>The value of subscriptions to the sponsorships of golf tournaments, celebrity dinners, race nights and other fundraising events will be regarded as donations and must be disclosed where the value or cumulative value exceeds the prescribed threshold.  If a company sponsored prizes at a golf tournament to a value exceeding £4,000, this contribution would have to be disclosed by the company also.  Appropriate records must be maintained by parties, members and candidates.  Penalties are prescribed for failure to furnish a donation statement or for making a false statement.</P>
    <P>As regards public funding, the position of the Progressive Democrats is a little obscure.  However, I believe its Deputies are saying that they favour public funding but they think it should be even more heavily biased in favour of small parties.  Not surprisingly, Deputy Sargent and Deputy Gregory made a similar plea.  Small parties stand to do well from the proposals.  Democratic Left and the Green Party, who get nothing from the present leader's allowance, will benefit substantially.  The gain to the Progressive Democrats will not be as significant because it does well under the present eccentric rules governing the allocation of the leader's allowance.  However, the precise allocation rules, particularly as between Government and Opposition parties, can be considered in detail on Committee Stage.  We will be willing to hear arguments on this matter.</P>
    <P>As far as I am aware, in every country where there is public funding some threshold, in terms of representation or votes, must be crossed before a party can benefit.  While there is usually a basic grant for all qualifying parties, the grant reflects the size of each party in terms of seats or votes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="543" /> As regards section 15 (5), which envisages a supplementary allowance for non-party members, the decision on this matter will rest with the Oireachtas, not as Deputy Quill alleges with one or two Ministers.  There is no question of bargaining with individual Independents as some speakers tried to imply.  The arrangements which will be introduced will have general application.  Deputy Gregory noted that the provision in relation to Independents is discretionary; he would prefer to see &ldquo;shall&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;may&rdquo;.  We will hear more argument about this on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Deasy inquired how the proposed allocation would work out in practice.  The total fund will be £2.6 million, the equivalent of £1 for every elector. Some 10 per cent will be reserved for Opposition parties and the balance will be distributed among all qualified parties in proportion to their numerical strength.  On the basis of present party strength, payments will work out at approximately £14,700 per Member for Government parties and £18,400 for Opposition parties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Part V of the Bill, dealing with the control of election expenditure, has attracted considerable comment during the debate.  I will now recap on the main provisions.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for the limitation of expenditure by or on behalf of political parties and candidates at Dáil and European elections.  There will be a limit on expenditure at national level by political parties, related to the number of constituencies contested, and for candidates at constituency level, related to the number of seats allocated to the constituency. Spending limits will also apply at presidential elections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="544" /> The controls will apply to all expenditure incurred in relation to the election, whether incurred before or after the issue of the writ or the commencement of the election.  That answers the point raised by Deputy Callely.  The controls will not be confined to spending during the few weeks of the election campaign, but will apply to all expenditure in connection with the election, whenever incurred.  The controls will be the same, irrespective of the source of the money, whether it is provided locally or centrally by the party, put up by the candidates out of his or her resources, put up by sponsors or supporters or, as somebody suggested, obtained from the candidate's business.  It must be fully accounted for in all cases.</P>
    <P>The value of services provided will be taken into account, for example, someone may supply a fleet of cars. However, if a private individual canvasses in his own time and without any payment, this will not be reckoned.</P>
    <P>The control of expenditure will operate through a system of agents.  Parties must appoint a national agent and each candidate an election agent.  Agents will be required to maintain appropriate records and furnish details of expenditure. Despite the inconveniences, the principle of placing a limit on election spending has much to recommend it.</P>
    <P>There was broad welcome for the special voting arrangements proposed for electors who have difficulty getting to their polling stations because of their occupations.  There was criticism that the arrangement will not meet every conceivable situation.  There were references to people sailing away from Rockall. If someone is at sea for the full duration of the election campaign, this arrangement will not meet his requirement in relation to that election.  It will, however, facilitate many hundreds of people who fish out of Ballycotton, Kilmore or Howth and are at sea for, perhaps, three or four days at a time and will be in harbour at some stage during the election period.  Ballot papers will be issued to such voters a considerable time before polling day.  Voters in this <Col N="545" /> category may vote while ashore during this period and have their ballot paper returned in time for inclusion in the count.  It will also facilitate many business people who may be absent for most of the week but return to base at the weekend.  Deputy Callely also referred to this situation.</P>
    <P>It is not possible to cover every conceivable situation, but the proposals in the Bill represent a substantial improvement on the existing position, while maintaining essential safeguards for the secrecy of the ballot and the integrity of the elections.  I thank all Deputies for their contributions.  We are open to any reasonable proposal put forward on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always <Col N="546" /> pleased to have the opportunity to address the House on the subject of the six-monthly reports.  The reports we are debating today cover the period from the second half of 1992 to the first half of 1995.  While we rarely get an opportunity to debate these reports in this House, the Foreign Affairs Committee and the European Affairs Committee have greatly improved our capacity to monitor developments in the Union and I would see our debate today as complementing their work.  It is worth commenting at the outset that the title of the six-monthly reports has changed from &ldquo;Developments in the European Communities&rdquo; to &ldquo;Developments in the European Union&rdquo;.  While the European Communities are still there, the change of title reflects the birth of the European Union following the entry into force of the Treaty on European Union on 1 November 1993.</P>
      <P>Deputies are of course familiar with the European Union's three distinct elements, referred to as &ldquo;pillars&rdquo;.  The first pillar comprises essentially the three pre-existing Communities, the European Community, the European Coal and Steel Community and the European Atomic Energy Community; the second pillar is concerned with the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) and the third pillar deals with Justice and Home Affairs (JHA).  All of these facets are dealt with in the six-monthly reports.</P>
      <P>The format of the six-monthly reports has been modernised so as to produce what I think Deputies will agree is a more concise and user-friendly publication. I am also glad to record that the reports are fully up-to-date, with the publication of the Forty-Sixth Report covering the first half of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union, and the Communities which came before it, have brought unparalleled peace and prosperity to a large part of the Continent of Europe.  The benefits of the European Union in terms of stability and economic development extend well beyond its borders.  The Union is a logical, practical, and imaginative response to the <Col N="547" /> challenges which face the peoples of Europe.  The success of the &ldquo;European project&rdquo; depends on harnessing the commitment and abilities of all of our citizens.</P>
    <P>I should like to look at some of the principal developments mentioned in each of the reports under review.  The Forty-First Report, covering the second half of 1992, reported on the Edinburgh European Council in December of that year which decided on the Community's financial arrangements to the end of the decade.  It also reached a compromise dealing with Danish concerns about elements of the Maastricht Treaty &mdash; this compromise was widely seen as having put the Maastricht process back on track.  The same period witnessed the currency crisis in September 1992 which led to the withdrawal from the ERM of Italy and the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>Arguably the most significant development during the first half of 1993, covered in the Forty-Second Report, was the positive outcome of the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty held in Denmark in June of that year. A year earlier the Danish electorate had ignored the advice of its Government and declined, albeit by a tiny margin, to ratify the Treaty.  That result had caused a crisis of confidence, but happily the Danes voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo; the second time around.</P>
    <P>The Forty-Third Report dealing with the second half of 1993 covered the period of the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty on 1 November of that year.  I have already mentioned that this necessitated a change in the title of the six-monthly reports.  The Forty-Third Report also referred to the Commission's White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment which drew in large part on contributions from member states.  The same report recorded the introduction of the Common Foreign and Security Policy in place of European Political Co-operation.</P>
    <P>The Forty-Fourth Report stated that the first half of 1994 was a period of <Col N="548" /> consolidation, with the Maastricht Treaty not long having entered into force.  Nevertheless there were developments of importance.  The enlargement negotiations with Austria, Sweden, Finland and Norway were concluded in March of that year.  Elections for the European Parliament took place in June 1994 and the new Committee of the Regions held its inaugural meeting in March of that year.  The people of Austria were the first to hold a referendum on EU membership and in June 1994 they voted by a two-to-one margin in favour of accession.  The European Council at Corfu in June 1994 established a Reflection Group to prepare for the Intergovernmental Conference.  I shall have more to say about this later.</P>
    <P>The Forty-Fifth Report dealt with the second half of 1994, with Sweden and Finland following the example of Austrial by voting to join the Union.  As we know, the people of Norway decided against.  In July of last year Mr. Jacques Santer, the then Prime Minister of Luxembourg, was chosen to replace Mr. Jacques Delors as President of the European Commission.  Relations with Central and Eastern Europe developed and strengthened in the same period and the Union continued to contribute substantially to the further development of democratic institutions, market economies and respect for human rights.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Forty-Sixth Report brings us right up to the first half of this year. On 1 January 1995 Austria, Sweden and Finland acceded to the Union raising the total number of member states to fifteen.  On 2 June I attended a conference at Messina to commemorate the fortieth anniversary of the original Messina Conference which launched the negotiations resulting in the Treaty of Rome.  On the margins of that Conference the Reflection Group, which will prepare the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference, held its first meeting.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Single Market I will start my detailed review of developments by touching on the issue of Employment, Economic and Monetary <Col N="549" /> Union, the financing of the Community, and on three of the most significant policy areas.  Agriculture, Fisheries, and Social Policy.</P>
    <P>A single market of 370 million people is now very largely in place.  The market has brought great benefits to the European economy, especially to a small export-oriented economy like Ireland's. We export some two-thirds of what we produce, compared to an EU average of just over one-quarter.  While Britain remains our largest market, our dependence on that market has declined significantly, from 54 per cent in 1973 to 27.5 per cent in 1994.  We have a significant trade surplus with our European partners.  Our economic well-being is intimately bound up with that of our partners.</P>
    <P>The period under review encompassed both the depth of recession and the recovery from it.  The recovery has been a vigorous one, but has been characterised across Europe generally by sluggishness in the creation of jobs and by persistently high unemployment. This is a matter of great concern to European citizens.</P>
    <P>Deep concern about the apparent weakness of the European economy in job creation, compared to the US and Japanese economies, led to the Commission's White Paper on Growth, Competitiveness and Employment, presented in December 1993.  On the basis of the White Paper, the European Council identified a number of key areas for intensive study, including training policies, the flexibility of work organisation, various forms of regional and local initiatives, non-labour wage costs, and special help for groups hard hit by unemployment, such as schoolleavers without qualification, the long-term unemployed, unemployed women and older people.</P>
    <P>Member states were asked to submit multi-annual programmes to stimulate employment.  The various studies will result in a first annual report on employment which will be submitted to the next European Council in Madrid in December.  Employment will be a major <Col N="550" /> theme at Madrid, which will mark the transition from reports to action.</P>
    <P>Despite the set-back of 1992, Economic and Monetary Union remains the top priority for the Union and fundamental to the process of European integration. Successive meetings of the European Council during the period under review reaffirmed the commitment to Economic and Monetary Union.  Governments have reaffirmed their commitments to the convergence criteria.  Last May, the Commission presented its Green Paper on the Practical Arrangements for the Introduction of the Single Currency.  The next meeting of the European Council, in Madrid next December, will have before it for approval the all-important reference scenario for movement to Economic and Monetary Union.  This reference scenario will provide the blueprint for the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union: that is, for the locking of the participating currencies, the introduction of the single currency for transactions and, finally, the issuing of notes and coins which will replace the national currencies.</P>
    <P>Looking back, we can see that agreement reached by the European Council at Edinburgh in December 1992 on the financing of the Community was a vital one.  Despite recession and a certain amount of disillusion, it put the financing of the Community on a new basis, agreeing a financial package &mdash; the so-called Delors II package &mdash; for the seven years 1993-99 which made possible significant increases in Community expenditure in real terms.  In doing so it restored faith in the process of European integration.  Furthermore, the Edinburgh package made possible agreement, in 1993, on the arrangements governing the Structural Funds for the period 1994-99.</P>
    <P>Over the period in review, the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy was put into effect.  It is due to be completed in the current marketing year.  This was an issue of crucial importance to Ireland.  While taking more account of market realities, the reform has retained <Col N="551" /> the essential principle that agriculture is a European policy.  Although the emphasis on price support has been reduced, the income of farmers has been protected through an increased element of direct payments.  The satisfactory conclusion of the CAP reform facilitated agreement on our part to the GATT Uruguay Round.</P>
    <P>The review of the Common Fisheries Policy was completed at the end of 1992 and has since been fully implemented. The system of national quotas was retained.  Of particular importance to Ireland, the restrictions on foreign vessels fishing in the 12-mile Irish coastal zone were extended for a further ten years.  These provisions constitute an essential safeguard for Irish coastal fishing communities.</P>
    <P>The social dimension of the Union has developed considerably in recent years.  The Social Protocol annexed to the Maastricht Treaty now increases its capacity to act in the social field.</P>
    <P>The Union has achieved much in recent years in areas such as social dialogue, women's rights and health and safety at work.  I need hardly add that Ireland has gained considerably from the actions of the Social Fund in the development of human resources.</P>
    <P>In promoting the quality of employment, the European Union has recently adopted a number of important measures such as organisation of working time, protection of young people at work and the right of employees in large-scale enterprises to information and consultation.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, an increasing awareness that social legislation of the Union must take account of the impact it may have on competitiveness and employment.  The Commission also recognises this.  In its recent MediumTerm Social Action Programme it states that there is at present less scope or need for a wide-ranging programme of new legislative proposals in the social area.</P>
    <P>A major innovation of the Maastricht Treaty was the placing on a Treaty basis <Col N="552" /> of co-operation in the area of Justice and Home Affairs &mdash; the so-called third pillar.  This commenced, in effect, with the meeting of the Council of Justice and Home Affairs Ministers of 29-30 November 1993.  The treaty provides for the possibility of various forms of joint action, and the Council drew up a work programme in the area of police and customs co-operation, the fight against drugs and crime, especially organised crime, co-operation in civil matters as well as in the area of asylum and immigration.</P>
    <P>There have been important achievements: the Europol Convention was signed in July last.  This provides for the establishment of a European Police Office which will be a centre of police co-operation and exchange of information. This will be particularly useful in the fight against drug trafficking. Also signed in July was a Convention on the Protection of the Financial Interests of the Community.  This convention, otherwise known as the Fraud Convention, provides for co-operation in preventing fraud against the Community and for uniformity in dealing with perpetrators of it.  The Customs Information System Convention was also signed.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to external policy, beginning with the CFSP.  The entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty during the period under review has given the European Union a greater capacity for action in the area of foreign and security policy through the definition of common positions on international issues and the formulation of joint actions.  Under the new arrangements, activity has been intensified, for example, a range of joint actions and common positions have been adopted on issues relating, <i>inter alia,</i> to the former Yugoslavia, the Middle East peace process, the Europan stability pact, Rwanda and Burundi.  The following issues have been at the forefront of activity within the European Union over the past three years.</P>
    <P>A tragedy of enormous proportion has unfolded in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="553" /> Perhaps as many as 250,000 people have been killed in Bosnia &mdash; over 10,000 alone in Sarajevo.  Nearly 2.7 million are receiving support as a result of the work of UNPROFOR and that of the UNHCR.</P>
    <P>For more than three years of bloody conflict the international community has been appalled by the gross violations of human rights which were perpetrated in pursuit of territorial and political ambitions.  However, there have been significant developments in recent weeks which give rise to hope. Last month the Foreign Ministers of Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which is also acting on behalf of the Bosnian-Serb leadership, agreed on a set of basic principles for a settlement of the conflict. Important and, I hope, decisive talks are to be held with the parties in Washington on 31 October.  A ceasefire, which is generally holding in Bosnia-Herzegovina other than in the north-west, came into effect on 12 October.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to underestimate the difficulties which must be overcome before a lasting settlement can be achieved in this troubled region.  The negotiating process, which itself must contend with a range of very difficult issues, might yet be undermined by fighting on the ground as, unfortunately, happened so frequently in the past.  But there is a real prospect of peace.  We will be working with our European Union partners over the next crucial weeks to foster and consolidate the peace process. Should this succeed, the European Union intends to play an active role in the implementation of the civilian aspect of a peace settlement, particularly with regard to reconstruction in the region.  This will help to promote peaceful co-existence and provide decent living conditions to those who have suffered so much on account of the tragic developments over the past three years in the former Yugoslavia.</P>
    <P>The process of reform in Russia has been of fundamental importance in the past three years.  A new constitution has been introduced and a constitutional <Col N="554" /> court established to oversee its implementation. The parliamentary process is developing and political debate is open and lively.  Free and fair democratic elections were held in December 1993, monitored by the European Union and other international organisations and preparations for a second round of parliamentary elections in December of this year are proceeding on schedule. However, although progress is undeniable serious problems remain.</P>
    <P>In particular, the situation in Chechnya continues to give cause for concern. The level of conflict in the area has been substantially reduced following the important agreements reached by both sides in July of this year on a ceasefire, disarmament and exchange of prisoners, but a peaceful resolution of the situation has not yet been realised.  Violations of the ceasefire by both sides have been reported and implementation of the July agreements was recently suspended by the parties following assassination attempts on representatives of the Russian Federation in Grozny.  The European Union is working closely with the OSCE with a view to preventing any further deterioration in the situation on the ground and promoting the early resumption of discussions on the implementation of the July agreements, which are the first institutionalised steps towards a peaceful solution.</P>
    <P>As regards the Middle East, the past three years have witnessed truly historic achievements.  In September 1993 Israel and the Palestinians signed a Declaration of Principles.  This led to two agreements in 1994 and 1995 which have given the Palestinians an important measure of autonomy in Gaza and the West Bank.  Jordan and Israel signed a peace treaty in October 1994.  Jordan thus became the second Arab state to negotiate peace with Israel since Egypt did in 1979.  These major achievements will help make the Middle East peace process irreversible and thus hold out to the rest of the world the prospect of the removal of a conflict which has on numerous occasions in the past threatened a global confrontation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="555" /> The period under review has witnessed progress in the process of democratisation with elections held in several African countries and the remarkable transition of South Africa following the end of apartheid.  There have been advances in substantive EU dialogue with the Southern African Development Community (SADC) following the Berlin Conference of September 1994.  Dialogue between the EU and the Organisation of African Unity has also been developed, particularly in relation to the establishment of African conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms. However, the EU continues to be concerned about the human rights situation and the slowness of progress towards democracy in a number of African countries.</P>
    <P>There have also been major crises resulting from human conflict and natural disasters in Africa during the period under review, among these the appalling genocide which took place in Rwanda in 1994 has and continues to provide the greatest challenge to the international community.  More than a year after the massacres the situation in the Great Lakes region remains volatile with two million Rwandan refugees living in camps in neighbouring states and severe overcrowding in Rwandan prisons.</P>
    <P>The safe and voluntary repatriation of refugees remains the major political and humanitarian issue.  However, it is also essential that the necessary conditions for their return are created in Rwanda and that those responsible for atrocities are brought to justice.  The anticipated hearing of cases by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda will be an important contribution to the process of national reconciliation.  On the ground the re-establishment of the justice system and other civil institutions is essential to the process of recovery and national reconciliation.  The ongoing situation in Burundi, along with the presence of refugees in other neighbouring countries, necessitates effective regional <Col N="556" /> and international engagement if a long-term solution is to be achieved.</P>
    <P>President Robinson has visited Rwanda on two occasions, most recently from 9 to 13 October when she was accompanied by my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Burton.  That visit reflects the priority which we all believe should be afforded by the international community in resolving the tragic problems of Rwanda and the Great Lakes region.</P>
    <P>The European Union's external economic relations relate to an area where there have been many significant developments during the periods covered by the reports.  The Union continued to engage in dialogue with all of its major trading partners including the United States, Japan and Canada as well as with regional groupings such as ASEAN and with Latin America.  The conclusion of the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations and the coming into being of the World Trade Organisation were two of the major achievements during the period covered.  I would like to mention three developments which are particularly important to Ireland.  Austria, Finland and Sweden became full members of the Union on 1 January 1995.  The positive response of the peoples of Austria, Finland and Sweden represented a great boost to the European Union.  Ireland shares many common interests with the three new member states and their participation in Union decision-making will help us all to forge a Union which is fully responsive to the needs of all of its members. My only regret concerning the recent enlargement process was the decision by the Norwegian electorate not to join the Union at this stage.</P>
    <P>In the area of multilateral trade, the World Trade Organisation came into existence on 1 January 1995 with Ireland as one of its founding members. The net result of the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the establishment of the WTO will be to provide a secure and predictable international trading environment and a continuing process of trade liberalisation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="557" /> Ireland's policy in the negotiations was to support the conclusion of a global agreement, covering all countries and sectors in a manner consistent with the level of development of each country while seeking to minimise the negative effects that any agreement might have on specific sectors in Ireland such as agriculture.  This objective was met and Ireland stands to benefit significantly from the resulting liberalisation of international trade.</P>
    <P>Members of this House are no doubt aware of the importance placed by Ireland on its relations with the United States.  In recognition of these ties Ireland during its last Presidency of the European Union played an important role in the negotiations leading to the conclusion of the Transatlantic Declaration which states the principles of US-EU partnership and sets out the institutional framework within which US-EU relations are pursued.  Negotiations are currently taking place between the Union and the United States to deepen this relationship still further.  It is expected that these negotiations will be concluded in time for the European Council in Madrid and that the Council will approve a joint EU-US action plan for the strengthening of transatlantic relations.  During our Presidency of the European Union I intend to do all possible to build on the work already begun to foster and enhance that relationship.</P>
    <P>Japan is the world's third largest economy after those of the European Union and the United States.  In its communication to the Council of Ministers in March 1995, the European Commission emphasised the importance which the Union places on its relations with Japan.  I share that view.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of significant developments to the south.  The Commission adopted positive opinions on the Cypriot and Maltese membership applications and it has been agreed that accession negotiations with these counties will begin six months after the completion of the Intergovernmental Conference and in the light of its outcome. We look forward to the eventual <Col N="558" /> accession of these countries to the European Union.</P>
    <P>With regard to Turkey, Customs Union is scheduled to enter into force on 1 January next year, subject to ratification by the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>The Union has also continued the process of deepening and strengthening its relations with Mediterranean third country partners.  The European Council at Essen in December 1994 emphasised the stategic importance of the Mediterranean for the European Union and reiterated its willingness to establish a Euro-Mediterranean partnership.  In this context, a new series of broad-ranging Euro-Mediterranean Agreements are in various stages of negotiation with individual Mediterranean countries. Trade links with the region are to be further stengthened, leading to the progressive establishment of a Euro-Mediterranean free trade area by 2010.  We welcome the prospect of a deepening of our relations to the south and I look forward in particular to the Euro-Mediterranean Conference which will take place in Barcelona on 27 and 28 November. The aim of this Conference is to enable the EU and its neighbours on the southern and eastern shores of the Mediterranean to reach agreement on the course of their future relations and co-operation over a wide range of areas until well into the next century.</P>
    <P>In the course of the three-year period under review, significant progress was made in intensifying the European Union's relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and in assisting these countries to prepare for eventual EU membership.  Landmarks in the on-going process of pan-European integration include:</P>
    <P>the coming into force of the Europe Association Agreements with Hungary, Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, Romania and Bulgaria, and the more recent signature of such agreements with Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania; the conclusions of the Copenhagen and Corfu European Councils in June 1993 and June 1994, <Col N="559" /> respectively, which acknowledge and associated countries' ambitions to European Union membership and set down the conditions necessary for membership and the commencement of accession negotiations; the adoption by the European Council in Essen last December of a comprehensive pre-accession strategy designed to assist the associated countries on the road to European Union membership; the publication earlier this year by the Commission of a White Paper on the preparation of the associated countries for integration into the Single Market at the time of their accession.  Their gradual alignment on Community policies for the construction of the Single Market will strengthen the competitiveness of their economies and increase the benefits of their econmic reforms.</P>
    <P>I need hardly state that the eventual enlargement of the Union to include associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe will create significant challenges for the European Union and its member states, including Ireland. Nevertheless it is important for us always to bear in mind that the achievement by them of the conditions necessary for accession and the eventual successful conclusion of accession negotiations will enhance stability, confidence and prosperity throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>Further east, the Union has negotiated Partnership and Co-operation Agreements &mdash; PCAs &mdash; with many of the countries of the former Soviet Union and it is its intention to conclude similar agreements with other such countries in the future.  These agreements are wide-ranging, covering trade and economic co-operation, political dialogue and cultural relations and are an important means of facilitating European Union support and assistance to the economic and political transformation efforts of the countries concerned. As you know, conclusion of the Interim Agreement with Russia, designed to <Col N="560" /> implement the trade and economic provisions of the EU-Russia PCA, was delayed because of Russian responses to the situation in Chechnya.  But the European Council meeting in Cannes last June, noting that progress had been made with regard to this issue, decided in favour of signing the Interim Agreement. Signature has since taken place.</P>
    <P>Europe took a significant step forward with the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.  The Treaty established the mechanisms necessary for further advancement in the process of European integration.  It will soon be time to take another step in that process.  The Maastricht Treaty itself provides that an Intergovernmental Conference shall be convened in 1996 to examine certain areas which were not fully resolved by the Maastricht Treaty.  Those provisions include: the Common Foreign and Security Policy; the Union's legislative procedures and the decision-making powers of the European Parliament; and the possible insertion of new Titles on Civil Protection, Tourism and Energy into the Treaty.</P>
    <P>Preparations for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference are well under way.  It is now clear that the Intergovernmental Conference will be far more than an exercise in tying up the loose ends of Maastricht.  It will be required to set the stage for the enlargement of the Union to encompass well over 20 members.</P>
    <P>The Corfu European Council in June 1994 decided to establish a Reflection Group to help to prepare the ground for the Intergovernmental Conference.  In particular, the group was asked to elaborate options on certain institutional questions in the perspective of the future enlargement of the Union.  In addition, the Brussels European Council of December 1993 specifically requested the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference to consider the questions relating to the number of members of the Commission and the weighting of the votes of the member states in the Council and also to consider any measures deemed necessary to facilitate <Col N="561" /> the work of the institutions and guarantee their effective operation.  At the Cannes European Council of June 1995 additional guidelines mentioning the third pillar &mdash; that is co-operation in Justice and Home Affairs &mdash; subsidiarity, employment and the environment, were set out for the Reflection Group.</P>
    <P>The Reflection Group is made up of one member from each member state, a member of the Commission and two members of the European Parliament. As Deputies will be aware, Ireland's representative on the Reflection Group is the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  The Reflection Group will play an important role in the preparation of the Intergovernmental Conference agenda, but, it must be stressed, is not a negotiating forum.  Its task is rather to identify the issues that are likely to arise for discussion at the Intergovernmental Conference and to put forward options to the Intergovernmental Conference for addressing these issues.  It has met nine times already and will continue to meet regularly between now and submitting its report to the European Council in Madrid in December.</P>
    <P>As regards the timing of the Intergovernmental Conference, it is expected to open during the Italian Presidency in the first half of 1996, and will continue throughout the Irish Presidency during which we will be expected to oversee the management of its agenda and the progress of the negotiations. It will clearly be a major priority of the Irish Presidency and we will advance its work as expeditiously as possible.</P>
    <P>The overall Irish approach to the negotiations is that our most fundamental interest is in the development of further integration and in a Union which has institutions which function effectively.  We recognise the need to streamline and simplify the legislative procedures of the Union.  Where substantive and practical progress can be made, we will support this.  At the same time, we will aim to protect the overall balance between the member states <Col N="562" /> within the institutions of the Union and to protect the overall balance between the institutions.  We will in particular oppose any diminution of the role and competences of the Commission.  We will support measures to bridge the gap that has developed between the citizen and the Union.  It is vital that the relevance of the Union to its citizens be strengthened, and that the Union become more effective in tackling problems, such as unemployment, international crime and environmental pollution, which adversely affect the quality of its citizens' lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Tánaiste for a very comprehensive report on the European Union in the past six months. I intend to deal mainly with the Intergovernmental Conference conference. The Commission's conclusion is that the complex institutional structures and equally complex decision-making procedures are hampering the Union in achieving the goals set out in the treaties. Like the Parliament, the Commission wants to see far more efficient decision-making introduced and an extension of majority voting in Council on nearly all legislative proposals including such sensitive issues as enlargement and financing.  Perhaps of more significance, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference, the representatives of the actual participants in the conference of member state governments have now begun to put forward their initial views on the issues which have been addressed in those nine meetings which have taken place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Reflection Group, whose membership comprises two members of the European Parliament, one member from each member state and a member of the Commission, has begun the search for common ground in the varying positions which have been put forward by the participants at the conference, that is the member state governments and, to a lesser extent, the positions of the European institutions, the Parliament and the Commission. While the Reflection Group is not due <Col N="563" /> to finish its work until the end of the year, a broad consensus is emerging on a number of issues.  Similarly, the major areas of divergent views between the member states are also becoming increasingly evident.</P>
    <P>With regard to institutional structures, the member states appear to be in agreement that the present functions of the biannual European Council meetings of Heads of State and Government should be maintained.  In regard to the Commission, there is general agreement in the Reflection Group that this institution should maintain its monopoly of legislative initiative.  A minority suggests that this monopoly should be accompanied by certain restricting mechanisms.  As more and more regulations are being introduced, perhaps it is not a bad idea.</P>
    <P>On the politically sensitive question of the membership of the European Commission, there is a proposal that membership be reduced from 15 to 12 members, in spite of the hoped for increased enlargement, as mentioned by the Tánaiste.  Naturally, smaller states like Ireland would see it as vital that we retain a commissionership while some of the larger states are advocating a reduction in numbers from 15 to 12.</P>
    <P>With regard to supervisory control on the activities of the Commission, there is a significant degree of support for reinforcing its powers, the powers of the Parliament and the Council in this area, and for a mechanism to allow individual commissioners to be censured.  This exists to some extent in Parliament but it requires unanimity.  There is broad agreement in the Parliament on the question of fixing a maximum number of seats and, again, we would lose numbers.</P>
    <P>There is a need to simplify legislative procedures.  In particular, the Reflection Group considers it necessary to simplify procedures and reduce the overall number of legislative procedures to consultation, co-decision and assent.  Only a minority of the participants in the <Col N="564" /> Reflection Group have so far advocated that the Parliament should exercise increased political control over the activities of the EU.  There is some support, however, for strengthening the role of Parliament in the fight against fraud.  That is essential because there is a suggestion that fraud is widespread, not just within the institutions of the Community but also in the governments of some member states.</P>
    <P>An investigation some years ago in northern Italy uncovered that everyone, including a doorman, had a car funded by the European Community.  There was another investigation into the building of a dam in Sicily and, to my knowledge, that dam has never been built. The contract for the dam was awarded by a certain political group to a company which made sure it would never be built because the control of water was the responsibility of that group.  Those matters have not been cleard up.  We have apparently failed to tackle the problem of fraud which can amount to three or four per cent of the Community's funding.</P>
    <P>Significantly there is clear agreement that a second or upper house &mdash; a type of European senate &mdash; should not be established.  A position in such an institution might be a nice retirement role for somebody from the Department of Foreign Affairs &mdash; I am speaking politically and not referring to the current members of Government at the Department. I wonder would they be required to wear togas in the European sense of total institutionalisation.</P>
    <P>There is an acceptance that national parliaments should be more closely associated with the workings of the European institutions and one proposal concerns the establishment of an advisory council on subsidiarity whose members would be drawn from national parliaments.  That would be a far more practical role.  Not only should we have an input from Members of the European Parliament, other than through the committee system, but our Members should particpate in advisory councils. A number of advisory councils have <Col N="565" /> been established in Europe whose membership is made up of people from various non-political groups.  Such advisory councils make us more aware of what is happening in Europe.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Council, there is general agreement on maintaining unanimity as a requirement for modifying primary law.  A majority of member states' representatives favour extending qualified majority decision-making for secondary legislation.  Predictably, the British strongly oppose this suggestion but, significantly, many representatives of other member states also have reservations about extending majority voting in different policy areas.  I am sure there are many areas with which we would find difficulty given our narrow vested interests.</P>
    <P>There is a clear divergence of opinion on the weighting of votes in the Council with the larger member states arguing for greater account to be taken of factors such as population in the allocation of weighted votes.  Not surprisingly, the smaller member states oppose this suggestion.  That would create an imbalance which would destroy Europe.</P>
    <P>With regard to the functions of the Presidency of the Council, there is not yet clear agreement on the changes, if any, to be made to the current sixmonth rotating system.  The French Government's view is that a senior representative should be nominated to represent the Council of Ministers on the international stage, presumbly with the intention of working in close collaboration with the Presidency-in-office.  Not surprisingly, the EU Commission is opposed to such a move which probably is intended to lead to a reduction in the international profile of the Commission President.  The Belgian Government is also opposed to this proposal.  The French Government will oppose it now also because it no longer holds the Presidency of the Council.</P>
    <P>There is a general consensus among the member states' representatives in the Reflection Group that the conduct of the common foreign and security policy in recent years demonstrates a lack <Col N="566" /> of coherence in the EU response to the new challenges of the post-Cold War era.  There are, however, widely divergent views on the underlying reasons for this lack of coherence and on the most appropriate methods of tackling these problems.  Some representatives suggest that the political will for a CSFP is lacking in certain quarters; others take the view that there is a structural problem which has resulted in insufficient instrumentation being established to implement an overly ambitious policy.</P>
    <P>During a recent meeting with one member of the Reflection Group, I was extremely concerned about his tendency to talk about a European military force which might become directly involved in conflicts such as that in the former Yugoslavia and elsewhere.  That is particularly worrying because we already have a two or even three tier Europe and with the Western European Union we may have a fourth tier.  God knows what will happen if monetary union goes ahead.  We will have different layers of the European Community which will mean little to the people.</P>
    <P>There is also some concern that the separation of the political and the external economic dimension under two different pillars in the Maastricht Treaty contributes to this lack of coherence.</P>
    <P>A number of member states consider that the EU should have an international legal personality and all are agreed that an analysis-forward studies unit working on common foreign policy questions should be made available to the Council of Ministers.  This suggestion is linked by certain member states to the proposal to create a post in the European Council for a senior politician who would become the Council's human face.  I do not disagree with that suggestion and I intend to refer to it later in my contribution.  The face of Europe is totally anonymous and few people are familiar with it, yet there is only minority support among member states' representatives for increased functions for the Parliament in the area of foreign policy.</P>
    <P>With regard to questions of security <Col N="567" /> and defence, some member states are of the view that the Western European Union should be gradually integrated into the EU institutional structure while others, in particular the non-WEU countries, consider that such a merger is not feasible.  Other member states' representatives suggest an interim formula mid way between integration and autonomy for Western European Union-EU relations.  That would help to destroy all that is beneficial to Europe.  Europe is not just a part of NATO nor is NATO European.  Some European countries are neutral such as Ireland, Austria and Sweden and when Europe speaks on foreign policy, it speaks with far greater strength than NATO and indeed it has a greater moral authority in that area.</P>
    <P>With regard to the free movement of people within Europe and the related question of policing access to the EU from third countries, some member states' representatives argue in favour of increased EU competence in areas such as immigration, asylum and controls at external borders.  We are one of the two or three countries whose citizens must produce their passports on entering Europe and in that respect we are a different type of citizen within the European Community.</P>
    <P>The Reflection Group has apparently begun to examine the feasibility of incorporating the Schengen Agreement into Community law, possibly with an opt out clause to allow certain member states to postpone their involvement in such a development.  Again, we are talking about a two or three tier Europe in that regard.</P>
    <P>There is an emerging view that energy, civil protection and tourism, all of which are mentioned in the Maastricht Treaty as areas that could be included among new Community competences, should not now become common policies and that instead further co-operation between the member states can be developed in these areas.</P>
    <P>There is a majority view within the Reflection Group on the need to maintain the criteria and the timetable for <Col N="568" /> economic and monetary union but there is no apparent desire to amend the Treaty's provisions or to incorporate new provisions in the Treaty on economic and monetary union.  We are not being told the truth in that regard.  We were told economic and monetary union would take place in 1999, that we would have one currency, one market and one union but we will not even know the details of how we will qualify for them by 1999.  I suspect that the date will be pushed further forward.  I ask the Minister in his reply to refer to the headline in yesterday's edition of the <i>Irish Independent</i> which stated &ldquo;Kohl warns of war if EU rejects monetary union&rdquo;.  In recent months the British Government attacked Gerry Adams for suggesting that the troubles in Northern Ireland would resume if no progress was made in the peace process.  However, it is more frightening and hypocritical for the leader of one of the main countries in the EU to compare the position in Europe to that in Yugoslavia.  Most people know that European monetary union will not be achieved as the conditions are too stringent.  By the time we have complied with all the conditions laid down by the EU, at which stage we will no longer be recipients of Structural Funding, we will almost be wiped out. We will lose money on the one hand and will not be allowed to use our initiative to develop our economy on the other.  This is a frightening prospect. There needs to be more straightforward thinking so that people do not continue to believe that the Single Market and the single currency are simple matters. They are complex matters on which we should make haste slowly.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Union budget, there does not appear to be any degree of support for tackling the issue of own resources or new financial instruments in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.  The proposal to remove the distinction between compulsory and non-compulsory expenditure has been rejected by a majority of the representatives of member states.  It now seems <Col N="569" /> likely that the Parliament will not succeed in gaining control over the annual budget allocated to the Common Agricultural Policy, a potential development which many feel could pose a real threat to its future.  I have spent some time in the European Parliament where the populist view is anti CAP.  However, the CAP is the heart of much of Europe and is the soul of many rural areas.</P>
    <P>There is a widespread view within the Reflection Group that employment and the environment should be clearly established as priorities for the EU, yet there is no concensus on how employment creation or environmental protection objectives can be incorporated in the Treaty.  There is a consensus view in the group that the Intergovernmental Conference should not deal with the conditions governing further enlargement or the potential impact of enlargement on specific internal policies, notably agriculture and the Structural Funds.  However, the representatives of member states are discussing appropriate methods of expelling a member state which no longer respects fundamental human rights or basic principles.  Some member states are in favour of EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights while others are opposed to it.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the present position within the Reflection Group as I understand it.  However, it is important to remember that the group is not due to terminate its work until the end of the year and that while the views put forward within it by the representatives of the member states will broadly reflect their Government's positions they will not necessarily reflect definitive national policy on particularly difficult questions.  This work will be completed for the Madrid Summit which will take place in mid-December.  We do not know when the Intergovernmental Conference will officially begin its work but even if it begins in 1996 it will not complete it by the end of the year but will continue into 1997.</P>
    <P>The Intergovernmental Conference should deal with the lack of consensus <Col N="570" /> on the way forward for Europe and people's lack of confidence in its leadership. I believe only six or seven Deputies could name four members of the Commission while nobody could list all the policies in regard to reform etc. The people on the street are receiving no direction from Europe and the opportunity should be availed of at the Intergovernmental Conference to look at where it is going and to make haste slowly.  Enlargement of the EU to include Poland.  Romania and the former Yugoslavia will lead to a reduction in the funding available.  Yet there has been no reference to this.  People do not know what powers the Commission has, where the Commissioners come from or which of them deals with the various sections.  While I welcome the appointment of a EU ombudsman he should have an office in every member state so that people do not have to ring Brussels to make a complaint.</P>
    <P>Europe has learned little from the Maastricht Treaty which was written in a language incomprehensible to the ordinary person and whose concerns were far removed from their lives.  The fact that the Maastricht Treaty was defeated in one member state and supported by a small majority in another is a lesson for all of us and indicates how far away the EU has grown from its citizens.</P>
    <P>Concerns have been raised about unnecessary interference in matters of national policy.  Everyone is aware of the story about the woman who rang the Marian Finucane show to tell how she had been prosecuted for selling scones she had baked in her kitchen which did not meet the requirements of EU regulations. Some of these regulations are ridiculous.  A few years ago a regulation proposed to remove the colouring from jam.</P>
    <P>There is a loss of national identity among people in many areas.  However misplaced these worries are they are a fact of life and it would be foolish for politicians to think that people are not concerned about them.  The further <Col N="571" /> enlargement of the EU should be carefully considered in the interests not only of Europe but also of those states which may not be ready to become members.</P>
    <P>The EU has been good for Ireland in many ways, through Structural Funding, trade diversification and giving us a central role on the European stage. However, we must not be blind to its failings.  The EU must muster sufficient political will to tackle the problems of unemployment in a comprehensive manner.  This has not been done to date. The more regulations have been introduced, the more difficulties have been placed on employers in terms of extra cost etc.  As the representatives of IBEC told the Joint Commitee on European Affairs last week, Ireland dropped from ninth most competitive country in the world a few years ago to twenty-second most competitive last year.  This is partly due to EU regulations which have a beneficial effect in more advanced countries but which have a detrimental effect on small businesses here.</P>
    <P>There has been agreement on the setting up of a European police force but there has been no further movement in this area.  Those of us who were naive enough to believe that the drugs discovered in recent months were meant for the European market were shocked to see the consignment of drugs from Amsterdam discovered at Dublin Airport.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Customs Service and the Garda Síochána on the volume of drugs seized.  I also compliment fishermen whose nets were filled with drugs on their honesty and integrity in not succumbing to the temptation to either sell or use them.  Little or nothing has been done to tackle this problem despite the fact that drugs are now freely available in every part of rural Ireland and some individuals operating within the trade have profit margins of up to 5,000 per cent.</P>
    <P>These are the core issues which the European Union should address as opposed to the objective of an enlarged federal Union.  It must try to regain the <Col N="572" /> confidence of its citizens.  I am disappointed that the Europen poverty programme has not been placed on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference. I regard this as one of the failures of the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>If the bureaucracy continues to hold sway, the credibility of the European Union will be further undermined.  I am pro-Europe and always have been.  We need to consolidate what we have before we move forward.  I would like to think that the majority will always be in favour of further expansion, but there is no chance of this happening if we fail to bring people with us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs made a lengthy speech in which he reviewed recent developments in the European Union, but what we are primarily concerned with is the question of where we go from here.  There is not much we can do about what happened in the past three or four years, some of which we are unhappy about, but it is water under the bridge.</P>
      <P>I expected the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to spell out where Ireland stood on the matters that will have to be discussed and decided in coming years.  He devoted the final paragraph of his speech to future developments. It was full of bland, meaningless clichés.  He stated: &ldquo;The overall Irish approach to the negotiations is that our most fundamental interest is in the development of further integration and in a Union which has institutions which function effectively&rdquo;.  We are all in favour of motherhood and apple pie and against sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier during Question Time the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs answered questions.  Unfortunately, it was difficult to get an answer from him.  He is a great man for bland clichés.  Saying nothing in a nice way is called diplomacy and has its uses at certain times, but the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs should get off the fence and tell us where they <Col N="573" /> stand on the issues facing this country and the Union.  They have not done so up to now.</P>
    <P>There has been an endless series of seminars and meetings at which everything has been discussed, but we are still waiting for the White Paper on foreign policy which has been promised for an extraordinary length of time.  We were assured it would be published in the spring, the summer and then the autumn, but we are practically into the winter and have still not seen it.  Even when we do I am worried that it will be a bit like the speech the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs made today, that he will not be prepared to take a stand on any issue and will leave everything open in a vague way in the hope everything will work out.</P>
    <P>We face some serious difficulties.  We talk glibly about European Monetary Union and a single currency as if they were something we could sail into, that there were no difficulties relating to them and that the rate of progress in the future will be similar to that in the past, but that is not so, it will be very different. As Deputy Davern said, there is a different atmosphere, a degree of disillusionment and, for the first time, active antagonism towards the Union from some of its own members, particularly Britain.</P>
    <P>Of all our external relationships the most important from many points of view is our relationship with Britain because of factors of geography, history, trade and many others.  It is the key relationship, but it was not addressed by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We cannot assess Ireland's situation in coming years unless it is assessed in the context of British attitudes and policy, some aspects of which were outlined last week in Blackpool.  If the Secretary of State for Defence, Mr. Portillo, a senior member of the British Cabinet, represented, even in a most limited way, what British policy towards the European Union might be in coming years, the outlook is bleak.</P>
    <P>There is a simplistic view that, irrespective of what the British do, we can <Col N="574" /> do our own thing because we are real Europeans.  We cannot operate that way as the economic consequences would be too great.  I respectfully suggest to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs that some of the figures he quoted in relation to the single market are doubtful.  He stated: &ldquo;While Britain remains our largest market, our dependence on that market has declined significantly, from 54 per cent in 1973 to 27.5 per cent in 1994&rdquo;.  I do not know from where those figures came, but they do not represent the reality.</P>
    <P>The degree of our trade with Britain in practice is much higher and the degree of our trade which is indigenously owned and which is vulnerable is far higher because a high proportion is with Britain and affected by imports from Britain.  It is, therefore, misleading to take our trade figures globally and to say that Britain accounts only for 27.5 per cent because the global figures include huge, almost fictional, sums of money which appear only in trade statistics.</P>
    <P>We have an economy with a huge amount of transfer pricing where the commercial reality is a great deal less than the figures we sometimes like to talk and boast about.  We know the difficulties we will encounter if Britain devalues and we do not.  We saw those difficulties in 1992 and the early part of 1993.  In the end, against the will and wishes of the Government and many others, we devalued because we had to do so.  If we are in the European Monetary Union without Britain and are locked in permanently to a Frankfurtdominated hard currency and Britain are free to float as they wish, where will we stand?  The Government is not even asking that question, let alone answering it.  That is a crucial question for us and is what the debate should be about.</P>
    <P>There has been talk in the last few weeks of the Germans being unhappy with the French approach to their budget, public finances and fiscal policy. France is a powerful country in every sense of the word.  If doubt is being cast on the eligibility of France to join the <Col N="575" /> European Monetary Union, where does that leave Ireland?  We will not be on the map.  We should have a real debate about this, not just use bland clichés saying something will turn up in the next few years to make things easy for us.</P>
    <P>In a recent survey carried out by the Dublin Chamber of Commerce 77 per cent of business firms suported membership of the European Monetary Union but only 37 per cent thought it realistic to enter if the UK stayed out. Some 22 per cent thought the Irish economy was not ready for European Monetary Union and they were right.</P>
    <P>During Question Time today Deputy Harney sought to raise the question of our official economic statistics.  She did not receive reassuring answers.  People are increasingly aware of the dubious nature of some of our official statistics. It is one thing for us to be aware of that but members of the German Parliament are also becoming aware and are beginning to query them.  The sooner we sort that out the better.  Some of the examples given today by Deputy Ahern are very interesting.  In a recent year we are supposed to have had a GDP growth of 8 per cent in real terms.  That is phenomenal.  Only a handful of countries in the world have anything like that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It was for the year 1994.  However, our level of employment did not increase, nor did unemployment fall.  If we had real growth of 8 per cent we could see it around us but we do not see real growth.  We see a continuing high level of unemployment and we have great difficulty in obtaining jobs.  We see a severe inability to provide normal infrastructure out of our own resources.  We rely on huge transfer payments from the EU and without them there would be very little activity. The level of agricultural incomes, which <Col N="576" /> make a huge contribution to the economy, would be between one third and a half of what they are.  The influence of that on our economy would be enormous. These problems must be faced but we are not receiving any leadership from the Government.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing that the debate is marked by a total reluctance on the part of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs to spell out exactly where we stand or where the Government feels we should stand on these matters.  I do not see that reluctance to express a view in other countries.  In Britain they are falling over themselves to express their views in strong terms.  In Germany they are expressing extremely hard, tough views.  If we take on board what they are saying in Germany we would think three times about where we might be going.  Strong views are held in France on these issues and they are not reluctant to express them.</P>
      <P>We have a huge dependence on foreign trade.  Two-thirds of what we produce is exported, while only one-quarter of production in other EU states is exported.  If there were a major reversal of the forward movement of Europe the consequences for us would be very serious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the EU were a business and run as such this would be a time to consolidate. There has been much expansion and enlargement, new competencies, jurisdictions and so on.  However, the EU is not a business.  It is much bigger and more important than a mere business.  It is not just a series of economies.  It has political obligations and is subject to political imperatives.  The overriding obligation is securing and maintaining peace in Europe, once the cockpit of world wars.  It has been successful in that but if it is to continue that success, which, in the last resort is the most important, it cannot simply consolidate and turn its back on its neighbours who were recently dominated by authoritarian regimes and say: &ldquo;build up democratic institutions on your own; do the best you can and come back in 25 years. If you get on well and are rich enough <Col N="577" /> we will take you in&rdquo;.  There is a political and moral obligation on Europe to enlarge the Community and help people who are weak both economically and in terms of their democratic institutions in order to strengthen those institutions, as happened in Greece and Portugal which were subjected to authoritarian regimes before they joined the Community.</P>
    <P>Because the European Union must enlarge significantly and we must take in countries a great deal poorer than Ireland, future enlargements will be a very different cup of tea.  I am not talking about the two countries mentioned by the Tánaiste, Malta and Cyprus. They will not make a whit of difference because they are tiny, their economies are very small and they have no effect on this country.  I am talking about major countries that will greatly influence us economically when they become members, countries such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak Republics.  We will have to think long and hard about this matter, but whether it suits us or not economically, politically we have no choice but to accept these countries at the earliest feasible date.</P>
    <P>We must also look further afield to the Russian Federation.  The future of Europe is very much bound up with the future of its biggest country.  Whether that country remains a federation and a unified country or breaks up into a whole series of autonomous republics remains to be seen.  We must adopt an approach whereby we can accommodate the difficulties and phobias relating to that country due to historical reasons, and realise that we must maintain a good relationshp with such a large country that could destabilise this continent as far as the Atlantic if the wrong developments took palce or if it felt threatened by its neighbours to the west.</P>
    <P>I have referred to only a few of the matters I believe are fundamentally important in terms of the Intergovernmental Conference and associated conferences that will take place in the next few years.  The difficulties are much greater than we are led to believe.  The <Col N="578" /> Government, while it undoubtedly spends much time and energy making the administrative preparations necessary for these conferences, is shying away from the real debates and problems and from working out solutions to them from this country's point of few. It is shying away from adopting policy positions on many of these matters of fundamental importance.</P>
    <P>I hope the debate will not be dominated by military and security affairs. The economic problems are the greatest problems facing us, but in so far as there is discussion of military and security affairs I hope we will take our heads out of the sand and realise that we have been enormous beneficiaries from the Union and that whether we like it or not we have an obligation to play our part as full members, not just as recipients all the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Tánaiste's opening contribution and the contributions of Deputies Davern and O'Malley.  Deputy Davern served his political apprenticeship in the European Parliament and had some interesting remarks to make arising from his experience there.  It is appropriate that we are talking about the European Union, European policies and European politics in the aftermath of our earlier discussion on the Electoral Bill.  Most people who spoke on that legislation strayed somewhat from the confines of the Bill, stating that politicians must concentrate on the politics of their own locality if they are to remain national politicians, although some people questioned whether that is good politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley stated that the Government is not providing sufficient or appropriate leadership in terms of the wider European questions.  Within the ambit of the Oireachtas Committee on European Affairs there is broad scope for Members with an interest in European policy to make their views known and to make appropriate suggestions and proposals.  Perhaps a great number of debates in Dáil Éireann on <Col N="579" /> the wider issue of the European Union and European policies would be effective. What we are talking about this evening are reports on developments in the European Union, and the Tánaiste gave a precise overview of those developments.</P>
    <P>It is an appropriate time to hold this debate because in a few months' time Ireland will hold the Presidency of the EU, in preparation for which tremendous work is being done at European and national level.  It is important for Ireland and the European Union that the Presidency is successful, and the lead-up work through the Intergovernmental Conference must be concentrated on heavily.  I hope the work being done by Deputy Mitchell and his colleagues in this regard will bear fruit.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste outlined important issues that will have to be dealt with through the Intergovernmental Conference such as a foreign and security policy and discussions on legislative procedures and the powers of the European Parliament.  He also referred to new titles under civil protection such as tourism, energy and so on.  I was interested in Deputy Davern's remarks on the powers of the European Parliament and the composition of the European Commission. Suggestions have been made about streamlining the Commission.  It is appropriate nationally and internationally that calls are made for efficiency and for the smallest number of people possible to make important decisions; we are told that is a way of making better and quicker decisions. However, the European Union consists of many countries with different cultures and ideas and it is important that the greatest number of people possible are at the table when the final decisions are made.  I hope we will continue with the present system whereby every country, large or small, will have full representation at Commission level.  We must seek to maintain that system and I expect we will be successful in that regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="580" /> The Tánaiste referred briefly to matters such as agriculture, social and economic policy, all of which are very important for Members and the country. Social policy is closely related to employment and is something we could debate all evening.  I agree with what Deputy O'Malley said about our method of producing statistics.  Statistics can lead us to believe the country is doing exceptionally well and allow us to convince ourselves we are among the premier league players in Europe, that everything is booming and has been booming for the past six or seven years. However, when we as public representatives look all around us we see unemployment on every doorstep and a continuing unacceptably high level of poverty we must ask if the statistics are correct.  In the coming years particularly during the term of the Irish Presidency I hope we will put employment creation and social policy at the top of the European agenda and keep it there.</P>
    <P>I concede there have been very effective efforts at European level to tackle the problem.  The European Social Fund has done tremendous work and has provided large sums of money for training and other types of grant-aid but that has not resolved the problem.  While we continue to have an unemployment rate which is much higher than the European Union average there is cause for concern and Members must demand action from Government.  Everyone has a role to play in keeping unemployment at the top of the agenda in the Oireachtas and at European level.</P>
    <P>We have to examine European Union policies which may not allow us to progress as strongly as possible in maintaining and creating jobs.  Deputy Davern mentioned somebody with a home bakery who was prosecuted for breaching EU rules.  Admittedly the prosecution may not have related entirely to European rules and regulations but there is a European dimension to it.  Tens of millions of ECUs have been spent trying to maintain and develop rural areas but other European rules and regulations hinder the success <Col N="581" /> of such programmes.  There is little point in spending huge sums of money trying to regenerate rural regions when the red tape and bureaucracy make it difficult to set up development programmes in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The reports on agriculture mentioned this evening refer to the period from 1993.  During that period the policies put in place by Commissioner MacSharry were implemented.  We would have to concede that the scare stories we heard and may have spoken about during the early part of that programme have come to nothing.  Our rural areas have not been totally decimated, support for agricultural prices has not disappeared and matters have not deteriorated to the extent that some experts predicted, but we realise that we have been unable to deal with the flight from the land.  It is good that European agriculture is strong but it is disappointing to note that the numbers employed directly in agriculture continue to reduce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something of which I am aware and I will have to tackle it.  My colleague, Deputy Sheehan speaks of the problems of bachelors in a wider context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The numbers of people employed in agriculture in Europe are reducing by the day and that adds greatly to unemployment. There have been very deliberate and to some degree successful efforts to put in place rural development programmes to fund alternative rural enterprise programmes.  These have helped and the Leader II programme holds out great hopes for people that they can not only continue to remain in rural areas but build a new economic future for their region.  Every parish and townland will be covered by the Leader II programme and more significantly funding under the Leader II programme will have to be matched by private investment at local level.  I believe the <Col N="582" /> combination of European, State and private investment will help a new generation to put new schemes for rural development in place.  We must do our utmost to ensure that industries and new ideas are not hindered at an early stage by excessive bureaucracy.  We are excellent at spending European moneys and at implementing the rules and regulations to the limit and beyond and I suspect that may not be the case in other member states.  We should take note of that.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs mentioned developments in the fishery industry.  If any industry should be a cause of embarrassment for every Irish Government since 1973, it is the fishery industry.  We cannot speak of jobs lost in the industry since 1973 but of the job opportunities that were lost. We have a set quota under the Common Fisheries Policy but the quota could have been much greater if we had protected our industry in the 1970s when we negotiated to join the European Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion and to express my sense of revulsion and anger at the manner in which the Minister with responsibility for the semi-State sector has undermined it, the directors of the various boards, the management teams, the employees and the companies themselves by his outrageous allegations of surveillance and cosy cartels which he has never substantiated.  He abused the privilege of this House last Tuesday week by attacking the reputations and characters of three private <Col N="584" /> citizens via allegations and innuendo which have been shown to be wrong and baseless.</P>
      <P>Most sinister of all was the use made of CIE officials who were wheeled out almost in straitjackets to support the Minister's version of events relating to the sale of the Horgan's Quay site.  I agree with the journalist, Vincent Browne, who stated in <i>The Irish Times</i> today that this is the most serious issue to emerge so far in this affair.</P>
      <P>This morning he further asked: &ldquo;How was it contrived that a well respected executive of CIE, surrounded by the CIE lawyer, senior CIE executive and a public relations expert would agree to tell what happened at this meeting only under such extraordinary conditions, prearranged conditions which obscured the crucial piece of information that Ambrose Kelly did not participate in the negotiations&rdquo;?  This represents an abuse of public servants and is scandalous behaviour.  No Minister should put public servants under such pressure. This Minister is intent on saving his own political skin at any cost and will do anything to preserve his position.</P>
      <P>Last Tuesday week the Minister deliberately used the sale of this site as a diversionary tactic to shift the focus from his allegations of surveillance and cosy cartels, despite the fact that the Craig Gardner report stated that the proper procedures were followed.  In addition to that the Minister, as Damien Kiberd put it last week in <i>The Sunday Business Post,</i> dragged the name of the Cork property developer, Owen O'Callaghan through the mire for no good reason.  The site in question was valued twice by professional valuers.  Colin Dowling said it was worth £450,000 while Lisneys said it was worth £475,000.  The agreed price was over £603,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most reprehensible of all was the huge play the Minister made of the fact that not a single penny had been paid for the site, even though the contract had only been issued days prior to his speech.  It is inconceivable that the Minister did not know these contracts <Col N="585" /> had been issued, or that he had not scrutinised them before they went out.  If he did, he clearly misled the Dáil without any shadow of doubt.</P>
    <P>The concept of a science and technology park at this site is a very good one.  Cork is not well endowed with such sites.  The IDA no longer has resources to acquire them at will.  Clearly the involvement of the private sector in the development of industrial sites and in the promotion of industrial development is one we should encourage.  Cork needs more jobs and industry.  It has huge unemployment problems.  Cork has lost a good project because of a political vendetta.  I am certain of this.  Certain senior people in Fine Gael blamed Owen O'Callaghan for leaking the Hugh Coveney story to <i>The Sunday Business Post.</i> The fact is that they got the wrong man.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications also got the wrong man.  He made ongoing allegations of surveillance and had no evidence to back them up.  The Minister has been guilty of the most unethical behaviour, destroying reputations and engaging in character assassination.  In the words of Sam Smith this morning, the Minister has sunk to old lows in Irish public life.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate on the semi-State sector, because in all the drama and hype of the past few weeks it seemed on some occasions, in regard to the contributions from the Opposition parties, that the overall policy objectives and needs of workers and consumers were being lost sight of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A secure and prosperous future for the commercial semi-State sector is important to Democratic Left and to this Government.  When we sat down last December to negotiate a possible programme for government with Fine Gael and Labour this issue was close to the top of our agenda, and the priority it received in the negotiations is reflected in the strong commitments which were included in the Programme <Col N="586" /> for a Government of Renewal.  In view of the deliberate attempts by those on the other side of this House to distort the intentions of this Government and to frighten workers in this sector, let me quote what the programme says:</P>
    <P>This Government will revitalise public enterprise.  Policy will change from a reactive to a more interactive approach.  It is recognised that dramatic change will occur in State companies. The twin drivers of technological change and EU competition rules will significantly affect what were once &ldquo;natural monopolies&rdquo; in the State sector.</P>
    <P>Our approach to these inevitable forces will be to ensure that all changes in these companies will be managed in the best interest of employees, taxpayers and consumers. Employment maximisation within the competitive environment will be a key objective and the development of these companies will be a priority.</P>
    <P>State assets will not be sold except where it protects employment and is in the long-term strategic interest of the company and its stakeholders... Opportunities for expansion to utilise the bank of skills in these companies will be encouraged.</P>
    <P>Commercial State bodies will be given a clear commercial mandate and clarity in the financial targets which measure their performance. Where social obligations are imposed, they should be paid for separately.</P>
    <P>The Government remains committed to these principles and the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, will have our full support in implementing them.</P>
    <P>Public enterprises have made an immeasurable contribution to economic and social development here over six decades, they have, often in the most difficult circumstances and frequently with little or only grudging support from a succession of governments, provided a range of badly needed services for the public and tens of thousands of reasonably well paid jobs for workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="587" /> We should remember that in most cases public enterprises were established because of a refusal or an inability of private enterprise to do the job.</P>
    <P>Semi-State companies were established to provide a national transport system and to process sugar because privately owned companies in these sectors had failed.  They were established in air transport and electricity generation where private firms were unable or refused to provide the massive investment required.</P>
    <P>Despite some spectacular failures, the commercial semi-State companies have served this country well and those who work in them have the right to be proud of their contribution.  This country would have been economically and socially poorer without their contribution and their effort.</P>
    <P>The commercial semi-State companies like Telecom Éireann, CIE and the ESB employ more people than any private enterprise company and are hugely important.  Between them they employ some 60,000 people and have a turnover of more than £4 billion each year.</P>
    <P>As the Programme for Government notes, the twin drivers of technological change and EU competition rules are radically altering the environment in which these companies operate, and if they want to survive and prosper they must change.  Anyone who tries to suggest that there is no need for change is not a friend of the semi-State sector or its employees.</P>
    <P>Many of the employees and most of the trade union leadership now accept the need for radical change.  This approach is best illustrated by the progressive step the Telecom unions took last year when they published their document &ldquo;The Future of Telecommunications&rdquo;. Rather than waging a futile battle to resist inevitable change, they set out to influence the sort of change that will take place and unions in other areas are now following suit.</P>
    <P>The best way to effect the change that <Col N="588" /> everyone agrees is needed and to ensure the future of the companies is through a partnership approach, co-operation between the Government, the boards of the companies and the workers.  Despite the criticism of the Minister, Deputy Lowry, by some trade union leaders, the Minister has in fact shown himself to be far more open to innovation and change in the interest of workers than any previous occupant of this office.</P>
    <P>One of the most amusing aspects of the events of the past few weeks has been the efforts of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to depict themselves as friends of the semi-State workers.  They must think that those who work in the sector have very short memories.  People remember the outrageous deal that Deputy Brennan brokered in 1991 when he sold the B &amp; I to a hand-picked purchaser against the wishes of workers and despite the vehement opposition of the chairman and board.</P>
    <P>Indeed could anything greater contrast the record of this Minister and his predecessor than their performance in regard to Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta? Deputy Cowen's handling of Aer Lingus &mdash; and the contributions of Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and Deputy Brennan before him &mdash; brought the company to the verge of collapse. Under Deputy Cowen, there were industrial disputes and civil disorder at the airport.  In contrast Minister Lowry has backed up the groundbreaking agreement on employees' participation in Aer Lingus recently agreed between management, unions and employees.  In Aer Rianta he has given wholehearted support to the major innovation of a compact between management and staff under the umbrella of the joint union group which will facilitate productivity changes in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>These models can be followed in other companies.  The Government, as the stakeholder on behalf of the public, is committed to securing change through a process of dialogue, consultation and negotiation.  All State enterprises have the skills and expertise <Col N="589" /> in management and workforce to meet the major challenges stemming from increased competition and deregulation. From my contacts with workers in that sector I sense a tremendous commitment to face up to the problems posed by globalisation, competition and restructuring.</P>
    <P>We in Democratic Left see the commercial semi-State sector securing its future by setting new standards of excellence in terms of performance and customer service.  In my view that sector can be at the forefront of technological innovation, using the collective intelligence of workers and managers to develop new flexible and imaginative strategies to respond to the needs of tomorrow's world.</P>
    <P>This, of course, means being willing to change old structures which inhibit the capacity to compete and grow in new circumstances.  The prospect of shared ownership along Aer Lingus lines, where employees have become shareholders, offers a model for this and there must also be increased customer involvement in such enterprises.  We also welcome the creation of a number of viable subsidiary companies with the capacity to adapt to particular needs and, where necessary, raise their own capital to fund further development and innovation.  Far from accepting the inevitability of decline or privatisation, the semi-State sector offers the possibility of a new model of socially responsible enterprise that will be efficient, flexible and commercially viable.  It can do this because, unlike private enterprise, it can offer economic, social and environmental responsibility combined with public accountability and shared ownership.  Because I believe in a good future for the commercial semi-State sector, I fully support the demands of the Minister, Deputy Lowry, for the highest possible standards from all concerned with the board and management of those companies.</P>
    <P>We must not have any element of a double standard which expects accountability, efficiency and effectiveness from employees but does not demand similar <Col N="590" /> standards from those at the highest level.  I have confidence in the Minster's determination to ensure that only one standard will apply, the highest possible standard of accountability.  If we do not have this we will face a continuing cycle of cynicism and doubts among workers and the public about the motives of those at the top.</P>
    <P>We require an atmosphere in semi-State companies that will facilitate the growth of mutual respect and real partnership between management and workers.  There must be public confidence in those charged with the management and direction of those companies. The people are correct to demand value for money and the transparency to see they are getting it.  It is our responsibility as politicians to restore public confidence in the commercial semi-State sector and build morale among the workers.  We must remove any semblance of an inner circle of power brokers linked to a golden circle in the business world using the power and privilege of the political system for personal gain.</P>
    <P>I have never believed that corruption or malpractice was widespread in the public sector.  It is more as the Minister, Deputy Lowry, stated last August, that the system is flexible enough to allow a few people to manipulate affairs to their advantage.  The shocking details we heard last week of the manner in which the Horgan's Quay site sale was conducted is a vivid example of this.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate the report of the task force did not receive more attention from the media or the Opposition when it was published by the Minister last week.  As well as offering assurances that the control ethos is strong in the commercial State companies it also made a number of important proposals for reforms and improvements.  I was particularly pleased to hear the Minister state that he intended to devolve further power to the boards by giving them the authority and necessary flexibility to operate in an increasingly competitive environment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> The Minister also accepted in principle six recommendations with regard to the boards of commercial State companies which can only improve the quality of those in charge of those vital interests and most important among these is the principle that people appointed as directors should be appointed solely on the basis of their experience, competence and expertise.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to go over all the matters covered in detail in the media other than to say I believe the Minister, Deputy Lowry, is an honest man who acted reasonably at all times on the basis of information available to him. Deputy Ahern addressed a question to Democratic Left last night.  He asked if we stood with the Minister or with the semi-State workers.  Our first concern is the interest of the workers in those companies and that can be guaranteed only by the implementation of the Government programme.  The Minister is implementing that programme and in doing so he will have our full support.</P>
    <P>I will finish by putting a question to the two Deputy Aherns, as Deputy Dermot Ahern is smiling like a Cheshire cat.</P>

The events of recent weeks, as Fianna Fáil is well aware, have nothing to to do with the workers in CIE or elsewhere and everything to do with the consequences of the traditional patronage system operated by Fianna Fáil in office.  It is regrettable that despite the minimal representation of worker-directors, workers generally in those companies do not have a say in important decisions; blame does not attach to them for the failure of existing procedures.</P>
      <P>In any event, few workers will be taken in by the totally phoney spectacle of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats posing as defenders of workers and State companies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In the short time available to me I wish to devote most of what I have to say to the issue of semi-State companies and their crucial role in the wider economy.</P>
      <P>It is fundamental to the role my party seeks to play in Irish public life that a strong, well managed and dynamic public sector has a major contribution to make to Ireland's future.  That contribution has been so critical in the past that the semi-State sector has been, in a real sense, the rock on which Irish economic development was founded.  We in the Labour Party would not have any wish to participate in a Government that was hostile to the involvement of the semi-State sector in continued growth and development.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with that issue in more detail, it is necessary to deal with some of the issues raised in contributions to this debate last evening and to the controversy of the past few weeks, the controversy that has been unseemly and which has demonstrated the hollowness and superficiality of the Opposition approach, especially Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is well known, particularly by Deputy Molloy, I fundamentally disagree with the ideological position of the Progressive Democrats in relation to all forms of public enterprise, but at least they have tried to conduct themselves with some degree of seriousness throughout this controversy and to <Col N="594" /> address the real issues, even if in a very incoherent manner.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, on the other hand, has betrayed not only an astonishing willingness to condone some elements of sharp practice, but also a complete misunderstanding of the real issues. Nobody has a monopoly on high standards&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;A mantra, Deputy Ahern.  However, the attempts by Fianna Fáil speakers to compare the controversy of the recent past with issues that brought down the last Government have forced them to rely on a version of the truth that would be more at home in an Enid Blyton story than in the House.</P>
      <P>That Government fell in the first instance because crucial information that was in the possession of the then Taoiseach, and used by him for tactical purposes, was withheld from the House. It fell because, in a number of instances, the trust that must exist in any partnership, especially a Government one, was irreparably breached.</P>
      <P>People who have to listen to lectures from Fianna Fáil about accountability, especially in the light of recent experience, would be forgiven for thinking they are in the presence of a true deathbed conversion.  I have been given no reason to distrust the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Michael Lowry.  In regard to the issue of surveillance on him, I do not know whether he was under surveillance, and if he was, who was responsible.  I was fully satisfied &mdash; and I remain so &mdash; that he had adequate reason to believe he was being watched and that the appropriate thing for him to do was to refer the matter to the Garda.</P>

In relation to the Minister's approach to the management of semi-State companies, I have had reason to know from my own experience that he takes his brief seriously, that he approaches it pragmatically and that his interest has been in the survival of the enterprises for which he is accountable and in the preservation of jobs.  In all our discussions on these matters &mdash; and I have no hesitation in saying there have been many &mdash; I have found him both open and approachable and I fully support the policies he has adopted and his commitment to them.</P>
      <P>In relation to the rest of the controversy, the political charge that has been made against Deputy Lowry, when it is all boiled down, may be no more than that he or people acting on his behalf may have overstated his case.</P>

      <P>The truth is that we may not all be prepared to admit it, but every Member of this House knows there have been many complaints down through the years of golden circles, insider trading, inside tracks and the like.  It is an area of Irish life where a lot of light has been shed in recent years. One only has to think back to controversies four or five years ago surrounding Greencore, the Telecom site in Ballsbridge, Carysfort and others to realise that it is impossible to be too <Col N="596" /> vigilant.  I have yet to hear anyone on the other side of the House say that the seemingly unnecessary expense uncovered in the case of some high personages in CIE is the real insult to CIE workers and pensioners.</P>
      <P>I have no interest in participating in the gutter-type slanging matches that have characterised this controversy.  If it has done some good, in ensuring that procurement and disposal procedures are tightened up all around, I believe those changes will be welcomed by the whole of semi-State industry.</P>
      <P>From the time my father came into politics, fifty two years ago, and through a great deal of his political career, the drive for economic development and growth in Ireland was led by the semi-State companies.</P>

      <P>The ESB, Bord na Móna, CSE, CIE, Aer Lingus and others not only contributed jobs in large numbers but they paved the way to a development of infrastructure without which the modernisation of Ireland, and the living standards we enjoy today, would have been impossible.  They all encountered opposition in their day, but the gratitude that modern Ireland owes to these enterprises &mdash; run by the first entrepreneurs and risk-takers in Ireland &mdash; is incalculable.</P>
      <P>In all my experience, I have found that the great majority of people who work in semi-State companies do so out of a sense of public commitment.  There are many, in management and at every other level, who could do better for themselves in the private sector but who have chosen public employment instead. They are the ones who will have been hurt by these controversies and their anger will not have been eased by the crocodile tears of a Fianna Fáil Party that in Government left many State companies starved of essential capital and ignored the necessary decisions when companies were in trouble.  The Members opposite know it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Some years ago I tried to set out the principles that I believe should apply to the existing State companies in the traded sector.  Many of these companies have been subject to fundamental rationalisation measures in recent years, which has been largely necessary on commercial grounds and because of a changing environment.</P>
      <P>It is essential that the changes that are still necessary are approached on a basis where principles are understood.  For that reason, I would like to spell out again the basic principles that I believe should underpin our approach to the semi-State companies in the traded sector. Developmental and financial objectives in terms of both value added, normal financial ratios and scope of the enterprise should be set.  Commercial goals should predominate and social goals, where appropriate, should be clearly distinguished and costed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Methods for resolving tensions between shareholders, board and management should be mutually understood and followed.  Once such arrangements are in place, political involvement should be constrained within the ambit of the procedures.  Capital should be made available on a basis that ensures that estimated returns are in excess of the cost of the funds, taking due account of risk and time factors.  State enterprises should be run by top management and boards that believe in the integrity of State enterprise and its role <Col N="598" /> in the economy.  Otherwise, they should not be appointed or should be removed.</P>
    <P>None of these principles rules out joint ventures or other appropriate forms of business co-operation with other State entities and the private sector or investment abroad for strategic business reasons.  I do not believe that semi-State companies should be allowed to indulge in adventurism, but neither do I believe they want to.  Where sound strategic reasoning suggests that the interests of the company, its customers, and its workforce would be best served by expansion overseas or by diversification in products or markets, it is good business rather than ideology that should inform the decision-making process.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to stress, as a fundamental point, that the adoption of these and other policy principles will not of itself result in enterprise development unless there is philosophical belief at political level which is transmitted to the human fabric of the organisations involved.  Lip service and half-formulated secret privatisation agendas are recipes for failure and have no place in the work we are trying to do.  And it is also necessary to state, again as a fundamental point, that imposed solutions do not work.  Policy has to be developed in partnership and consultation.  Our whole community has a stake in semi-State industry, not just taxpayers but those who work in the companies, those who manage them, those who buy their goods and services, those whose pensions depend on viability and prudent management and those who sell the companies.</P>
    <P>The people who work in public enterprise, and the trade unions which represent them, have demonstrated a commitment in recent years to the success of their enterprises that ought to be an example for all.  Through all the painful adjustments that have taken place &mdash; and there have been many &mdash; the key feature that has ensured successful transition has been a willingness to consider new ideas and even painful sacrifice. Trade unions and employees have <Col N="599" /> earned a right to play a major role in shaping the future of their enterprises. It is often the job of Government to present difficult choices, based on careful analysis, but any Government which believes it can impose change simply by waving its hand is not only fooling itself but behaving irresponsibly.</P>
    <P>We stand at a time when Ireland is gearing itself to compete even more effectively in a rapidly changing world. None of us is immune from that change. We can get through it and benefit from it only if we work together.  It is surely time to put slagging matches to one side and stop all this political point-scoring.</P>

      <P>There are obvious examples in terms of what our semi-State companies can do and I will give two.  What ESB International does in many countries abroad is lauded, as are the efforts it has made abroad on behalf of Ireland.  I will cite a recent example. A Palestinian delegation was in Ireland from the West Bank and Gaza, where the ESBI are working with them to give them an independent electricity supply. They could not overpraise the professionalism, integrity and work of the ESBI.  The same has happened in relation to Telecom workers who went abroad, during the crisis in England two years ago, when praise was given to those workers for the efforts they made on behalf of British Telecom when the emergency struck.  The same is true in many other areas.  I have heard people attacking Aer Rianta.  Aer Rianta has been extremely successful in many corners of the world and long may it last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would remind Deputy Ahern that I have, on many occasions, praised the efforts made by Fianna Fáil in the 1930s in working with the semi-State industries. They were brave decisions by a new party in Government, but that has changed in recent years.  The semi-State bodies have a major role to play and they deserve our support.  They have hard decisions to make and we all know <Col N="600" /> what pain has been suffered in recent years.  It is time for us all to work with the semi-State bodies in facing those decisions.  They have been the major component parts and participants in building up this country and we should never forget that.</P>

      <P>It would have been better for the Minister, Deputy Lowry, to come into this House and answer the questions we put to him.  He cannot keep running away from the fact that he has misled this House and he cannot keep treating this House in a cavalier fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are nine key facts where, it is now clear, the Minister has misled this House.  In regard to the American trip of Mr. Dermot O'Leary the Minister has admitted that he misled the House. As regards his knowledge of the Horgan's Quay site, the Minister says he was aware of the controversy while he was director of elections during the by-election in Cork last year.  Deputy Bernard Allen said he raised the matter <Col N="601" /> as soon as the new Government was formed.</P>
    <P>Our information is that the Minister asked his Department to investigate the matter as soon as he came to office and his Department, I am told, sought the file from CIE last February.  I would like to ask the Minister if that is true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>January.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, the Minister told us in a reply to a parliamentary question on 20 September that he did not know about it until May 1995.  In his Dáil speech he claimed he did not know about it until 21 June and refuses to say who brought it to his attention. However, during questioning last week he said he asked the new chairman of CIE to investigate the site in April 1995. Deputy Lowry also said he was aware of the problem while Mr. O'Leary was chairman of CIE.  These are huge anomalies involving different time frames and enormous gaps.  Which one of these dates is correct: February, April, May or June?  They cannot all be right.</P>
      <P>The Minister also claimed in his speech last week that there was firm interest in the Horgan's Quay site apart from Owen O'Callaghan's.  This is simply incorrect and the information the Minister gave the House in relation to the Cork Harbour Commissioners was misleading.</P>
      <P>The CIE board, under its new chairman and new chief executive, yesterday stood over its decision to sell the site to O'Callaghan Properties.  The Minister has misled the House on the negotiations on that aspect of the Horgan's Quay site.  He claimed in his speech and during Question Time that Mr. Ambrose Kelly negotiated the financial aspects of the deal and acted on behalf of Owen O'Callaghan.  This, the Minister claimed, was an example of a cosy cartel simply because Mr. Kelly knows Mr. O'Callaghan and Mr. Kelly also knows Mr. O'Leary.  By claiming that Mr. Kelly negotiated the deal with CIE the Minister somehow felt he had established proof of his golden circle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="602" /> However, a CIE official said that Mr. Kelly did not negotiate the financial aspects of the deal, and this is in direct conflict with what the Minister told this Chamber.</P>
    <P>The Minister also claimed to present three separate pieces of evidence to back up his claims about Mr. Kelly when, in fact, the primary source for Craig Gardner and for Mr. Kennedy was one Mr. Gahan.  Then we had the kangaroo court spectacle of CIE executives being paraded on television last Friday.  I would like to know who instructed these officials to appear in this rather silly fashion and why.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed, in August, that he would give additional information to the Garda about his allegations of surveillance. Why has he not done this yet? The Minister told this House that the Garda investigation into surveillance was still ongoing.  Not only is the investigation finished, it never really began as the Garda established within days, if not hours, that there was no substance to the Minister's claims that the surveillance was linked to his much hyped clamp-down on semi-States.  Again, the House has been seriously misled in this key area.</P>
    <P>The Minister has also given seriously misleading information to this Chamber about details of the surveillance.  On page 12 of his speech he says a few days after he got the letter alleging he was under surveillance he consulted the Taoiseach and passed the letter to the Garda.  In response to questions on 10 October he said he got the letter alleging surveillance on 1 July and did not tell the Taoiseach and the Garda until 25 July.  Three weeks is hardly a few days, or did the Minister give more misleading information to this House?  Why did he wait so long?</P>
    <P>The Minister also claimed that Mr. O'Callaghan was being bankrolled by CIE.  This is simply not true.  The developer could not have paid for the site, as the Minister claimed, because contracts were only exchanged on 2 October 1995.  This was because the deal was delayed due to a series of investigations <Col N="603" /> lasting from January, and it was held up by the Department.</P>
    <P>I find it most extraordinary that the contract for the site was suddenly rushed out by CIE just before the Minister came to defend himself in this House.  I think this was done deliberately at the Minister's behest because the Minister wanted to be able to say that contracts had been exchanged so that he could come in here and order the review of the site.</P>
    <P>With regard to Killarney, the Minister, while claiming he wanted to get value for taxpayers' money, simply gave away a valuable site.  He has misled the House as in a parliamentary question on 3 October he told Deputy Batt O'Keeffe that he had no function in individual property disposals.  Yet, in his press release on this Killarney development he says he has intervened.</P>
    <P>The Minister has twisted the facts surrounding his conversations with journalists and others about surveillance.  In his speech he selectively quoted the <i>Sunday Business Post</i> as back-up for his surveillance claims.  The security source being quoted by the newspaper said one of the groups that had the Minister under surveillance might even be Fine Gael.  The Minister also appears to have set up a security source that contacted some other newspapers and he is now apparently using that as evidence.</P>
    <P>On top of all this, he is now quoting what journalists have written as evidence when, in fact, reporters got that information from the Minister in off the record briefings.  On 20 August he was quoted in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> as saying that a security source had also confirmed that he was under surveillance. In his speech this has turned out to be a journalist.  Who was the journalist? Is it a case of the Minister giving the reporter information and then, having given it out, using the journalist as his source to carry on?  It seems to be the case.</P>
    <P>In his speech last week he claimed he had not been digging for dirt on any file since he took up office.  That is another <Col N="604" /> case of deliberately misleading this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did an army of accountants peruse the semi-State files? Why were questionnaires sent out by his Department?  Why all the trawling? The Minister has presented the House with a forged Waldorf Astoria bill.  We want to know who forged it.  Was it a deliberate attempt to mislead this House? Also, who wrote the letter he quoted on 10 October from CIE Tours?  The Minister read the letter but not the signature. Why did the CIE chief executive, and not the chairman, report the claims of surveillance.</P>
      <P>We have questioned the judgment of this Minister in many areas.  In the light of some remarks he made in his speech last week we must raise the issue again. In his speech on 10 October he said that appointments to State boards must not give rise to conflicts of interest.  How does the Minister square this with his appointment of a director to Bord Gáis earlier this year.  This individual's firm has very valuable contracts from Bord Gáis, and the director appointed receives all company documentation.  I gather he is the only one on the board who may have a direct conflict of interest with Bord Gáis.  It will be interesting to hear the Minister's comments on that at some stage.</P>
      <P>This affair has gone on for far too long.  The Minister has not answered central questions on surveillance.  He has not substantiated his cartel allegations. He has angered the trade unions and management.  Under Dáil privilege, he has disgracefully attacked the integrity of three businessmen.  He has misled the Dáil in nine key areas and he should now leave office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>The semi-State sector does not need a mutual admiration <Col N="605" /> society in the Dáil, with Members falling over each other to praise what we all know is their important role.  If there is any wrongdoing that should be looked at.  A special Committee of this House could thoroughly investigate such matters. The Minister asked us recently if anybody condoned wrongdoing.  No one in this House would condone wrongdoing but it should be proved.</P>
      <P>I am taking part in this debate because of a most unedifying spectacle which has run for many months with no sign of being concluded thanks to the incompetent handling of the various issues by the Minister, Deputy Lowry. The Minister claimed that he never named any businessman as being responsible for the surveillance on him. As recently as last Sunday week's issue of <i>The Sunday Business Post,</i> Emily O'Reilly quoted him as denying that he had named businessmen to certain individuals and journalists.  I want to put on the record of the House that the Minister named the three businessmen to me, and to many other politicians even after he had been told by the Garda Síochána that the surveillance claims he made in his off the record briefings with the media had been investigated.  He also identified the businessmen to some journalists who work in this House.</P>
      <P>I will outline when the Minister named the businessmen to me.  I was walking towards Grafton Street at approximately 3.45 p.m. on Monday, 31 July.  It was the Monday after the Leinster football final in which Dublin had beaten Meath.  I met the Minister and we briefly discussed the game and a few general issues.  He then mentioned the media coverage of the semi-State sector and said that the surveillance on him the previous week had been &ldquo;ridiculously heavy&rdquo; and suggested that it was &ldquo;unbearable&rdquo;.  He said it had eased last week and he then asked if anyone could &ldquo;call off O'Callaghan, O'Leary and Kelly&rdquo;.</P>

He did not answer that question, but he mentioned the time he took up his position as Minister and the fact that an unsatisfactory situation existed in his Department as regards Mr. O'Leary. The Minister said he had no choice but to take action.  He said he called in Mr. O'Leary and suggested that he could deal with his removal on the basis that a new executive chairman of CIE would be appointed.  He said this would be a face-saving mechanism for Mr. O'Leary. My conversation continued with the Minister for another couple of minutes during which time Senator Norris passed by and exchanged greetings.</P>

Yet he said the surveillance was &ldquo;ridiculously heavy&rdquo; and &ldquo;unbearable&rdquo;. How could he say that if he did not detect it?</P>

      <P>The Minister denied natural justice to three individuals who should clear their names in the courts.  As Deputy Molloy said, he blackened their names to journalists and politicians without giving them the opportunity to respond.  That was a reprehensible act and the three named individuals can pursue their case in the High Court.  The Minister by his actions, and those of his underlings, and minions has misled the House.  He has had to retract and clarify certain statements made during his earlier performances in the House.

      <P>In endeavouring to prove the existence of what does not exist and never existed, the Minister deliberately vilified, smeared insulted and deeply hurt tens of thousands of decent men and women who work in the semi-State sector.

      <P>I call on the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to apologise to the workers of CIE and the semi-State sector in general for his unfounded allegations against them. While he was appointed Minister to protect, develop and advance commercial semi-State companies, in effect he has libelled, slandered, undermined and debased the entire semi-State sector. The Minister's credibility is in tatters, his speeches are being rewritten by the Labour Party and Democratic Left, he has lost all control of his Department and is incapable of discharging his ministerial functions.</P>
      <P>From my contacts I can assure the Minister there is a great deal of anger in the trade union movement that his authority has been weakened irreversibly. While digging himself deeper into the unsavoury mire he created for himself, he has adopted a specific strategy of endeavouring to blacken Fianna Fáil, making sweeping and scurrilous allegations against our party.  He has reintroduced Civil War politics to Dáil Éireann in a vicious, vindictive manner and should be condemned for doing so.</P>

      <P>We have had our fill of the Minister's witch-hunt, innuendoes and insinuations. I might remind him that we are the largest party in the State and, for that reason, at least 50 per cent of business people will inevitably be Fianna Fáil supporters.  However, as far as the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications is concerned, if a business person is involved in a business deal with the State or other parties, if he or she happens to be a Fianna Fáil supporter, in the Minister's eyes, that person is a crook.  That attitude is offensive and sickening.</P>

      <P>We have had our fill of the Minister's ridiculing the good name of our party.  I will tell the Minister where the real crookery lies: we had his crookery over the summer months when he made his spurious allegations, we had his crookery in assassinating people's characters and misleading the Dáil.  We have had the crookery of the most Machiavellian minds in the country on behalf of the three Government parties concocting the Minister's speech, attempting to pretend that what happened during the past summer was of our making, in an attempt to convince us that the Minister could not have said what he did then, in an attempt to savagely smear and attack the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>The public has not been conned by these slick tactics.  The dogs in the street could tell one that the bottom line is that the Minister's standing and reputation have been damaged irreparably.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to this matter this House has been treated with contempt by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and with arrogance by his colleagues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House has heard much about <Col N="613" />&ldquo;cosy cartels&rdquo; over the past summer, the Minister appointed himself the avenging angel of the electorate, promising to poison &ldquo;sweetheart deals&rdquo; and end inside trading.  He made his last stand in Horgan's Quay in Cork, holding up the sale of the CIE site to O'Callaghan properties as an example of a &ldquo;cosy cartel&rdquo; in operation but his recollection of the history of that site is scandalously selective and disingenuous.</P>
    <P>I can illustrate here this evening that the Minister's &ldquo;cosy cartel&rdquo; amounts to little more than a Fine Gael &ldquo;carousel&rdquo;, having its roots in Deputy Allen's sponsorship of another development company keen on the Horgan's Quay site, North Gate Investments Limited.</P>
    <P>Last November Deputy Allen claimed that another interested party &mdash; North Gate Investments Limited &mdash; had been shut out of the purchase of the site after it had been secured by O'Callaghan properties at more than 35 per cent above the two independent valuations sought by CIE.  Since then two reviews have confirmed compliance with the guidelines then in operation.  In the intervening period the Minister of State has continuously engaged in a vindictive campaign against O'Callaghan Properties, citing the experience of North Gate Investments Limited as its justification.  He has been urging the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications to instigate endless so-called investigations into the sale of the Horgan's Quay site, incidentally none of which found any fault with that sale. The main purpose of such investigations was to discredit a perfectly legal and legitimate transaction handled by CIE in accordance with its procedures, not changed by the Minister despite his often repeated and malignly-constructed reservations about them.</P>
    <P>The Horgan's Quay saga was promoted to the status of &ldquo;cosy cartel&rdquo;, ripping off millions of pounds at the expense of taxpayers.  The Minister, despite having spent £150,000 of taxpayers' money on external consultants, huge fees on public relations handlers and advisers, wasted the time of the <Col N="614" /> semi-State employees he insulted and to whom he has not yet apologised and failed miserably to find the smallest shred of evidence to support his claims in this House last week.  On Thursday last, he conveniently announced that he had an alternative firm, North Gate Investments Limited, apparently prepared to take over the site on the same terms and conditions as O'Callaghan properties.</P>
    <P>Who is North Gate Investments Limited, the company so hard done by by CIE, and so close to the heart of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Allen?  Who are these white knight developers who have ridden to the assistance of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications?  North Gate Investments Limited is a Cork property development company whose quantity surveyor &mdash; wait for it &mdash; to borrow a phrase from the Minister himself &mdash; is none other than Patrick F. Coveney Associates, the family firm of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Coveney.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;this merciless pursuit of private individuals, this discrediting of CIE and the entire semi-State sector. This is not about openness and transparency, about virtue or the high moral ground; this is crass commercial interest topped up by envy and political malice. Those twin towers of openness and transparency &mdash; I refer to those of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Allen &mdash; not once alluded to the fact that Patrick F. <Col N="615" /> Coveney Associates had a specific, vested interest in North Gate Investments Limited if the latter company had obtained the site.  Neither did either of them allude to the fact that in the summer of last year Patrick F. Coveney Associates was actively involved with North Gate Investments Limited on a project in Cork City at a time when North Gate Investments Limited had expressed an interest in that site.</P>
      <P>Do those same two Ministers seriously expect us to believe that, if CIE had agreed to sell the site to that company by private treaty &mdash; as they did ultimately to O'Callaghan properties &mdash; North Gate Investments Limited and its design team, including Patrick F. Coveney Associates, would have objected?  Do they expect us to believe they would have rushed in to say &ldquo;stop, we cannot purchase on that basis, you must go to public tender&rdquo;?  Indeed, if they had purchased it at 35 per cent more than its market value, would those same two Ministers not now be contending it was anything other than a proper beneficial deal &mdash; even a sweetheart deal &mdash; for the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been a shameful episode, a controversy contrived and conceived with political malice, executed by lies and half-truths, innuendo and character assassination.  This country and House have been shamefully served by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and his junior colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Allen. To save his political neck, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications has been prepared to come in here, to sacrifice semi-State companies and private individuals, from his bunker, under the protection of this House.  Indeed he has made decent public servants look like caricature used car salesmen, exposing them to public ridicule. Unlike those he attacked in this House, the Minister, Deputy Lowry, has run and hidden behind the privilege of this House and his expensive handlers. He has refused to be interviewed other than a 30 second sound bite at his bidding, having sent others, like his friend <Col N="616" /> and colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, to do his dirty work for him in public.</P>
    <P>It has been an extraordinary six months in Irish politics.  No Minister has so demeaned politics, shown himself less fit for public office than the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  He has been successful in driving O'Callaghan Properties from the Horgan's Quay site, having told them he knew nothing about it until 2 June last whereas we now know that the controversy stoked by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications arose in the Cork by-election which returned Deputy Coveney to this House.  In addition, we know from his own admissions about the Bord Gáis affair, the then Minister of State, Deputy Coveney, kept an active lookout for his interests in his family business.</P>
    <P>From all the material facts emerging it is clear there has been a &ldquo;cosy cartel&rdquo; of Fine Gael Ministers who have maintained masonic silence on their interests and conflicts of interests.  We now know from Government sources that all Government parties had a hand in this deeply disingenuous and distorted version of the material facts relating to the Horgan's Quay site.  The Minister promised to tell all.  What he delivered was a dismal attempt at a crude political hatchet job which has blown up in his face.</P>

      <P>We aim to encourage growth and diversity and above all to use available resources to increase growth, protect jobs and create new ones.  As my party Leader outlined, those key principles are the cornerstone of our approach to the semi-State sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examples of the positive approach we are taking include the following.  Bord na Móna will be revived as a result of an injection of £120 million in State investment.  Aer Lingus is now on a sounder footing following equity injection and restructuring with the final instalment of equity due this year.  The plan to save TEAM Aer Lingus and to secure its future continues.  Bord Gáis continues to grow and has invested successfully in securing gas supply.  A major expansion programme is under appraisal at my request.  The upgrading of Whiddy and continued development at Whitegate have given a new sense of purpose to the Irish National Petroleum Corporation.  The Government remains committed to finding a strategic partner for Telecom.  A second mobile phone competition is now under way and I welcome the initiative of existing State companies in diversifying and joining <Col N="619" /> consortia in bidding for that licence &mdash; more power to them.  We are committed through social partnership and dialogue to finding agreement with all the interests within the ESB to secure a strong and vibrant future for that crucially important company.  Investment in light rail and the continued upgrading of our rail network will benefit CIE in its strategically vital role as the State's transport company.  A fundamental review of postal services is at an advanced stage in An Post to seek to ensure that it survives and thrives in an era of increased competition.</P>
    <P>The truth is that if Ireland's economic development over the past 50 years had depended on the private sector and on the profit motive alone, that development would not have happened.  The private sector would have refused to take the risks or to wait for the returns associated with the huge investment that was necessary.</P>
    <P>The semi-State sector has also given the lead in providing good employment and high standards and that good employment has been repaid by an outstanding contribution from the employees of the semi-State sector who are public servants, servants of the whole community in the best possible sense of that term.  They know, and I can reassure them, that Labour in Government will never abandon the semi-State sector&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but stood back and thought out a comprehensive strategy for the semi-State bodies for which he is responsible.  This strategy, as enunciated in the House by the Minister last night and elsewhere previously, represents a real vision about how the Minister, Deputy Lowry, and the Government will prepare the commercial semi-State bodies for a competitive marketplace in which they must become more efficient and customer focused.  This strategy will ensure that these companies will have a viable future and thus be able to provide viable and sustainable jobs for their employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's strategies for the semi-State companies are being implemented in a consistent and coherent manner and are already yielding significant results as indicated by the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg.  The Minister, Deputy Lowry, has tackled Bord na Móna's crippling debt problem which was ignored by his predecessors.  He has provided Telecom Éireann with a mandate to seek the strategic alliance partner vital for the company's future.  He has facilitated the completion of the crucial restructuring and development plan in TEAM Aer Lingus which aims to ensure its future viability.  He has actively promoted the seminal agreement on employee participation in Aer Lingus.  He has taken positive action to speed up the negotiations on the cost and competitiveness review of the ESB. He has given CIE the go ahead for the <Col N="621" /> biggest ever investment programme in Irish railways.</P>
    <P>Those are some examples of what the Minister has achieved in just ten months in office.  I would like to mention a more recent example.  Earlier today, even amid the continuing diversions and side issues which have been introduced into this debate, the board of An Post endorsed a report on the future of the company initiated by Minister Lowry last June.  This report charts the future of An Post for the next five years during which new competitive challenges will emerge.  It gives the company an excellent basis from which to address these challenges and it offers it a way to refocus its activities.  The report will put An Post on a sound footing for the future. It typifies Minister Lowry's strategic approach to the semi-State sector which he intends to pursue with commitment and vision.</P>
    <P>Despite the efforts of some Opposition Deputies to deflect attention from the core issues in this debate, the reality is that the Minister's strategy for the semi-State sector is working and is already showing positive results. Through his strategy and actions to date the Minister, Deputy Lowry, has proved himself to be a real ally to the semi-State companies and their employees. He is the Minister who is preparing them for a future in which they will see growth and profitability and in which they will provide sustainable and rewarding jobs for their employees.</P>
    <P>In contrast, through years of consistent inaction by former Ministers, Deputies Brennan, Geoghegan-Quinn and Cowen, Fianna Fáil allowed the semi-State companies to deteriorate financially to the point where serious action and surgery was required.  The Fianna Fáil Party and the dream team, in particular, have consistently condoned and supported closed deals behind closed doors, especially in relation to the Horgan's Quay site in Cork.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that it would be hijacked by the events which resulted from the statements by the Minister during the summer recess.  We thought that by this time the Minister would have given a reasonable explanation to the House.  However, he did not.</P>
      <P>In my contribution last night I devoted some time to the Lowry affair and sought to use the remainder of my 40 minutes to put before the House the proposals, policy ideas and objectives of the Progressive Democrats on the way in which the semi-State sector should develop over the next five years.</P>
      <P>On the Lowry affair I posed certain questions.  I would have expected those questions to have been answered.  They related to the file in the property section of CIE which was sent to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  I posed questions rather than making any allegation against the Minister of giving wrong information or misleading the House.  I asked the Minister if such a file was sent to his Department in January 1995, if it had been carefully examined in his Department and if the details of the sale which were outlined in that file were approved by his Department and sent back to CIE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have it on very high authority that this file was sent to the Minister's Department.  I know the names of the officials who dealt with it in the Department and the names of officials who <Col N="625" /> dealt with it in CIE.  In his statement to the House on Tuesday, 10 October 1995, the Minister said he knew nothing about the detail of the Horgan's Quay site until 21 June and hung all of his summer allegations about cosy cartels and surveillance on this sale.  He dragged other individuals in and said they were present when this extraordinary deal was being negotiated.  I am amazed that the Minister, who spoke after me last night, did not refer to the questions that had been asked.  He did not say he would answer them today or that he would check the facts.  He ignored them last night.</P>
    <P>I was on a television programme, &ldquo;Cúrsaí&rdquo;, last night where the leader of one of the parties in the rainbow coalition, the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, sought to drag a smokescreen across this question and refused to answer.  I am amazed that the same Minister who was the first Government speaker tonight made no attempt to answer the questions I posed. The Tánaiste and Leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Spring, has also contributed tonight.  The three parties have contributed to this debate in the knowledge that this question was posed in the House and no attempt has been made to answer it or even to refer to it.  There seems to be an effort by the three parties in Government to ignore these facts in the hope that they will go away and that the contradictions that lie on the record of the House in the contributions the Minister, Deputy Lowry, has made, will be forgotten and swept away.</P>
    <P>None of this difficulty would be continuously raised in the House if the Minister was man enough to stand up and say he made a mistake, that he regrets what he has done and that he withdraws what he said.  We could get on to deal with the real business of this House.  Many of us in this House said things in the past but we stood up manfully, withdrew them and apologised. That has been the tradition in this House.  If I was to say the Minister told the House a lie I would be told by the Chair that I could not make such an <Col N="626" /> allegation.  If the Minister tells the House a lie who will do anything about it?  Are we to have a situation where the Minister's contribution contradicts what he said earlier?  Was this file sent to the Department in January 1995?  Was it carefully examined?  Did it contain the details of this sale and was it approved and sent back to the property section in CIE?  That is crucial to the whole issue that has been raised here.  I will give the Minister an opportunity to reply.</P>

My speech was circulated at 6.30 p.m.  I made this statement in the House at 7.2 p.m. and I did not conclude until 7.40 p.m.  The Minister had an official sitting beside him during that time and other officials were available outside.

I fully accept that many people in this House seem to operate on the basis of what word processors tell them to say yesterday but when it comes to a debate on an important issue, when one's ministerial record and integrity is an issue, one should come into this House in a position to answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to simple questions.

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. It has been appropriate at various times to stand back and see whether policies of the past which have been successful are being pursued to the present day.  In the last couple of years I have queried the way we measure a successful economy.  By any objective yardstick, whether economic growth or fiscal management, we have had a successful economy, with high growth rates and public finances under control, yet approximately 280,000 people are unemployed. I am not the only person in the developed world who questions the way we measure success on the economic front.  It appears that if we continue to measure success in the way we do we will have the most successful economy in the world but practically everybody will be unemployed.  However, that is a matter for another day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> Irish firms who trade in the British market are under considerable pressure. I acknowledge the significant achievement by successive Governments and Irish industry over a long period in reducing our dependency on the British market from a total dependency in the late 1960s to about 30 per cent today. At least 45 per cent of Forbairt assisted companies export to the United Kingdom.  Those are generally the most labour intensive companies with low paid workers &mdash; during my time as Minister for Trade it was estimated that perhaps more than 50 per cent of employment was created by those firms.</P>
    <P>It is not a coincidence that since the Irish pound broke parity with sterling in April this year unemployment figures have been increasing.  There may be other factors involved, and I am not blaming the Minister for Finance for the problems in that regard, but it is not a coincidence.  With the rate continuously increasing Irish firms have no profit margin with which to trade and that impinges on jobs.  Furthermore, I believe the position will become worse.</P>
    <P>Various calculations have been made of the number of job losses in the food sector, which has been badly affected. In the mushroom industry which provides employment in my constituency, people are being laid off.  It was believed that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry had proposals in hand to make changes to assist these firms and I urge him to meet the commitments he has given in this regard.  Something needs to be done.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that later.  In 1992-93 when we faced problems arising from the exchange rate the then Government introduced the market development fund.  I am aware that the advice to this Government would be that a reintroduction of that fund would be outlawed by the EU.  However, it should not be above the ingenuity of <Col N="644" /> civil servants to devise a scheme to alleviate the problems facing Irish firms. If companies in France and Germany were faced with similar problems something would be done about the matter.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister is open to suggestions in all aspects of economic policy and the time has come to consider initiatives to help firms in this position. Otherwise we will have a wonderfully successful economy in objective terms but increasing unemployment, which is unacceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the bona fides of my colleague, Deputy McCreevy, who is trying to address a real problem.  However, he has made no useful suggestions.  In his truncated remarks he suggested a form of intervention &mdash; permanent, ongoing subsidies &mdash; which is not only illegal in European terms but goes against everyone of the economic tenets and principles in which he believes.  I am amazed that a person of his rigorous intellect would propose a measure that offends all the values and views he has so eloquently portrayed here, on &ldquo;Question and Answers&rdquo; and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that; I said that ingenuity should be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy requested another form of market development fund, which is a permanent, ongoing subsidy that is not only illegal but, if I understand the Deputy's consistent political position on economics, offends all the principles which he espouses.  As a socialist, I suggest other measures can be taken to assist the firms to which the Deputy referred.  The Irish pound has appreciated above the value of sterling since March this year and has been consistently trading at about £1.02 per pound sterling.  That creates a problem for Irish companies trading in the traditional markets.  While we have no accurate statistics on the extent of dependence by the Irish sector on the UK market, I would not dispute the figures put forward by the Deputy &mdash; allowing <Col N="645" /> for a 10 per cent margin either way, they are accurate.</P>
      <P>What we have done for the firms involved is much better than that suggested by the Deputy, it is legal and does not offend or distort the internal rigours of a market to which we are committed within the European Union. As a result of the prudent management of our finances our inflation rate, projected at 2.25 per cent for 1996, is virtually half that of the UK at just under 4 per cent.  The interest rate payable on business loans is 1 per cent lower than that paid by our competitors in Britain. In addition, the small business loan fund which I introduced last year and which my colleague, Deputy Richard Bruton, has extended this year to a sum of £208 million will provide business loans for small businesses, including the service sector, to a minimum of £20,000 at a fixed rate of 6.5 per cent.  It provides to that indigenous traded sector a measure of sustenance and relief which it previously did not have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked what am I doing in this regard.  He put forward one proposal which is illegal and offends every economic principle to which I formerly thought he was committed.  I am outlining the measures we have implemented.  However, these firms will still experience difficulties in their operations. In addition to the two major instruments I have described already, in last year's budget we raised the threshold for PRSI contributions and exempted the first £50 for labour intensive indigenous firms with traditionally low profit margins, whose employees would be paying the full rate of PRSI. As a consequence the total cost of their wage bill, that is what they have to pay to their workers in addition to the employer's PRSI, has been reduced.  We have devised a mechanism that is legal, whereas what the Deputy is proposing is not legal within the context of the European Union.  Second, it is effective. I measure that effectiveness in the following way &mdash; reported redundancies this year are 19 per cent lower than they were this time last year.  In the period <Col N="646" /> to which the Deputy referred, 1992-93, the redundancy figures soared.  The message from those statistics was borne out by anecdotal evidence that exposed fragile marginal companies trading traditionally into the UK market were haemorrhaging and virtually closing down.  The Deputy's colleague, Deputy Lawlor, who has a very close knowledge of these affairs, will be aware of some of the matters to which I am referring.</P>
    <P>I recognise the problem and we are doing something about it.  What Fianna Fáil has proposed is not only illegal but offends the very economic principles which the current Fianna Fáil management advocates and supports.  The way we are approaching the ongoing difficulty which some sectors of the Irish economy are experiencing is the best way open to us and the only way that will ensure their ongoing economic survival.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Location of Eastern Health Board Clinic.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="LiamLawlor" hpid="Mr. Lawlor Mr. Lawlor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lawlor</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and the Minister of State for being present during the Adjournment.  I am aware that this afternoon the Eastern Health Board distributed an information notice to residents who are very concerned about the location of this unit.  In its literature the Eastern Health Board states that no methadone or needle exchange service for drug users will commence without the fullest consultation with the local community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put in context the genuine criticisms and concerns of residents in the immediate vicinity and surrounding area where it is proposed to locate this small clinic.  I do not think anyone would accept that it is the NIMBY &mdash;&ldquo;Not In My Back Yard&rdquo;&mdash; syndrome. A converted caretaker's residence adjacent to a district distributor road that serves a community of approximately 700 to 800 families is not an ideal location for this type of service in any form.  In 1978-79 the then Minister for Health, Mr. Charles J. Haughey, gave <Col N="647" /> the Coolmine therapeutic community &mdash; one of the pioneering centres for day and residential drug treatment &mdash; what was the old Ashley Stad where there is an additional facility to provide a service for those afflicted by drug addiction. People of Dublin 15 and those in the immediate environs of this project are opposed to the location of this new clinic.  The James Connolly Memorial Hospital is a vast complex and if the health board had found some other location within the complex to provide this service nobody would have objected.  There is a real concern that this is the thin edge of the wedge and once the facility is opened it will be expanded.  It is adjacent to the public bus service and is near the district distributor road which housewives pass to get to the main street in Blanchardstown. Large numbers of teenagers and young people pass it on their way to and from school or when they play at the sports grounds.  For those reasons the local community held a number of large meetings.  The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, attended one on Friday night and I, together with other public representatives, attended a meeting on Monday night.  There is genuine concern about the location.  This is the nub of the criticism.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Eastern Health Board has been less than forthcoming. Only today did it deliver notices to a limited number of houses and this is an unsatisfactory way of communicating with public representatives and residents. It was difficult to make contact with senior health board officials but I am aware that Dr. Barry met residents' representatives who are concerned about this unit but rather than having an exchange of informations they were told the die was cast.  I ask the Minister to call a temporary halt with a view to finding a more suitable location to serve the Dublin 15 area.  I have no doubt that the Minister of State has informed the Minister of the real fears of residents. Nobody at the meeting the other night denied the need for the service but I do <Col N="648" /> not think a converted caretaker's house at the rear entrance to James Connolly Memorial Hospital is suitable for such a service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank Deputy Lawlor for raising this issue on the Adjournment and giving me the opportunity to put departmental policy on record.</P>
      <P>Drug use and drug addiction is one of the greatest dangers to health.  It is becoming a national problem.  It is endemic in certain areas of Dublin and is not confined to any one particular area of the city.  One's social and economic background is no longer a protection for one's children and family.  I am very much aware of the concerns of various communities and individuals in the Blanchardstown area about the proposed clinic.  I know there is a protest outside the House this evening but I draw Deputies' attention to the fact that it is not very long ago, just last week, since there was a major march to this House by people demanding extra clinical facilities and additional methadone treatment for persons in their community, particularly for their own children. Yesterday I met representatives of ICON, the north inner city community group, and they have accepted a clinic in their area and are looking for increased facilities.</P>
      <P>It is a very difficult problem.  I met a woman in that delegation yesterday whose son committed suicide and another woman who put it to me &ldquo;what does one do if one's teenage daughter comes home pale, sweating and shivering and shaking and she needs either heroin or a substitute and the only substitute available is methadone?&rdquo; There are concerns on both sides and both have decided to take to the streets on this issue.  It will have to be addressed as a matter of policy.  I believe the Government and the Minister for Health have a responsibility to persons who are addicted to drugs and we have to put measures in place to help, in so far as any society can, alleviate the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> Deputies will be aware that the provision of services for drug misusers in the Dublin area is a matter for the Eastern Health Board in the first instance. Since 1992 funding has been provided to the board to enable it to implement the recommendations of the Government strategy to prevent drug misuse.  This involves the development of a comprehensive programme of services for drug misusers, ranging from education and prevention to treatment and rehabilitation. While the ultimate object of treatment programmes for drug misusers is a drug free lifestyle, it is internationally acknowledged that this is not an option in the short-term for many drug misusers.  Consequently it has been necessary to introduce a number of treatment options, most notably methadone maintenance, as a means of (a) stabilising the behaviour of drug misusers which, in turn, can lead to a reduction in drug related crime and (b) enabling those who wish to become drug free to do so and to proceed to rehabilitation.  A community drug centre was established for the residents of Dublin 15 to provide treatment to drug misusers in the catchment area in which they reside.  Other centres have been successfully in operation for up to three years with minimal problems associated with their operation.  The treatment provided at these centres includes (a) counselling and support for drug misusers, their families and carers and (b) prevention services to the community as a whole through a network of outreach workers and counsellors.</P>
    <P>To date three community drug centres have been established by the Eastern Health Board.  The centres are run under strict medical and general supervision.  The hours of operation are normal business hours.  Each patient's general practitioner is informed of all treatment provided by the centre.  The patient is required to co-operate with the treatment programme worked out by the centre's staff.  This includes medication, urine screening, appointment times etc.  All patients must be over 18 years.  They must respect the centre's <Col N="650" /> staff and the local residents and business people.  They must help to promote a positive image for the centre in the locality, for example, by not congregating, dealing in drugs or committing crimes in the locality.  All breaches of these requirements will incur a sanction worked out by the doctor and other professionals dealing with that patient.</P>
    <P>Any community would misunderstand the nature of the drug problem if it thought it could be ring-fenced from its implications.  There are quite a number of addicts in Dublin 15.  No community is safe from the real threat, and we have to try to deal with it.  If we ignore it, it will spread and not only the persons who are addicted will be at risk.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that local communities in the Blanchardstown area are apprehensive about the establishment of a community drug centre in their area.  I appeal to them, however, to acknowledge that the most successful way to provide treatment for those misusing drugs is to provide it in the community. I would rather have drug addicts on methadone treatment in my community than drug addicts who are not on methadone.  I ask them to consider the views of community organisations in areas of the city where such centres have already been established.  It has been demonstrated quite clearly that with proper supervision and control, those centres work effectively with the minimum of interference to the local community.</P>
    <P>The Eastern Health Board has given assurances to the local community in Blanchardstown as follows: from today an additional addiction counsellor and two outreach workers, based at the new centre, will form a new team for the Dublin 15 area.  Until now there has only been one addiction counsellor.  The new team will assist and advise young people, their families and the community at large who may be worried about drug use problems.  The team will provide education and prevention programmes and no methadone or needle exchange services for drug users will be <Col N="651" /> commenced without the fullest consultation with the local community.  The new centre will service the Dublin 15 area only.</P>
    <P>I see drug abuse as a very serious problem.  It creates serious security problems but it is also increasingly a serious health problem, a problem that cannot be ignored.  No community is immune.  We must have a network of centres where persons can be treated. We cannot proceed on the basis that if we put our heads in the sand our community will be safe and the problem will only exist elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a glacadh leatsa as ucht go dtug tú an deis dom an cheist seo a ardú ar an Athló.  Ba mhaith liom freisin mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis an Aire agus leis an Aire Stáit as ucht a bheith i láthair sa Teach chun an cheist seo a phlé.</P>
      <P>We pride ourselves on having a good mix of private and public health care and also because our public health service can, for the most part, provide many of the required services.  However, the Minister has acknowledged that there is a necessity for private health insurance.  That has been provided by the voluntary health insurance company in a totally non-competitive market and with considerable freedom to operate on its own without regard to either its members or the Government of the day. The VHI has a very important role to play in the marketplace, a role I have supported and which I hope will be strengthened when the Minister introduces legislation in the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I am appalled, and I am sure the Minister will be equally appalled, that the VHI should suggest charging higher premia to older people living in this State who wish to join.  I am appalled because, as we all know, it is when we come to our latter years that <Col N="652" /> we have most call on the health care service. The vast majority of the people who avail of the public health care service are older people.  The VHI must be conscious of that and have stated strongly that if competition is to be introduced there should be no out for any competitor coming into the market whereby they would deal only with younger and healthier people.  I accept that and think it proper.</P>
    <P>The last time I raised this matter the Minister was favourably disposed to the introduction of a consumer's council for members of the VHI.  I suggest this again because I am concerned, and I am sure the Minister is equally so, that the VHI should be not alone answerable and responsive to the public and to its members, but should be seen to be so.</P>
    <P>Not alone did the chief executive of the VHI warn about the possibility of older members being asked to pay higher premia when joining the VHI, he also announced to all and sundry that there would be another increase in premia next year of at least 3 per cent.  We on this side of the House will oppose any move by the VHI to charge older people higher premia, but if another general increase is granted it will mean that in the past two years the VHI will have increased its fees by 21 per cent, almost seven times the rate of inflation. I do not believe either the chief executive officer or the VHI generally have justified such a level of increase.  They are way out of line with inflation which is currently running at about 2.4 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>We have all come to realise that the VHI has been allowed to increase its premia on a regular basis and is not answerable to it members.  It is time the VHI came out from behind the cloud, as it were, and became answerable to the Members of this House, because it is a company which is answerable, through the Minister, to this House.  It might be no harm were the chief executive and senior management staff of VHI to come before one of the committees of <Col N="653" /> this House to answer the genuine concerns of Members of this House regarding the way it conducts its business.</P>
    <P>Subscribers are always helpless when price increases are announced by the VHI.  The establishment of a user's council must now be an immediate priority.  It would give the members of the VHI a say.  The VHI has over one million subscribers to whom it is not answerable.  It certainly does not give us an opportunity to have an input into its operations or its policy.  It is important that we put our comments on the record, not to be in any way mischievous, but because of genuine concern about the direction the company is taking.</P>
    <P>For far too long the VHI has stood for high insurance costs.  If we are to resolve the position whereby we are insured for everything but covered for nothing, the VHI must be made answerable and I rely on the Minister to make that happen.</P>

      <P>The Deputy referred to increases granted over the last two years and quoted figures in that regard.  However, it is not correct to say the increases were granted.  While the VHI is statutorily obliged to inform the Minister, I do not have discretion in the matter.  In other words, I cannot refuse a proposal by the VHI to increase its fees.  It is not a question of me granting increases, it is a question of the VHI proceeding to implement increases and announcing them as it deems fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to justification for the increases.  The VHI is a non-profit making organisation and medical inflation runs far in excess of consumer price index inflation.  The most recent VHI returns reveal that, after drawing down income from past investment, income barely matches <Col N="654" /> expenditure.  The company is trading at a loss on a daily basis.  As a non-profit making insurance organisation it is obliged to make ends meet but it is not in a strong financial position.  I have inherited that difficulty and it causes me a great deal of concern.</P>
    <P>I hope shortly to introduce legislation in this regard.  From a user's point of view, there are not enough members on the board of the VHI and two of them are consultants.  They represent the supplier rather than the consumer.  The legislation will extend the board's membership to approximately 12 and during the debate on the legislation we can discuss the validity of the Deputy's views on a user's council.  VHI subscribers, rather than suppliers of the service, would be well represented on a board comprising more members.</P>
    <P>The people have been well served for many years by the VHI, particularly by community rated health insurance.  That is the key to addressing the Deputy's fears about older people having loaded premia.  The community rated health system has been, and continues to be, the basis on which private health insurance is available to a large proportion of the population.  More than 35 per cent of the population is covered by private health insurance, three times the percentage covered in the United Kingdom, which operates a system that relates premium to the risk of the individual.</P>
    <P>Community rating works.  It ensures that a high proportion of our population is covered by health insurance and, compared with the United Kingdom, a much greater percentage of our elderly is covered.</P>
    <P>Equally, there has been a significant level of stability in the Irish health insurance market for many years in terms of membership.  It has not been prone to the fluctuations in membership levels of other risk-based insurance markets that are heavily influenced by general economic conditions.  I am, of course, fully aware that membership could fall here as in any other country if insurers do not control their costs but <Col N="655" /> community rating can help to provide a stability in the market, particularly for the vulnerable groups; the elderly are a very vulnerable group.</P>
    <P>Adherence to the principle of community rating ensures that the same level of premium is charged, for the same level of health insurance cover, to all persons regardless of their age, sex and health status.  It thereby ensures that health insurance cover is available to the elderly and chronically ill at a rate no higher than that charged to less vulnerable groups.  In a risk-rated system such persons could find private health insurance beyond their means and such a situation, with the worry it would cause to the vulnerable, would be unacceptable to me as Minister for Health and to society in general.</P>
    <P>The principle of community rating and its preservation in our health insurance system is regarded as so vital that it has been enshrined in law.  The Health Insurance Act, 1994, which regulates the sector in a Single Market context, made it obligatory that all insurance undertakings wishing to conduct health insurance business provide health insurance contracts on a community rated basis.  Accordingly, the law of the land requires that private health insurance be sold on a community rated basis only and I have no plans to change this position.</P>
    <P>In terms of entitlements to be insured, the Health Insurance Act, 1994, provides for open enrolment and lifetime cover.  Therefore, private health insurance undertakings could not refuse to provide or renew cover by reference to age, sex or health status.  Also, there are reasonable and legitimate measures built into the policies of insurers which can be regarded as coaxing subscribers to join early.  These various measures involve periods, which vary according to the age of the individual, during which the subscriber must wait before benefit will be payable.  In addition, under the draft minimum benefit regulations health insurers must pay a grant towards <Col N="656" /> the hospitals costs of childbirth.  Extensive regulations which include under-pinning these principles are being finalised by my Department.</P>
    <P>It is of course desirable that the community rated system which ultimately exists to serve all the people equally should be subscribed to as widely and as early as possible.  It relies on solidarity between the generations whereby the young and healthy subscribe in the knowledge and confidence that the system will be there to serve them well in later life should the need arise.  There are positive incentives to persuade people to join health insurance at an early age.</P>
    <P>Charging higher premiums to older people joining the VHI is inimical to community rating and is, therefore, contrary to the law.  I have no plans to change the law in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for giving me an opportunity to raise this matter. It is no secret that the unemployment position in Cork city is particularly bad, especially in certain areas.  The Liebert company can be rescued and the jobs saved.  The workforce at the company have given a loyal and dedicated commitment to the company for many years and they and their families want the company saved.</P>
      <P>SIPTU is seeking a Labour Court hearing to resolve the impasse.  It rejected a survival plan because of overtime conditions, a pay freeze and sick pay clauses.  Agreement has been more or less reached on the number of redundancies and the methodology of their implementation.  In SIPTU's view the problems are not insurmountable and if progress were made on a number of issues the package could be made more attractive to the workers and approved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Government to intervene directly in this dispute, to bring all sides around the table and to resolve the matter. We cannot afford another factory closure in Cork.  The differences <Col N="657" /> between the sides are not beyond resolution. Rather than the present stalemate, with some sides wanting to resort to the Labour Court, direct intervention is required to alleviate the difficulties. Another factory closure for Cork would have an immense psychological impact on the people there, and the prospects of a replacement industry are not great. We have already heard news this week of a private sector development at Horgan's Quay not going ahead at this stage, with the developer in question pulling out.  That project had the potential for 800 jobs and it is a matter of deep regret to me that the project has been shelved.  It is the type of project involving the private sector that can lead&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point in the context of trying to save the jobs at Liebert and the importance of so doing, because I do not see any projects for the city or region on the horizon.  Can the Minister advise me if that is the position? The jobs are critical and the wrong signals will be sent out if Liebert closes. I have spoken to many families affected and I discovered a commitment on behalf of the workforce to save this plant.  The workers are anxious to retain their jobs.  There are different views as to whether the company is anxious to continue.  I suspect it is, it entered into negotiations.  The company has not yet been wound down.  We learned that we have a few weeks to save the plant, if we can, and I urge the Minister &mdash; I know he will be genuine in this &mdash; to do everything possible to do so.</P>

      <P>I want to thank Deputy Martin for raising this issue on the Adjournment.  It is an important and topical issue for the <Col N="658" /> country and for Cork.  I, too, am deeply concerned about recent developments at the Liebert plant in Cork.  The company is a wholly subsidiary of the Liebert Corporation of Columbus, Ohio, and is a division of Emerson Electric Corporation of St. Louis, USA.</P>
      <P>Liebert is one of the world's leading suppliers of computer support systems. The facility in Cork, which was established in 1983, manufacturers air conditioning units for computers and approximately 130 workers are currently employed at the plant.  Unfortunately, there has been a history of poor industrial relations at the Cork plant for some years.  There was a major strike there in 1990 which lasted for 13 weeks. The advisory service of the Labour Relations Commission recently carried out an examination and prepared a report on industrial relations in Liebert and a review of the company's operations was also carried out by the Irish Productivity Centre recently.</P>
      <P>The current dispute arises from proposals put forward by management to effect cost savings.  Among the issues covered by the cost saving proposals were redundancies, a pay pause, a peace clause, reduction in overtime rates, reduction in shift premia and elimination of attendance bonuses.  Following rejection of the proposals, the dispute was referred to the Labour Relations Commission.  A series of negotiations took place under the chairmanship of a senior industrial relations officer of the LRC and proposals which emanated from these discussions were put to the workers and rejected in a ballot last weekend.  Despite the rejection of the overall package, I understand that agreement was reached on a considerable number of the issues in dispute, as Deputy Martin said.  Regrettably, as a result of the rejection, management announced it would commence the phased closure of the plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was deeply concerned and disappointed to learn of these developments at the beginning of the week, as I still believe that the company can become viable because it produces a quality <Col N="659" /> product for which there is a considerable international demand.  The Labour Relations Commission has, I understand, become involved again in this dispute, with a view to assisting the parties to resolve their difficulties and to saving the plant.  I have just been informed that revised proposals are being put to a vote of SIPTU members tomorrow morning. That, apparently, was on the RTE news.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I earnestly hope, as I know the Deputy does and, indeed, pray that the outcome will result in the saving of this important Cork industry.  On the Deputy's recommendation that the Government and myself or both should become involved, I recently spoke with the regional representative of SIPTU and with the managing director of Liebert and I am keeping in close touch with the situation, as is my colleague the <Col N="660" /> Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton.</P>
      <P>It is difficult enough to attract international industrial investment to Ireland and Cork and, therefore, it behoves everybody &mdash; employer, employees, unions and the Government &mdash; to do everything possible to hold on to existing industrial jobs of this kind.  I earnestly hope and believe that will be the case at Liebert.  On the point made by the Deputy about the difficulty of getting employment creating industry into Cork, to my knowledge there is a high level of industrial inquiries coming through the IDA at present.  I cannot say for sure whether that will result in substantial announcements of industries for Cork in the coming weeks and months, but I am told by the IDA that it has a relatively high level of industrial inquiries for the Cork region.  I hope that will result in further job creation which, as the Deputy said, is necessary.</P>

      <P>I share the concern that the Deputy has expressed regarding the destruction of the marshlands of Southern Iraq.  Apart from the disastrous ecological consequences, the deliberate policy of drainage and Iraqi military operations in the area are further clear evidence of a continuing campaign of repression by the Government of Iraq against the Marsh Arab people.</P>
      <P>Iraq's policies towards the Marsh Arabs continue to violate Security Council Resolution 688 of 5 April 1991 which called for an end to the repression of the Iraqi civilian population. This same resolution also called on Iraq to co-operate with humanitarian organisations to ensure that the human and political rights of all Iraqi citizens are respected.</P>
      <P>The situation of the Marsh Arabs was addressed in the report on human rights in Iraq presented last February to the UN Commission on Human Rights by its special rapporteur, Mr. Max van der Stoel.  This report drew attention to the destruction of economic resources including arable land through deliberate draining of the marshlands, the accompanying destruction of the environment and the economic basis for the traditional lifestyle of the Marsh Arab people, and their consequent large-scale displacement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government supports the special rapporteur's call for an immediate end to, and reversal of, the draining of the marshlands by the Iraqi Government <Col N="395" /> and the cessation of military activities against the civilian population of the area.</P>
    <P>Ireland cosponsored the Resolution on the Human Rights Situation in Iraq adopted at the most recent session of the UN Commission on Human Rights in April last.  This Resolution, <i>inter alia,</i> urged the Government of Iraq to implement in particular the recommendations of the special rapporteur which refer to the Marsh Arabs.</P>
    <P>The Government will avail of every appropriate opportunity to urge that the recommendations of the special rapporteur on human rights in Iraq are kept at the forefront of the UN's consideration of the situation in that country.</P>

      <P>The answer to the question is No. I would like to place on record our debt of gratitude to the US Administration for the support and goodwill which they have afforded to us, at every stage in the path towards peace and beyond.  This has been expressed in a tangible way by US contributions to the International Fund for Ireland, totalling 250 million dollars to date.

      <P>The new context created by the ending of violence has transformed the potential for such co-operation.  The Government wish to see full advantage taken of the significant new opportunities which arise in this context for North-South trade and economic co-operation.</P>

      <P>The Anglo-Irish Conference over the past number of years has taken initiatives in the conference to promote co-operation in fields such as tourism, transport, energy, environment, health, agriculture, education, North-South trade, forestry and fisheries.

      <P>I assume that Deputy Michael Ahern's question relates to the Taoiseach's plans for bilateral meetings particularly in the context of Ireland's forthcoming Presidency.</P>
      <P>Preparation for Ireland's Presidency of the European Union from 1 July to 31 December 1996 has been under way for over a year now.  As part of the planning process and in preparation for Ireland's Presidency of the European Union, including the European Council to be held in Dublin in December 1996, the Taoiseach intends to maintain bilateral contacts, concentrating particularly on the Presidency, with Heads of Government of the European Union member states over the coming year. For example, the Taoiseach met Prime Minister González, the current Chair of the Council, in Madrid on 3 October. He is to meet with Prime Minister Junker of Luxembourg in Dublin next month.  Details of further meetings are being worked out at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to a series of bilateral meetings, the Taoiseach will have a number of opportunities to discuss issues on the European Union agenda <Col N="398" /> with the Heads of State or Government at the European Council in Madrid in December and at one or more European Councils during the Italian Presidency. Heads of State or Government will also meet in the context of the Europe-Asia Summit in Bangkok at the end of February &mdash; beginning of March 1996.  During these summits there will be the opportunity for the Taoiseach to meet bilterally with his European colleagues to discuss issues of relevance to Irish bilateral interests and to the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>For my own part, I will be holding meetings with colleagues over the coming months.  For instance, I visited Helsinki earlier this month for a meeting with my Finnish opposite number.  Planning is far advanced for bilateral meetings with the Italian Foreign Minister who will precede me in the Chair and with the Dutch Foreign Minister who will follow me.</P>
    <P>In addition, of course I will have the opportunity to meet my counterparts at every meeting of the General Affairs Council as well as at the European Councils scheduled between now and the start of our Presidency.  I have had two meetings this year with the President of the European Parliament and I will be meeting members of the Commission well in advance of our Presidency.</P>
    <P>As the Minister responsible for co-ordinating the Presidency, I am encouraging all Ministers with Presidency responsibilities to ensure that they hold bilateral meetings with their counterparts in member states, with relevant Commissioners and members of the European Parliament in the lead up to our Presidency.  It is our view that adequate preparation for the Presidency will enable us to ensure that the aims and objectives of our Presidency can be achieved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, and 65 together.  The Government continues to be concerned about the situation of republican prisoners in British jails.  Their health and welfare has been discussed on a continuous basis with the Home Office and the Prison Service in England and Wales. My Department has also kept in close contact with the families and legal representatives of a number of the prisoners in recent months.  Officials of our embassy in London have made consular visits to the prisoners, most recently in Whitemoor prison last week.</P>
      <P>The importance of addressing prisoner issues in a positive and forward looking manner has been underlined by the Government throughout the peace process.  It is regrettable that difficulties still surround the treatment of prisoners, particularly in view of the significant role played by the prisoners in securing the ceasefires.</P>
      <P>A number of Deputies are aware of the conditions faced by these prisoners at first hand.  Issues raised as a result of visits by Members of the Oireachtas to the prisons in Britain in recent weeks have been raised by the embassy in London with the British authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons comes into force in this jurisdiction on 1 November. Discussions are continuing between officials of the Department of Justice and the Home Office to ensure that, once in place, the convention operates as effectively as possible.  Given the importance of the prisons issue for the <Col N="400" /> peace process, the Government would hope that all those who wish to be transferred can be facilitated as soon as possible. We have made our views on this matter known to the British authorities at the highest levels in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>As regards the matter of parole, referred to in Deputy Raphael Burke's question, I am aware of the recent judgment in the case of five long-term prisoners, whose tariffs expired earlier this year.  I understand that these cases are scheduled to be considered in December by the parole board.  I hope it will do so, bearing in mind comments made by the judge in the High Court case.</P>
    <P>I wish to assure the Deputies that the issue of prisoners will continue to receive priority attention from the Government in view of the humanitarian concerns for the prisoners and their families, as well as the central importance of this issue for the peace process.</P>

      <P>Since 1992, the Government has responded to a number of requests from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to admit refugees from the former Yugoslavia to Ireland.  There are now 446 refugees from the former Yugoslavia settled here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 29 August 1995 the Government agreed, in response to an urgent appeal from the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, to admit another 250 refugees from the former Yugoslavia together with their close relatives. These are expected to arrive in a number of groups over the next six to nine months and will bring the total number <Col N="401" /> of former Yugoslav refugees here to about 700.</P>
    <P>Refugees admitted as a result of Government decisions are eligible for State services, including social welfare, health, and education services, on the same basis as Irish citizens.  In recognition of the fact that refugees can initially have particular problems in accessing these services, the Refugee Agency, a non-statutory body under the aegis of the Department of Foreign Affairs, is responsible for liaising between refugees and Government Departments, local authorities, and other bodies to facilitate the provision of services to which refugees are entitled.</P>
    <P>As well as looking after the reception of refugees and facilitating their access to State services, the Refugee Agency supports their integration into Irish society in a variety of ways.  Special English language classes are provided free of charge in conjunction with the Department of Education and vocational education committees.  Refugees are helped to obtain suitable accommodation and the agency helps refugees to obtain appropriate training with a view to improving their prospects on the employment market.</P>
    <P>The agency also attempts to develop community contact and support for refugees in local communities, and encourages and supports the development of social and cultural associations among the refugee communities.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Government is to encourage refugees to become progressively more independent and integrated within the general community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reflection group which is to assist in the preparation of next year's Intergovernmental Conference started its work in June.  Nine meetings of the group have taken place so far.  It has completed in initial round of discussions on the issues likely to arise at the Intergovernmental Conference, and has had a further round of discussions on the basis of a progress report prepared by the chairman of the reflection group, Mr. Carlos Westerdorp.  The group will continue to meet regularly over the coming weeks and will submit its final report to the <Col N="403" /> European Council in Madrid in December.</P>
      <P>The reflection group is not a negotiating forum.  Its role is to help in identifying the challenges to be addressed by the Intergovernmental Conference, to clarify the issues and where possible to set out possible options.  It will be the task of the Intergovernmental Conference itself to negotiate any Treaty amendments.</P>
      <P>As the Irish member of the reflection group, I have already given one detailed briefing to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and will be giving a further briefing to the Committee on 24 October.</P>
      <P>The work of the group is progressing very satisfactorily.  Discussions have centred on five main themes: the challenges facing the Union and the objectives of the Intergovernmental Conference; the institutional system; the Union and the citizen; the Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy; and the so-called instruments of the Union, a concept which includes, for example, subsidiarity and the possibility of incorporating new competences in the Treaty.</P>
      <P>There are differing views in the reflection group both on the scope of the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference and on the level of ambition for its outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the preliminary discussion taking place in the reflection group I have emphasised that in our view the Intergovernmental Conference should address three main challenges.  First, it must streamline the functioning of the Union's institutions with a view to further enlargement.  Second, it must help to bridge the gap which has in some respects opened up between the Union and its citizens by making its own workings more transparent and comprehensible and by demonstrating that the Union can help to address effectively the most direct concerns of the public including unemployment and the fight against international crime and drug trafficking.  Third, it must ensure that <Col N="404" /> the European Union can contribute in a way commensurate with its size and responsibilities to the preservation of international peace and security.  I am pleased that a broad measure of agreement is beginning to emerge on the need to give priority to these challenges.</P>
    <P>In addressing these challenges it is essential at the same time that the Union should broadly preserve the essential balances which have served the Union well and which are essential for its future success.  I have emphasised on the one hand the importance of preserving the balance between the institutions. For example, the Commission's role in the decision-making process and as the defender of the common interest the member states must be preserved.  On the other hand I have stressed that the essential balance between the member states within the different institutions must also be preserved.  For example, the right of every member state to nominate a full member of the Commission must be maintained.</P>
    <P>I do not underestimate the task which lies ahead for the Intergovernmental Conference.  It is clear that the list of issues likely to arise is extensive and that on many of these issues the range of views is considerable.  I have no doubt, however, the reflection group will play an important role in clarifying the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference and thereby in facilitating its work.</P>

      <P>The Washington Conference provided a uniquely prestigious showcase for the attractions of Ireland, North and South, as a location <Col N="405" /> for US investment and business partnerships in the new context created by peace.</P>
      <P>President Clinton's remarkable commitment of his own time and energy and that of his administration in support of US trade and investment for Ireland was unprecedented.  It transmitted also a powerful signal of support for the peace process in Ireland.</P>
      <P>Follow-up activity to the Washington Conference is ongoing in a number of areas.  The most immediate activity is a US Trade and Investment Mission which is visiting the Border counties and Northern Ireland this week.  The mission will feature some 15-18 US companies who will meet with Irish companies, State agencies, etc.  The primary focus of this mission is in the areas of food products, information technology and environmental protection services.</P>
      <P>The Deputy can be assured that, in particular, the Irish State agencies have pursued actively those business contacts which were made at the Washington Conference, in addition to other target companies in the US.  He will appreciate that such contacts with companies must of their nature remain confidential.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to making every effort to ensure the long-term success of President Clinton's initiative, especially towards attracting further US investment and support to assist in the process of economic regeneration of the Border counties.  I would hope that the forthcoming visit of President Clinton to both parts of Ireland will give further impetus towards this objective.</P>

      <P>The customs union <Col N="406" /> between the European Community and Turkey is due to enter into force on 1 January 1996 subject to the assent of the European Parliament being forthcoming before that date.</P>
      <P>The Government supports the conclusion of the customs union which is a key element in the European Union's strategy to support the democratisation process and promote improvements in the human rights situation in Turkey. The customs union is intended to enhance the framework for economic development in Turkey, and thereby help to foster a more favourable climate for acceleration of the internal reform process.  By developing Turkey's links with Europe, Turkey's European orientation should be strengthened and the European Union's capacity to exercise a positive influence on developments in that country enhanced.  The closer relations with the European Union which the customs union will bring should reinforce the position of those elements in Turkey which are striving for the application of European standards in relation to human rights.  The customs union will be accompanied by improved mechanisms for political dialogue, which will facilitate the EU's efforts to pursue its concerns on these issues with the Turkish authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government remains very concerned, nevertheless, about continued reports of human rights violations in Turkey.  In common with our partners in the European Union, we have made it clear that observance of a state of law and of fundamental liberties underlie the development of our relations with Turkey.  While recognising the difficulties posed by a sustained campaign of violence, we have insisted that the fight against terrorism must be conducted within the law and with full respect for human rights.  The Government believes, moreover, that the situation in south-east Turkey should not be approached purely as a security problem and has called for a political settlement which, while respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the <Col N="407" /> Turkish state, would allow for appropriate expression of the Kurdish cultural identity.</P>
    <P>I hope that the present constitutional review initiative in Turkey will contribute substantially to the process of reform.  The initial package of constitutional amendments adopted last July is a step in the right direction.  More needs to be done, however, particularly in relation to freedom of expression and protection of civil liberties.  The outgoing Turkish Government indicated that it would seek the Turkish Parliament's approval of further reforms in these areas.  I hope that its successor will pursue the same approach and that necessary reforms will be adopted and implemented at an early date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should of course say that the fight against crime, and particularly the need for joint action against the drugs menace, has been recognised as an issue requiring greater co-operation at EU level.  For example, at the reflection group which is preparing for next year's Intergovernmental Conference, there is widespread agreement that the existing provisions on Justice and Home Affairs in the Treaty need to be reviewed.  With this in mind, an Interdepartmental <Col N="408" /> Committee chaired by the Department of Justice is considering Ireland's approach at the Intergovernmental Conference to the issue of drugs and crime.</P>

      <P>This matter has already been dealt with in response to an Adjournment motion tabled by the same Deputy yesterday evening.</P>
      <P>The Government has been consistently engaged on both the political and the humanitarian fronts to help bring about recovery in Rwanda.  We have worked bilaterally with the Rwandan authorities, and through the EU and the UN to help create and implement policies which have the overall aim of restoring normality in that country.  As the Deputy is aware, President Robinson has visited Rwanda on two occasions, most recently from 9-13 October when she was accompanied by my colleague Deputy Joan Burton, Minister of State with responsibility for development cooperation.  That visit reflects the priority which we all believe should be afforded by the international community in resolving the tragic problems of Rwanda and the Great Lakes Region.</P>
      <P>Within the context of our EU membership and our forthcoming Presidency responsibilities, it is the Government's intention to make action on Rwanda and the Great Lakes Region a continuing priority, and thus to do our utmost to help bring about national reconciliation there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is aware that while there has been some improvement in <Col N="409" /> the situation in Rwanda over the past year, it remains very fragile and much progress needs to be made to avert another disaster.  Ireland will continue to pursue the following broad policy objectives in co-operation with the EU and the UN, as well as with the Rwandan authorities.</P>
    <P>&mdash;overall, to encourage a concerted international approach to help bring about national reconciliation, reconstruction and rehabilitation in Rwanda.</P>
    <P>&mdash;to encourage discussion and co-operation between the Governments and countries of the region to determine and implement concerted action on the underlying problems of the region.  This process may culminate in the holding of an international conference on the Great Lakes Region.</P>
    <P>&mdash;to encourage the return of the refugees and the provision of adequate conditions for them to return safely and with dignity.</P>
    <P>&mdash;to encourage the International Tribunal to start trying those responsible for genocide at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>&mdash;to provide financial and other forms of assistance to help remedy humanitarian problems. </P>
    <P>The Government has long been a proponent of concerted international action in response to the problems of the Great Lakes Region and is acutely aware of the fact that previous initiatives, such as the plan of action adopted by the International Conference on Refugees which was held in Bujumbura last February, have failed to be implemented.  The International Tribunal, whose work is an essential part of the reconciliation process in Rwanda, has also been slow in its implementation. The lack of adequate resources, particularly in the case of the Rwandan authorities also needs to be addressed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="410" /> The Government places great emphasis on the importance of the implementation of policies by the international community and of the provision of adequate assistance to enable the Rwandan authorities carry out measures necessary for the restoration of order.  The Government considers that the restoration of the judicial system in Rwanda is essential to the process of recovery and in this context we welcome the recent election of the Supreme Court of Rwanda.  The restoration of the rule of law is one of the essential elements in creating favourable conditions for the return of refugees. The international community is already seized of the need to restore the judiciary and the administration of justice and to improve the appalling conditions in Rwanda's prisons.  The Government has provided assistance to the human rights and justice sectors in Rwanda and I have previously provided details of this in written replies to questions tabled by Deputies Shatter and Kitt on 20 September.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 27, 32, 34, 50, 58 and 62 together.  All of the questions relate to the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference (IGC).</P>
      <P>The Government has begun the process of preparing its approach to next year's Intergovernmental Conference. As the Deputy will be aware and as has again been underlined in a reply to a separate parliamentary question today, the negotiation of Treaty changes will fall to the Intergovernmental Conference itself which is due to open during the Italian Presidency in the first half of next year.  The reflection group is undertaking a preliminary exercise of clarifying issues likely to arise at the Intergovernmental Conference and identifying possible approaches to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Member states are not at this stage setting out their detailed negotiating approach to the Intergovernmental Conference nor are they submitting detailed Treaty amendments for consideration. The Government attaches <Col N="412" /> great importance, however, to promoting from the outset parliamentary and public debate about the issues likely to arise.  The White Paper on Irish Foreign Policy which is to be published shortly will set out the Government's approach at this stage to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference.  Minister of State Deputy Gay Mitchell, who is my personal representative on the reflection group, has already set out some of our general objectives which have been raised in the group.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that the further enlargement of the Union should have any implications for the right of every member state to nominate a member of the European Commission, although I am of course aware that not all member states share this view.  To deprive member states of the right to nominate a Commissioner, far from making it more efficient, would in our view make it less efficient in its essential role of protecting the common interest and in retaining public support for its central role in the process of European intergration. We consider that it would, however, be appropriate for the large member states to agree in the context of further enlargement to nominate only one member of the Commission.</P>
    <P>It is not clear whether the linguistic regime of the European Union will fall for consideration at next year's Intergovernmental Conference.  The question of languages is, of course, a particularly sensitive one and the unanimity requirement at the Intergovernmental Conference may preclude any significant changes.  Moreover, the detailed arrangements for the language regime are not set out in the Treaty itself but rather principally in a Council regulation.  A change in the language arrangements would not, therefore, require Treaty change at an Intergovernmental Conference.  If the language regime is discussed at the Intergovernmental Conference and a suitable opportunity arises to enhance the status of Irish in that context the Government would intend to bring forward a suitable proposal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="413" /> The Government is, of course, in any event committed to practical improvements in the use of Irish in the European Union which do not require Treaty change.  I consider that there are a number of such practical improvements which could be made, including the translation into Irish of a larger number of documents than at present.  I am in contact with my colleague the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht about the possibility of such practical improvements.</P>
    <P>I would add that the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, has recalled at the reflection group the importance of the Irish language to the Government and citizens of this country and has indicated that its status may be raised in the event of a wider discussion of the language regime at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
    <P>The powers of the European Parliament will be a key agenda item at the Intergovernmental Conference.  The Government will support an appropriate strengthening of the role of the Parliament provided the broad interinstitutional balance and in particular the role of the Commission are fully preserved. The Government would be happy to see, for example, an extension of the co-decision procedure to some additional areas of European Community business.</P>
    <P>The question of whether the European Union or European Community should accede to the European Convention of Human Rights may arise at the Intergovernmental Conference and is likely to be identified as an option by the Intergovernmental Conference reflection group.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers has already requested the opinion of the Court of Justice on whether accession by the Community to the European Convention is compatible with the existing EC Treaty.  This request is without prejudice to the position of member states on the substantive issue which would have to be decided unanimously.  The court's opinion is awaited.</P>
    <P>The implications of accession whether <Col N="414" /> by means of Treaty change or under the existing Treaty have not yet been fully teased out at the level of the European Community, the Council of Europe or member state level.  The issues are complex ones and, before the Government adopts a definitive view on the matter, these need to be studied further.  The Government, of course, attaches the greatest importance to the protection of human rights.</P>
    <P>The Government is very concerned to do whatever possible to address the concerns of the disabled.  The issue of whether to include in the Treaties an appropriate provision in this regard such as a non-discrimination clause has been raised at the reflection group including by the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  The issue has arisen in the context of a wider discussion on rights and non-discrimination more generally.  The role of the reflection group, as I have said, is not to negotiate Treaty changes but rather to identify possible options for consideration by the Intergovernmental Conference. I have no doubt that one of the options which will be clearly signalled will be the possibility of provisions to prevent discrimination on the grounds of disability.  The full implications of the various options set out in the reflection group's report will be considered in due course by the member states individually and collectively at European level. As far as the Irish approach is concerned the issues arising are at present being studied at interdepartmental level.</P>

      <P>The Government's reply to the Commission's letter on infringement procedures in this matter was, in the usual way, prepared by the responsible Department, in this case the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  It was communicated directly to the Permanent Representation in Brussels by the Department for transmission to the Commission.  The reply issued to the Commission on 5 March 1991.</P>
      <P>The question of whether the company concerned was an agent was not a matter within the direct competance of my Department, nor is it a matter within its direct competence now.  It is, therefore, a matter which should be pursued with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 38 together.  The <Col N="416" /> US embargo on all political, economic and commercial relations between the United States and Cuba has been in place since 1962.  As Deputies are aware, I am very conscious of the difficulties which the embargo causes for the people of Cuba.  It has been my hope that the changes in international relations in recent years, which have created the conditions for the resolution of many regional cold-war issues, would lead to improved relations between the US and Cuba.</P>
      <P>It is Ireland's policy and that of our partners in the European Union to support a peaceful transition to democracy and respect for human rights in Cuba. To this end the European Union has decided to begin exploratory discussions with Cuba in order to determine the appropriate framework and level for future relations between the EU and Cuba.  I believe that maintaining political dialogue and encouraging economic relations are the means best suited to promoting evolution towards democracy and Cuba's reinstatement in the international community.</P>
      <P>Along with partners in the European Union, the Government has expressed its concerns about the approval on 21 September by the US House of Representatives of the Helms-Burton Bill which proposes further measures to be added to the embargo, which would have extra-territorial application and which would be in conflict with the rules of international organisations including those of the WTO.</P>
      <P>I am reviewing very carefully the position that Ireland should adopt on the Cuban resolution at this year's General Assembly in light of the overall situation, and in particular of developments over the past year, including the cross-party support expressed by the Joint Foreign Affairs Committee for a vote in favour of the resolution.</P>

      <P>In recognition of the economic difficulties which have faced Cuba following the collapse of its major trading partner, the former USSR, Ireland and its partners in the European Union have supplied substantial humanitarian aid to the people of Cuba in recent years.  In 1993, in response to concerns expressed by the European Parliament, a total of 5 mecu was provided in humanitarian aid to the Cuban people.  This figure rose to 14 mecu in 1994.  Together with partners in the EU Ireland decided that given the socio-economic situation in which Cuba finds itself this aid should continue to be provided in 1995, at least, at the same level as in 1994.  The EU also supports developmental projects in Cuba organised by non-Governmental agencies. Some 2.5 mecu was supplied for this purpose in 1994.</P>
      <P>I took the opportunity of my recent visit to the UN General Assembly to meet my Cuban counterpart and to have a wide-ranging review of the relatons between our two countries.  The question of additional assistance to Cuba was not raised by him.  He informed me that following several years of economic crisis the Cuban economy was now beginning to show some growth.</P>
      <P>I understand that the question of further aid to Cuba was not raised during the recent visit to Ireland by a Cuban Parliamentary delegation.</P>

      <P>The Government raised the events which occurred on the Lower Ormeau Road on both 12 July 1995 and 12 August 1995 with the British Government through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  We restated our guiding principle that parades should not take place in an area, or along a route, where they are not welcome.

      <P>The manner of the policing of parades is one that is raised on an ongoing basis with the British authorities through the framework of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference.  At yesterday's meeting of the conference, we conducted an extensive review of the marching season and I again raised my concern about the handling of certain parades.  I shall keep this matter under constant review in the context of our ongoing contacts with the British Government in the framework of the Anglo-Irish Agreement.</P>

      <P>Successive Irish Governments have sought to secure increased and improved reception of RTE television in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>There is a strong demand for greater and better quality access to RTE television in Northern Ireland.  This demand is not confined exclusively to the Nationalist community.  I believe that easy and reciprocal access to each other's television stations is bound to be a helpful factor in promoting mutual awareness and understanding on the island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subject has been under regular review in the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference over the last three years.  A bilateral group of officials was established under the Conference to examine the issue of RTE television broadcasting in the North.  The group reported that the most significant improvement in the short-term could be achieved by increasing the power of Clermont Carn, the RTE transmitter in County Louth.  The UK authorities feared that an increase in power from Clarmont Carn would adversely affect the reception of local Northern Ireland services and reserved their position.  The British Government have accepted the desirability of improving RTE reception in Northern Ireland.  In this context, I welcome the publication of a letter by the British Ambassador to <i>The Irish Times</i> in August this year which stated <Col N="421" /> that &ldquo;The British Government fully supports RTE's desire to enhance its service to Northern Ireland&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>An Irish position paper which was drawn up with the assistance of RTE and officials from the Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, was handed over to the British authorities in September this year.  This paper will be the subject of discussions between Irish and British technical experts which are scheduled to take place shortly.  The technical experts on the Irish side are confident that solutions can be found and agreed between the relevant authorities to minimise or indeed eliminate any problems which might arise from an increased output from Clermont Carn.</P>

      <P>The Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations this year is an appropriate opportunity for the international community to reflect on the UN's record of achievement to date, and also on how we, as member states, can best assist the organisation in developing and adapting to meet the new and daunting challenges of our time.  Ireland's long commitment to the work of the UN and our participation in peacekeeping over nearly forty years give us a particular interest in ensuring that the organisation consolidates its many successes and is placed on a firm foundation for the future.  In light of the discussion in the current session, the Fifty-first Session of the UN General Assembly, which will take place during Ireland's EU Presidency next year, will allow Ireland and its European Union partners the opportunity to continue to encourage early and comprehensive agreement on a future programme of renewal for the organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The efforts of the UN in promoting international peace and security are to <Col N="424" /> a great extent dependent on the effectiveness of the Security Council, and an important current issue is the question of Security Council reform.  Ireland plays a significant role in the General Assembly Working Group on the reform of the Council, and we are also co-ordinating closely on the issue with a number of like-minded smaller member states.  In my address to the Fiftieth Session of the General Assembly on 27 September last I argued that the Council &ldquo;needs to be enlarged in order to increase its effectiveness and its ability to act, both clearly and unambiguously, as the expression of the common will of Member States.&rdquo;  Ireland supports a balanced enlargement of the Council which would include a modest expansion in its membership.  Such an enlargement should improve the Council's representative character, transparency and effectiveness. Within this same framework, we are also working to ensure a greater degree of representation for developing countries, and to retain the opportunity for smaller member states to serve on the Council from time to time.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest challenges facing the United Nations has been the marked increase in intra-State conflict and ethnic tensions in recent years and the increased demands which this has placed on the organisation.  At the same time great progress has been made in some formerly intractable conflicts around the world, including Cambodia, Angola, Namibia and E1 Salvador.  This has led in turn to an enormous increase in UN peacekeeping and related activity since the late 1980s.  Because of this, the demands on UN resources have increased dramatically.  It was against this background that, when I addressed the UN General Assembly last month, I emphasised that the management and conduct of peacekeeping operations must be improved, and I stessed the need for clear mandates and clear lines of command and control.  The Secretary-General had addressed these issues very eloquently in the &ldquo;Agenda for Peace&rdquo; and its recent Supplement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="425" /> The UN's activity in the peacekeeping field is complemented by its crucial role in promoting peace through development.  Ireland will continue to support the early elaboration of an action-oriented Agenda for Development which could guide the international community's efforts in this area into the next century.  Lack of development is one of the root causes of conflict. Similarly, the Government places a high priority on the UN sustaining its role in the protection of fundamental human rights and freedoms and in furthering international co-operation in disarmament and arms control.</P>
    <P>All of the UN's work, however, is seriously jeopardised by the financial crisis which threatens to bring the UN system to a halt.  The repeated failure of many member states to pay their assessed contributions in full and on time is undoubtedly the primary cause of this.  I stressed in my address to the General Assembly last month that &ldquo;if all member states were to declare here their intentions to pay assessed contributions in full, on time and without conditions, both for peacekeeping and the regular budget, this single commitment would do more than any other to strengthen the UN's capacity to act effectively.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The extent of the crisis is illustrated by the fact that as of 30 September, the UN was owed approximately US$3.3 billion in outstanding contributions by member states, $0.8 billion of this total in respect of the regular budget and $2.5 billion for peacekeeping.  The five largest debtors were as follows:</P>

    <P>The arrears are due to a general shortfall in the relevant UN accounts caused by the chronic failure of many member states to pay their dues, and, in particular, their peacekeeping assessments.  I raised the question of arrears in my meeting with the UN Secretary-General in New York on 27 September, and my Department is pursuing this issue vigorously with the UN.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 49, 63 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of the tragic conflict in former Yugoslavia, it has been clear that a durable peace will come to the region only as a result of a negotiated political settlement.  The efforts of the Government, in common with those of our European Union partners, have been consistently directed towards the achievement of a peaceful outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conflict in former Yugoslavia has engaged the energies of all the organisations involved in European and global security &mdash; the OSCE, the European Union, the Western European Union, NATO and, above all, the United Nations.  The UN Security Council in particular has the primary responsibility for maintenance of international peace and security.  In our view, any action involving peace-enforcement would <Col N="428" /> require authorisation by the Security Council in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The United Nations Protection Force &mdash; UNPROFOR &mdash; has performed an invaluable role on the basis of the difficult mandate conferred on it by the Security Council.  The actions taken by NATO in recent weeks were also on behalf of the United Nations in support of its mission, and had as their goal the ending of civilian suffering in the designated safe areas.  However, it is important to state that all the organisations to which I have referred are of the opinion that peace will come only as a result of a negotiated political settlement involving all the parties.  I fully share this view.</P>
    <P>The UN Secretary-General has strongly advocated that the most credible option for international support for implementation of a peace settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina would be for the Security Council to authorise an <i>ad hoc</i> coalition of member states to discharge the task.  Furthermore, the Secretary-General has expressed concern regarding the United Nations' limited capacity to manage large-scale operations, and the difficulties of entrusting to a United Nations peacekeeping force a mandate which would require it to take enforcement action against parties whose co-operation is required for peacekeeping functions.</P>
    <P>In this context, preparations are proceeding as a matter of urgency within NATO on the establishment of a force which will implement a peace settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  NATO is widely regarded, including by our European Union partners, as the only regional organisation which has the capabilities to implement the military aspects of such a settlement.  The force is likely to include personnel from the United States and a number of European Union member states.  Urgent negotiations are also under way on how non-NATO countries, in particular Russia, can be engaged in implementation. It is envisaged that the implementing force will be authorised by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="429" /> Against this background, the size of UNPROFOR is being reduced, taking account also of the improvement in the situation on the ground in many parts of Bosnia-Herzegovina.  Over the past three years, the United Nations peace-keeping forces have made an essential contribution to facilitating the conditions for a peaceful settlement and to ensuring the delivery of humanitarian assistance to the victims of the conflict. While an <i>ad hoc</i> coalition will be necessary to implement a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, I agree with the Secretary General that the United Nations can continue to play a useful peacekeeping role in the future in Croatia and in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</P>
    <P>The Government welcomes the progress made in the peace process in former Yugoslavia over recent weeks.  Last month's agreements in Geneva and New York on basic principles for a peaceful settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina I hope will come to be seen as an important milestone in the search for peace.  These principles include confirmation of the continued legal existence of Bosnia-Herzegovina within its internationally recognised boundaries.</P>
    <P>Detailed talks begin in the United States on 31 October.  If these are successful, a peace conference will be held in Paris.  A separate conference in London, to deal with specific aspects of implementation of a peace settlement, is also envisaged.  Many difficult issues, including the allocation of territory between the Bosnian Federation and the Serb entity within Bosnia-Herzegovina and further aspects of the constitutional arrangements, remain to be resolved.</P>
    <P>The European Union and its member states will continue their efforts to promote peace in former Yugoslavia, respect for human rights in the region and to provide humanitarian aid.  The work of the European Community Monitor Mission and the Union's administration of Mostar are practical demonstrations of our commitment in this regard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="430" /> In the event of a settlement in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the European Union is determined to play its part fully in the provision of humanitarian assistance, in the massive reconstruction effort which is required, in assisting in establishing conditions on the ground for the return of displaced persons and refugees and in preparations for the holding of democratic elections.</P>
    <P>The ceasefire, which came into effect throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina on 12 October, is of vital importance for the peace process.  However, I am deeply concerned by reports of fighting between Bosnian Government and Bosnian Serb forces in the north-west of the country in violation of the ceasefire. The European Union has urged the parties to show utmost restraint at this crucial stage.</P>
    <P>With genuine commitment from the parties, and with assistance from the international community including the European Union, the United States and Russia, there is now a chance that the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, and of the region generally, will finally be able to enjoy lasting peace and security.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue its active engagement in the search for a lasting peace in former Yugoslavia so that the process of reconstruction and reconciliation can begin in this war-ravaged region.</P>
    <P>The question of peace enforcement in Europe outside former Yugoslavia does not arise at present.  The 1996 Intergovernmental Conference Review of the CFSP provisions of the Maastricht Treaty will provide the Union with an opportunity to examine how best it can respond to international crises, whether in Europe or elsewhere.</P>

      <P>The Government is deeply concerned about the continued deterioration in the political and human rights situation in Kenya which includes the detention of opposition figures as well as restrictions on the activities of political parties, NGOs and the freedom of the press.</P>
      <P>Together with our partners in the EU in the past we have made a number of representations to the Kenyan authorities, voicing our concern at the human rights situation in the country.  In August 1994 the Government supported a démarche by the European Union to the Kenyan Attorney General voicing its concerns about the trial of human rights activist Koigi wa Wamwere.  The EU also made a démarche to the Kenyan Minister for Foreign Affairs on 7 February last in response to the manner in which his Government was addressing ethnic tensions at local level which had included the forced relocation of ethnic groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the 51st session of the UN Human Rights Commission in Geneva in February Ireland and the member states of the EU called on the Kenyan Government to take measures to alleviate ethnic tensions in consultation with the <Col N="432" /> UNDP and all concerned parties.  In August of this year we joined our EU partners in issuing a declaration which denounced the intimidation of opposition leaders as well as journalists in an incident in Nakuru on 10 August.  We highlighted the incident as yet another serious disturbance of the political climate and emphasised that this did not serve the interests of the Kenyan people.  An EU troika démarche was made to the Kenyan authorities in support of the declaration on 22 August.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to do everything possible, in co-operation with our EU partners, to increase pressure on the Kenyan authorities to implement the democratic process and to bring about the full recognition of human rights.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that 90 per cent of formerly closed Border roads have now been reopened. Work is now concentrating on the remaining bridge crossings, including that at Aghalane, County Cavan, where an extensive road improvement scheme is planned, in addition to the provision of a new bridge.  The entire Aghalane project is not expected to be completed until 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is aware, this project has required a considerable amount of land purchase and other planning <Col N="433" /> measures.  Nevertheless I understand that planning and design work is now well in hand.  There is close and on-going contact between the roads service of the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland and the National Roads Authority, which is responsible for the road improvement scheme at Aghlane, as this is a national route.  The quality of co-operation and commitment shown by both sides augurs well for the future.</P>
    <P>The overall plan for Aghalane amounts to a major project with considerable economic and social potential for the area on both sides of the Border. I can assure the Deputy that, together with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, I will continue to monitor progress and make sure this important scheme is completed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>On 11 May 1995, the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review and Extension Conference, which brought together 175 States Parties including Ireland, agreed: that the Treaty, which was ratified by Ireland in 1968 and entered into force in 1970, shall continue in force indefinitely; that the process of review and implementation of the Treaty shall be strengthened; and a set of principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of principles and objectives, the conference agreed a programme of action which included the completion no later than 1996 of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.  It was also agreed that, pending the entry into force <Col N="434" /> of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the utmost restraint should be exercised by the nuclear weapon states.  France and China were among the States Parties who subscribed to this decision and the commitments to which it gives rise.</P>
    <P>The Government received no advance notification, prior to the conclusion of the NPT Review Conference, from either the Chinese or French Governments of their intentions to carry out further nuclear tests.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the European Council meeting held in Essen &mdash; December 1994 &mdash; requested the Commission to submit as quickly as possible its detailed analysis of the effects of enlargement in the context of the Union's current policies and their future development.  In addition it called on the Commission to submit, in 1995, a study of means of developing relations between the EU and the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe &mdash; CEECs &mdash; in the agriculture sector with a view to their future accession.  The results of these indepth studies are awaited.  It is expected that the report on EU-CEEC relations in the agriculture sector will be available before the end of the year.  Last July, the Commission published detailed reports on the agriculture sector in each of the associated countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy implications of future enlargement of course will be addressed in the forthcoming Government White Paper on Foreign Policy in the context <Col N="435" /> of our preparations for the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.

    <P>Given the importance to Ireland of the issues raised by future enlargement, I arranged some time ago to put in place an Inter-departmental Committee, chaired by my Department, which is mandated, <i>inter alia,</i> to continuously monitor the position in regard to EU relations with the CEECs and to analyse relevant positions and papers advanced by the EU institutions and other bodies from the standpoint of their implications for Ireland.</P>

    <P>Note: The expenditure in relation to all visits since June 1995 identified in the table is estimated. These estimated costs are based on previous similar trips abroad made by the Taoiseach and the Ministers of State at his Department.  The actual full cost of each trip from June 1995 is unknown at this time because the Department of Foreign Affairs has yet to invoice the Department of the Taoiseach for them.</P>

      <P>Details of the trips undertaken by me in the period 31 January 1992 to 11 October 1994 have already been made available to the House in replies given on 7 October 1993 &mdash; Questions Nos. 16 and 32; 29 March 1994 &mdash; Question No. 86; and 11 October 1994 &mdash; Question No. 117.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every effort continues to be made to keep the cost of visits to a minimum <Col N="444" /> consistent with the appropriate discharge of my responsibilities as Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the responsibilities assigned to the two Ministers of State.  Since my appointment I have been conscious of the need to keep expenditure on Ministerial travel to a minimum.  On my appointment I arranged for the allocation to my office for this purpose to be reduced by approximately 12 per cent on that of my predecessor.  This reduction was maintained in 1994 and again this year. Indeed I am happy to advise the House that the outturn for last year showed a saving of over 21 per cent on the allocation to my office under this heading.</P>
    <P>Since 11 October 1994 I have fulfilled 13 European Union ministerial commitments, one EU Council commitment, eight Anglo-Irish commitments, two UN commitments, and one Western European Union commitment.  I have also undertaken official visits to the European Parliament, the Middle East and Finland.  Details of these trips and those undertaken by the two Ministers of State at my Department since their appointment in January 1995 are given in the tables below.  In so far as the most recent trips are concerned, actual costs arising have not yet been brought fully to account and I will supply up to date figures to the Deputy as soon as they are available.  I am confident that we will come in under budget again this year.</P>

      <P>A breakdown according to the categories of prisoners referred to in the Deputy's question is not officially available from British sources.  However, the data available to my Department from a number of sources indicates that there are 27 republican prisoners currently held in British prisons.</P>
      <P>According to information received by the Embassy in London, there are no loyalist prisoners currently in England and Wales.  There are however some loyalist prisoners in Scotland, including some who are on remand.  Figures for this category are not readily available.  I will communicate with the Deputy as soon as I receive further information on this.</P>
      <P>Fourteen republican prisoners have been transferred to Northern Ireland since 1 September 1994.  Of these, five have been temporary transfers and nine permanent.  According to information available to my Department, there have been no transfers of loyalist prisoners to Northern Ireland since the ceasefire.</P>

      <P>The military posts which have been totally dismantled to date are the Kilturk Patrol Base in February 1995, the Clady permanent <Col N="448" /> vehicle checkpoint in June 1995 and the North Howard Street Mill Army Base in Belfast which was demolished earlier this month.</P>
      <P>On 2 October it was announced that three permanent vehicle checkpoints on the border at Derry and Strabane are to be dismantled following the ending of vehicle checking at these patrol bases earlier in the year.</P>
      <P>During the meeting of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference yesterday, I stressed the Government's view that the new security situation calls for a fundamental review of the way military posts operate and indeed of the need for them at all.  I will continue to press for these posts and the activity associated with them to be wound down in line with reductions in the security threat they were intended to deal with.</P>

      <P>The special EU Peace Programme provides for a new five-year Community Initiative for Northern Ireland and the southern Border counties.  Funding of 300 MECU, of IR£240 million approximately is allocated for the first three years of the initiative.</P>
      <P>Northern Ireland and the Border counties will receive respectively, a maximum of 80 per cent and a minimum of 20 per cent of the total funding.  For the six Border counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo this will amount to EU funding of £48 million approximately.</P>
      <P>The arrangements and procedures for the disbursement of financial assistance under the special support programme for Peace and Reconciliation are set out in the Decision adopted by the Commission on 26 July of this year.</P>
      <P>These arrangements were the subject of agreement between the Commission and the Irish and British Governments, based on a Joint Operational Programme.</P>
      <P>The two Governments and the Commission were agreed that there should be the maximum degree of local input into the decision-making process.  The EU Peace Programme is an imaginative response to the needs of Northern Ireland and the Border counties.  The means of delivery of the programme should be those which are most appropriate to the actions envisaged and the local circumstances in the eligible areas. This view received strong endorsement at the various consultative conferences and submissions from the voluntary and community sector.</P>
      <P>The special nature of this programme demanded that new funding mechanisms should be devised to ensure the fullest local involvement.  Where appropriate and to the fullest extent practicable, delivery of the measures under the programme will be implemented through the use of intermediary bodies, in addition to central and local government and State agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding will be provided by means of <Col N="450" /> global grant contracts signed between the Commission and the intermediary bodies with the approval of both Governments.  The intermediary bodies will also assist in the overall co-ordination of the programme.</P>
    <P>For the Border counties, more than half of the programme will be delivered by intermediary bodies.  For the appropriate parts of the Employment, Urban and Rural Regeneration, Social Inclusion and Productive Investment sub-programmes, the intermediary bodies are Area Development Management Limited (ADM) and the Combat Poverty Agency.  Co-operation North and IBEC/CBI (NI) will manage part of the Cross-Border Development subprogramme.</P>

To date the information requested has not been furnished. On 6 October 1995 the taxpayer contacted the inspector of taxes and was advised that a reply from her agent was necessary before all years could be finalised.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that 85 taxpayers, including companies, were randomly selected for comprehensive audit in 1994.  Of these, 67 have been finalised to date.  Liability to tax has arisen in 26 of these cases producing £116,426.  The average yield in the 67 randomly selected audits completed to date is £1,738.</P>

    <P>Audits selected at random are a very <Col N="454" /> small dimension of the audit programme. In all, 4,114 audits yielding £39.89 million were conducted in 1994. The vast majority of audits are riskbased targeted selections.  The average yield from targeted audits in 1994 was £9,696.</P>

Diabetics requiring out-patient services attend one of the two medical clinics held weekly in the hospital.  The establishment of a specialist diabetic clinic at Tralee General Hospital would involve the attendance of a consultant diabetologist and the additional services of a dietician, ophthalmologist and chiropodist.</P>
      <P>The provision of consultant diabetic services at Tralee General Hospital will be reviewed by the board following the appointment of a consultant endocrinologist with a special interest in diabetes mellitus to Cork University Hospital. This consultant appointment, which the Department approved on 6 January 1994, is being finalised at present, and will allow the board to expand the number of specialist diabetic clinics which it provides at present.</P>

      <P>The total number of foreign trips I have undertaken since the Government took office is three. The total cost of the three trips was <Col N="464" /> approximately £51,900, of which approximately £3,000 was refunded by the Council of Europe.  The amount relating to expenses incurred by me was approximately £14,000 and the balance of approximately £37,900 related to expenses incurred by my officials.  The purpose of the trips was (1) to attend a Council of Europe Steering Committee meeting on Equality between Men and Women, on which I was accompanied by two of my officials; (2) to attend a range of official functions in Toronto, on which I was accompanied by my spouse; and (3) to attend the UN Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, on which I was accompanied by six of my officials and the chief executive of the Employment Equality Agency. There is no Minister of State at my Department.</P>

      <P>Section 8 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1992, enables third parties to make submissions or observations in relation to an appeal to An Bord Pleanála within one month of the receipt of the appeal by the board.  When a planning authority has made a decision in relation to a planning application, it is required to notify the decision to the applicant and to any person or body who has made submissions or observations to them. Article 62 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Regulations, 1994, requires An Bord Pleanála to prepare a weekly list of new appeals received, and of appeals determined, dismissed or withdrawn, no later than the third working day following a particular week.  This list is displayed in the office of the board for a minimum period of one month and upon request a copy will be sent to any person or body.</P>

      <P>According to figures released by the Central Statistics Office, an estimated 1,733,000 overseas visits were made to Ireland in the period January to June 1995.  This compares to 1,501,000 in the corresponding period in 1994 and represents an increase of over 15 per cent.  The performance to date, therefore, is ahead of the Bord Fáilte overall target of 9 per cent growth in 1995.</P>
      <P>This excellent performance indicates that 1995 will be one of the best years ever for Irish tourism with anticipated increased numbers and revenue from a number of our main markets.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Fair trade bananas&rdquo; is the title given to bananas which have been produced with proper regard to the environment and acceptable ecological practices.</P>
      <P>I have received proposals from the Irish Fair Trade Network concerning a specific allocation for fair-traded bananas.  While I have no objection to the allocation of a percentage of the EU banana quota to fair-traded bananas, the position is that there is no clear evidence that there is a substantial market for this product which would trade at a considerably enhanced price.  I also understand that there is no network in place at present which would enable the production of such bananas to be controlled and monitored.</P>

      <P>Under the National Development Plan covering the period 1994 to 1999, total investment in the mainline rail network will amount to approximately £275 million. This investment will be focused on track renewal, £123 million, modern signalling systems, £27 million and rolling stock £125 million, in accordance with the overall policy framework set out in the Operational Programme for Transport. All major lines on the inter-urban mainline railway network, including the Dublin-Sligo line, are included in the proposed investment programme.  It is too early to give the precise details of individual investments on particular lines. This will depend on the outcome of detailed consultations which are expected to take place with the EU Commission in the months ahead.</P>
