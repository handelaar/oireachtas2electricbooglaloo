      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Leaking of confidential information containing proposals not yet considered by Cabinet is undesirable because it pre-empts the constitutional function of the Cabinet and interferes with the free exchange of views in advance of decision-taking. <Col N="902" /> This exchange is essential to the working of an effective system of public administration.  The leaking of confidential information can be especially unfair and contrary to the public interest if the information is commercially advantageous or sensitive.  It also involves, in most cases, a breach of the law.</P>
      <P>The Government secretariat, at my request, initiated separate investigations into a number of recent incidents of premature disclosure of matters which were under consideration by the Government.</P>
      <P>The investigations to date have not revealed any further sources of leaks other than the matter already referred to in my reply to a question here on 14 February 1995.</P>
      <P>While I am generally satisfied with the arrangements for the handling and circulation of Government papers, procedures in this regard are being kept under continuous review.  The Minister for Finance is, at my request, initiating Civil Service wide procedures, whereby departmental secretaries will be charged with responsibility to initiate, as a matter of course, investigations into any leaks that occur in their area.</P>

      <P>I am surprised the Taoiseach thinks it is merely undesirable as I would have thought it very wrong for sensitive information to be leaked in advance of Cabinet discussions.  Does he accept that leaks from this Cabinet, not yet four months in office, are unprecedented? How many investigations are under way?</P>

      <P>Four investigations were initiated by me and probably a number of others have been initiated under the procedure I outlined in individual Departments.  It is very undesirable and wrong, if the Deputy wishes me to use that term, for information to <Col N="903" /> be disclosed in this way because it prejudices the freedom of decision making of the Cabinet, which is the body charged under law with the responsibility for making executive decisions in our political system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In essence what the Deputy is proposing is that the parliamentary draftsman's office would draft Bills for members of the Opposition and would draft Opposition amendments to Government Bills which had been drafted in that office.</P>
      <P>Having examined the Deputy's suggestion, I have to say I do not consider that would be a feasible arrangement. Furthermore, I am advised that it would give rise to constitutional difficulties because of the separation of the Legislature and the Executive.  Under the Constitution the Attorney General is the legal adviser to the Government and, therefore, both he and the members of his staff are precluded from giving legal advice or assistance to Members of the Oireachtas, other than members of the Government.</P>

      <P>Deputy Woods apologises for his absence at Question Time but, due to the cumbersome committee system, he has to be elsewhere at this time.  He has asked me to ask the Taoiseach in the interests of openness, transparency and, most importantly, more effective parliamentary procedures, if he would not accept that in the interests of the good workings of the House a parliamentary draftsman should be available to all Oireachtas Members, regardless of party affiliation, to assist us in formulating good law?  For example, we got the amendments to the Occupier's Liability Bill almost at midnight and are expected to debate them properly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I made clear in my original reply, there are constitutional difficulties in doing this because the Attorney General is the adviser to the Government and it is our view, and has been the view of previous Governments, that the Attorney General's Office cannot provide advice on an ongoing basis to others in the Oireachtas apart from the Government to whom he or she is a legal adviser. However, I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that the Bills Office provides excellent assistance to Opposition Deputies wishing to draft amendments. As someone who was in Opposition for longer than I would have wished&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I testify to the considerable assistance that office can offer to any Deputy who wishes to avail of it.  Increased financial and other resources are being made available to committees, which should help.  The assistance being made available to Opposition parties, which is greater than that available to Government parties, will enable them to ensure that legislation and amendments they put forward are adequately drafted.  Opposition Bills have been accepted by Governments so there is not any diriment impediment to the drafting and acceptance of Opposition Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point as far as the Office of the Attorney General is concerned.  Deputy Woods subsequently asked if he will ensure any proposed recruitment will take into account the need to provide services to the Houses of the Oireachtas as well as the Government. The Taoiseach will appreciate that any work which takes place in committee is usually on Government Bills. <Col N="906" /> There have been a few exceptional cases but that cannot be used as a precedent to suggest that resources are available to other Members to enable them to publish Bills.  It is a sensible suggestion.</P>

      <P>As I explained, the Office of the Attorney General cannot provide assistance other than to the Government.  There is a constitutional obstacle to that.</P>
      <P>As far as making assistance available to the Opposition to enable it to draft Bills is concerned, it has been given financial assistance which it can use for that purpose if it chooses.  The Bills Office forms part of the Houses of the Oireachtas and is available to it.  If a case can be made that there are insufficient resources available to the Bills Office, which is an instrument of the Oireachtas and not of Government, that can be raised in the normal way through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or, if the Deputy wishes, directly with me.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My meeting with the Ireland-America Economic Advisory Board in Washington on 17 March was a first opportunity for me, as Taoiseach, to meet this important group of corporate Irish-American leaders who give freely of their time, expertise, experience and contacts to assist in the promotion of our economic interests.  I wish publicly to place on record my thanks to each and every one of them for this very practical expression of their goodwill towards Ireland.</P>
      <P>The main topics which arose at the meeting on 17 March were: additional steps which might be taken to promote US tourism to Ireland, North and South; further development and promotion of the International Financial Services Centre in Dublin; and the organisation of the White House Conference on trade and investment scheduled to take place in May.</P>
      <P>Specific suggestions were made in relation to all three areas.  Deputies will, however, appreciate that given the nature of the Economic Advisory Board it would not be appropriate for me, nor has it been the practice of my predecessor to publicise the precise suggestions made at its meetings.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  Is it the intention to continue the work of the Economic Advisory Board?  The Taoiseach acknowledged that its membership includes some very powerful business people.  Perhaps he will also acknowledge that it is the brainchild of <Col N="908" /> his predecessor who was criticised for going to the board when it was set up. Is it the Taoiseach's view that opportunities exist in the United States for further developing the centre?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to continue consulting the board.  It is very valuable and I will meet it as often as practicable. I give credit to my predecessor for establishing it and have done so freely to the board and elsewhere.  There is scope for further development of the centre, the full potential of which has not yet been realised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not easy to co-ordinate efforts to try to promote and market the International Financial Services Centre.  Was the Taoiseach involved in any initiatives with the advisory group which could help co-ordination of the effort?  If not, will he consider that matter?  I was involved in some of those discussions in the autumn and contend we could improve on focusing the marketing effort in the United States.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The people on the board are best suited to advise us on that.  The board has established a small sub-committee to specifically promote the IFSC.  Not only will it make recommendations to us but, more importantly, it is using its networks in the American business world to contact others and make them aware of the attractions of the IFSC.  Those arrangements are good and are working reasonably well.  My role is to assist them and meet people, whenever desirable, but it is not for me to prescribe how it should be done. Those who are involved in it know best how to do it.</P>

      <Quest>if he will respond to the statement of the Director of Public Prosecutions that a mechanism could be set up under existing provisions of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, under which the Attorney General could review any decisions by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to consider if it had acted correctly according to due legal process in reaching its decisions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 and 5 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mechanism suggested in the <Col N="910" /> recent Sunday newspaper article was one of a number of recommendations contained in a 1987 Report of the Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  The suggestion was that, under section 2 (6) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, the Attorney General could be consulted by the Director of Public Prosecutions relevant to his decisions in certain cases for the purpose of establishing whether the decision was arrived at in accordance with the proper legal criteria.  The recommendation was not implemented at the time because it was the considered view of the Director of Public Prosecutions, after reflection, and of the then Government that it would interfere with the independence of the Director and bring such matters into the political arena.</P>
    <P>I have again consulted both the Attorney General and the Director on the matter and they are strongly of the view that such a mechanism would not be a good idea, for these same reasons.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept in principle that a review of the decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions and thereby more accountability of the office is necessarily good? Is he mindful of the fact that the Director of Public Prosecutions has openly and publicly stated he thinks it would be good and desirable if his decisions were open to review?  Does the Taoiseach intend to introduce a review mechanism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I discussed the matter with the Director of Public Prosecutions. He confirmed the advice that he had given in writing directly to me that the arrangements suggested in the Deputy's question are not satisfactory. It is my impression that there is no proposal at present which overcomes the difficulties to which I have referred on many previous occasions in the House. If a proposal is suggested that would overcome those difficulties, I am willing to have the matter considered, but I see fundamental difficulties of the kind I <Col N="911" /> have recited at considerable length previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that the concession by the Director of Public Prosecutions that he had no problem with a review by the Attorney General of some decisions allowed for under the 1974 Act was made in the context of massive criticism of a major discrepancy between reported prosecutions and those that proceed to trial, in other words, charges of child sex abuse which are dealt with by the Garda and ultimately by the Director of Public Prosecutions which do not proceed to trial and the low rate of success in such cases as are prosecuted? It was in that context that the Director of Public Prosecutions indicated he was willing to concede that there was a need for some scrutiny of certain policy areas. Will the Taoiseach not agree that, having wrenched this concession from the Director of Public Prosecutions, it is folly for the Taoiseach and the Executive to row back on that concession and that there is a need for a review of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions in respect of prosecutions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that my views on these matters are my own.  I strongly believe that the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions should not be politicised.  I see serious dangers in any of the proposals I have heard for the introduction of what is called &ldquo;accountability&rdquo;.  The result would be the politicisation of the office and of prosecutorial decisions, which would be profoundly dangerous.  It is possible that Deputies, such as Deputy O'Donnell, may hold a different view.  I wish to assure the House that my views on this matter are firmly held and are not inspired by anybody else.  I have already indicated in the House that I favour the idea of an external audit of the operations of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and have conveyed those views to him.  I see no difficulty with that <Col N="912" /> because it would involve the overall operation of the office.  I see profound difficulty in reporting on individual decisions because, if people know that individual decisions will be the subject of parliamentary scrutiny, they will inevitably tailor their decision-making to the political requirements that would entail.  That would not lead to the proper separation of powers and the proper independence of the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Director of Public Prosecutions has stated publicly that he considers his decisions should be reviewable and he would welcome that. Will the Taoiseach say if he disagrees with the view of the Director of Public Prosecutions on how his office should operate?  Does he fundamentally disagree with that statement?</P>

      <P>I would like to put on record what I understand happened in regard to the so-called views of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  He was asked in general if he was opposed to the concept of accountability.  In order to illustrate the fact that he was not opposed in principle to accountability as long as it did not interfere with the problems to which I referred, he said he had been open to the suggestion made in the 1987 report of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism.  He said that to indicate an openness on his part but subsequently, having considered the matter carefully, he came to the firm view that the actual proposal was dangeous, wrong and would not work.  There is no difference between the Director of Public Prosecutions and myself on this issue.  If specific proposals can be made which do not politicise prosecutorial decisions or create a position where explanations are offered which could be prejudicial to the rights of innocent people, such proposals can be considered.  I have already indicated that I favour the idea of an external audit of the general operations of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. I also favour the arrangements for reporting on the processing of cases <Col N="913" /> in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions on an ongoing basis to ensure that no cases simply disappear, as was suggested by Deputy Séamus Brennan in an earlier exchange on this subject.  I am open to those types of suggestions, but I am determined not to allow these decisions to be politicised.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate the relevance of section 2 (6) of the 1974 Act which appears specifically to allow for such consideration and discussion with the Attorney General of the operation of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions?  Regarding the Taoiseach's response that he has no problem with some type of independent accounting generally to the House on policy issues, would he agree that an annual report of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which would focus on specific areas of policy which have caused concern, such as child abuse cases, should be debated in the House?  Surely such a debate would provide an opportunity for the Attorney General to review any discrepancies in the figures for prosecutions in a general way.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not favour an annual debate on the operations of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions as I believe that would have the effect of politicising his decisions which I wish to avoid.  Regarding the provisions of the 1974 Act, the best advice I could offer the Deputy is to read the Official Report at that time where she will find the motivations for the section to which she referred.  It is the view of the current Attorney General, the current Director of Public Prosecutions and the current Taoiseach that any attempt to implement those provisions in the manner suggested in <Col N="914" /> the 1987 report would lead inevitably to the politicisation of the office because that would result in my answering questions on the floor of the House on behalf of the Attorney General in respect of individual decisions on whether or not to prosecute.  That would not be desirable as it would involve the politicisation of prosecutorial decisions. I hope Deputy O'Donnell and others who are pursuing this matter realise that would be the position.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy checks the record, he will see that I have given at least two examples of problems that could arise in that regard.  For example, a specific witness may be absent or unreliable or other evidence may not be available which would point the finger in a particular direction without it being possible to prove the matter one way or the other.  I consider that would be prejudicial to the interests of individual innocent persons.  In order to have an authoritative statement of my views on this matter, I refer the Deputy to my previous and more comprehensive answers to the same question in the past few months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>United Nations General Assembly Resolution 49/75K of 15 December 1994 requested the International Court of Justice to render its advisory opinion on the question: &ldquo;Is the threat or use of nuclear weapons in any circumstances permitted under <Col N="916" /> international law?&rdquo; The Government has received an invitation from the court to make a submission before 20 June 1995.  The response to this invitation is now under consideration.</P>
      <P>It will be recalled that the World Health Assembly, in Resolution 46/40 of 14 May 1993, requested the International Court of Justice to give an advisory opinion on whether the use of nuclear weapons by a state in war or other armed conflict would be a breach of its obligations under international law, including the Constitution of the World Health Organisation.  As Deputies will be aware, Ireland responded on 9 June last year to the invitation of the International Court of Justice by making a submission on the matter.</P>
      <P>It is still unclear what procedure the court intends to follow in handling the two similar, but not identical, referrals. Since it is possible that the court will decide to combine its consideration of the two cases, the precise procedure that it adopts will be relevant to the Government's decision on whether or not an additional submission by Ireland would be helpful to the court.  We are currently seeking clarification from the court on this procedural point.</P>
      <P>The Government's objective in this matter will be to ensure that, in preparing its advisory opinion or opinions, the court is fully aware of the approach of successive Irish Governments with respect to nuclear weapons &mdash; namely, to work by every means open to them, towards the aim of the ultimate abolition of nuclear weapons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Now that chemical and biological weapons are outlawed, will the Tánaiste accept that the next logical step is for the International Court of Justice to make a judgment banning the use of nuclear weapons also?  Will he welcome such a decision by the International Court of Justice?  In view of our people's objections to the possession of nuclear weapons and in the light of our key role <i>vis-á-vis</i> the Non-Proliferation Treaty, will the Tánaiste agree that we <Col N="917" /> should respond clearly and forthrightly, outlining our abhorrence of the use of nuclear weapons, stating we want them banned as are chemical and biological weapons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be well aware of the policy of the present and successive Irish Governments, our ultimate aim being the abolition of nuclear weapons.  In that respect any steps that can be taken by the International Court of Justice or the United Nations to ensure an ultimate ban will be welcomed, and we shall continue to work in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Tánaiste explain why, when the International Court of Justice sought the views of nations worldwide, 21 nations argued that any use of nuclear weapons would be illegal but Ireland simply wanted the question answered.  What was the significance of that approach by our Government, as distinct from seeking a straight ban which we should have sought?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>One must draw a distinction between the issues submitted by the World Health Assembly and those submitted by the United Nations General Assembly.  The question submitted by the World Health Assembly relates to the use of nuclear weapons only, with particular reference to the health and environmental effects, while that submitted to the United Nations General Assembly extends to the threat of use as well as to the use of nuclear weapons, so there is a distinction.  We would need to be careful not to confuse the issues before the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference to be held in New York in a fortnight's time and those before the International Court of Justice. In terms of the general area, there are some similarities but we must make progress at the conference in New York. Some people have endeavoured to link the question before the International Court of Justice with the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  That would be unwise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>I have consistently emphasised to the British Government the need to respond positively to the new situation created by the ceasefires.  In that context the Government has pointed to the need for careful consideration of the position regarding prisoners, and made clear its view that a sensitive approach in this area has an important contribution to make to the consolidation of the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that regard we have taken careful note of the situation regarding Irish prisoners in Britain, including those held at Belmarsh Prison.  I have instructed our Embassy in London to monitor the situation closely and, at my request, an official recently visited <Col N="919" /> Belmarsh where he met a number of Irish prisoners.  We have also maintained close contact with many of the families concerned and with the relevant legal representatives.  On foot of these contacts we have raised with the British authorities a number of issues relevant to conditions at the prison, including arrangements for visits by the families concerned, many of whom must travel long distances to reach the prison. If tackled on a pragmatic and sensitive basis, these problems can be satisfactorily resolved without any loss of principle. I assure the Deputy that I will continue to follow closely the situation at the prison and to urge that the difficulties there be addressed in as flexible a manner as possible.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of prison releases, Deputies will be aware that the Government recently permitted, against a background of the significant reduction in the level of threat to the community, the early release of a number of prisoners serving sentences in this jurisdiction.  The Government will continue to keep these matters under review in its contacts with the British Government and to encourage a flexible and sensitive approach in dealing with prison issues generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that of six Irish prisoners in Belmarsh Prison, two are locked up for 24 hours in their cells, without any exercise or fresh air, and the other four are locked up for between 18 and 19 hours a day in their cells with one hour only in the open air, will the Tánaiste agree that no matter what crime was committed, that constitutes an inhumane regime and the strongest possible protest should be made to the British authorities by our Government about their treatment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>There are certainly very serious, specific problems at Belmarsh Prison, relating to food, exercise, access to recreational and educational facilities, and arrangements for visits, on <Col N="920" /> which our views have been communicated to the British Government.  An official from our Embassy in London visited the prison on 16 March and met all concerned.  In addition, my Department is in close contact with many of the families, on foot of which contacts we have raised with the British authorities a number of issues about which concern has been expressed.  We have had detailed discussions with them about these issues and stressed the need for a flexible response.  Discussions are continuing.  I confirm that the Government approved today the Bill on the transfer of prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the approval of that Bill and hope it will be introduced and passed by the House in the near future.  Will the Tánaiste accept that the prison regime is so vindictive as to ban the use of vitamin supplements which are absolutely essential due to the lack of fresh air?  Will he accept that this regime is inhumane and will he make direct contact with the Secretary for Home Affairs on this issue?  In regard to visits by families, because it takes 45 minutes from the time of arrival at the prison before visitors see the prisoners and there is more time involved in getting out of the prison, it is impossible for families from Ireland to make it a one day trip.  That is outrageous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply and in reply to the first supplementary, we have taken up the issues to which the Deputy referred with the British authorities and will continue to do so.  The regime has to be addressed and we want to do everything possible to assist the prisoners and their families who have to endure considerable hardship because of these difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is seriously concerned at the deteriorating situation in Bosnia where, in recent weeks, there has been a dramatic increase in violations of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement.  This agreement, which came into effect on 1 January 1995 for a four-month period, had been generally holding, other than in the Bihac area.  If it collapses and significant progress cannot be made towards a solution, there is a strong possibility that Bosnia will be plunged into a renewed war with tragic results for the region as a whole.</P>
      <P>This critical situation in Bosnia has been precipitated by military offensives undertaken recently by Bosnian Government forces in the Tuzla and Travnik areas.  Bosnian Serbs have retaliated against Tuzla, Gorazde, Mostar, and around Sarajevo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a tragedy for the people of Bosnia should the limited progress towards a political solution be lost at this stage.  In my answer to a question on 24 January, I outlined the elements of the Contact Group's plan for territorial delimitation in Bosnia and for its preservation as a single union within its internationally recognised borders.  This has been accepted by three of the four key participants in the conflict &mdash; the Bosnian Government, Bosnia's Croats, <Col N="922" /> and the authorities in Belgrade who represent the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, i.e., Serbia and Montenegro.</P>
    <P>Only the Serbs in Bosnia itself continue to reject the plan.  Pressure is being applied to obtain their agreement. The Security Council, in September 1994, reinforced and extended the sanctions which had been imposed earlier on the Bosnian Serbs.  Provision was made to prevent all economic activities in member states by persons or entities resident in areas under control of Bosnian Serb forces; the freezing of Bosnian Serb assets; and the exclusion of Bosnian Serb civilian and military authorities from the territories of member states of the UN.  These sanctions, together with those already in place, are among the most stringent measures ever adopted by the Security Council.  For their refusal to accept the Contract Group's plan, the Bosnian Serbs are now isolated politically, materially and physically.</P>
    <P>Belgrade's decision, in August 1994, to end its support for the Bosnian Serb leadership and to close its border with Bosnia, has brought further pressure on the Bosnian Serbs.  A mission of the International Conference on former Yugoslavia, to which Ireland is contributing four personnel, is monitoring this closure.  To encourage Belgrade's belated co-operation in the peace process the Security Council has suspended a limited number of sanctions &mdash; for example on sports and cultural contacts &mdash; but not the core economic sanctions. While pressure is being maintained on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Contact Group's plan, the European Union is working to advance the peace process on a broader level.  We are endeavouring to bring about the mutual recognition of the former Yugoslav states. This would be a clear signal that the aspirations of the Bosnian and Croatian Serbs for a &ldquo;greater Serbia&rdquo; are not attainable and would improve the prospects for political settlements in Bosnia and Croatia.</P>
    <P>At this critical time we, with our European Union partners and the UN, <Col N="923" /> have made it clear that the Bosnian parties must cease their military operations; they must abide by their commitments under the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement and permit its renewal; they must co-operate with the Security Council's decision last week, which we fully support, to renew UNPROFOR's mandate; and, vitally, they must now begin negotiations on the basis of the acceptance of the Contact Group's plan.</P>
    <P>We are continuing to work with our European partners to achieve these objectives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in his reply, for which I am grateful because it covers the matter fairly fully, referred only to sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs.  Does he think it appropriate, in view of the very close connection and support between Serbia proper and the Bosnian Serbs, that sanctions against Serbia should be reimposed or intensified? When he says that the recent outbreak of fighting was caused, in the first instance, by the Bosnian Government forces attacking others within Bosnia and seeking to regain some of the territory which has been taken from it by Serbia illegally, does he not feel that the Bosnian Government, in all the circumstances, is entitled to seek to defend and try to reoccupy its own territory, particularly as an arms embargo has operated against them and not against Serbia?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware of the position taken by the Irish Government and by our European Union partners on the arms embargo. There are many who take a different view but I do not feel that allowing arms into Bosnia would in any way contribute to a solution to this horrendous problem. We have to look at this in the context of what the Contact Group set forward over many months and, indeed, going back to the original London conference. We have to ensure a continuation of pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the Contact Group's plan.  We <Col N="924" /> have to maintain an emphasis on the overall resolution of the conflicts in former Yugoslavia which would guarantee the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all the states within their internationally recognised borders.  That involves an emphasis on the importance of mutual recognition of all former Yugoslav republics.  In this regard support for the convening of a meeting between Presidents Tudjman, Millosevic and Izetbegovic could pave the way for an international conference to settle all matters relating to the conflict in former Yugoslavia.  Also, we must support the international conference's peace plan for Croatia and we are urging parties to begin negotiations.  There are no easy solutions.  That is one of the lessons we have all learned in relation to former Yugoslavia.  The parties must be brought back to the negotiating table and the European Union, in conjunction with our United States allies and the Russians, must do everything possible to encourage them to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that if pressure is not put on Serbia in the present context, on the lines I suggest in the question, that the Serbians are likely &mdash; and thought by many people very likely &mdash; to engage in further acts of aggression in Kosovo where they will seek to occupy that country and to expel people of Albanian ethnic origin?  Does he not regard the attitude now being taken in regard to Serbia as an encouragement to them to expand their idea of what they call a greater Serbia which they want to establish, and that they are showing no respect for national borders within the former Republic of Yugoslavia by occupying parts of Croatia, of Bosnia-Hercegovina and, effectively, parts of Kosovo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>First, the Bosnian Serbs remain intransigent in their opposition to the Contact Group's plan but we have to look at a way of advancing the overall peace process in Bosnia.  We are pressing for recognition of the Federal <Col N="925" /> Republic of Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Croatia, within their internationally recognised borders.  This would be a major contribution to peace in the Yugoslav region.  It could also be a clear signal &mdash; a signal which the European Union has been trying to send for many months &mdash; to both the Bosnian Serbs and the Croatian Serbs that their aspirations for a greater Serbia cannot be realised.  They have to accept that they cannot be realised and everything we do must ensure that that is the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The United States House of Representatives Committee on International Relations, chaired by Congressman Ben Gilman, held a hearing on Northern Ireland on 15 March 1995.</P>
      <P>This meeting focused on the peace process and, in particular, on the role the United States can play in encouraging reconciliation and dialogue in Ireland through measures to assist economic development and investment on this island.</P>
      <P>The meeting was addressed by five members of Congress and by a number of other speakers who included Mr. Richard Holbrooke, Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs at the US Department of State.</P>
      <P>The Government was not asked to assist or facilitate the hearing or to participate in it in any way.  It was, however, an initiative which developed in a positive and constructive fashion the Congress's engagement with the peace process and as such, was, something to which we could readily give our support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I availed of my visit to Washington on 27-28 February to discuss a range of matters with Congressman Gilman.  The <Col N="926" /> Taoiseach also met Congressman Gilman during his recent visit to the United States.  We expressed the Government's deep appreciation of his long standing work on behalf of the Irish-American community, of Irish interests generally and of his strong support in encouraging the process of reconciliation and political dialogue on this island.</P>
    <P>Congressman Gilman will be visiting Ireland later this month.  We look forward to welcoming him and holding further discussions with him on these issues.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Minister's view that Republican Congressman Gilman has been and continues to be a good friend of Ireland.  In the event of further meetings being held by the committee, will the Government give evidence and provide whatever assistance and information is required by Congressman Gilman?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have an opportunity to discuss these matters and whether it is intended to hold further hearings when Congressman Gilman visits Ireland later this month.  As the Deputy acknowledged, Congressman Gilman has been a very good friend of Ireland, in the best meaning of that word, for many years, has an abiding interest in the conflict and has done tremendous work.  There was a positive note at the hearings held on 15-16 March and all parties will have an opportunity to discuss these matters with Congressman Gilman later this month.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that congressional opinion, as reflected by Congressman Gilman's group, shows increasing frustration at the delays by the British Government in entering ministerial talks with Republicans, particularly as it has had a meeting with Loyalists who, as far as one can judge, were not required to be as forthcoming on the decommissioning issue?</P>

      <Quest>if his Department will provide funding for the emigration advice centres to help potential applicants for the next immigrant visa lottery scheme to the United States of America (details supplied) in view of the fact that certain individuals and organisations profess to guarantee visas.</Quest>
      <QRef>[7116/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the allocation of visas under the current US immigrant visa programme is decided by lottery, there is no question of any individual or organisation being in a position to guarantee visas.  All details about the operation of the programme are published by the US authorities and are available from US Embassies and Consulates. These official US sources provide the most authoritative information about the programme and potential visa applicants are advised to contact them directly.</P>
      <P>My Department provides funds of £150,000 a year to support the valuable work of immigrant advice centres in the United States.  However, since these centres are dealing with people already in the US, their involvement with potential visa applicants is limited.  Funding of emigrant advice centres in Ireland would not be a matter for the Foreign Affairs Vote.  In any event, those interested in the visa lottery scheme are best advised to contact official US sources for full details of all aspects of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The only funding for emigrant advice centres is provided through the Department of Education and distributed mainly through the vocational education committees.  Given that some US organisations charge $50 for help <Col N="928" /> with filling in application forms and £2,000 if one is successful, does the Minister not agree that it is time to allocate funding to advice centres which employ two or three people and provide advice and information free of charge?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>As I see it, the system is clear.  The US Embassy advertises the immigrant visa lottery schemes and, to the best of my knowledge, Irish people have been very successful in obtaining visas in recent years.  If anything, the US Embassy is extremely helpful and information is readily made available.  I suspect that, like many other Deputies, Deputy Kitt has helped with filling in application forms and processing material.  There is no need for intermediaries or for would-be visa applicants to incur any expense when filling in their application forms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that his Department or the American Embassy should issue a statement about misleading advertisements in the newspapers in advance of the announcement of the next immigrant visa lottery scheme?  Some people have paid between $50-$2,000 on the basis that they would be guaranteed a visa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Misleading advertisements in the Irish media are dealt with by the Advertising Standards Authority. I am prepared to bring any misleading advertisements to the attention of the authority and I encourage Deputy Kitt and other Deputies to do likewise.  The Deputy provided me with a copy of an advertisement from a newspaper which on the face of it, does not appear to be misleading as all it offers is information about the visa lottery scheme.  However, if one were to follow that up one might be surprised where it leads and the next communication may require a fee of some sort.  I will ask the press section of my Department to ensure that information is made available to the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister put his finger on the problem, that people are <Col N="929" /> drawn into the net of paying money when they reply to the first advertisement. The American Embassy is annoyed about these advertisments and I ask the Minister to make a statement about misleading advertisements in advance of the next scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Deputy's genuine concern about this matter, I will have discussions with the American Embassy on how the Department and it can best handle this matter to ensure that people are not drawn into the net referred to by him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to take Question Nos. 21, 28, 38, 44, 46 and 57 together.</P>
      <P>The decision to publish a White Paper on Foreign Policy has been incorporated in the programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i> as a central element in the Government's wider initiative to bring greater openness and transparency to the way in which Ireland is governed.  I am glad that the White Paper has already had an impact on the degree of transparency with which our foreign policy is conducted.  The series of White Paper seminars which have just been completed broke new ground, not only in Ireland but in Europe and beyond, in opening up foreign policy to the scrutiny and discussion of the public at large.  It is my intention that the White Paper should contain proposals for establishing a permanent framework allowing public access to the formulation of our foreign policy, and work is at present under way on such proposals. Deputies will already be aware of the existence of the Irish Aid Advisory Committee and of my announcement at the Human Rights seminar in Galway that I intend to establish a Standing Committee on Human Rights, involving officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs and representatives of the NGOs community.  I also refer to my invitation to representatives of the public and NGOs to send in written submissions on matters to be covered by the White Paper.  I am pleased to report that over 60 submissions have been received, so far mainly from NGOs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention that the White Paper on Foreign Policy should be published in June, although I will not allow its quality to be sacrificed to the need to meet a particular deadline.  As I said in the House in January in reply to questions, I intend to bring the White Paper <Col N="931" /> before the House at the earliest possible date following its publication, and I hope that the House will agree to hold a substantial debate on its contents.</P>
    <P>I cannot, at this stage, give precise details on the decision-making procedure to be followed in the implementation of the various proposals which will figure in the White Paper.  Clearly, the means and timescale of implementation will vary according to the proposal in question.  Furthermore, while it may be possible to implement certain proposals by Government decision or through national legislation, the achievement of many of our foreign policy goals will require the agreement of other states.</P>
    <P>In addition to debating the White Paper, I expect that, during this year, the House will have the opportunity to discuss specific elements of foreign policy, in particular matters relating to the European Union.  There will also be detailed discussions on a whole range of foreign policy issues in the Oireachtas Joint Committees on Foreign Affairs and European Affairs.</P>
    <P>European affairs and, in particular, Ireland's approach to next year's European Union Intergovernmental Conference, will be among the central concerns of the White Paper.  It is, of course, only in the negotiations themselves that each member state can, or should, set out its detailed negotiating approach, but the White Paper will state clearly and openly the broad considerations which will influence Ireland's approach to the Intergovernmental Conference.  The Intergovernmental Conference will be of great importance to Ireland and the European Union as a whole.  Chairing the Intergovernmental Conference during the second half of 1996 will be one of the major priorities of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers, the Commission and the European Parliament are currently producing reports on the functioning of the Treaty on European Union.  These reports will serve as inputs into the work of the Reflection <Col N="932" /> Group which will undertake the preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference and which is due to hold its first meeting on 3 June.  Ireland's representative on the Reflection Group will be the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs.  Deputy Gay Mitchell.</P>
    <P>The Government attaches great importance to ensuring that at all stages of the process, both in the preparation for and conduct of the Intergovernmental Conference, the public, the Oireachtas, the social partners and other interested groups are kept fully informed of the issues at stake and fully involved in their discussion.  The Joint Committee on European Affairs and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, I am sure, will address many issues relevant to the Intergovernmental Conference over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The Government would welcome the views not just of other political parties, of the social partners and of other interested groups in the run-up to the Intergovernmental Conference, but also the views of the general public.  I would point out that two of the White Paper seminars focused on issues likely to arise at the Intergovernmental Conference. I have also received a number of interesting written submissions on these issues in the context of the White Paper and I am ready at any time during the discussions in the Reflection Group and in the Intergovernmental Conference to receive further submissions on matters under discussion in these fora.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Does he agree that communicating European policy matters to the public presents a difficult challenge?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his remarks.  Of their very nature, European statements, directives and policies in general are complex, especially as <Col N="933" /> they now involve the deliberations of 15 member states, and communicating Europe to the public presents major difficulties. The Government has set up a well-resourced strategy for communicating Europe so that the public can become more involved in decisions made in Europe.  Part of my thinking in publishing a White Paper was to engage the public in the formulation of foreign policy.  For many years most people have been unable to contribute to the evolution of Irish foreign policy.  The seven seminars held for the purpose of obtaining information and an input to the White Paper were successful and well attended by rank and file members of the public, non-governmental organisations, academics and other interested people.  I am not sure if I will succeed, but I will endeavour to communicate Europe to the public in a simple fashion and to ensure it is well informed in the run-up to the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>

Is he aware of the concern of those organisations today &mdash; a concern shared by most people &mdash; about the crisis in Burundi and the lack of action at Government level on a worldwide basis?  What specific action does the Minister propose to take regarding the handling of that crisis?

      <P>There are two parts to the Deputy's question.  I outlined the general principles of foreign policy in my reply.  In regard to day to day crises, the Deputy will be aware that my ministerial colleague, Deputy Burton, announced last weekend that the Government proposes to allocate £750,000 to assist agencies working in Burundi.  The Minister proposes to meet the NGOs representatives on their return from Burundi tomorrow morning <Col N="934" /> to get an update on the position.  We will continue to do everything possible to alleviate the problem both on a bilateral basis and with our European partners.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister of State's proposal to meet the NGOs on their return from Burundi and the contribution of £750,000, is a sizeable amount of money from our small State. The European Union which consists of 15 members should play a lead role in this area.  We do not want a recurrence of the massacres which took place in Rwanda, but it looks as if that could happen.  Will the Minister commit himself to raising this issue at an early stage with our European Union partners as well as at the UN so that we can take significant action to stop another tragedy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Everything that can be done to ensure there is not a recurrence of the Rwandaan tragedy in Burundi. The matter is being given priority attention at the UN by the Organisation of African Unity and the European Union Troika has visited that area twice in recent times.  I will have an opportunity to brief my colleagues in Brussels on the matter next Monday on the basis of the report we receive from the NGOs returning from the area tonight.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, the Irish Government has taken to contribute to the review of the United Nations in view of the need for the United Nations to satisfactorily monitor human rights abuses and war crimes tribunals in Yugoslavia and Rwanda; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is actively contributing to the general debate on the future of the United Nations.  When I addressed the General Assembly on 28 September 1994 I made a number of specific proposals relating to human <Col N="935" /> rights.  These included a call for an effective system of monitoring and adjudicating on human rights violations.  I proposed the development of a standing team of human rights monitors reporting to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.  I also repeated my view that the international community will have failed to learn the lessons of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda unless a permanent international criminal court is established.</P>
      <P>Ireland is participating in the <i>ad hoc</i> committee of the General Assembly currently meeting in New York to consider arrangements to convene an international conference to establish such a court.</P>
      <P>We supported the establishment of the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda.  Although the Government shares the view of our European Union partners that the tribunals should be funded through the regular budget of the United Nations, we have also made voluntary contributions to the work of both tribunals.  In the General Assembly we have, together with out European partners, pressed for early agreement on a secure financial basis for these tribunals.</P>
      <P>Ireland was instrumental in the negotiations which led to the appointment of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr. Ayala Lasso, in April 1994. We welcomed the High Commissioner's prompt response to the crisis in Rwanda and contributed £50,000 in October 1994 to his emergency human rights field operation in Rwanda for the deployment of human rights monitors. We will shortly make another contribution of £50,000 for the same purpose.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to note that the team of 40 EU human rights monitors who are currently deploying to Rwanda in support of the High Commissioner's operation is led by an Irishman, Brian McKeown, who was nominated by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the recent session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, <Col N="936" /> also announced that the Government will double its contribution in 1995 to the UN Voluntary Fund for Technical Co-operation in the field of human rights to £60,000.  This fund is an important resource available to the High Commissioner and the UN Centre for Human Rights for preventative action in the field of human rights in countries such as Burundi, which has been threatened with a tragedy similar to that of Rwanda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive response.  He referred to the <i>ad hoc</i> groups set up and his recommendation that there should be a permanent international court for war crimes.  Has any person been brought to justice for the genocide and other war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda or are we still at the recommendation and aspirational stage in setting up international tribunals to bring people to justice? Does the Minister agree that to facilitate reconstruction and reconciliation of the peoples of the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda it is vital that the criminals are named and brought to justice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy says.  It is not a question of semantics.  It is pointless setting up a court, whether on an <i>ad hoc</i> or temporary basis, unless it carries out the functions with which it is seized.  I do not have the information the Deputy seeks, but I will supply her with it.  I am aware that work in tracking down those accused of heinous crimes has been very slow, in some cases involving extradition from other countries. As I stated in my reply, we want to establish a permanent international court with the power to investigate and prosecute.  Until that happens we will be frustrated in our attempts because, in cases such as Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, it will take a great deal of time and effort to establish courts to deal with the crimes.  A permanent international criminal court with the necessary machinery and resources <Col N="937" /> would be much more effective than the present system.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept the Minister stated that European Union human rights monitors are led by an Irish person, does he not agree that this is an opportunity for Ireland to take the lead?  Is it not an opportunity for us, as our President has done in other fora, to take the lead in human rights terms and offer leadership to those countries economically even stronger than ours?  If nobody has been brought to trial for genocide and war crimes, will the Tánaiste raise this with the UN at the earliest possible opportunity?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>We have taken a lead.  At the UN Assembly last year I made a specific call for an effective system of monitoring and adjudicating on human rights violations.  That was repeated in Vienna last year.  Likewise, we supported the call for setting up a permanent court.  When I get information I will make it available to the Deputy and, at the earliest opportunity, we will pursue our ultimate ambition to have an international court established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy O'Donnell's concern that the machinery should be set up, but there is no evidence of action.  I realise it is often difficult to capture known criminals, whether in Rwanda or Yugoslavia. Would it not be possible, as was done after the Second World War, to conduct trials in the absence of the accused, as was done in the case of Klaus Barbie who was eventually found and caught?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have found information which I saw earlier today.  On 13 February, the Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia charged 21 Serbs with war crimes and crimes against humanity at the notorious Omarska prison camp in Northwest Bosnia.  The 21 defendants include the camp commander, Mr. Meakic, and trials are expected to start <Col N="938" /> in the spring.  So far, unfortunately, only one of the 21 accused, Dusan Tadic, is in custody &mdash; in Germany.  The other suspects are believed to be at large in Serb-controlled areas in Bosnia.  The Bosnian Serb Leader, Dr. Radovan Karadzic, has said that his forces will not hand suspects over to the tribunal and this is a serious obstacle to its work. With our European partners we will seek to ensure that justice is not obstructed.</P>
      <P>The last point raised is one which should be considered in the context of a permanent international court of justice, something we are working towards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 54 together.</P>
      <P>Suggestions that funding under the Lomé Convention, provided through the European Development Fund, be incorporated in the EU general budget have been rejected by the Council.  As recently as last December, the General Affairs Council concluded unanimously that it would be inappropriate to amend the provisions currently applicable to financing the European Development Fund.  This decision reflected the Declaration adopted by the Intergovernmental Conference at the time of negotiating the Final Act of the Treaty on European Union.  That Declaration, which is annexed to the Final Act states: &ldquo;The Conference agrees that the European Development Fund will continue to be financed by national contributions in accordance with the current provisions.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The size of the 8th EDF, to cover the period 1995-2000, is under negotiation among the EU member states.  In those negotiations, Ireland offered to increase its contribution from its current £48 million to £60 million, an increase of £12 million over the five year period in question.  As regards the cost to Ireland of including the EDF in the general budget instead of the present system of national contributions, the best estimate, on the basis of the latest figures suggested by the Presidency, is that it would cost a further £10 million over the five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the current position of the Council on budgetisation, and the implications of the additional costs of budgetisation for Ireland's other aid priorities, I believe that the current EDF arrangements offer the best hope of arriving at a satisfactory amount to meet the European Union's obligations to the <Col N="940" /> developing countries which are parties to the Lomé Convention.</P>
    <P>To date, it has not been possible to reach agreement on the size of the 8th EDF because some member states have sought to make significant reductions in their contributions.  We will continue to work with the Presidency and other member states to arrive at a realistic and acceptable offer for the 8th EDF.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State for her reply and congratulate all concerned on the decision to increase our contribution.  When does the Minister of State expect that the final decision will be taken, in view of the niggardly approach of some of the member states who do not want to contribute to the Lomé Convention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Presidency is making sustained efforts to negotiate the eighth round.  There is a general expectation that it may be possible to reach a conclusion by May.  However, a number of countries object to the scale of contribution which they would have to make and a conclusion has not yet been reached.  The Presidency has engaged in an extensive round of negotiations to reach agreement, particularly with those countries, and I am hopeful that agreement might be reached some time in May or June.</P>

Many member states share our view that it is important to not only maintain the contribution but, if possible, expand it in terms of the commitment which people in Europe generally have to the concept of co-operation and partnership with the developing world.  I thank the Deputy for his comments.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the comments by the Secretary of State in Washington last month in which he stated that, before British Ministers will participate in exploratory talks with Sinn Féin, there would need to be a reliable assurance from Sinn Féin that constructive discussion &mdash; particularly in achieving substantial progress on decommissioning of arms &mdash; would be facilitated by ministerial participation.  The Secretary of State also set out his views on conditions to be met for Sinn Féin participation in substantive talks.</P>
      <P>The Government fully appreciates the deep concerns to which the arms issue gives rise, and the anxiety to ensure rapid progress regarding the stocks of weapons held by paramilitaries on both sides.  Dealing with the paramilitary arsenals is clearly an essential element in the peace process and crucial to the achievement of a lasting peace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government believes, accordingly, that the decommissioning of arms is one of a number of very important issues which must be addressed.  I believe that there is a very widespread acceptance in principle of the need for progress in this vital area, and that the debate should now focus on how we can <Col N="942" /> create the conditions which will enable this objective to be achieved.  However, as the Taoiseach and I have both emphasised, the peace process is not a single issue agenda.  Progress in this particular area may be made easier with the growth of confidence and in the context of movement across a range of issues. The objective of permanent peace is most likely to be achieved by a process which involves movement on a number of fronts.</P>
    <P>Given the complexity of the issues involved in decommissioning it is clearly desirable that the necessary discussions on this item should get under way as quickly as possible.  We welcome the fact that Sinn Féin seems now to have broadly met the criteria set out by the Secretary of State in Washington for ministerial participation in exploratory dialogue.  It is our hope that technical or presentational difficulties in wording an agenda will not hold up for much longer the involvement of both sides in such dialogue.  For our part we will continue to encourage all the parties to show the necessary flexibility to ensure that the peace process can continue to move forward.</P>
    <P>As regards the Deputy's question about third party involvement, the practical arrangements for decommissioning arms will be a matter for discussion between the relevant parties.  Obvious issues of verification will arise and it may be that, down the road, there will be a role for third parties.  For our part we are quite open and flexible on that aspect and will be willing to look at it at the appropriate time.  I see the immediate priority, however, as the achievement of meaningful progress in direct dialogue between the British Government and the parties concerned, and repeat my hope that there can be exploratory dialogue on this and other relevant issues with British Ministers as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of decommissioning of arms, does the Minister agree that the language used is contributing to the paralysis and that <Col N="943" /> one must not lose sight of the fact that there is a difference between arms held illegally and those held legally by a state protecting its own interests?  What models have been proposed so far?  The Taoiseach recently mentioned a variety which could be used in handing over or decommissioning arms.  In that context would it be appropriate at this stage to consider using the United States as an honest broker?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of decommissioning of arms, it is important to remove the stocks of paramilitary weapons; that is the essential key.  I also look forward to further reductions in the military presence in Northern Ireland in line with the new situation prevailing as a result of the ceasefire.  These are different issues and they should not be confused but, ultimately, both will have to be addressed. I do not think we will have great difficulty in coming up with the right model or modalities; the body involved could well be the OSCE or some of the Nordic countries.  It has been suggested that I should look at how arms were decommissioned successfully in fraught and difficult circumstances after the Greek civil war in the 1940s.  We must ensure that dialogue and discussions take place between Sinn Féin and the British Government at ministerial level.  That is the first hurdle to be overcome and I hope we are making progress.  We should not be side-tracked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister emphasised that, while there is a need for decommissioning, this cannot be a single item agenda only. The present hair-splitting performances of the British Government on this issue is not helping in commencing the necessary talks to build on the peace process. Does the Minister accept that congressional opinion in the United States is becoming increasingly frustrated, as are we in the Republic, at the delays in the British Government entering talks at ministerial level with republicans, <Col N="944" /> especially as it has done so with loyalists without, as far as one can judge, the loyalists having to be forthcoming on the question of decommissioning?  I also welcome the fact that the Minister mentioned the need for a reduction in the military presence, including the RUC and loyalist armaments legally held by those who felt threatened down through the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The administration in Washington takes a keen interest in what is happening in Northern Ireland, has held itself out as a friend to both the Irish and British Governments and wants to assist in a positive way.  This goes to the heart of the administration; President Clinton and Vice-President Gore are personally engaged with the Department of State and others and we welcome their involvement.  At this stage the question is not &ldquo;whether&rdquo; but when and how it can be done.  I hope, with an awareness of the complexities and difficulties involved, that the issue of decommissioning can be dealt with in a practical way.  While it is an important part it is not the whole picture.  The peace process is not a single item agenda.  It is important that we find a way to resolve the difficulties and I am confident that they will be.  The determination of both the British Government and Sinn Féin to engage in dialogue will assist in breaking the impasse and I hope this will happen within a short period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihan" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the fact that the Minister has expressed the view that the intervention of a third country or international agency at a certain stage might be a suitable way to break the logjam.  Without prejudice to the continuation of talks on many political fronts in the development of the peace process, does the Minister agree that such intervention by a third country or an international agency should be advanced up the scale of priorities and that the decommissioning of arms and demilitarisation should form part of a confidence-building measure to allow the British and Irish Governments to proceed with political talks?  The two should run parallel rather than have a logjam.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is not just a matter of decommissioning terrorist arms, that 4,000 RUC reservists and a number of others in Northern Ireland hold weapons legally for their own protection which are not under the control of the RUC and that this presents a further complication?  In addition, there is a need to discuss the concept of demilitarisation with a view to reducing the number of arms to reduce tension. Does the Minister agree that this is not a simple matter of saying to the paramilitary groups that they should commence a decommissioning process, that it would be much better at this stage to try to persuade the British Government that it would be a good idea to ask an international agency to consider the question of decommissioning and demilitarisation and that this could proceed while the two Governments proceed with political business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the lessons of history is that nothing is simple when it <Col N="946" /> comes to Northern Ireland.  The precise arrangements for the decommissioning of arms are a matter for discussion between the relevant parties.  The question of a role for third parties may be a matter for discussion down the road. That would be my preference as I see a role for third parties assisting the process. On the other hand, there will be many tracks.  For instance, discussions will have to take place on the questions of policing, the new assembly, the framework documents, relations between North and South and between east and west, which we should do everything we can to encourage.</P>
      <P>On the question of arms in Northern Ireland, tragically it has been a violent society with a difficult history from the 1920s.  In that respect the South has had a privileged existence; we have been able to maintain an unarmed police force and I hope this will continue.  With the threat of violence reduced &mdash; and I hope removed from the equation &mdash; this will present an opportunity for all sides to ensure that arms held legally and illegally are taken out of commission. Many arms are held because of the threat of violence.  I hope, with the removal of the threat of violence, arms can be taken out of circulation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Noting that Mr. Adams is reported as saying he has lost confidence in Mr. Major, will the Tánaiste accept that this is a very delicate period in which the British Government should be encouraged to take that ultimate step?  Like my colleagues, I agree the debate should be as broad as possible and that we should not get bogged down on the issue of decommissioning. Does the Tánaiste agree with Prime Minister Major's reported statement to the US Senate Majority Leader, Mr. Bob Dole, that the deadlock over talks could be resolved in a matter of days? When does the Tánaiste believe the deadlock can be resolved so that we can move on to the next vital stage in the process?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the latter part of Deputy Kitt's question, I am not aware of statements emanating from the British Prime Minister in Washington but obviously I would welcome any positive indications from him along the lines suggested by the Deputy.  If he is saying that the logjam can be resolved in a matter of days, that is encouraging and we will certainly do all we can to ensure that happens.  In relation to Mr. Adams expressing a lack of confidence in John Major, I do not recall Mr. Adams ever saying he had confidence in Mr. Major.  The reality is that they have to deal with one another.  Hopefully, the British Government under Mr. Major, will see fit to have meetings at ministerial level with Sinn Féin.  As far as I am concerned, the war is over.  Sinn Féin wants to be involved in dialogue and inclusive negotiations.  They have a role to play and we should do everything we can to facilitate that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the Tánaiste's statement that he believes the war is over, will he not agree that the decommissioning issue is the last card for militant republicans?  That is why it is the issue it is last to cede and, for that reason, great care must be taken to move it along in parallel with the other issues.  People must not be forced to suspend their critical faculties on this issue.  To move it along in a balanced way, we must not be afraid to express reservations or healthy cynicism, where appropriate, when it comes to dealing with Sinn Féin.</P>

      <P>I would not want the Deputy to believe that we were submerging our critical faculties in relation to this difficult situation.  We must be positive and flexible and must encourage both sides to try to resolve the difficulties that exist.  I believe we can overcome those difficulties and I want to put it firmly on the record that the Government is fully committed to the removal of all paramilitary weapons.  We have <Col N="948" /> said that publicly and we want that done.  There are many cards to be played before this process is ultimately brought to a conclusion.  One of the great achievements of recent years is that we have set out to bring as many people as possible with us, right across the divide, because ultimately we must reach a solution that has cross-community support.  On the basis of the Framework Document and other documents on the table, there is a prospect of having such cross-community support for a resolution of the conflict in Northern Ireland for the first time ever.</P>

These forms will be available at airports and successful applicants will have an appropriate stamp placed on their passports and a portion of the application form stapled into them for inspection by officials in the US.

      <P>Yes, and I have said many times that we are grateful to the Ambassador and her staff for their approach to this matter.  Of course, that does not exclude difficulties that arise from time to time, of which we have all had experience.  There is no guarantee, under the new scheme, that every applicant for a visa will be granted entry to the US.  Immigration officials at Dublin, Shannon, Kerry International Airport or any airport from which people are departing have the power to refuse entry to the US if they are not satisfied about a person's bona fides.  In that respect, it probably would be better if they exercised that power rather than it being exercised at Kennedy Airport on the other side of the Atlantic.  That is a matter for the judgement of the US officials but I hope, in the spirit of the new programme, we will have few, if any, problems with it.</P>

      <P>The Tánaiste stated that 90 per cent of people will no longer require visas but that means that 10 per cent will be refused.  The average jumbo jet carries 350 people, therefore 35 of them will be left standing at the visa check-in area.  In view of the possibility of a refusal, is the Tánaiste recommending that people continue to apply for US visas prior to their departure in order to have peace of mind or is he recommending that they use the new waiver programme, which I very much welcome?  It is a very good scheme but I believe difficulties will arise with it in future and it is as well to be aware of them at this stage.</P>

It is a simple procedure and I hope that most applicants who want to travel to the US, in the spirit of the procedures of the last number of years, will be successful and that Deputies will not have to deal with the problems that arose about five or six years ago.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Quesions Nos. 29 and 63 together.</P>
      <P>The incident referred to by the Deputy involved an unauthorised crossing into this jurisdiction by an RUC vehicle and a British helicopter.  The circumstances were described in detail by the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell, when replying to an Adjourment Debate on this issue on 2 March last. Following that incident, the matter was raised through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat and an explanation sought.  The British authorities responded that the crossings were unauthorised and expressed regret for what had occurred.</P>
      <P>The British authorities are well aware of our view that unauthorised crossings are unacceptable and have indicated that such incidents are contrary to the instructions issued to the security forces.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that this was not the usual type of Border incursion that happens day in, day out; it was at least three to four miles into the Republic, the helicopter had to fly over a broad wooded area and the RUC vehicle had to travel a circuitous route to get to the area at which it was apprehended?  It was only when local people informed the RUC they were in the Republic that they left.  Will the Minister accept there was no question of the usual excuse that it was a map reading error?  Will he confirm it is the Government's view that this type of incident should not happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The British side confirmed this was an unauthorised crossing and expressed regret in that regard. To the best of my knowledge the Government position has not changed from that of the previous Government and the Government before that.  The Deputy mentioned three to four miles of an incursion, but I understand the RUC vehicle had travelled two miles inside our jurisdiction, although geographically it was about half a kilometre from the Border.  The British accepted that these crossings should not occur <Col N="953" /> and has taken steps to avoid a recurrence. We must ensure that the steps we take to prevent incidents of this kind, even if isolated, are adequate in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>My information is that the negotiations between Bhutan and Nepal concerning the southern Bhutanese refugees are continuing.  I am aware that the meeting, which took place in Katmandu from 27 February to 2 March 1995, between Ministers from Bhutan and Nepal, discussed the situation of the refugees but showed no signs of progress. However, both sides agreed that the next meeting will take place during the month of April.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the reports by Amnesty International on the refugees' situation.  I am aware that the Working Group on Arbitrary Detention of the UN Commission on Human Rights has visited Bhutan and expressed concerns about the National Security Act, 1992, to the authorities there.  It is worth noting that the Government of Bhutan agreed to consider the proposals made to it by the UN Working Group which has welcomed that reaction.  Although the talks between the Governments of Bhutan and Nepal have not broken down, I am aware how reticent the Government of Bhutan is about accepting the return of most of the refugees.  The Irish Government, together with its partners in the European Union, will continue to follow those negotiations closely.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31 and 55 together.</P>
      <P>I have received the correspondence to which Deputy Molloy refers as well as a further letter dated 7 March 1995. Members of the family have been in contact with my Department and with the Embassy in London at different times since December 1985.  As I said in response to a written question from Deputy Killeen on 23 March, I am aware of doubts and unanswered questions in the minds of the family, for whom I have a great deal of sympathy.</P>
      <P>This case involves a number of complex issues which are essentially matters of law for clarification by solicitors and, if necessary, by the courts.  I understand that the family are being given legal aid in Britain in order to pursue their concerns. At the request of the family, the Embassy in London wrote to the Home Office last November asking that the family's questions be investigated. There has also been correspondence recently between the Embassy and the solicitors now dealing with the case.  My Department and the Embassy in London will continue to co-operate with the solicitors and the family and to maintain contact with the Home Office.</P>
      <P>Officials of the Department are meeting family members again today and the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, has also offered to meet them.  If my personal involvement is likely to be of assistance, I will certainly consider meeting the family.</P>

I welcome the fact that the Minister of State is prepared to meet the family, but if the Minister would devote some of his time to meeting them it would be much appreciated by this side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I informed this House in answer to a parliamentary question on 18 October that, during my visit to China last September, I met vice-President and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen and raised with him the question of human rights and the treatment of prisoners in Tibet.</P>
      <P>The Irish delegation to the UN Commission on Human Rights &mdash; CHR &mdash; which took place in Geneva from 30 January to 10 March 1995 played an active role in drafting a proposed resolution on Human Rights in China and ensured that appropriate reference to the situation in Tibet was included in the text.  The draft resolution, which Ireland co-sponsored, highlighted how intolerable is the situation for Tibetans, for their ethnic identity, their religious freedom and their own language and culture.</P>
      <P>It is significant that this year the CHR came much closer to adopting the draft resolution than at previous sessions.  As in previous years, China moved a no-action motion but this was the first year in which it was unsuccessful.  Members of the EU voted against China's no-action motion.  As a result, the draft resolution was taken and it was defeated by only a single vote.  China always campaigns strongly against the tabling of this draft resolution.  I know that this outcome constitutes an important message from the international community to the Chinese Government concerning its treatment of the people of Tibet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Representatives of EU embassies in Beijing visited Tibet last November and made clear EU concerns about the <Col N="957" /> human rights situation there.  They once again raised with the authorities the list of prisoners which had been presented by the EU ambassadors when they visited Tibet in May 1993 and also handed over a list of 14 nuns who had been arrested.  I understand that a small number of Tibetian political prisoners have been released but the situation of political prisoners in Tibet remains an issue of great concern.</P>

      <P>On 1 November last, President Clinton announced a package of measures to assist in the consolidation of the peace process, including the holding of a White House Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland.  This conference, in which the President will participate, will take place in Washington on 24-26 May and will provide a unique forum to show the exceptional attractions of Ireland, North and South, as an investment location.  It will help to give practical expression to the strong US support for the peace process.</P>
      <P>In his statement of 1 November the President also stated that, in addition to a planned commitment of $20 million to the International Fund in 1995, the Administration would seek congressional approval for an additional $10 million for the fund in 1996 and 1997, that is, for a total of $30 million each year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that this approval will be forthcoming and that Congress will be willing to give this further tangible signal of US support for the peace process.

      <P>The Finance Bill is usually published when the Dáil is in session.  Will the Taoiseach give an assurance to the Opposition that the usual practice of briefing Opposition spokespersons and making copies of the Bill available will be followed, even though the House will be in recess?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is almost in order, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the Taoiseach <Col N="1052" /> might be helpful and reply to the question.</P>
    <P>As regards those who suffered as a result of flooding and have received forms and been told of the various procedures to follow, will the Taoiseach consider providing them professional assistance directly or through some agency such as the Red Cross, quite a number of whom contacted my colleagues? The questions are quite difficult and the procedures complicated. Rather than getting into a political wrangle about the matter it would be helpful if professional people could assist the flood victims in submitting applications.</P>

    <Title>Report of Sub-Committee of Select Committee on Legislation and Security: Statements.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make the opening statement on the report of the sub-committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security which investigated the circumstances surrounding the fall of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Partnership Government.  The background to our work was unusual to say the least.  What was widely considered to be an excellent Government fell in mid-term because of disagreement over a relatively routine matter, namely the appointment of a new President of the High Court.  The fact that the crisis emerged within a few months of the Northern Ireland ceasefire, undoubtedly the greatest political breakthrough on this island over the last 25 years, added to the general sense of disbelief and shock.</P>
      <P>As the crisis developed during November last, the need for openness, transparency and accountability was frequently highlighted.  When asked to chair this investigation I was determined from the outset that these characteristics would be adopted in the running of the sub-committee.  Consequently, despite certain dangers, I adhered to two particular principles when chairing the various sessions.  First, every effort was made to allow each witness make as complete a statement as he or she considered necessary, no time limit was placed on statements.  Second, members of the sub-committee were allowed pose questions and pursue lines of investigation to the fullest possible degree.  A number of operational procedures were adopted at the outset, which I believe contributed greatly to the efficient running of the inquiry.  If time permits I will briefly mention some of these procedures at the end of the statements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to express my sincere thanks to a number of participants in our work.  I would like to warmly thank <Col N="1060" /> my colleagues on the sub-committee for their outstanding co-operation at all times during the proceedings.  In many instances they had to develop a line of questioning within minutes of hearing evidence.  I strongly recommend that in future investigations of this type statements should be made available at least a few hours before presentation.  I would like to express both thanks and admiration for the witnesses who appeared before the sub-committee without legal obligation.  I would like to acknowledge the key role played by the sub-committee's secretariat, other staff of the House, particularly the broadcasting unit and our advisers.  Their assistance throughout was greatly appreciated.</P>
    <P>How and why did the crisis arise?  As I stated, most impartial observers agreed that we had an excellent partnership Government.  While the dramatic breakthrough in Northern Ireland was, without doubt, the greatest development in the lifetime of the Government, a major improvement in the State's finances was also of great importance. Furthermore, outstanding ministerial performances were a feature of the Administration with difficult and courageous decisions being made in all portfolios. In general, a positive relationship was evident between Ministers and Deputies of the two Government parties.</P>
    <P>However, despite all the progress, co-operation and mutual respect, the Government suddenly ran into serious trouble on the appointment of a new President of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Has the inquiry helped us to understand why the crisis arose?  A number of issues have been clarified.  The process by which Mr. Whelehan was appointed President of the High Court on 11 November 1994 is now largely undisputed. It began with Mr. Whelehan expressing an interest in the post to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  Deputy Reynolds expressed his personal support for Mr. Whelehan.  Deputy Reynolds's research into the matter of precedent in the appointment of the <Col N="1061" /> Attorney General directly as President of the High Court might possibly have been more comprehensive.  A binding precedent in the case of the presidency of the High Court might have led to the current presence of Chief Justice Rogers in the Supreme Court; this of course did not happen when the presidency of the High Court last became vacant in 1984.  Rather than appointing the Attorney General of the day, Mr. Rogers, directly as President of the High Court, a senior judge of the court, now Chief Justice Hamilton, was appointed.</P>
    <P>The initial reaction of Deputy Spring to Mr. Whelehan's interest was not very encouraging.  Subsequently, his public position on the matter seemed, if anything, to harden.  During his contribution to the Dáil on 16 November 1994 Deputy Spring identified Mr. Whelehan's lack of judicial and administrative experience as particular reasons for his opposition to the appointment.  Nobody would dispute that, as Tánaiste, he was totally entitled to have such views, irrespective of their validity or fairness to Mr. Whelehan.  Significantly, however, for the fate of the partnership Government, Deputy Spring failed to take either of two vital steps during the growing controversy up to 11 November 1994.  First, he did not state publicly the precise reasons for his objection to Mr. Whelehan's appointment as President of the High Court.  Second, he did not take what would appear to have been the logical step, given his strong personal views on the matter, of vetoing the appointment.  It is almost certain that either of those initiatives would have brought the matter to an end and saved both the Government and Mr. Whelehan from subsequent developments. However, it must also be accepted that Deputy Spring hardly could be publicly critical of Mr. Whelehan while the latter was Attorney General.</P>
    <P>From the evidence it is clear that most people, including Deputy Albert Reynolds, the then Taoiseach, considered the matter settled when the Cabinet sub-committee arrived at an agreement.  When the Courts and Court <Col N="1062" /> Officers Bill was drafted in retrospect, it seems clear, that Deputy Reynolds should have appointed Mr. Whelehan immediately as President of the High Court.  While his sensitivity to Deputy Spring's predicament was admirable, it was not politically wise.  Similarly, his agreement to various requests for postponement of the appointment ultimately paid an extremely poor dividend. By the time the Cabinet met on the fateful Friday events had been complicated further by the Fr. Brendan Smyth case.</P>
    <P>In attempting to assess the remainder of those events, it is important to note two issues of particular relevance. Undoubtedly there was a serious difference of opinion within the Labour Party on the desirability of being involved in the partnership Government.  In general Ministers seemed very committed to that Administration while a number of other influential figures within the party perceived membership of Government as a political liability.  The latter perception was understandable in that the Labour Party had made an historic breakthrough in the 1992 general election and had played a key role in the ensuing excellent Government.  Nevertheless, the Labour Party did not appear to be reaping political benefit from the partnership arrangement.  Its performance in the European elections and various by-elections and a range of opinion polls pointed to the definite possibility of the Labour Party losing rather than gaining seats at the next general election.  As the presidency of the High Court developed into a public issue, Deputy Spring was being pulled in two different directions, rendering the then Government extremely vulnerable in a crisis.</P>
    <P>The second point to be remembered from this series of events was the fact that the Opposition parties were in an extremely poor position to pressurise the then Government.  The prospect of at least another seven to eight years on the Opposition benches seemed quite probable.  Since the then Government was performing exceptionally well with regard to Northern Ireland and our economy, the only realistic prospect of <Col N="1063" /> undermining it rested with the identification and exploitation of inter-Fianna Fáil-Labour disputes on smaller issues. The emergence of the presidency of the High Court and the complication of the Fr. Brendan Smyth case afforded such an opportunity.  Not surprisingly, the Opposition parties made the most of the chance handed to them.</P>
    <P>I have two comments to make on the Friday Cabinet meeting at which Mr. Whelehan was appointed President of the High Court.  Perhaps Deputy Reynolds, the then Taoiseach, should have been more sensitive to Deputy Spring's request for postponement of the appointment in the aftermath of the Labour Party's very disappointing performance in the two Cork by-elections.</P>
    <P>My second comment relates to the request by the Labour Party to have the appointment deferred until the Taoiseach had answered questions in this House the following Tuesday.  From his report it was absolutely clear that Mr. Whelehan had no knowledge of the Fr. Brendan Smyth case while it awaited processing in his office, due to the administrative procedures in place in the office of the Attorney General on the management of extradition cases. The only matter for which Mr. Whelehan could be held responsible was that such an administrative deficiency existed.  Further questions regarding the Fr. Smyth case would have done nothing to clarify the matter.  The core issue to be addressed was whether Mr. Whelehan's failure to deal with the administrative problem in his office was sufficiently serious to affect his suitability to be appointed President of the High Court.  The presence of the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and Mr. Whelehan at the Friday Cabinet meeting should have made it possible to deal with that dilemma immediately.</P>
    <P>The events of the following Saturday and Sunday are largely self-explanatory. However, the request to the new Attorney General, Mr. Fitzsimons, to undertake a full examination of the Fr. <Col N="1064" /> Brendan Smyth file, can be interpreted only as indicating a determination on the part of the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, to obtain as much information as possible on the issue for the forthcoming Dáil sitting.</P>
    <P>Having examined all the evidence relating to the period from Monday, 14 November 1994 to the fall of the Government on Wednesday, 16 November 1994, I am certain none of the participants was involved in deliberate wrongdoings.  I found Deputy McCreevy's evidence extremely convincing in terms of illustrating there had been no deliberate attempt to mislead the Dáil. While freely admitting the preoccupation of Fianna Fáil Ministers with maintaining the Government, Deputy McCreevy clearly indicated also that Mr. Fitzsimons's legal viewpoints had little impact on himself or on his Fianna Fáil colleagues.  Similarly, the evidence of Mr. Tim Dalton, Secretary of the Department of Justice, clearly illustrates the honourable intention of the Minister for Justice, Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn, to inform the House about the possible relevance of the Duggan case.</P>
    <P>Equally I am certain many mistakes were made during that very pressured time.  While one could comment at length on the evidence of all participants in the inquiry, five witnesses emerged as having played a key role in the overall controversy &mdash; the then Taoiseach and Tánaiste, Deputies Reynolds and Spring, Messrs.  Whelehan, Fitzsimons and Russell.  In the course of a very forthright and impressive contribution to the subcommittee Mr. Russell presented in detail the background to the delay in the Fr. Smyth case.  While I remain convinced the delay was excessive and should not have occurred in any circumstance, it is only fair to acknowledge Mr. Russell's frankness and his admission of responsibility. Another important matter to be noted was the substantially increased workload placed on the staff in the Attorney General's Office.  Too often staffing levels in key offices of State are reviewed very infrequently, usually whenever a <Col N="1065" /> serious problem arises.  Despite the lapse in the processing of the Fr. Smyth case, the evidence given to the subcommittee suggests that the former Attorney General, Mr. Whelehan, Mr. Russell and their staff gave full, committed service to the State which should be acknowledged.  It must be accepted also that the administrative shortcomings identified in that office, together with the inadequate application of computer technology, have been addressed in the interim, so that a delay of the magnitude which occurred in the Fr. Smyth case certainly will not recur.</P>
    <P>Overall the episode has not been kind to Mr. Whelehan.  While he may have been criticised by some people for having approached the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, regarding possible appointment to the presidency of the High Court, it would seem only reasonable that he should have done so in the context of having already refused other judicial appointments.  Silence on his part might have been interpreted as lack of interest.  Similarly, he was criticised for not having withdrawn his candidature once it had become a controversial issue.  The matter was by no means clear cut.  Had he withdrawn his candidature a reasonable implication would have been that he was unfit in some way to serve in such a position which would have made his occupancy of the office of Attorney General virtually untenable.</P>
    <P>While Mr. Whelehan's refusal on the Monday evening to postpone his swearing-in ceremony could be portrayed as insensitive to the politician who had appointed him President of the High Court, the misleading information he, Mr. Whelehan, has received in terms of the religious status of Mr. Duggan undoubtedly influenced his judgment <i>vis-à-vis</i> the necessity for such a postponement. Therefore, it is my opinion Mr. Whelehan served the country honourably and effectively as Attorney General and certainly was not deserving of the personal attacks he was forced to endure between autumn and mid-November 1994.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> Similarly, I have no doubt that the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, behaved honourably during the crisis.  While he might be blamed for his early endorsement of the candidature of Mr. Whelehan and his political failure to anticipate the reaction of the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, to the appointment of Mr. Whelehan, there were a number of mitigating factors.  For example, he had been successfully leading an excellent Government, having had some outstanding recent achievements. Perhaps he could be excused for having expected a greater degree of tolerance on the part of his Government partner on this matter.  In my opinion Deputy Reynolds was absolutely correct not to have mentioned the Duggan case in his Tuesday speech in the House because its potential implications were too great for its introduction without absolute written confirmation by the new Attorney General.  In fact Deputy Reynolds could rightly have been criticised had he detailed the Duggan case on the Tuesday.</P>
    <P>On Wednesday, 16 November 1994, Deputy Reynolds strongly criticised Mr. Whelehan because of the omission of a reference to the Duggan case in his report to the Cabinet, based largely on a text supplied by Mr. Fitzsimons and the Labour Party.  With the benefit of hindsight, since those specific criticisms were advanced in an attempt to bestow a grossly exaggerated importance on the relevance of the Duggan case, they were extremely unfair to Mr. Whelehan. Deputy Reynolds honourably expressed regret in that regard when giving evidence to the subcommittee.  The fact that Deputy Reynolds left those comments in his speech, even when the agreement with Deputy Spring had broken down, is another clear indication of the integrity of his behaviour throughout those events.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, played a key role throughout.  It goes without saying that he was perfectly entitled to have his own opinion regarding the <Col N="1067" /> appointment of a new President of the High Court.  Indeed, as a member of the legal profession, it would have been surprising if he had not taken such a keen interest in the matter.  When considering his performance throughout the controversy, one must take into account the strongly differing opinions within his own party in relation to the partnership Government.</P>
    <P>The impact of these conflicting pressures showed clearly on at least four occasions.  First, despite his personal lack of support for the appointment of Mr. Whelehan to the presidency of the High Court, he refrained from actually vetoing the appointment.  Second, his withdrawal from Cabinet, followed by his offer of resignation to his ministerial colleagues, clearly showed his ongoing uncertainty regarding the issue.  The manner in which he agreed to go back into Government on the Wednesday morning also seemed to lack conviction. Finally, having decided to withdraw his agreement shortly afterwards, his refusal to listen to Deputy Reynolds's explanation for the delay in referring to the Duggan case clearly reflected the level of conflicting pressures which were being brought to bear on Deputy Spring.</P>
    <P>The then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, and the Tánaiste had only recently played an historic joint role in restoring peace to Northern Ireland.  In anything approaching normal circumstances, one would expect that the Tánaiste would have shown a far greater degree of willingness to at least listen to Deputy Reynolds.</P>
    <P>The general sense of uncertainty within the Labour Party during the crisis is probably best illustrated by the comments of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, at the conclusion of the final fateful meeting on the Wednesday. The general thrust of Deputy Spring and the Labour Ministers' position was that Deputy Reynolds' failure to mention the Duggan case in his Tuesday speech made it impossible for the party to remain in Government under his <Col N="1068" /> leadership.  Nevertheless, the clear message conveyed by Deputy Quinn's comment was that the partnership might be saved if Mr. Whelehan was removed from the presidency of the High Court.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fitzsimons was the central figure in the events of 14-16 November 1994. Before assessing his role, it is important to fully accept the difficulty of his position. A highly respected member of the Bar, he had what can only be described as a baptism of fire on his first full day as Attorney General.  His performance proved to be critical in the overall matter. In particular, his insistence on the importance of the Duggan case provided the defining issue on which the fate of the Government was eventually sealed.  There is no evidence to suggest that Mr. Fitzsimons acted in anything other than an honourable manner throughout.  However, his inexperience of the political environment, combined with his failure to keep working notes, probably contributed to the large number of instances in which his evidence seems to be a source of disagreement.  I will outline some relevant examples.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fitzsimons stated in his evidence that he met Mr. Barrett &mdash; Official C &mdash; on Monday morning.  Mr. Barrett indicated that the meeting took place on Tuesday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Mr. Fitzsimons disagreed with practically all Fianna Fáil Ministers regarding the request from Deputy Reynolds for a definitive report. Yet he supplied two reports to Deputy Reynolds on Tuesday: one prepared by Mr. Hamilton in the morning and another prepared by himself in the afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Fitzsimons rang Mr. Whelehan on the Monday afternoon to inform him of the Duggan case.  There is no evidence that he informed Deputy Reynolds of the outcome of this call but it would have been quite strange if he did not since Deputy Reynolds sent him <Col N="1069" /> on an almost identical mission later that night.  It seems extremely unlikely that Deputy Reynolds would have done so if he was aware of Mr. Whelehan's initial reaction to the Duggan case.  Mr. Fitzsimons's interpretation of his meeting with Mr. Whelehan differs substantially in terms of emphasis from that given to the sub-committee by Mr. Whelehan.</P>
    <P>When Mr. Fitzsimons communicated the existence of the Duggan case to Mr. Whelehan he seems to have introduced a serious error, namely, that Mr. Duggan was an ex-monk.  This had a profound influence on the attitude of Mr. Whelehan and, in particular, on his decision not to agree to a postponement of his swearing-in ceremony.  Mr. Whelehan felt that the fact that he had already previously extradited without delay a cleric accused of child sexual abuse clearly showed that he was not a protector of religious personnel involved in such crimes.</P>
    <P>If one takes into account Mr. Fitzsimons's worries in relation to the Dáil being misled about the Duggan case, for example, it is difficult to understand either his failure to read the draft speeches provided to him beforehand or his lack of reaction to the speech later that afternoon.</P>
    <P>I recount these examples of confusion simply to illustrate the problems of accurate recollection after a period of intense activity.  Similarly, it clearly shows the different interpretations which people can place on the same conversation.</P>
    <P>Mr. Fitzsimons disagreed with Deputy Spring in relation to the timing of their meeting on Wednesday.  Similarly, the precise nature of that conversation is unclear.  In his statement, Mr. Fitzsimons stated that he gave details of the Duggan case to Deputy Spring. However, under questioning from Deputy O'Malley, he indicated that the conversation lasted only a few minutes with the only substantive question relating to the time of Deputy Reynolds's initial awareness of the Duggan case.</P>
    <P>While Deputy Spring stated that he <Col N="1070" /> decided to speak to Mr. Fitzsimons subsequent to receiving an unexpected call, Mr. Fitzsimons stated that he was asked by the Taoiseach or Fianna Fáil Ministers to await a call from the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>One could go on and on in relation to the evidence presented in the 980 page report but, no matter how one assesses the evidence, it seems clear that the crisis originated and developed because of political mistakes and misunderstandings rather than any deliberate act of wrongdoing.  Hopefully, those who made extremely critical and hurtful comments in the immediate aftermath of the crisis will now generously set the record straight.  I believe that our Dáil committee system can and must play an increasing role in the operation of our democratic mandate.</P>

      <P>It is fairly clear that the impartial role adopted by Deputy Wallace when he was chairman of the sub-committee no longer applies and that he is now speaking in a personal capacity.  The inquiry into the events surrounding the fall of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government marked an important chapter in the development of our system of parliamentary democracy. There are those who claim the inquiry was a failure in that it did not reach conclusions on contested facts. Those who do so miss the point.</P>
      <P>The inquiry, as constituted, could not achieve more than it did.  The sub-committee could only exercise the powers delegated to it by the Dáil.  Under that order the sub-committee had power to take evidence in public and to publish the evidence in its report.  It was not given specific powers to make findings based on the evidence given to it.  That was just as well.</P>
      <P>If the sub-committee were to arbitrate on the evidence or reach conclusions which would inevitably have implications for the name or reputation of witnesses it would have had to adopt judicial or quasi-judicial procedures. Legal representation would have been inevitable and the inquiry would be continuing. The result would be another expensive useless lawyers' benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Instead we have had a fair and impartial hearing completed in record time at minimum cost.  The general public has had an insight into the events surrounding the fall of the last Government. People who tuned in to the inquiry have been informed and, indeed, entertained. I have heard no complaints on either score.  The witnesses, politicians, Attorneys General, civil servants and special advisers were given a reasonable <Col N="1072" /> opportunity to tell their story as they saw it.  The procedures we devised meant they could be questioned but in a manner and according to a formula that was &mdash; and seen to be &mdash; fair and just.</P>
    <P>The taxpayers were happy in that at long last they were getting a cost-effective procedure for an inquiry into matters of national interest.  One day's hearing at the beef tribunal swallowed up more public money than the entire cost of this committee of inquiry.  The approximate comparative figures are £35,000 as against £35 million.  For every pound spent on the inquiry £1,000 was spent on the beef tribunal.  One cannot beat the committee for value.</P>
    <P>We should be clear, therefore, on what we are debating and, in particular, on what we are not debating.  We are not discussing the judgment of a court established under the Constitution or a report from a tribunal established under the Tribunal of Inquiry Act.  The matter before the House is the report of a sub-committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security which was charged with a specific function by an order of the Dáil and which completed its work in accordance with its terms of reference and finalised a report as required by the order.  The proceedings of the inquiry and the report should be judged accordingly.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that the original proposal from the then Fianna Fáil Government on 6 December last was to appoint a person of judicial or senior legal status and to give him or her the necessary powers to summon all persons relative to the inquiry and to report back to the House.  Fortunately, that motion was defeated by 91 votes to 66 on 6 December.  If it had been adopted, I am convinced that we would still be bogged down in quasi-legal proceedings four months later.</P>
    <P>It is correct to say that the inquiry began in a somewhat inauspicious way. The original order of the Dáil was to the Select Committee rather than to a sub-committee and it was clear that the lack of agreed procedures resulted in the <Col N="1073" /> opening day in the Dáil Chamber being correctly described by a number of commentators as a &ldquo;bear garden&rdquo;.  Most people will agree that the committee was ill prepared for the work which had been delegated to it.  However, the Dáil reacted quickly, enacted the necessary legislation to provide privilege for witnesses and re-established the inquiry on the basis of a small sub-committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.</P>
    <P>It is worth recalling that the terms of reference provided for the committee to question all persons it deemed appropriate on the circumstances surrounding the appointment of the President of the High Court on Friday, 11 November 1994, the request on Sunday, 13 November for re-examination of all details of the Brendan Smyth case, the request to the President of the High Court to resign on Monday, 14 November, the draft reply and covering letter provided to the Taoiseach in advance of the Dáil debate on 15 November and the identification of all those involved in the preparation of his speech on that date.</P>
    <P>On reflection, I would very much have liked to have had a specific term of reference authorising the committee to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the seven month delay in dealing with the Brendan Smyth case in the Attorney General's office.  If I were to compile a list of faults and failings in relation to the inquiry I would put that issue at the head of the queue.  I would have preferred a specific term of reference charging the inquiry to investigate specifically that issue and, if possible, to come to a conclusion in so far as this could be done without casting aspersions on any individual.  I am dissatisfied that the inquiry failed to elicit the full story in relation the the Brendan Smyth case and, in particular, that we have not been given a specific reason for the outrageous delay in that case. Suffice it to say at this stage that I do not accept that the legal points involved were so complex that a delay of that order was justified.  Sufficient priority should also have been given in the Attorney General's office to that case to <Col N="1074" /> allow whatever investigations considered necessary to be completed in a short time.  If that had been done the case could have been dealt with and a decision made within a matter of weeks rather than months.</P>
    <P>I have the report of the review of the office of Attorney General which was published in the last few weeks.  Until recent events brought them to light, there was little understanding or appreciation of the very important work conducted in that office.  I cannot recall a full debate in the Dáil on the workings of the office of the Attorney General and, in the context of the publication of the report, the time is ripe for a full and separate debate on this issue.  I hope this can be arranged in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am not sure it is the function of this debate, or that it would be proper for conclusions to be drawn at this stage in the Dáil, on the matters of fact about which evidence was given before the committee and in respect of which the committee felt it should not express a view.  The comments that I make or conclusions that I have come to, therefore, will be very broadly based and as far as possible will not reflect in any way on individuals.  This is in contrast to the remarks made by Deputy Wallace.  As a chairman he acted in an exemplary and impartial way but, in some of his comments today, he attempted to whitewash the role of Fianna Fáil in the fall of the previous Government.</P>
    <P>It is now clear that the appointment of Harold Whelehan to the presidency of the High Court on Friday, 11 November 1994 by the Fianna Fáil component of the Cabinet was a disastrous political mistake. I do not think that anybody will dispute this.  There is no single view as to why there was such an insistence on the part of the then Taoiseach to push through that appointment.  It may have been the culmination of a series of events which gave rise to bad feeling and difficulties between Fianna Fáil and Labour.  It is clear that the beef tribunal and, in particular, the publication of the report and the manner in which it was dealt with by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Albert <Col N="1075" /> Reynolds, contributed very substantially to those difficulties.  The description of the events on the evening of the publication of the beef tribunal report on Friday, 29 July 1994 is fascinating and perhaps gives a clue as to the reasons the previous Government subsequently fell apart.</P>
    <P>There were considerable inconsistencies in relation to the evidence adduced as to what occurred in the five days following the appointment of Mr. Harold Whelehan to the presidency of the High Court on Friday, 11 November. It is not for me to adjudicate on these inconsistencies.  However, it is fair to say that the evidence of Eoghan Fitzsimons, Senior Counsel, who had been appointed Attorney General in succession to Harold Whelehan, was crystal clear and was acceptable as an utterly calm and objective recollection of the events of those days.  It was very clear that his calm and precise approach had a dramatic impact on the general public who were following the events at the inquiry.  One need not go beyond his evidence to get a basic factual account of the events of those days in so far as he had personal knowledge of them.  I strongly disagree with the comments made by Deputy Dan Wallace in that regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to the events generally leading to and culminating in the fall of the previous Government, the proceedings of the inquiry gave the general public an opportunity to judge these issues for themselves.  Effectively the inquiry was merely the medium through which light was thrown on these issues and the general public were judge and jury.  I see little point in rehashing the evidence at this stage.  The public has drawn its own conclusions.  The events leading up to last November and subsequently culminating in the change of Government are now history.</P>
    <P>There is one aspect worthy of mention. The inquiry could not have done its job in the way I have described if the media had not been involved to a remarkable degree.  There is no doubt <Col N="1076" /> that the inquiry captured the public imagination and the media responded very fully.  RTE adopted a cautious approach in not making available the proceedings, or at least some of them, in live form.  Concern about the possibility of libel might have been one of the factors giving rise to this decision at a time when there was such public demand for live broadcast.  However, the role of the media was very important in relation to the success of the inquiry.  This was particularly so in the context of the general public being judge and jury.  Acres of newsprint and many colour pieces were the regular diet of the papers at the time.  Most of the coverage was very accurate and fair. There were a few unbalanced, ill-informed and biased articles but these were very much the exception rather than the rule.  For example, Vincent Browne did not distinguish himself in some of his comments but I will say no more about that issue.</P>
    <P>There are some lessons to be drawn for the future.  New ground was broken from the point of view of effective use of Dáil committee time.  Lessons were learned initially from the lack of procedures and new ones were devised. Further lessons can be learned from the experience of the inquiry.  It is clear at this stage that we do not want a quasi-court system, neither do we want a committee system modelled on the type of witch-hunt proceedings which took place at the Senator Joe McCarthy hearings on unAmerican activities in the 1950s.  We want reform which will ensure that the various organs of the State and holders of high office are more answerable and accountable to the Legislature.  We need to ensure that the powers of the Dáil and its committees to investigate matters of serious concern are extended in a balanced way.</P>
    <P>In developing the committee inquiry system we should therefore be clear that we are not trying to establish a substitute for court proceedings.  It is not really appropriate in our system to have additional courts of justice or tribunals to adjudicate on questions of fact and <Col N="1077" /> in particular where people's good name and reputation may be impugned.  At the same time we should accept in the future that, where committee inquiries are being conducted, an adjudication on the facts in so far as individuals are concerned is not the expected outcome. Another possibility for consideration is an extension of the role of the legal adviser to the committee.  In other jurisdictions the committee Counsel has an investigative role and can produce a report to the committee which is then acted on by it.  The American system is renowned for this approach.  It would be a useful exercise to have that system examined in more detail to see the parallels that could be drawn here.  Our constitutional requirements and restrictions could have a limiting effect on possible investigative activity by committee Counsel.</P>
    <P>Such problems would not arise in all cases.  For example, the privilege and compellability Bill which will give committees the power to compel the attendance of witnesses and provide for privilege and immunity in respect of their evidence should be completed as soon as possible and debated in the Oireachtas.  The new Select Committee on Legislation and Security should now conduct an objective examination of the procedures which were developed and the process involved in the inquiry just completed.  I emphasise that such an examination should not be related to the substantive issues, but rather to the process and the procedures.  I am a believer that, in the cold light of day in the absence of emotion and tension, there is a better chance of dispassionate examination of such procedures leading to sensible recommendations for improvement.  Furthermore, information should be obtained from other jurisdictions as to how inquiries are conducted there and lessons drawn from that experience.</P>
    <P>My views as to the future are that more thought should be put into the framing of the terms of reference of any such an inquiry.  All witnesses should be asked to submit statements in advance <Col N="1078" />&mdash; it was unfair that some witnesses had the benefit of hearing the evidence of others before completing their statements. Any such opening statements should be submitted in advance to the legal adviser to check their relevance; one statement submitted to the recent inquiry contained matters which were in breach of Cabinet confidentiality. Evidence in this type of inquiry should not be given on oath.  There should be more flexibility in the questioning of witnesses.  Overall there should not be an expectation that any such inquiry is a substitute for a court process.  The cost-effective approach of the recent inquiry should be followed as far as possible.</P>
    <P>What happened last November involved a breakdown in trust between Fianna Fáil and Labour.  The approximate causes were not necessarily the real causes of the breakdown.  The inquiry which we conducted with relatively narrow terms of reference was not able to give detailed or authoritative adjudication on these matters &mdash; perhaps just as well.  On the other hand, the inquiry performed a very useful role where the general public was concerned. It will be seen to have been even more useful if, in the future, we draw on the lessons and experiences of that inquiry, in particular from the point of view of process and procedures.</P>

      <P>I compliment the sub-committee and its chairman, Deputy Wallace, on the very comprehensive job it carried out.  It is generally agreed that the work of the committee shed considerable additional light on events of last November, which led to the fall of the last Government and the background to them.  Rarely have the proceedings of any sub-committee of this House attracted such intense public interest.  The commentators on public affairs and the political scientists were also well satisfied in terms of insights into some of the workings of Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee did an excellent job. While it showed that events had proceeded in a somewhat confused manner <Col N="1079" /> in an atmosphere of political crisis, there was no evidence to substantiate rumours of dark conspiracies or allegations of deception.  The State has not been rocked to its foundations, no doubt much to some people's disappointment.</P>
    <P>The method adopted for investigating these events was a matter of controversy when the legislation went through the Dáil.  The committee worked well as a means of investigating events, through hearing and cross-examining witnesses with free and unimpeded access to all relevant documentation, but it was right not to attempt to draw conclusions.</P>
    <P>It would be a very unhappy state of affairs if a committee of the House were to take it upon itself to act in a quasi-judicial manner, delivering verdicts and distributing blame.  Unlike the Judiciary, Members of the House do not normally claim to be impartial.  Judgments would inevitably have the partisan colour of a political majority at any time.  It is right for public opinion to be the jury and make up its mind in the light of all the considerations put before it, as to whether the fall of the last Government was really necessary and whether it could not have been put together again.</P>
    <P>It has been asked if the beef tribunal could have been conducted by a Dáil Committee at a fraction of the cost? Perhaps some of the political allegations relating to Government actions could have been so investigated, but questions of alleged fraud and malpractices in the beef industry would probably have been beyond the resources of this House to investigate, and outside parties would have felt they lacked adequate legal protection.  The sub-committee worked in this instance, becauses all the witnesses were either Ministers, former Ministers, Attorneys General, senior civil servants or advisers, the lawyers remained in the background.</P>
    <P>What the beef tribunal and the sub-committee had in common, however, was that they were both established to investigate potentially serious charges of political wrongdoing against <Col N="1080" /> members of my party.  For many years, the enemies and rivals of Fianna Fáil, inside and outside the Dáil, have been vainly on the look-out for a major scandal that would confirm their prejudices and suspicions and prove their case about the political culture of Fianna Fáil, to use another expression of Deputy Rabbitte's.  The politicisation of problems in the beef industry is turning out to be expensive for the country, with the tribunal costing £30 million to £35 million to run and its report leading to a £75 million fine by the European Union, with possibly more to come, a bill which, according to the Minister, Deputy Yates, may fall to be paid by the taxpayer.  The extra few million in taxes owed will not go very far to cover these costs.  The law of the land is there to investigate and prosecute fraud, wherever it exists, without political impediment. Administrative practices have been tightened up in consultation with the European Union.  If there is one matter on which we are all agreed it is that there must be a better way of dealing with such issues in the future.</P>
    <P>The sub-committee was established in highly unusual circumstances.  The Government was in a minority in the House and the sub-committee was pushed through by the Opposition majority.  One must wonder whether this Government with a majority, and assuming it remains united, would subject itself to this type of inquiry, however much circumstances might call for it.  We all have a vivid memory of one of the most disgraceful episodes in this House, 11 years ago, when Irish Shipping was closed down in scandalous circumstances and the Minister of the time, Deputy Jim Mitchell, refused to appear before a Dáil committee and forbade any of his officials to appear.</P>
    <P>That was the level of openness, transparency and accountability the last time Fine Gael and Labour were in Government together.  I would not automatically assume things would be radically different today and it would be wrong to draw such conclusions from the establishment of this sub-committee in <Col N="1081" /> very unusual political circumstances. Members of the public looking forward to an early repeat are likely to be disappointed.</P>
    <P>What precipitated the political crisis of last November was a serious political misjudgment perhaps brought about by a degree of mutual exasperation.  As I said in my evidence, we wanted to be finished with a saga that had run on for too long.  I have no hesitation in saying that the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government was an excellent Government, which helped to bring about peace in Ireland and which had a fine record of economic and social achievement.  Since early 1993 the Labour Party was subjected to fairly constant unfair harassment inside and outside the Dáil, purely and simply because it had decided to break with precedent and to go into Government with Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Now that Labour are in the rainbow, all is quiet on the western front.  One does not hear any more about Labour Party programme managers, since Fine Gael, with cynical and breathtaking opportunism and Democratic Left, have hastened to embrace them.  One does not hear much about the Government jet, because the present Opposition is not as politically childish as were Fine Gael were about necessary Government business.</P>

      <P>I even believe that the Tánaiste could now safely return to the Waldorf-Astoria in New York and, in all probability, nobody in the media would criticise him.  Nevertheless, the peace and quiet purchased by the Labour Party by abandoning its partnership with Fianna Fáil, in the longer run, may also have a political price attached.  Labour did not do so well in last June's by-elections or the November ones in Cork.  The leadership believed they <Col N="1082" /> were not getting the credit for their good work in Government which created a serious political problem for them.</P>
      <P>Modern Coalition politics has become intensely competitive, in a way that is not good for the stability or cohesion of any Government, and which distracts from concentration on the main problems in hand.  We have seen a recent example of that with the competitive leaks over the budget, which led to the resignation of a junior Minister.</P>
      <P>In the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition of the 1980s, the two parties largely cancelled each other out.  Government was a zero-sum game, where if one party gained the other lost.  We had our own experience with the Progressive Democrats, when we had Government by ultimatum, with the Progressive Democrats asserting themselves by threatening to pull out of Government on at least half a dozen occasions.</P>
      <P>The Partnership Government with Labour was a much more positive experience.  Ministers worked well together.  Unfortunately, as time went by, there was a deterioration in the relations between the two leaders, where perhaps most of the political competitiveness was focused, and to which the rest of us did not pay enough attention.  This manifested itself in the battle of political wills that developed over the appointment to the presidency of the High Court, which was not an issue that had the intrinsic importance to bring down a Government.  Tough negotiating positions are often the stuff of politics, but nobody believed, particularly in the aftermath of the ceasefires, that the issue would be pushed over the brink on either side.  That it was, even after we believed it had been defused, provides an object lesson for everyone in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was not an issue that should ever have gone in to the public domain, a compromise would have been much easier, if it had not.  The derogatory briefing of the former Taoiseach, when he was away in Australia, poisoned the altmosphere, some of the circumstances <Col N="1083" /> of which represented a serious breach of trust.  An agreement of understanding was later negotiated, but Fianna Fáil did not, out of consideration for its partner, press home quickly its political advantage. Machiavelli's advice to the Prince was ignored.  Mr. John Rogers in his evidence testified about the continued personal opposition of the Tánaiste to Mr. Whelehan's appointment on 20 October, three days before the delays in the Fr. Brendan Smyth case were brought to public notice in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  On the other hand, it could be fairly said that the Fianna Fáil side of the Government failed to see that the delays in the Fr. Brendan Smyth case involving very emotive child sexual abuse by an adult in a position of trust weakened the case for proceeding regardless with an appointment with which the Labour leadership was deeply unhappy.  There was of course an agreement, but it is not always wise to demand one's pound of flesh.  I also think in general that people proposed for a public appointment to which they feel they have a strong claim nevertheless, should, decline gracefully if their appointment will cause great public controversy or even a serious Governmental crisis.  It is too late to step down when all the damage is done.</P>
    <P>The concept behind the Partnership Government, which I played a key part in negotiating in December 1992, was that decisions would be made by the parties in Government by agreement or consensus.  Even though we believed we had a prior agreement, the implementation of which was continually being put off, it was still a serious matter to force through a decision against the will, and in the absence, of the Labour Ministers.</P>
    <P>This caused a very serious breach, but did not warrant or necessitate the break-up of the Government.  Indeed with the peace process only two and a half months old, it was gravely irresponsible to let the Government fall apart, even if in the event the peace has held steady.  To be fair to Labour Ministers, <Col N="1084" /> they strove hard to put the Government together again, but in the end their influence did not count for very much.</P>
    <P>In the efforts to hold the Government together, and the events over the weeks from 14 November to 6 December 1994, the Duggan case came to assume extraordinary and unmerited significance.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice asked the new Attorney General to review the files before the Taoiseach went into the Dáil to explain the handling of the Fr. Brendan Smyth case.  The new Attorney presented to Ministers a previous case, which appeared to undermine one of the reasons given by his predecessor for the delay.  The trouble was, as every Minister has testifed, the case was complex and not clearcut.  It is clear from the evidence to the tribunal that the Duggan case had little intrinsic importance, and if there was factual error, it was of a formal rather than a substantive kind.  In the light of what we subsequently know, it is not surprising that the Taoiseach and Ministers hesitated to embrace fully the view of the new Attorney General that Monday afternoon.</P>
    <P>People have made much of the apparent conflict of evidence between the former Attorney General, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons, and the Fianna Fáil Ministers about whether or not he provided a definitive view that Monday.  In resolving that conflict, I regard the written evidence of the Secretary of the Department of Justice, Mr. Tim Dalton, as providing decisive confirmation of the Minister's evidence.  He recounts how, in conversation with him on Monday afternoon, the Minister for Justice stated her intention to make a personal statement to the House:</P>
    <P>the Minister went on to say that she was far from clear as to the extent to which the Attorney was suggesting the consideration given to the issue of delay in the Duggan case had a relevance for the Smyth case.  As I understand it, the lack of clarity related to a difference of opinion on <Col N="1085" /> the issue between the Attorney General and the Senior Legal Assistant in the Attorney's Office ... The Minister indicated to me that the Attorney had been asked to go off and clarify the situation.</P>
    <P>This provides decisive independent contemporaneous confirmation of a key part of the evidence of Fianna Fáil Ministers and the then Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General, Mr. Fitzsimons, was very concerned in his Tuesday letter to the Taoiseach that the Taoiseach should not state that the Smyth case was the first to be considered under the relevant section of the Extradition Act.  The Taoiseach did not say that, and therefore did not mislead the Dáil, because he and his colleagues were determined not to justify the inexcusable delay in dealing with the Smyth case.  Indeed, the Taoiseach was quite open and frank with the House in not advancing any excuses.</P>
    <P>Despite incorporating all the suggestions passed to us by the Labour Ministers, the Tuesday speech did not succeed in pacifying the Labour Party.  It is fanciful to suggest that a passing reference in the Taoiseach's speech to the fact that two Ministers would make statements of correction to the House, which was apparently intended at one stage, would have made any great difference to the Labour Party's reaction. The need to go further on the Tuesday evening came together with the now emphatic view of the Attorney General that an omission of reference to the Duggan case in his predecessor's report to Cabinet meant that he should not have been appointed President of the High Court or allowed to remain Attorney General.  This very harsh view was adopted by the then Taoiseach on the advice of the Attorney General although he has since disowned it, and the bottom line conclusions formed the basis of a signed agreement by Deputy Dick Spring to go back into Government with Deputy Albert Reynolds.</P>
    <P>This agreement, about which his closest adviser was deeply unhappy, was <Col N="1086" /> broken within less than an hour, following an interview between Deputy Spring and the Attorney General, the background to which remains unclear and mysterious.  I find it extraordinary that Deputy Spring was only willing to hear one side of the case, that of a fellow-lawyer, which carried more weight than his colleagues in Government with whom he had worked far more closely. The attitude of Mr. Finlay, judging from his evidence, seems to have been that the Taoiseach could not credibly and with dignity disown the appointment made, an arguable point of view.  Yet that is precisely what the Labour Party Ministers had been pressing Fianna Fáil to do, presumably in good faith, in order to preserve the Government.  Obviously, Mr. Finlay had decided ahead of the Labour Ministers and even of the Tánaiste, that the Government was doomed.  All that remained to be done was to rationalise this in a suitable tone of high moral indignation.</P>

      <P>I am being very restrained in talking about this individual. Deputy Quinn, when he said at the subsequent meeting that they had come looking for a head, rather spoiled the high moral ground effects surrounding the whole episode.  Having enjoyed good relations with all my Labour colleagues, I resented and rejected the insinuation, which is what it eventually came to, that Fianna Fáil Ministers as a whole were involved in morally unacceptable conduct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All parties in this House have on different occasions had reason to be wary of agreements entered into with the leadership of the Labour Party.  In the 1980s agreements made in Cabinet with Fine Gael were not always kept, as <Col N="1087" /> a result of pressure from Labour Party backbenchers.  In January 1987 it walked out of Government with Fine Gael after four and a quarter years together.  In December 1992 the Labour Party leadership negotiated a policy agreement with Democratic Left and then abandoned it but used the agreement as a platform for negotiations with others. Its Deputy Leader announced it was opening negotiations with Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrates but this agreement was then disowned.</P>
    <P>Successive agreements on the timing of the appointment of the presidency of the High Court were not kept last autumn.  The Leader of the Labour Party, under internal pressure and without adequate objective cause, repudiated within an hour his signed agreement of 10.22 a.m. on 16 November 1994 to re-enter Government with Fianna Fáil.  The Labour Party leadership then turned to Fine Gael to see if it could negotiate the office of Taoiseach for Deputy Dick Spring but Fine Gael held its nerve.  The Labour Party leadership then went back to Fianna Fáil.  Three weeks later, on the flimsiest of excuses, an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> That contained nothing new but which added to the political pressure for Deputy John Bruton the previous day, it walked away from a virtually completed agreement with Fianna Fáil.  Very little was said in justification of this at the sub-committee, as it knew it was on very weak ground and had a bad conscience about it.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party then used the draft agreement with Fianna Fáil as a basis for negotiating the programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, large portions of which came direct from the original Fianna Fáil paper.  As successive opinion polls showed, the country wanted a renewed partnership between Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party but was denied it by the vacillation and indecision of the Labour Party leadership. I gather that on the morning of 15 December 1994 the Labour Party <Col N="1088" /> leadership overturned a previous rainbow agreement that would have given Democratic Left two seats in Cabinet and five only to the Labour Party.  As a result of this successful last minute &ldquo;try on&rdquo; Democratic Left ended up with one Cabinet Minister while the Labour Party retained six.</P>
    <P>During the years the Labour Party leadership has developed &ldquo;political gazumping&rdquo; to a fine art.  In the short term at least the Labour Party appears to have done well out of the episode, with six seats in Cabinet, including the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  However, let no one try to persuade us that the gyrations were all for the sake of high-minded principle when, latterly in particular, it was all about weighing up and maximising its own political advantage.  The Labour Party leadership has been good at creating the impression that it has higher political standards but that is not the case.  As a result of all these events we have a new Government but it is not doing as good a job as I believe a renewed partnership Government with Fianna Fáil would have done.</P>
    <P>The handling of the national finances has led to a loss of confidence and contributed to the rise in interest rates.  The markets see a Government that solves internal difficulties by spending more money.  The strict expenditure limit of 6 per cent has been seriously breached within a few weeks of assuming office. Since we had succeeded in eliminating the current budget deficit in 1994 that should have remained the position for all time, especially as it would have meant more tax relief down the line.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare admitted during the weekend that the general social welfare increases were grossly inadequate and claimed, disingenuously, that he had not attempted to defend them.  If socialism is supposed to be about anything, it is the fair and equal distribution of resources.  To pump all available resources in a couple of favoured political directions while neglecting the old who do not vote for <Col N="1089" /> Democratic Left and the unemployed without children, is a betrayal of socialism. If the Minister for Social Welfare is not in a position to defend what were largely his choices and priorities, what is he doing in office?</P>
    <P>The previous Government ensured steady momentum in the peace process. We would have enacted the convention on the transfer of prisoners a long time ago instead of having our members thrown out of the House for asking questions about it.  It is time for a further initiative on Republican prisoners in Portlaoise.  Issues on which movement was required were continually raised, publicly and privately, with the British.  The previous Taoiseach constantly explained and promoted the peace process while his Government showed a sureness of touch and did not try to put the cart before the horse.  Let me not be misunderstood.  We support the Government in relation to the Framework Document and will support any efforts it makes to consolidate the peace process and move it forward.  A clear understanding of the situation, a sense of direction and political energy are all needed so that a dangerous political vacuum is not allowed to develop.  I was disappointed that in a recent interview the Taoiseach listed the peace process only third on his list of political priorities.</P>
    <P>Government Ministers are trying to do their best, although many of them are very inexperienced.  It has been shown, for instance, in the initial attitude of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, to barracks closures, the ultimatum of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, to the ESB, the premature announcement of a referendum on bail by the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, and the lopsided welfare priorities of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  I do not think there is the close rapport between the parties in Government that developed between Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party or coherent leadership from the top.  The <Col N="1090" /> Taoiseach tends to talk off the top of his head; when he expressed some ill-thought out ideas on Europe last week he was laughed at.  This is probably the reason his exposure has been deliberately limited.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will preserve and build on the achievements since 1987 and not damage them, as it seems set to do.  Essentially, what we have in place is a caretaker Government until the next general election when the people will have the opportunity to decide whether they want a more coherent Government with a strong sense of common purpose and led by a party that has a long proven track record of delivering which inspires confidence.</P>
    <P>I thank all the members of the sub-committee, especially those who stayed with it.  I do not want to name those who did not.  I also thank my party colleague and chairman of the sub-committee, Deputy Dan Wallace, for having done an excellent job.</P>

      <P>It is difficult in 20 minutes to give any kind of detailed assessment of the report of the sub-commitee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  It is possible, however, to speak of the general significance of the inquiry carried out by the sub-committee and to demonstrate its usefulness and importance in spite of the superficial and frequently facile reaction of some of the media at the time of its publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first time a committee of this House has ever fully and extensively investigated from start to finish a <Col N="1091" /> series of interlocking political events of fundamental importance.  Their importance can be gauged from the fact that as a result the then Taoiseach resigned and, in spite of his best efforts to the contrary, the principle of accountability was upheld and vindicated.  As a further result, the second most senior judge in the land also had to resign.</P>
    <P>Because of the enforced resignation of Deputy Reynolds as Taoiseach the subsequent inquiry did not have the fundamental political relevance it might have had.  Nonetheless, as a member of the sub-committee which spent a great deal of time on the inquiry and worked very intensively over a period of about five to six weeks, I consider it was a worthwhile exercise.  This is particularly so when it is borne in mind that it was the first such inquiry of this nature undertaken by a Dáil committee.  The facile reaction is because it could not make specific findings that reflected on the good name or reputation of individuals and it was claimed, therefore, that it was a waste of time.  It was invaluable and a great advance in the political process here and very much in the public interest that a succession of senior politicians and senior officials, including Ministers and former Ministers, appeared before the committee to account for their actions.  Light was shed on events notwithstanding the anxiety of certain members of the former Government to carry on everything in secret.</P>
    <P>The inquiry into the events of November 1994 had less public impact than the Dáil debates in November as these events unfolded and developed.  The reason for this is that the Dáil debates were televised live and had a substantial effect on the public.  Because of the length of the hearings each day it was not possible to televise live the deliberations of the sub-committee.  I am not blaming RTE for this because the rule to which it seemed to be subject was that if they had broadcast any of it live they would have had to broadcast all of it which would clearly have been <Col N="1092" /> impossible with only two television channels.</P>
    <P>The sheer inpact of the Dáil debates enabled the public to make up its mind. Because the public was enabled to draw conclusions from those Dáil debates, the former Taoiseach resigned and the last Government fell.  Without that live coverage in November, these events might not have happened.  The public's ability to see events unfolding before its eyes and to see the demeanour of those involved has a much greater impact than looking at recorded highlights, reading Dáil debates or even reading the most acute commentary on debates.  It is a clear demonstration of the primacy of television as a medium.</P>
    <P>As somebody who was involved in the beef tribunal, it is a cause of great regret to me that that tribunal was not televised as it would be, for example, in the United States on a public service channel. If it had been so televised, the public at large would have had few doubts about a great many aspects of the topics covered in that tribunal, just as the handful of uncommitted people who attended the tribunal's hearings were left in no doubt as to where the truth lay.</P>
    <P>The inability of the sub-committee, on strong legal advice, to draw conclusions arises from the principles laid down by the Supreme Court in a case called in Re. Haughey, reported in the 1971 Irish Reports when an investigation was being attempted by the Committee of Public Accounts of this House. The rules laid down in In Re. Haughey were so fundamental and all encompassing that they will inhibit future investigations of this type here unless they are changed by the Supreme Court in a further case or unless there is some form of constitutional amendment. Serious consideration will have to be given to one or other of these courses because, to hamstring committees of this House for all time in necessary public investigations, would be seriously detrimental to the public interest.</P>
    <P>Among the advantages of this form of inquiry is that it was very expeditious <Col N="1093" /> and its cost negligible, in contrast to the beef tribunal which took three years and is reputed to have cost over £30 million pounds.  The absence of lawyers from active involvement in the committee's hearings was undoubtedly a great advantage and led to the expeditious and inexpensive inquiry.</P>
    <P>There is a debate beginning in the context of the criminal law, as to why the accused should appear to have all the rights and the victim none.  There is a clear analogy to be drawn from this type of inquiry.  Why is it that those who might be criticised or reprimanded appear to have all the rights and the public interest none?  Why is it that the conduct of such an inquiry must be carried on from the point of view of protecting those being investigated, who might or might not have been potential wrongdoers?</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Justice 23 years ago, I made a speech querying whether the accusatorial and confrontational system of justice we inherited from the English is necessarily the best, and I asked whether we should look to countries on the Continent and to their system of investigating magistrates as a possible alternative.  I was howled down at the time by all the various vested interests, principally the legal one.  I am glad to see that the idea was taken up again at a seminar in County Clare last weekend by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>We tend to look down on the Italians and their public administration as appearing somehow corrupt.  It may well have been so in the past but it has to be said for the Italians, and it cannot be said for us, that they have a system of courageous investigating magistrates which has led to serious scandals and corruption being uncovered and investigated fully and which is contributing in a major way to the break-up of organised crime in the underworld of the Mafia.  A long succession of Ministers, including former Prime Ministers, have been charged by these investigating magistrates.  No Italian head has been too high to roll.  Our system does not <Col N="1094" /> even allow such an investigation to begin.</P>
    <P>The peculiar English system of investigation, which we so slavishly follow, has been at least partly abandoned by the English.  The Scots never allowed themselves to adopt English law.  We, on the other hand, try to be more English than the English.</P>
    <P>The English do not suffer from the same constraints on an inquiry where very senior people are involved.  The proof of that is the present Scott Inquiry which has been expeditious and where legal representation is minimal.  I have not heard anyone complain that injustice must necessarily be done by Lord Justice Scott because he does not follow the rules of In Re. Haughey, and let us not forget that Scott is looking into the actions of a former Prime Minister and a whole range of Ministers.</P>
    <P>It is important that this House as a whole, and not just the Government of the day, give serious consideration to the experience of the sub-committee and to what lessons can be learned from its inquiry, not just in regard to the facts which have come to light but, even more importantly, in respect of how further inquiries of this type might be carried on in the future.  This House will have to be the primary vehicle for consideration of these matters through the Committee on Procedure and Privileges because any Government of the day would like to assume that there would never have to be an inquiry into its actions and will not give any priority to devising ways of overcoming the difficulties which beset this sub-committee. Whether this House and its committees can undertake this task successfully is a matter of some doubt because of the lack of parliamentary independence and supremacy which has been a feature of our democratic institutions.</P>
    <P>This House, now as before, is dominated by the Government of the day. Its committees are so dominated, and the chairmanship of each of its committees bar one is seen as in the gift of the Government.  Any parliament that fails <Col N="1095" /> to assert itself as against the Government of the day in the way we do, has only itself to blame for the problems that flow from that.  The fact that this debate on a fundamentally important issue will last for scarcely two hours is an indication of the priorities of the House, even at a time when there is little or no new business before it, and it has to resort to what my colleague, Deputy McDowell calls &ldquo;legislative polyfilla&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for the long delayed Bill introducing compellability and privilege for witnesses before committees of this House.  This inquiry further underlines the desirability of this even if, as in this case, all the witnesses actually turned up.</P>
    <P>There were many conflicts of interest in the evidence given to the sub-committee where that sub-committee as a body was not allowed to draw conclusions. The principal conflict was between the evidence given by the former Attorney General, Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons, on the one hand, and that given by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds and the former Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn on the other.  Mr. Fitzsimons was of course at a major disadvantage inasmuch as he was the first witness; he did not know what evidence would be given by any other witness and his evidence was available to every other witness to seek to pick holes in it, if it suited them and their lawyers in the adjoining room.</P>
    <P>It transpired in the course of the evidence of Mr. Fitzsimons that on no less than seven occasions on the Monday of the week in question he spoke to one, some or all of the Fianna Fáil Ministers about the Duggan case.  He was assured that the Taoiseach and at least two Ministers would deal with the Duggan case in the Dáil the following day. Understandably, he saw no reason at the time to doubt that and he understood it to be Government policy, as he was entitled to do.  At about lunchtime on the Tuesday he was informed by the then Minister for Justice to the effect. <Col N="1096" />&ldquo;We have decided not to use the Duggan case&rdquo;.  It is hardly surprising that he was startled at this and found it necessary to write a very specific letter to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>As a member of the committee that heard the evidence of all the witnesses, except one, and who read that evidence, I had no difficulty in coming to the conclusion at the end of the inquiry that the evidence given by Mr. Fitzsimons was correct in everything except some trivial and irrelevant details.  I still believe that to be the case and I am not impressed by the prolonged efforts of former Fianna Fáil Ministers to try to persuade the sub-committee that while they had heard about the Duggan case, they did not appreciate its significance. They appreciated it sufficiently on the Monday for three members of the Government to indicate their intention to refer to it and to clarify the position the following day and for one of those three subsequently to offer her resignation as Minister because of her failure to have it clarified.  My impression of Mr. Fitzsimons is that he is somewhat innocent and politically naive and was horrified to find himself in the centre of a den of people with whom he then discovered he had little or nothing in common.</P>
    <P>As well as the evidence that they had all been informed of Duggan on Monday, and some of them several times, there is the further evidence of Dr. Mansergh, their chief adviser, that he had in his possession on the Monday evening a full written document on the Duggan case from the Attorney General. Dr. Mansergh afterwards sought to suggest that, in saying that he had it in his possession, he really meant by those words that he did not have it in his possession. It seems remarkable that those who did not understand, as they claim, the significance of Duggan should have asked the then Attorney General to request the recently appointed President of the High Court to resign his office because of his failure to tell the Government of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the report which mentions the names of all these people who were examined at length.</P>
      <P>As late as 5 December last some of these Ministers pleaded with Mr. Fitzsimons, who was asked to prepare a note on what had happened, to give them a fool's pardon.  This he attempted to do in the addendum to his report of that date by saying that on the Monday they were behaving in a very disorganised manner and that no one appeared to be in charge.  As a Fianna Fáil Attorney General it seems unlikely that Mr. Fitzsimons would have set out to be antagonistic to Fianna Fáil.  I believe that Mr. Fitzsimons simply set out to tell the truth and succeeded in doing so.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding all its detail, this inquiry leaves certain questions unanswered and we are entitled to ask now why they remain unanswered in spite of all the efforts to secure answers.  Why was the extradition request for Fr. Brendan Smyth not dealt with after seven months in the Attorney General's office?  If Fr. Smyth had not gone to the North, would that request even still have been dealt with?  Why was the sexual abuse of children by an adult in a position of trust regarded as of such little importance by the Attorney General's office it could be effectively ignored over a lengthy period?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why was the then Taoiseach so obsessed with appointing Mr. Whelehan as President of the High Court in spite of cogent reasons to the contrary?  Why was Mr. Whelehan so obsessed with being appointed?  Why did the then Taoiseach take steps &mdash; that even he must have realised could lead to the downfall of his Government &mdash; to have <Col N="1098" /> Mr. Whelehan appointed to his office against the strong opposition of his partners in Government who left the Cabinet room in protest?  Did this obsessive loyalty to Mr. Whelehan have its roots somewhere in the recesses of the beef tribunal, where great favours were done for the then Taoiseach?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it a price that had to be paid at any cost?  How could it be remotely argued that the appointment of Mr. Whelehan to this office would be publicly beneficial or necessary?</P>
      <P>There are other people who have questions to answer which were never answered in this committee's inquiry. Why were the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and some of his colleagues anxious to go back into Government with Fianna Fáil early in December after all they had discovered about the events of November? Why was the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, deflected from that course of action only by an article in a newspaper, the factual substance of which he may have been aware of all along?  What sort of man changes his mind because of public disclosure of facts but is prepared to live with the principles involved if they are not publicly disclosed?</P>
      <P>Why did the then Taoiseach and his colleagues seek to conceal so much from the Dáil?  Why did the then Taoiseach change his mind, or at least change his public utterances, about Mr. Whelehan so often even though he had all the relevant information on the Monday? What credibility has someone who supports you on Tuesday, abandons and excoriates you on Wednesday and says a month later at the committee of inquiry that you were really a fine fellow after all?  Is the changing assessment of Mr. Whelehan by people in Fianna Fáil no more than a reflection of their own personal interests or welfare at a particular time?  If Fianna Fáil's old reliable friend, Harry Whelehan is readily expendable, who is not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> It was abundantly clear from the evidence to the sub-committee by Deputy Spring, several other Ministers and Mr. Finlay that the then Taoiseach's manner of handling the report of the beef tribunal was the first and principal cause of the breakdown in relations between Fianna Fáil and Labour.  The beef tribunal, and the events that led to it, loomed large over this committee's inquiry and indeed continue to loom large over several aspects of public affairs.</P>
    <P>If Fianna Fáil Ministers could change their mind about Mr. Whelehan when it suited them, naturally they did the same about Mr. Russell in the Attorney General's office.  Shortly after taking office Mr. Fitzsimons was asked to fire Mr. Russell from his position as the senior official in the office, equivalent to the secretary of a Department.  When Mr. Whelehan sought to stand over Mr. Russell's handling of the Brendan Smyth affair, Deputy Reynolds and his colleagues were furious, but when it came to the committee's hearing Fianna Fáil changed its mind again and decided it was more expedient to agree with Mr. Russell.  Mr. Russell was more fortunate than his antagonist Deputy Reynolds. While Deputy Reynolds has been forced out of office, Mr. Russell has apparently been reinstated surrounded with the benefit of computers to make him more businesslike.</P>
    <P>Since, incidentally, we are told that Duggan had nothing to do with the delay, it is interesting to discover from the correspondence that passed between the parties that the British Attorney General thought it had and specifically drew the attention of the Irish Attorney General to that fact. Constant and well rehearsed repetition by certain Fianna Fáil former Ministers that Duggan was not relevant, sought and partly succeeded in embedding that belief in the public mind.  The fact that it may reside in a vague way in the public mind does not make it correct because the facts are otherwise.</P>

      <P>My belief is that for the future the ideal would be that committees investigating serious matters of this type should be smaller than this sub-committee, even though I can see that creates difficulties of representation. Ideally such committees should, if possible, be chaired by someone with legal knowledge and experience.  Given the difficulties he laboured under, Deputy Wallace did a good job as chairman but I do not see why the chairman should be inhibited or prevented from taking part in questioning of witnesses. A judge can do so in court without prejudicing or forfeiting his independence or open-mindedness.  In looking at how further inquiries should be run, it is worthwhile for this House to study the experience of the Committee of Public Accounts which has had a relative degree of success over the years, even with limited resources and powers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>First I wish to pay tribute to Deputy Dan Wallace who carried out an extremely important role as Chairman of the Sub-committee on Legislation and Security and who produced a most important report which reveals a substantial amount of information on the way the State functions, particularly the way Government functions.  He undertook a difficult role and handled many of the points raised in the fairest way possible, considering the political nature of the inquiry and the difficulties that could have arisen in terms of his position.  Despite all the difficulties he carried out his role in an extremely professional and competent manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be a mistake to rehash the whole inquiry.  The role of the committee was to inquire into events during the period concerned and to make the <Col N="1101" /> results available to the public for consideration and decision.  The point was made by me and other members of the committee that criticism would be levelled at the inquiry to the effect that conclusions arrived at would not be to the satisfaction of certain people.  It was pointed out by most members of the committee that the public is the jury on this issue and, if given access to the information gleaned from the inquiry, it would make up its own mind on the conclusions.</P>
    <P>It is important that RTE and the media be given due recognition for the work they did in the course of this inquiry.  Most people forget that it took place during the Christmas when they were enjoying the festivities.  People had hoped to get away from the hustle and bustle of political life.  RTE and the media covered one of the most important inquiries we have had for some time in such a way that it made a substantial impact on the public, as the viewing numbers attest.  That is a tribute to both RTE and the print media who gave it substantial coverage in a format which enabled the public to adjudicate daily on the evidence put before them.</P>
    <P>The members of the committee who worked with Deputy Dan Wallace gave a service second to none.  The proceedings were reported speedily and this made the work of the committee extremely pleasant and easy to undertake.</P>
    <P>I would like to put some aspects of the proceedings in perspective.  Most people criticise the Tánaiste.  Deputy Spring, for his failure to inform the public of his reservations regarding the appointment of Mr. Harry Whelehan to the position of President of the High Court.  During the evidence given by the Tánaiste at that inquiry he outlined the reason and stated:</P>
    <P>In June or July 1994 the Taoiseach informed me that Mr. Whelehan had expressed an interest in the High Court appointment, possibly the presidency if it became available.  I informed the Taoiseach that I did not <Col N="1102" /> consider it wise to appoint Mr. Whelehan directly to any administrative position within the courts and that it would be more satisfactory to appoint a person with judicial experience. I also said that I would agree to Mr. Whelehan being appointed as a judge of the High Court or to the European vacancy, if he wished.</P>
    <P>I think that statement is an expression of concern about that appointment.</P>
    <P>I will now refer to the events that unfolded on the night of Thursday, 10 November 1994 and through the weekend to the following Wednesday.  The concerns expressed by the Tánaiste on the appointment of the then Attorney General, Mr. Whelehan, to the presidency of the High Court were repeated in two letters which were sent to the Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, expressing serious reservations about proceeding with the appointment of the Attorney General to the presidency of the High Court on Friday, 11 November 1994.  On that Friday the Labour Ministers in Government expressed their reservations about proceeding with the appointment but, despite those clear signals of political danger, the Taoiseach persisted with the appointment.  At that point the die was cast.  That is the point of breakdown of a partnership that had been so successful.  The trust in Government began to dissipate from that moment and it became virtually impossible to repair the damage.  That is the crucial point that has emerged from reading the evidence of the committee report.</P>
    <P>Expressions of concern about the appointment and the breakdown of trust continued on that Saturday and Sunday.  A special parliamentary Labour Party conference was called on Sunday to deal with the issue and throughout that day party members gave their total commitment to support the Tánaiste and Labour Ministers in whatever action they decided to take in the developing political situation.  The Tánaiste had a clear mandate from the party.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> On that Sunday night and Monday the new Attorney General, Mr. Eogan Fitzsimons, made serious attempts, on instructions, to find out the background reasons for the seven months' delay in handling the Smyth case and to provide the information as quickly as possible so that it could be made available to the political parties and to the public who were seriously concerned about the progress of events.  It must be recognised at this point that the credibility of Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons, the then Attorney General, was called into question.  This was unfortunate because he is a man of high integrity who had been a short time in a job and had done his utmost to be of assistance to the Government.  It is a pity that he was not recalled by the committee.  The report is over 1,000 pages but it could be summarised as the statement of Eoghan Fitzsimons versus the rest and if he had come back he might have answered some of the questions. We know he was not interested in doing so and unfortunately people will have to draw their own conclusions.</P>
    <P>We should consider the terms of reference when holding committees of inquiry because they will enable us to do the job correctly or restrict the work we may want to do.  In this case we found that the terms of reference were not adequately considered in order to allow the work to proceed in the way most members said it should.  We must be careful about this in future.  It also puts a great deal of strain on members who do not have large resources for research.  They coped effectively but in future there should be research facilities that members may call upon irrespective of the resources of individual Deputies.</P>
    <P>On one occasion the committee met far too long, almost 11 hours.  It was done with the best of intentions because of pressure on the committee.  This was difficult for witnesses and Members but served as a marker for the future.  In future we must make sure that we provide adequate time for the work of the committees.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> I am not sure whether the <i>sub judice</i> rule should apply to proceedings, with members and journalists forbidden to discuss matters concerning the inquiry, until its work has been completed.  The committee faced many dilemmas which the chairman had to address as to whether it was correct for Members to speak to the media about the issues they had dealt with that day.  The consensus was that Members should refrain from speaking to the media except for some who acted as substitute members for a short time and felt obliged to comment on the workings of the committee.  We must consider how we should proceed in that area.  It would be wrong to make it into too much of a judicial inquiry.  It is a political inquiry, perhaps the rules are too strict, and we must decide if they are relevant.</P>
    <P>All parties should have been asked to make written submissions in advance. This would reduce the time spent on hearing oral contributions and all parties would have knowledge of all the testimony of contributors.  We first heard the former Attorney General, Eoghan Fitzsimons, and used his contribution as the guideline for questioning on the events to be looked at.  It would be a big improvement if those appearing before us submitted written statements. Committee members should be allowed to contribute and whether their information should be heard in public or private session is a matter we must consider. The chairman should have a greater opportunity to intervene and contribute to the work of the committee.</P>
    <P>Some questions are left unanswered. When we create committees of inquiry we could easily fall into the trap of constructing forums that would resemble courts of law.  We should avoid that and ensure committees are not guided predominantly by judicial rules.  The public, who charge us with the responsibility of looking after its affairs, can make up its mind on the evidence.  It is in a position to decide at the next general election whether it is appropriate to take certain <Col N="1105" /> steps and will decide who is right and who is wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to share my time with Deputies Treacy and Cullen. While we all hope that any future tribunal or inquiry set up by the Dáil will be more broadly based than the previous one, we are constrained by the Haughey case.  I quote the well thought out principle which Mr. Justice O'Dálaigh outlined:</P>
      <P>Where it is considered necessary to grant immunity to witnesses appearing before a tribunal, then a person whose conduct is impugned as part of the subject matter of the inquiry must be afforded reasonable means of defending himself.</P>
      <P>The then Chief Justice identified four minimum protections: the person accused should be furnished with a copy of the evidence which reflected on his good name; he should be allowed cross-examine, by counsel, his accuser or accusers; he should be allowed give rebutting evidence and be permitted to address again, by counsel, the tribunal in his own defence.  We cannot get away from that whether we like it or not.  That is part of our law.</P>
      <P>We made that point clear in the House when the sub-committee was set up, yet we were accused by the then Opposition of having something to hide. Even Deputy Walsh will acknowledge that those who took a particular stance at the beginning changed their view by the time we finished the report on the basis that, as a body, we did not have the proper Order of the House and were legally constrained from making any findings or expressing opinions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe about the committee's failure to find out about the seven month delay in the Father Brendan Smyth case.  When we started our deliberations I insisted, as Deputy Walsh will acknowledge, that part of what we had to do was find out about that delay.  Other than the evidence of Mr. Russell, we were not able to find out why there was a seven month delay. <Col N="1106" /> That is what the public wanted to know. Some Deputies and political supporters wanted blood on one side or the other but, for the public, the reason for the delay was the core issue.  Unfortunately, there were people within the House who were more interested in political mudslinging.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to rewrite history, as others have attempted to do today but as the inquiry progressed, I was satisfied the core problem was that, as a result of certain actions by Deputy Reynolds in relation to the beef tribunal report, Deputy Spring decided he would get his revenge.  By chance, the débâcle of the Harry Whelehan appointment and the Father Brendan Smyth case fell into the lap of the Labour Party and they milked it.  On the Sunday night when the Labour Party held a meeting, Deputy Quinn told the nation on television that this case was about child sexual abuse.  I knew then that the Government was finished and the Labour Party would use this as their opportunity.  It was a means to an end and the committee became far less relevant once Fine Gael, Democratic Left and the Labour Party went into Government and got the Mercs and perks.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern stated that the State was not rocked to its foundations by the committee's report.  There is no doubt about that.  I insisted, unsuccesfully, that Deputy Rabbitte be called before the committee simply because it was his statement in the House which &ldquo;rocked the foundations of the State&rdquo;.  He referred to a non-existent letter.  Both Deputy Spring and Dr. Martin Mansergh confirmed conclusively in their evidence that what really built up the political pressure was Deputy Rabbitte's statement which had the effect of preventing the Labour Party going back into Government even though the next day it was prepared to sign a document to that effect.</P>
    <P>I compliment the chairman, Deputy Wallace, on his handling of this difficult task even though we disagreed with him on occasion.  I pay my regards also to the other Members of the committee <Col N="1107" /> who sat for endless hours.  A special word of thanks must go to the secretariat who showed how civil servants work extremely well on ours and the State's behalf.  They did a magnificent job.  I also thank the media.  By and large &mdash; there are one or two exceptions as members of the committee will know&mdash; the media and some of the better known names and political correspondents sat through our deliberations and reported them verbatim.</P>
    <P>The reality is that this was not an impartial sub-committee, and that is one of the reasons it could not reach conclusions. A number of speakers on the far side of the House said when they were in Opposition we should introduce the privilege and compellability Bill. The ball is now in their court.  They have talked about it for weeks, and we have asked questions about it on a daily basis, yet members of the Government continue to say it will be introduced shortly. The Government should introduce the Bill when we will be able to establish more effective sub-committees with broader terms of reference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to these statements.  I am one of the few Deputies who attended every sitting of the sub-committee.  It is regrettable that the committee was not allowed to complete its good work and establish the truth or otherwise of many unsubstantiated statements by some of our present Ministers and their minders. Why was the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, not made to account for his outlandish statement in the Dáil forecasting that the foundations of the State would be rocked by information available in the Attorney General's office? That was shown to be irrational and irresponsible and should be withdrawn from the record by the Minister of State. It is a fabrication and it is unworthy of any Member to mislead the House in that way.  Why was the chief in the Government Information Services not called to account for his disgraceful <Col N="1108" />&ldquo;High King of Ireland&rdquo; Labour-sourced stories to the media in September 1994?</P>
      <P>Those statements were designated to, and could only result in, undermining the Taoiseach and the Government, actions apparently supported and condoned by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring. Trust can have a strange meaning sometimes, but we must always remember that trust is a two-way thing.  It broke down in the previous Government when the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, led his colleagues out of a Cabinet meeting on Friday, 11 November 1994.  That contrasts with Deputy Spring's signing a document at 10.22 a.m. on 16 November stating that he would lead his colleagues back into Government to complete the Programme for Government.  History now shows that neither the written nor spoken word mattered.  However, <i>verbum scriptum stat.</i></P>
      <P>From my inquiries I have established that there was no lockout or the use of secret code knocks on a particular door in Government Buildings, neither was that ordered on 29 July 1994 or any other day by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, during his term of office.  The personnel concerned freely admit that.  They felt maligned by such spurious allegations and thought some further questions could have been raised by members of the sub-committee on this issue.  Deputy Reynolds confirmed to me that he had never seen that particular door locked during his term as Taoiseach.  Staff members also confirm that the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, was out of his office for a period on that particular night having tea with other officials in another office.  I can only conclude that such statements were figments of Finlay's fantasies designed to attract media headlines in a dramatic way, and they succeeded.  I hope this rebuttal will attract the same attention.  Those are some of the many false assumptions made by Mr. Finlay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the beef tribunal report, it has also been confirmed to me that two copies were handed to the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, <Col N="1109" /> Deputy Joe Walsh.  He retained one in his Department for copying and the other was sent to the then Taoiseach at approximately 9.15 p.m. on the day in question.  The tribunal report was not with the Taoiseach from 6 or 7 o'clock as alleged by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and his many aides.  It is well known that Deputy Spring's copy was available for collection in the Government's Secretary's office from 10.15 p.m.  However, it was not collected until about an hour later.  I wonder why. Nobody was keeping that report from him.  He was in Tralee and Government business and beef reports did not seem to be a priority for him on that day.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision regarding the report was that there would be a meeting the following week to discuss it. There was not a Government decision that it would not be commented on by anyone, as alleged by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, on a number of occasions.  In the interests of truth and honesty it is important to set the record straight.  How could the Tánaiste say that he never accepted Mr. Harry Whelehan would be appointed to the presidency of the High Court when he had already agreed to his replacement? Where did he think Mr. Whelehan was going at that stage of his career?</P>
    <P>The people now realise there was no conspiracy and that a political execution was carried out without any trial or evidence, based purely on innuendo and driven by rumour and counter-rumour engineered by a small cadre of people working with a latent agenda for the achievement of their selfish ends.  It must now be clear to everybody that no conclusion should have been drawn or action taken to break up the previous Government until the facts had been absolutely established.  This exercise of breaking up the previous Government was designed to inflict maximum damage on the Fianna Fáil Party.  Those low political and personal actions failed miserably.  It was also hoped that it would obliterate any memories of the humiliating route of the Labour Party in the two Cork by-elections held that <Col N="1110" /> same week.  It has had short-term success in that regard, but the real jury is still out and I am confident that it will prove in due course that those who claim to own the high moral ground will find their share of it has diminished substantially.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a short contribution to these statements.  I attended almost all of the hearings of the sub-committee and found it an enlightening experience and of great interest given the maelstrom in which we had all been involved at the end of 1994.  As a consequence, we have reached a watershed in Irish politics and I do not believe things will ever be the same again.  I do not believe that any public appointments to whatever area will be made by a Government in future without the utmost scrutinty either by Members of this House, people in the public domain or by the media.  Whenever an issue arises in future that has a certain connotation, I will always look for a political agenda behind it.  I will never believe when an issue gathers momentum, as did the one last year, that it was not somehow motivated by somebody's political agenda.</P>
      <P>From watching and listening to the facts that emerged during the hearings of the sub-committee, it became clear to me that the conspiracy that was supposed to have existed, orchestrated by the Fianna Fáil Party, certainly did not exist.  There never was a conspiracy and a party in Government which was enjoyed great success with its then colleagues during the life of that Government had its eye taken off the agenda by a so-called important appointment objected to by the Tánaiste.  We have never found out what was his and the Labour Party's substantive objection. What we did find out was that we were dealing with three different parties in Government.  There was the Labour Party of the Tánaiste and his advisers, a clearly separate Labour Party of Ministers and another Labour Party of backbenchers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1111" /> There is no doubt that there was a political agenda set by the Tánaiste and his advisers to pull out of Government. They seized an opportunity they saw arise, they coloured what was happening, took the high moral ground and abused a sensitive issue, about which everyone in this House and throughout the country was concerned, the question of the delay in dealing with the Brendan Smyth case.  They used that issue, compounded by the Duggan case, which we now know had little bearing on the Brendan Smyth case.</P>
    <P>When we recall the events as they unfolded, Members of the House were as confused as the media about what was happening.  It is easy to understand how Fianna Fáil members of a Cabinet could not understand, and did not want to believe there was a real political agenda being driven by the Labour Party.  The real impetus to this confusion was given by the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, who, as it were, injected steroids into this issue when he spoke about the rocking of the State to its foundations when the contents of some letter, which we now know never existed, would be revealed.  That is the type of colourful language for which the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, has become known in this House.</P>

Perhaps we were tripped up, having failed to realise there was a political agenda, hidden <Col N="1112" /> from Labour Party Ministers, by the Leader of their party and his advisers, to ensure they broke up the then excellent Government, went about the formation of another, seeking to remain in power. As we know to our cost, this agenda was fulfilled.  However, I warn him that it is a long road without a turning and the Labour Party will reach that turning eventually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the gentlemen of the Fianna Fáil Party do not consider women have as much to contribute as men to politics but I assure them that I will adequately fill my ten minute slot.  I do not need Deputy Gilmore or Deputy Rabbitte to speak for <Col N="1113" /> me because there is equality in our party.  I know it is difficult for Fianna Fáil to understand, but when a female member of our party wants to contribute she is allowed to do so.</P>
      <P>It is amazing the Fianna Fáil Party still do not realise the State was shaken to its foundations; they are still reeling from its effects.</P>
      <P>The report of the sub-committee is comprised of almost 1,000 pages.  When its statements and counter-statements are stripped of their rhetoric, we are left with the bare facts &mdash; that a Catholic priest abused a number of children, as yet unknown, in the Republic and Northern Ireland.  The authorities in Northern Ireland issued an extradition warrant which was allowed to gather dust in the Attorney General's office for almost seven months.</P>
      <P>When one subtracts the political manoeuvrings, the extraordinary events surrounding the appointment of Mr. Harry Whelehan as President of the High Court and his resignation; if we subtract the note passed to the Taoiseach in the House reading: &ldquo;If pursued on this matter keep repeating the above&rdquo;, we are left with a sordid case of child abuse and official neglect of a sector of our society assured of our protection, a neglect it appears that went right to the Office of the Attorney General.</P>
      <P>One of the most positive by-products of the events of November 1994 was the highlighting of the overall issue of child abuse, which has remained in the public arena, something we should not forget. We also learned much that had been hidden from public view, for example, how the office of the Attorney General operates.  We also learned more about the relative powers of civil servants and their political masters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If for no other reason the establishment of the sub-committee was valuable, in stripping the veil from public administration.  It is regrettable the sub-committee was unable to reach a conclusion although ultimately I am not so sure that was necessary.  It has been left to Member and the public at large to draw conclusions from the events and <Col N="1114" /> evidence presented to the sub-committee. I, for one, have no difficulty in drawing a conclusion from both; I suggest neither has the electorate.</P>

      <P>The evidence to the sub-committee has two main thrusts &mdash; one which might be described as the Eoghan Fitzsimons' line, the other the Fianna Fáil line.  For what it is worth, not only I but I believe the majority of the electorate believes Mr. Fitzsimons and it is not difficult to understand why. Mr. Fitzsimons did a great service to our democracy.  Having identified what had gone wrong in the office of the Attorney General, he made a number of points relating to the conduct of the then Government, painting a picture of a Fianna Fáil Party in disarray.  I can vouch for that picture which I found very frightening when I entered this House.  I had always been under the impression that somebody in Government was in control but I discovered there was then nobody in control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very easy to frighten Deputy Lynch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not be drawn, Deputy O'Dea will never have that pleasure.  I discovered a Fianna Fáil Party in disarray, instantly obvious to anybody who witnessed the events of that time.  Disarray is one thing but Fianna Fáil Ministers also stand accused of duplicity and deceit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dáil was misled on the Duggan case.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, defended Mr. Whelehan's appointment as President of the High Court the day after he had apparently asked him to resign.  To put it mildly, Fianna Fáil Ministers were less than honest with their Labour partners. Those are the facts that emerge not only from the report of the sub-committee that inquired into those events but from the media reportage of them at the time. It is not a pretty picture but at least it <Col N="1115" /> was hung out in public for everybody to see.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind that Deputy Dan Wallace and I represent the same constituency, I thank him for the balanced, judicious manner in which he chaired the proceedings of the sub-committee. Here I am sure I speak on behalf of those Members who participated, the public who watched its proceedings in their homes and other Members here who followed them.</P>
    <P>The collapse of the last Government should not be availed of to throw stones but to draw lessons for the future; we are inclined to keep looking backwards, seeking scapegoats, not looking to the future.  The first lesson has been from the establishment of the sub-committee which, for legal and constitutional reasons, was precluded from presenting any findings in relation to the evidence presented.  Such preclusion, although understandable legally, does neither the State nor witnesses any service.  In effect, the sub-committee returned a verdict of &ldquo;not proven&rdquo;, always very unsatisfactory to all concerned.  What is important is not what the inquiry found but that it was held.</P>
    <P>I agree with the report of the sub-committee that the preclusion of presenting findings should not be used as a precedent for future sub-committees. The previous Government entered office promising, in the words of the Taoiseach, to ensure that the business of Government was carried out as transparently as though behind a pane of glass.  The hearings of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security were an exercise in such transparency. Members of this House and others involved in the bizarre events leading to the fall of the last Government were called to account for their actions and the public allowed to draw their own conclusion.  In itself that represents a sizeable advance for our democracy.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the conclusions of the sub-committee, or lack of them, are irrelevant at this stage.  Accountability is <Col N="1116" /> fundamental to the practice of democracy and the proceedings of that sub-committee were an example of that accountability I should like to see continue. Despite the 1,000 pages of this report and the excellent procedures put in place, we have a choice &mdash; to believe Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons or Fianna Fáil.  I believe the people have already decided who they believe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Chairman on the wonderful work he did on this sub-committee.  In the short time available to me I will make some pertinent points.  The committee of inquiry showed the public and every honest Member involved in it that the collapse of the last Government was about many things but was not about the Father Brendan Smyth case or the Duggan case.  The truth is that the Labour Party had decided, at some stage, to get out of Government.  With the Labour Party Leader being pulled by his Ministers and Deputies on the one side and his Labour Party handlers on the other the only question throughout those traumatic weeks was which side would win. We know that the handlers won.  One can draw no other conclusion as evidenced by the fact that the Labour Party Leader and his party pulled out from negotiations with Deputy Bertie Ahern on the most flimsy excuse possible.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to that, for reasons of political expediency and political jack-boot tactics, Fianna Fáil was put on trial.  Many people inside and outside this House were sorely disappointed as the committee began to unravel the truth.  It was established beyond a shadow of doubt that at no stage was there a conspiracy between Fianna Fáil Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The jury, the general public, in this case has reached a verdict different <Col N="1117" /> from that Deputy Lynch would have us believe.  The jury accepts that this was a political business, that it was about political expediency on the part of the Labour Party, in particular, who had decided earlier to pull out of Government. There is considerable evidence to this effect throughout the report.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, was described as the High King of Ireland on a roll while he was out of the country. There are many other examples in the report.</P>
    <P>Nothing confirms it more than the enlightening evidence of the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, when he mentioned the beef tribunal and clearly placed the blame for the collapse of the Government on it.  It gives me no pleasure to say there was a considerable amount of political hypocrisy involved in all of this. Neither does it give me any pleasure to say that those who came calling for a head &mdash; when they could not get one they had to get the other &mdash; will be answered by the people in their wisdom in due course.  In their electoral sophistication the people will make the correct decision.  All honest people involved in the committee of inquiry and the general public know what the result will be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Though the sub-committee did not reach conclusions for legal reasons, certain conclusions have been reached by every independent fair-minded commentator because the evidence is clear.  One conclusion is that the Duggan case was of little or no significance. Another conclusion is that there was no conspiracy to deceive anybody and there was no document and no event occurred which would tend to rock the foundations of the State. Consequently, as has been said, this House was misled by Deputy Rabbitte who is now a super Minister of State.  A third conclusion is that no definitive view of the significance of the Duggan case was ever given by Mr. Eoghan Fitzsimons to Fianna Fáil Ministers on that fateful Monday, 14 November, 1994. <Col N="1118" /> There was no lock-out.  Another conclusion, of which everybody is now certain, is that there was nothing new in Geraldine Kennedy's article in <i>The Irish Times</i> which would justify the Labour Party pulling out of negotiations with Deputy Bertie Ahern at the last moment to form a Government.</P>
      <P>The sub-committee's report, and the events which led to it, are proof positive of the old adage that the problem with facts is that there are so many of them. Though we did not reach conclusions certain things are clear.  The public will be the final jury.  As far as the Fianna Fáil Party is concerned, I am confident of the verdict of the public on it but I am not certain others will be so lucky.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all who contributed to the debate for their kind remarks about me and the manner in which the business of the sub-committee was conducted.  This was not due merely to me: I had tremendous co-operation from all sides of the House.  The inquiry, which was broadcast live on television, brought home to all Members the importance of this sub-committee and the importance to the members who represented the different parties on it of ensuring that its work proceeded in a constructive manner.</P>
      <P>The public got an insight into the workings of Government when officials came before the sub-committee and outlined in detail, honestly and sincerely, their views on the events of that time.  The fact that the committee compiled a report of almost 1,000 pages may not be attractive to the public but certainly will be of interest to historians. The details that emerged showed the issues that brought down a Government.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Members on whom there were certain constraints. They had to put questions to witnesses at short notice although they did not have sufficient time to digest the statements made.  A very efficient job was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I said in my introductory remarks that I would endeavour, if time permitted, to <Col N="1119" /> mention a few points which I thought were of assistance to the sub-committee, the public and the press on the workings of the sub-committee.  Every effort was made by the secretariat to ensure the availability of a full transcript of proceedings at the end of each day.  This policy was adopted in response to the need to demonstrate openness from the outset.  The second procedure involved the relatively frequent use of private meetings to resolve unforeseen problems quickly and effectively with the minimum of conflict.  Another important element involved the prior agreement of the order and duration of questioning by the sub-committee members.  In this regard the policy of using a single spokesperson for each political group was particularly efficient.</P>
    <P>It is important to point out that witnesses were not compelled to attend the inquiry.  Each witness who was asked to attend did so, which certainly enhanced the work of the committee.  The co-operation in regard to the statements made and the questions answered can only enhance the role of the Oireachtas. When the necessary changes are made to the terms of reference, future committees can play a vital role on behalf of the House and its Members.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The fundamental philosophy behind this motion is the pursuit of equality for all students attending third level education courses in respect of fees, grants and access to facilities.  It <Col N="1121" /> is a philosophy which is all-inclusive, not exclusive.  It aims to increase participation rates in third level education among those groups in our society who up to now have not been participants, people who have effectively been excluded from our system of education. The Fianna Fáil philosophy in the educational context has always been a truly egalitarian one.  We want to help and assist those currently attending third level courses against great odds whether they be evening, PLC or post graduate students, women returning to education or part-time and mature students.  These students have made great financial sacrifices in the pursuit of educational advancement and should not be ignored.</P>
      <P>The recent budget package on third level education ignored and excluded these students, discriminated against them and effectively declared them to be second class citizens in our third level educational system.  It also exacerbated the degree of inequality in the system. The Minister, through the decision to abolish tax covenants, realised extra resources for educational expenditure over coming years.  However, she decided to allocate these resources in one direction only.  No attempt was made to distribute them in an equitable way or to include the category of students referred to in the motion.  In my speech I will deal primarily with the plight of the PLC, evening, mature, part-time and post-graduate students, while my parliamentary colleagues will deal with the need to increase the basic rates of maintenance grant, the students attending designated colleges such as the Mater Dei Institute and the need to prepare a strategic plan to accommodate expanded enrolments in third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without question, the forgotten people in our educational system in so far as the Minister for Education is concerned are the post-leaving certificate students.  This sector has witnessed the most exciting and radical developments in education for decades.  A wide range of courses is provided including horticulture, <Col N="1122" /> fashion, art, sailing, computing, business, health, equitation, estate management, music management etc.  A particular feature of this phenomenon has been the degree to which these courses have been developed locally and are firmly rooted in the community.  For years people referred to the need for curriculum development at a local level and the PLC phenomenon put flesh on that concept.  It allowed many teachers to become creative again, to explore, experiment and inject a new energy and sense of purpose into their lives.  Dynamism, energy and innovation have been the hallmark of the PLC development. Most importantly, these courses are closely related to market needs and linked to employment needs and opportunities. Most of the teachers involved in these courses have developed strong links with business, which interaction provides opportunities not only for work experience but for eventual employment in the marketplace.  To her shame, the Minister has ignored this phenomenon.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 17,500 students attending post-leaving certificate courses this year.  The Minister has estimated that 20,000 places will be available in this sector next year.  Yet students attending these courses receive no maintenance grants and, despite the resources realised by the abolition of tax covenants, the Minister is refusing to use some to provide financial support for these students.  This injustice is further highlighted by the fact that even though the courses are ESF-funded no maintenance grant is available to PLC students, yet maintenance grants are available to students on ESF funded courses in regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology. In addition, many students have to travel to PLC courses which are located in centres such as the College of Commerce in Cork, Ballyfermot Senior College, Dún Laoghaire Community College, Inchicore College, etc.  Students on FAS and CAO-CAS courses can avail of financial support.  The PLC sector is now the only public education sector <Col N="1123" /> whose students have to fund themselves entirely.  These students have to pay rent, buy food and books and meet travel expenses.  Some PLC courses last three years and students are finding it increasingly difficult to survive.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to the representatives of students in this area who have recounted sad and distressing stories of students who have dropped out before the completion of their courses and of students working late at night in pubs and supermarkets in an effort to eke out an existence for themselves, often to the detriment of their studies.  Why is the Minister so callous and uncaring in her attitude to these students?  She may argue that she will abolish fees for these courses but that is a cynical con job which has fooled nobody.  It can even be argued that the abolition of these charges will have a detrimental impact on the PLC colleges which urgently require capital funding to update equipment and provide extra places to accommodate increasing student numbers. The abolition of these charges will rob them of a useful revenue base which facilitates such necessary advancement.</P>
    <P>Considerable confusion surrounds this proposal.  Various charges have developed in PLC courses and some students are charged £25 to £35 to cover materials and services, some are charged up to £70 while others are charged nothing at all.  However, some fees are payable to professional bodies such as auctioneering, accountancy and marketing institutes and it is still unclear whether these will continue.  The crucial issue for these students is the provision of maintenance grants, not the abolition off fees.  Essentially the Minister's decision to abolish university fees will save some families up to £2,500 per year, irrespective of how wealthy they are, while the families of PLC students may save up to £70 per year.  This is the Labour Party's concept of equality and fair play.</P>
    <P>The absurdity of this situation was best summed up by Christina Murphy in an article in the Education and Living <Col N="1124" /> supplement to <i>The Irish Times</i>, in February:</P>
    <P>Then we will continue to have a situation whereby a student from a family with an income of say £16,000 will qualify for a maintenance grant to go to Trinity, but a student with a family income of £8,000 would get no maintenance to go to Ballyfermot Senior College; it will actually be cheaper to go to university than to a PLC course, which is absurd considering the whole idea of PLC courses was to cater for those who did not make the points to get into university.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to respond positively to our motion and to provide maintenance grants to PLC students.</P>
    <P>One way of reducing inequality in higher education and increasing participation rates by those in disadvantaged and lower socio-economic groupings in our society is by adequately funding and resourcing mature students attending third level education.  The Higher Education Authority's steering committee technical working group undertook research in this area and made a number of important recommendations.  In 1993-94 there were 6,665 mature entrants to higher education, of whom 1,697 were full-time and 4,968 were part-time.  It is estimated that mature entrants represent about 16 per cent of all higher education entrants, including part-time and full-time entrants.</P>
    <P>The Minister made no provision in the budget for mature students but essentially ignored their plight.  The Higher Education Authority's report stressed the need to make proper provision for mature, second-chance students and saw such provision as a second and final attempt to address serious inequality in third level education. The report's research indicated that the socio-economic profile of mature students is different from that of non-mature students.  There is a stronger concentration of lower middle class groups in the mature student population and a weaker concentration of higher professionals, farmers and skilled <Col N="1125" /> manual workers in particular.  Studies by the group also revealed that, while mature students may pursue higher education for personal fulfilment, the majority do so to enhance their employment and career prospects.  In a study on full-time mature students it was found, for example, that only 31 per cent were employed, 19 per cent were registered unemployed while 26 per cent were unemployed but not registered and 15 per cent were working full time in the home without pay.</P>
    <P>The group report underlines the importance of this sector in helping to eliminate disadvantage.  It states:</P>
    <P>What is clear from the data available therefore is that full-time provision for mature students in higher education is catering principally for relatively disadvantaged lower middle class people who may have the Leaving Certificate or some other form of professional or occupational qualifications but who are unemployed or not in secure employment.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, however, those from the lowest socio-economic group are still only minimally represented among mature students.  The report cites the absence of pro-active policies within the higher education sector, including adequate financial support for part-time study, flexible modes of delivery and assessment procedures and adequate support and guidance services as factors in making it extremely difficult for economically and socially disadvantaged mature students to enter into and succeed within the system.  Furthermore, the committee's research indicates that lack of adequate financial resources is the principal difficulty experienced by full-time mature students while attending higher education.</P>
    <P>The working group believes strongly that an enhanced level of grant should be introduced for mature students from low income backgrounds and, in addition, that low income part-time students need to have fees paid and be given adequate maintenance support on <Col N="1126" /> a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  It was also noted that mature students have financial problems arising from their adult-related commitments.  The report recommended that the special costs involved for mature students with dependent children should be taken into account in any revised grant support scheme and that individual family circumstances would need to be taken into account in determining eligibility for, and level of, grant support.  It is felt that women were likely to have caring commitments and it was recommended that the unique problems women have in returning to higher education should be systematically addressed when developing grant arrangements.  The unique requirements of minority groups, such as travellers and people with disabilities, will also have to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Primarily, the research of the working group indicated that one of the biggest problems facing the socially and economically disadvantaged mature student entering higher education was reaching a stage educationally, psychologically and economically at which they were in a position to apply.  To deal with this, the working group recommended the development and increased resourcing of the adult, community and further education sectors, so that alternative entry routes to higher education are fully available to those in need of a second chance.</P>
    <P>In the context of that research, it is extraordinary that the Minister essentially ignored these recommendations in putting together her budgetary package, excluded a sector of education which offers opportunities for social inclusion and progression and which has the capacity to break down class barriers in higher education.  She also ignored the recommendations of another report on mature students, the de Buitléir report on the higher education grants system, commissioned by her.</P>
    <P>Mature students on part-time or evening courses are not entitled to any maintenance grant; those studying in full-time day courses are eligible for the higher education grant.  The problem, <Col N="1127" /> however, is that regardless of age, mature students are means-tested on their parents' income if they live at home.  As many mature people giving up a job to go to college would move back to their parents' homes, this is a real catch 22 situation.</P>
    <P>The de Buitléir report recommends that mature applicants over the age of 25 years should be means-tested on their own income regardless of residence. It is disappointing that this has not yet happened.  In Northern Ireland students can get additional grants for spouse and child support.  In short, as pointed out by Olive Keogh in an excellent article on mature students in the <i>Education and Living</i> supplement of <i>The Irish Times</i> of 14 March &ldquo;... for people already working or recently unemployed, the financial support to upgrade their qualifications is woefully inadequate.&rdquo;  She concluded by stating that for many mature people considering going to college to upgrade their qualifications &ldquo;the prospects are very bleak indeed.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There was considerable anger and disbelief by mature students at the decisions to exclude them from the Minister's budgetary package.  A mature evening law student at UCC who, because she is classified as part-time, is excluded from the Minister's fees abolition programme stated:</P>
    <P>I think the decision is very unfair and I am both angry and disappointed that a Labour Minister who should be the first to redress social inequality should have introduced such an arbitrary measure.</P>
    <P>Another student who is studying for a BA by distance learning at a cost of just over £4,000 was equally annoyed and indignant, pointing out that distance education is indispensable in that it allows people access to education who could not achieve a degree by any other method.  An evening Arts student at UCD made the valid point that the term part-time student is essentially a misnomer. She attends college four nights a <Col N="1128" /> week and has practically as many lecture hours as a day student doing exactly the same degree courses.  She articulated her anger in a most forthright fashion by stating:</P>
    <P>... We are absolutely outraged at the way we have been treated by the Minister.  This is blatant discrimination and we are amazed that a Government with Labour and Democratic Left who consider themselves egalitarian could support such a two tier system.</P>
    <P>I quoted from the comments of students who are angry at the Minister's policy of exclusion and elitism.  Their anger is honestly and profoundly felt, and justified. I have also quoted from reports undertaken by the Higher Education Authority on the Minister's behalf.  Yet she has chosen to ignore the de Buitléir and the HEA's working group reports. In the budget and in her fees abolition proposals, she pre-empted their work and in the process created the basis for new and greater inequities in the system.</P>
    <P>The Minister's approach is similar in relation to part-time students in higher education.  The interim report of the HEA's steering committee's technical working group included useful research and work in this area based on a study on participation of part-time students in higher education.  It took as its starting point the OECD definition of part-time students in higher education as those who are enrolled in a programme of study organised in such a way that they are able to undertake another activity either full-time or part-time.  The data available proved to be completely inadequate for the task and the Department should deal with this immediately.  Its findings show that in the academic year 1992-93 almost 24,000 students were registered for part-time third level courses, of which almost 60 per cent were in the regional technical college-DIT subsector.  By far the greatest concentration occured in the main urban areas, with about 75 per cent of students living within 15 miles of the college <Col N="1129" /> attended.  The majority of students attended in the evenings and at weekends. The research indicates that almost 90 per cent of participants were in employment and almost all cited career-related reasons for their participation. Professional upgrading is the predominant objective of participants.</P>
    <P>The report echoes the sentiments expressed by students that the definition of part-time education and the sharp distinction drawn between it and full-time education is difficult to sustain. There are significant variations in required hours of attendance between faculties for full-time courses and there are also wide variations in the required hours of attendance for different part-time courses.  Indeed, weekly or yearly hours of attendance for part-time courses may be equivalent in some instances to those for full-time students, qualifications may be obtained within the same time scale for both.  The distinctions will become even more blurred as time progresses and technologies develop.</P>
    <P>Participation in part-time higher education is good for the economy and very cost-effective.  The funding mechanism for part-time education is inadequate particularly for the regional technical college's and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Subsequently in many cases part-time courses will be provided only where they are self-financing.  This places a particular burden on part-time students who cannot qualify for means-tested grants.</P>
    <P>The working group made two important recommendations calling for a comprehensive review of funding arrangements with a view to (a) achieving a more equitable basis of funding institutions in respect of part-time and full-time on a course to course basis and (b) bringing part-time students within the student grant system to permit them to qualify on a proportionate basis for means-tested grants.  Better facilities are also required for this sector, in particular more induction and study skills courses are necessary for part-time students, particularly for those coming <Col N="1130" /> from disadvantaged backgrounds, and more extensive guidance should be provided relating to college services.  In addition, as part-time students may have more family and community ties, consideration should be given to franchising Outreach centres and to enhancing the provision of distance education.</P>
    <P>In her budgetary package the Minister again ignored the research, work and recommendations of the technical working group in relation to part-time students.  They were excluded and no specific measures were introduced to improve their neglected situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister also discriminated against postgraduate students in the most appalling manner.  It also seems extraordinary that the Minister would not have been aware of the work being undertaken by the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council whose recently published report highlighted very serious under-provision in the post-graduate area.  The report put forward a host of recommendations affecting business, higher education, State agencies and the Government.  It proposed the establishment of a Cabinet sub-committee to deal with matters of science and technology, particularly to settle budgetary and Estimates issues, and to establish national priorities.  One wonders whether, if this committee had been established prior to this year's budget, the fees abolition proposal would have gone ahead in the manner and form it did or whether postgraduates would have been so excluded and discriminated against.  Would the Minister have been allowed to allocate the entire resources to be realised from the abolition of convenants to one sector only, to the exclusion of so many others?  If Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte were honest with us he would no doubt say no.</P>
    <P>The report painted a damning picture of under-provision in the postgraduate area.  The report recommends that basic research funding for higher education should be increased from £1.5 million to £6 million per year and a further £5 million should be made available to redress <Col N="1131" /> the deficiencies in research equipment. Furthermore, it argued that each PhD scholarship should be funded at a level not less than £3,000 per year.  If one listens to any postgraduate student in this area one will hear tales of obsolete equipment, poor library facilities, overcrowded laboratories and inadequate research grants.  The recent budget served only to worsen the situation for postgraduate students.  They will still have to pay their fees and will not benefit from the budget proposals.  Parents who were convenanting to postgraduate children will lose the convenant savings and will gain nothing as their fees have not been abolished.</P>
    <P>The Minister has even ignored the deliberations of the National Education Convention.  In the report on the deliberations of the convention the following conclusion was made:</P>
    <P>It is a matter of great concern that support for post-graduate research students has declined in recent years. Convention participants felt strongly that there was a need for significantly greater support for post-graduate research.  It was argued that the amount of money required was not large and that the universities and society as a whole got a very good return for the money invested in this area.</P>
    <P>Why bother to have such conventions? Why bother to consult?  Why bother to claim an interest in consensus while continually ignoring the recommendations of a convention, the establishment of which resulted in such kudos for the Minister?</P>
    <P>I agree with the report's conclusion that the research capacity of the higher education system is an important national resource and that for the future it is imperative that priority be given to developing its research potential.  If only the Minister could have allocated such priority to the sector in the recent budgetary package on education.  At The National Education Convention a very significant presentation was made <Col N="1132" /> by the Department of Education outlining the cost of educational reforms and change.  The Secretary of the Department presented a schedule of illustrative costings stating that most of these &ldquo;reflect the proposals at the convention&rdquo;. They are also implied by proposals in the Green Paper on Education and Government policy.  On aggregate they amounted to an extra £478 million. The Secretary of the Department drew the following conclusion, &ldquo;Significant improvements in the education system are expensive, education is competing for resources with other policy areas and expenditure and taxation&rdquo;.  He concluded that there would be a need for prioritisation among desirable inputs. The secretariat also concluded that there was &ldquo;striking concordance of view that serious and sustained action needed to be taken to remedy various features of inequality of education&rdquo;.  It was also agreed that a policy of prioritising and targeting areas of most urgency or fundamental need is necessary if real progress is to be made.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Minister did not take on board the views and opinions expressed at the National Education Convention in relation to prioritisation, targeting and the eradication of inequality.  Her budgetary package did not reflect the most equitable use of resources.  It was not fair and excluded too many students in different sectors of our third level educational system, particularly sectors which offer opportunities for advancement for lower socio-economic groups and people who have not traditionally been participants in higher education.</P>
    <P>Many hailed the 1992 general election as a significant one for the Irish Labour Party.  It certainly was significant in a numerical sense, with extra votes and seats.  In retrospect it was also significant in terms of the evolution of that party.  No longer does it cling to its alleged historic mission of creating genuine equality, of being a voice for the marginalised, disadvantaged and <Col N="1133" /> less well off.  It has jettisoned the egalitarian principles of Connolly and Larkin. It is now a party controlled by its new electoral configuration.  Its acquired electoral base now determines its policies. Its guiding principle is the retention of votes and seats, not the social and economic advancement of our people.  Nowhere is this more manifest than in its educational policies.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil since its foundation has always given pride of place to education. We have always believed in the principle of equality of opportunity in education, and it is in that spirit we put this motion before the House tonight.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two strands to the motion before us.  The first is equity and the second is strategy.  The Minister does not seem keen on either.  Equity is one of those respectable buzz words &mdash; there should be equity, equality and parity.  Parity of esteem is etched out on the tablets of stone which we have been given from the Mount Sinai of the Framework Document. However, around Mount Errigal, and also Sleive League, people know what lack of parity means.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has always been a great hunger for education in Ireland, and the more peripheral the area the greater the hunger.  Parents were prepared to make great sacrifices to ensure that their children had the opportunity of availing of further education.  For many years that involved paying fees to allow them to attend post-primary schools, paying the cost of books, foregoing the wages that young people might otherwise have brought to the home, and paying boarding costs.  As Minister for Education, the late Donogh O'Malley changed that nearly 30 years ago.  He removed fees from second level schools, but he did more, he extended provision for school books for those who could not otherwise afford to buy them and, most significantly, he introduced the school transport scheme, the yellow buses that brought the children in rural areas to school.  Times have changed and needs have changed.  Thirty years on we have <Col N="1134" /> one of the highest particiption rates to leaving certificate level of any developed country.  Young people now need the education and training provided at further and higher education institutes and universities.</P>
    <P>The Minister has decided, with the limited resources at her disposal, to take the blunderbuss approach to third level provision and divide what she thinks is the cost of covenants among all full-time day students in the universities and colleges that come to her mind at the time of decision &mdash; she can write herself into the history books.  She will succeed in that.  She will be remembered as having resources never previously available to a Minister for Education, as a Deputy who had the good fortune to be Minister for Education in a period when sound and prudent financial management over a number of years resulted in sufficient funding to make major advances in the provision of third level education.  The Minister has also come to the Department of Education at a time when much of the groundwork had been done by her predecessors.  Instead of equity and fairness she has operated on the principle that to those who have enough more shall be given.  She has ignored the long-term needs of the people in pursuit of what she hopes will be short-term electoral gain.  She has also put immediate tactical advantage before development and implementation of a long-term strategic plan for the development of third-level education. The net result will be unequal treatment for the socially and geographically disadvantaged, the older student, post graduates, women returning to education and particularly post-leaving certificate students.  When she discriminates against the Royal College of Surgeons which has a long and worthwhile tradition of providing medical education for students from developing countries she completes the picture.</P>
    <P>Young people who wish to be a teacher should be wary with regard to the subjects they want to teach.  They should not pick religion, as the Mater <Col N="1135" /> Dei Institute of Education will not be included in the free fees scheme.  Why should the Pontifical University in Maynooth be excluded?  When did any previous Minister for Education manage to discriminate on the grounds of income, age, sex, race and religion in one single measure?  Part of the Minister's problem is that she does not understand the country outside her constituency in the backwoods of Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire.  I am aware that she has toured the country making grand speeches but she moves on before she has time to hear of the issues facing students and parents.  Someone said to me recently that she should stay and listen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is incorrect and I will answer with great enthusiasm, when the Deputy should listen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Parents in Country Donegal will tell the Minister that it is expensive to send children to college. This is borne out by the report of the Higher Education Authority technical advisory group which points out that the rate of acceptance of places on degree courses in Border areas is very low whereas the rate of acceptance of places on diploma courses is highest in the midlands, Border areas and the west. The reason for this is very simple: it is easier to gain access to places in regional technical colleges than to places in university.  The universities are too far away and accommodation is too expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the take-up of places on certificate and diploma courses at regional technical colleges is high the less well off family should find it easier to keep a student on for a year or two on a post-leaving certificate course in a school which is only a few miles down the road.  It would be easier if the Minister provided maintenance grants for PLC students. Two students could take the same course, say, in business studies or accounting technician, one in a regional technical college, the other in a <Col N="1136" /> vocational school as part of a post leaving certificate course, with one in receipt of a maintenance grant.  This is not fair.  When the Minister decided to revise the financial arrangements she should have eliminated this anomaly.  In the past if parents were paying significant amounts of tax they could have provided for their PLC students through a tax covenant and obtain a measure of support but this is no longer an option.</P>
    <P>PLC courses are of particular importance to students from families who do not have a strong tradition of pursuing higher education.  These courses are market driven and relate to real jobs in the areas where the courses are provided. They are proof of those who are sceptical about staying on in education that qualifications lead to jobs.</P>
    <P>If a student secures part-time work, to help meet the cost he should be careful about which shift he works.  If the student studies by day and works the evening shift in a pub, for example, he will have free education.  On the other hand, if he works the day shift behind the bar and attends classes at night he will pay full fees.  It is easy to talk about young people having a right to higher education; they have that right but they need the means.  Donogh O'Malley recognised that when he provided for school transport he was providing the means by which parents and children could exercise their right to education. Many students in County Donegal today would not be able to exercise their right to third-level education without McGeehan's bus.</P>
    <P>Did the Minister ever see the stream of young people walking past the Department of Education on a Friday evening, laden down by text books and the week's washing, heading home for the weekend?  Did she ever see them return on a Sunday night, with provisions for the week, usually stolen from the cupboard and clean laundry, ready to start another week at college?  The cost of travel, accommodation, food, clothes and books is heavy for families with one or more students at third-level. <Col N="1137" /> The cost is particularly heavy for families just above the income limits for grants.  They have a right to expect that they will be treated fairly by the State but they have not been treated fairly by the Minister.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the second thread running through the motion this evening &mdash; strategy.  The Minister has been unfair to PLC, evening, mature and part-time students, women returning to education and to students who attend the institutions listed in the motion.  She does not have a coherent strategy to improve third-level facilities.  We all realise there are complex questions in education to which there are few easy answers but the Minister is required to make her best effort.  This was not her best effort; rather it was rushed, too clever by half and wrong.  Ba chóir don Aire suí síos anois chun na ceartúcháin a dhéanamh.  The Minister should make her corrections and make up to all of those she has treated unfairly since she announced the abolition of third-level fees.  It is very easy to score political points in this House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I sincerely hope that, during her tour of duty over Easter, parents and students will tell the Minister what Deputy Martin and I have been saying to her, that she has lost a wonderful opportunity to make a difference.  There has been much talk about reform and there are great opportunities to be grasped in the field of education but the amendment to the motion is not relevant and says nothing.  It skips over some of the difficult questions and <Col N="1138" /> makes no reference to many of the categories we feel have been treated unfairly.  We look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say but, if she fails to address in a positive and coherent manner the many questions we have put to her, students, parents and those who wish to pursue a career in education will not be happy.  I support the motion.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann commends the Government decision to abolish tuition fees for undergraduate students and for post-leaving certificate students as the first response to the commitment given in A Government of Renewal policy document that there will be new support mechanisms to increase participation by third-level students from low-income backgrounds, including the abolition of third-level fees, a comprehensive reform of the higher education grants scheme, the introduction of support for students on post-leaving certificate courses and an increase in the number of third-level places.</P>
      <P>I am happy to speak on this motion. I regard equality of educational opportunity as a key principle underpinning our education system.  This motion affords me the opportunity to review the actions I have taken to improve access to third-level education generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The action which I have taken in abolishing third-level fees fulfils a policy commitment given in A Government of <Col N="1139" /> Renewal policy agreement, a programme agreed by the Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left parties.  This decision confirms the Government's commitment to promoting the ambitious agenda of achieving greater equality in the distribution of the benefits of third-level education.</P>
    <P>We have to see the abolition of third-level fees as part of the overall funding of higher education.  At the moment the Government pays almost £300 million to third-level colleges through a block grant.  More than half of all students already obtain fee grants.  Thus, the Government provides three-quarters of all university funding and more than 90 per cent of funding of regional colleges. Most courses in the regional colleges are funded by the European Social Fund and no fees are charged for those courses.  Income tax covenant relief amounts to £34 million foregone in revenue this year.</P>
    <P>Most of the costs of ensuring access to third-level education are borne by the Exchequer.  However, the present system is confusing, complex and arguably leads to serious distortions, inefficiencies and inequities.  The Exchequer is already meeting most of the costs of participation at third-level but in an inefficient, inequitable and regressive way.</P>
    <P>Although more than half of all students get fee grants, there is a real problem of lack of public confidence in the higher education grant schemes, which are perceived as unfair.  This perception is reinforced by data emerging from the steering committee on the future development of the higher education sector which indicates that in the period 1986-92 participation rates for lower professional and salaried employees actually declined despite the fact that overall participation rates were increasing.  Thus, abolition of fees is fairer &mdash; it is seen to ensure equal treatment for full-time undergraduate students from all backgrounds.</P>
    <Col N="1140" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been calls in response to my free initiative that fees for postgraduate students and part-time students should also be abolished and that the initiative should be extended beyond the institutions already announced.</P>
      <P>It is worth remembering that, whereas free fees has been a feature of third level education in the UK for about 50 years, the authorities there have not yet extended the benefit of free fees to post-graduate students.</P>
      <P>At undergraduate level, there is increasing difficulty, given the evolution in course structures &mdash; modular courses, distance education courses, etc. &mdash; in sustaining meaningful distinction between what are part-time and full-time courses.  In the past, this distinction for the most part, was quite straightforward. It is increasingly the case that the distinction is becoming more blurred and less clearcut.  I will keep the whole concept of part-time courses under active review in the context of the operation of support schemes for third-level students.  Thus, abolition of fees for full-time undergraduate students is part of a wider strategy as outlined in the programme. A Government of Renewal. This strategy includes the continuing reform of the student support schemes which now relate mainly to maintenance at undergraduate level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since I became Minister for Education I have implemented the following: I increased the income limits in 1993 by 3.4 per cent in line with the average increase in industrial wages; I increased the maximum tuition fee grant limit for courses covered under the higher education grants scheme and vocational education committee scholarships scheme by 10 per cent to £2,200; I gave discretion to the awarding bodies, for the first time, to renew grants and scholarships for repeat years, in exceptional circumstances, in cases of certified serious illness; I arranged for a thorough review of all the relevant scheme <Col N="1141" /> documentation to be carried out, I ensured that the schemes were redrafted and simplified and that the application form was redesigned.</P>
    <P>In 1994 I introduced a further increase in the maintenance grant in line with inflation and in the income eligibility limits in line with wage movements; I abolished the two grade Cs requirement to satisfy the academic requirements of the scheme; I introduced new rules for second chance cases &mdash; this to ensure that students who did not complete studies at a particular level will be eligible to apply for grants to study again at the same level after an interval of five years &mdash; and I provided a discretionary budget to set up a hardship fund with the third-level institutions.</P>

This earlier issue will happen again this year.  In due course I also propose to implement in due course more fundamental improvements to the administration of student support associated with the processing of grant applications and payments by a single office.  These measures will further improve the service to students.</P>
      <P>The abolition of fees for PLC students is being effected at an estimated annual cost of £2 million per annum.  My Department will provide more than £37 million this year towards the running costs of PLC courses in addition to this extra £2 million.</P>
      <P>There has been reference to the issue of extending maintenance grants to PLC students.  However, the provision of a means-tested maintenance grant scheme for PLC students along the lines of the higher education grants scheme would cost at least another £10 million annually.</P>

      <P>I will keep the position of PLC students under review in the context of the resources available to me and decisions about the best use of the overall funding available for education. As Minister, I have been active in enhancing the profile of post-leaving certificate courses; in launching national certification and assessment at level 2 for the first time in 1994; in supporting the ongoing work of the National Council for Vocational Awards, which received almost a 70 per cent increase in 1995 over 1994 levels of funding; in the developments under way to establish a National Education and Training Certification Board and through making funds available for staff development, capital investment and the abolition of fees.</P>
      <P>There has been a dramatic increase in participation in third-level education in Ireland since the mid-1960s.  Total full-time enrolments increased from 23,000 in 1967 to almost 88,000 for the 1993-94 academic year.  Moreover, they are projected to continue to increase and will reach in the order of 120,000 in the year 2005.</P>
      <P>It was during the 1980s that the main increase in participation began.  Enrolments have more than doubled since 1980 from 42,000 to almost 88,000 today.  Our membership of the EU has contributed greatly to increased participation. Funding from the Structural Funds for national certificate and diploma courses in the non-university sector has been a major factor in the increased participation rates.  This is reflected in the enrolments in the non-university sector which increased from 11,000 in 1980 to 35,000 for the 1993-94 academic year, an increase of more than 300 per cent.</P>
      <P>Direct Exchequer support for students has also grown in importance. During the 1981-82 academic year 32 per cent of students received grant aid, by 1993-94, this had grown to 60 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year I made provision for a further increase in third-level places by increasing by 9 per cent the grants in <Col N="1143" /> respect of the running costs of regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology; developing the commitment in A Government of Renewal programme to establish a regional college in Dún Laoghaire and the Tipperary Rural Business Development Institute; increasing the vocational education committee scholarship provision by 13 per cent; and increasing the provisions for ESF student grants by 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>I am planning for the need for third-level places in the future.  That is why I established a steering committee under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority in 1993 to advise me on the future development of the higher education sector in Ireland.  The steering committee has the following terms of reference: (a) to prepare projections to the year 2015 of the total potential enrolments in higher education; (b) to formulate best estimates of appropriate balance in the sector, in terms of intake and total student numbers; (c) within the overall national context, examine the needs for higher education on a regional basis and the appropriateness of the current institutional provisions by region to meet the needs; and (d) having regard to the continuing high demand for places from school leavers and the growing demand from mature students, make recommendations as to the appropriate weighting to be given to mature students in admissions policies.  The committee will also prepare draft integrated proposals for the provisions of third-level education facilities.</P>
    <P>The technical working group established to support the steering committee has already reported to the steering committee and its report has been published. I am now awaiting the report and recommendations of the steering committee together with the views of the Higher Education Authority.  I am confident its advice will chart the directions of a broad-ranging strategic plan for the development and expansion of the third-level educational system well into the next century.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1144" /> The continuing increase in numbers of third-level places is only one part of the overall picture.  The problem of the under-representation of lower socio-economic groups in third-level education is not one which will readily be resolved by merely injecting additional resources into third-level student support. In the absence of measures to address retention of pupils from disadvantaged groups in second level education, significant increases in the level of existing student support grants will have only a marginal impact on the inequitable patterns of participation.</P>
    <P>To achieve this retention a range of initiatives is being and has been put in place.  These include targeting of resources on disadvantaged areas, including intervention at pre-school level; the provision of educational support services for students in psychological and guidance services, career guidance, remedial teachers; the continuing development of the home-school liaison service; a major restructuring of the senior cycle curricula to adapt them to the needs of the wider spread of ability levels and backgrounds proceeding to senior cycle and the introduction, through the establishment of the National Education and Training Certificate Board, of alternative pathways for students to progress to post-second level education and training.</P>
    <P>The importance for students of completion of second-level education is emphasised in the findings of the recent ESRI report &mdash;<i>Poverty and Time: Perspectives on the Dynamics of Poverty</i>&mdash; in its finding that &ldquo;the risk of poverty ... is about five times as high for someone with no qualifications as it is for someone with the Leaving Certificate&rdquo;. The operational programmes for the use of Structural Funds contain resource provision for a range of initiatives, ranging from early childhood intervention programmes, up to restructuring of the senior cycle with the objective of having a 90 per cent completion rate of senior cycle education by the end of the decade. As this objective is attained the participation rates of students from <Col N="1145" /> lower socio-economic backgrounds in third-level will inevitably increase.</P>
    <P>I would say to Deputy Martin that while his obituary of the Labour Party was amusing, his comments undermine the seriousness of this debate.  The Labour Party will answer for itself and to the electorate.  Mention was made of my journeys &mdash; my pilgrimages as I describe them &mdash; the annual pilgrimages of the Minister for Education.  I have already attended a number of meetings and I will shortly set out on my third pilgrimage. I will listen to what people say, I will arrive exactly on time and I will leave at the time agreed with the national organisation that invites me.  I would say to Deputy Coughlan that when I last visited her constituency in Donegal, I arrived on time, addressed the meeting and met the deputation, but I did not stay for a second cup of tea because I wanted to continue my journey across Ireland, to visit schools in Sligo and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>There are one million students participating in the education system on a daily basis.  That is a very large remit for any Minister for Education.  When I travel around the country I meet Deputies &mdash; I met Deputy Martin in Cork&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Without the spirit of partnership established <Col N="1146" /> at the National Education Convention, with which I am honoured to be associated, I would not be able to assure Deputies on the other side of the House that we are moving forward together into the next century for the benefit of the students about whom we are rightly concerned.

      <P>I am confident that the wide range of measures the Government has taken will encourage students to remain in education, will facilitate their paticipation at third-level and will enhance their chances for the future. Education is a long term investment; it is not a ministry with overnight solutions. I presided over the Department of Education also in 1993 and 1994.  This year we are putting in place a programme in which all sides of the House and all partners in education have participated. I am confident we are planning for a successful future for the citizens for whom we have responsibility. The measures I have outlined represent a comprehensive and coherent response to the commitment in the programme for A Government of Renewal to increase participation by third-level students from low income backgrounds.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the rest of this debate and thank the Opposition for paying attention to my remarks.  No doubt we will be able to conclude the debate tomorrow evening having taken on board some of the suggestions that have been made in keeping with the priorities in the Department of Education. As increased moneys are made available to the Department we will respond first to those in most need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion as education plays a significant role in bringing about equality in society.  Recently, I read disturbing statistics in a document entitled <i>Education and Poverty</i> by the Conference of Religious of Ireland stating that up to 8,000 young people leave school each year with poor formal educational qualifications, or none.  In some areas of extreme deprivation more than 25 per cent of those leaving primary school have serious literacy and numeracy problems.  I understand this problem is countrywide and not confined to urban areas, which is the perception.  Conversely, students from high socio economic backgrounds are more likely to attain a leaving certificate than those from unskilled or semi-skilled backgrounds. These stark statistics must be addressed as, unfortunately, they represent our children.  We must ask whether our education system &mdash; which cost £2 billion in 1993 &mdash; has failed.  I do not go that far but the resources should be redirected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, on her achievements since becoming the first Labour Minister for Education in 1992. In this short period she has put the emphasis on additional general resourcing and specific targeting of those resources at primary and second level. The Minister is providing more money per head targeted at disadvantaged schools at primary and second level.  In 1992 the capitation grants for primary schools was £28 per student and this has been increased to £40 per student.  In disadvanataged areas the capitation grant has been increased from £45 to £60 per student and at second level the capital grant was increased from £158 to £165 in 1995.  These increases have been welcomed by parents and boards of management.  Since 1992 the Minister has approved an additional 265 remedial teachers, 190 disadvantaged teaching posts and 90 home-school link persons have been appointed at first and second level.  I have served on the <Col N="1148" /> vocational education committees and on a number of school boards of management in County Dublin and am conscious of the lack of relevance of the standard leaving certificate to many of our students.  I am very pleaed the Minister has decided to introduce the applied leaving certificate programme.</P>
    <P>The abolition of third level-fees is a policy the Labour Party has pursued for many years.  Thanks to the commitment of the Minister for Education and the support she received from her Cabinet colleagues, this aspiration will soon become a reality for all.  This is an important first step in making third-level education accessible to all students and will give heart to many young people who wish to proceed to third-level. The Minister's decision is comparable with that of the late Donogh O'Malley, who introduced free second-level education.  Education is a right, not a privilege.  Of course, other areas must be addressed and the motion before us mentions some of them.</P>
    <P>I support the case made by PLC students for grant aid and I hope the Minister will be able to address these anomalies at an early stage.  I think there is a commitment in the Programme for Government to deal with this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Given the importance of education, there will always be a requirement for significant funding.  In light of this it is galling to hear cries from some politicians and right wing economists to cut public expenditure further, particularly on education.  I could dwell on the needs of first, second and third-level students <Col N="1149" /> in my constituency and I hope the Minister will address their needs in some shape or form.  There is need for a third-level college on the North side and it is my hope and aspiration that it will be located in the general Swords area, which was in the County Dublin Development Plan.</P>

        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I am delighted to have the opportunity to debate this very important subject but I am disappointed by the partisan and unfocused opening address of the party opposite.  In some respects it sounded like a county council meeting where you list all the problems and say that a deputation will be sent to the Minister in the hope that something can be done about it.  It is the type of attitude which decides that the glass is half empty rather than half full and will not give credit where credit is due.  I am happy to support the Minister in what she has done so far in third-level education.</P>
      <P>In 1992 the then Minister for Education, Deputy Séamus Brennan, announced that this would take place under a Fianna Fáil Government.  If Fianna Fáil had still been in office it would have been the first on the night it was announced to claim credit for it, as it did during the past year, particularly during the European and local elections.  When ever you read a Fianna Fáil election leaflet, everything that Deputy Bhreathnach did which was good was to the credit of Fianna Fáil. I am happy to acknowledge that it was achieved by a partnership Government.</P>

      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Kenneally and Noel Ahern.  I congratulate Deputy Martin, spokesperson on education, and the junior spokespersons.  Deputies Flood and Coughlan, on putting down this important motion calling on the Minister for Education to bring forward a comprehensive package of measures to ensure equity for all students attending third-level education courses and specifically calling on the Minister to provide equal treatment for students attending the Mater Dei Institute of Education, the Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosophy, the Royal College of Surgeons, the National College of Industrial Relations, the Pontifical University in Maynooth, All Hallows College and other designated colleges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion further calls on the Minister to provide maintenance grants for post-leaving certificate students; to increase the rates of student maintenance grants under the higher education grants scheme; to provide equal treatment for evening students in respect of fees, grants and access to facilities; to provide equal treatment for post-graduate students in respect of fees, grants and access to facilities; to provide equal treatment for mature students in respect of fees, grants and access to facilities; to provide equal treatment for part-time students in respect of fees, grants and access to facilities; and to introduce <Col N="1151" /> specific measures to assist women to return to higher education.</P>
    <P>Over the past few weeks, I received correspondence from Kerry and Cork students attending the Mater Dei Institute, a teacher training college specialising in the teaching of religious education and arts subjects.  Graduates are recognised teachers in secondary, vocational and community schools. Each post-primary school is required to provide religious education as part of the curriculum.  This requirement is based on parents' rights under the Constitution, the deed of trust of community schools and the Vocational Education Act, 1930.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not mention students at the Mater Dei Institute of Education.  It is the institute's proud record that its graduates secure teaching positions each year. For the record, access to the institute is by way of application processed through the chief executive officer.  Eligible students qualify for grants under the existing higher education grants scheme. At present, 153 of the 221 students at the institute receive grants.  The four-year course leading to the degree of bachelor of religious science includes an arts subject, religious studies and education. The degree is recognised by the registration council for secondary teachers as the equivalent of a primary degree and a higher diploma in education.</P>
    <P>We heard several Government Members say students have a right to free third-level education.  Why should that right not be available to students at the Mater Dei Institute of Education? The need to have professionally trained teachers of religious education in all schools is greater today than ever before, given the pressures experienced by young people.  It is imperative that the course provided in the institute should be available to those who wish to avail of it on the same financial basis as other degree courses in teacher training and third-level colleges.  Over half the student body have benefited from <Col N="1152" /> higher education grants since 1987.  This is based on the principle that the benefit is to the student, not to the institute. Surely the abolition of fees is mainly a benefit to parents and students and should be available to all students as in other teacher training and third-level colleges.  Otherwise it could be said that students wishing to study religion at the Mater Dei Institute and become teachers are penalised.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to prepare a strategic plan for the future development of third-level education which will ensure that extra places and adequate facilities are provided to accommodate the projected expansion in third-level enrolments.  I support the motion.</P>

      <P>I hope she will take note of what I have to say.  The motion refers to equity for all students attending third-level education courses. As one of my party's spokespersons on equality and law reform, I see the word &ldquo;equity&rdquo; on a daily basis.  I wish to speak about equity for the south-east region.  I am returning to a subject I did not expect to raise so soon.  I refer to the ongoing and seemingly endless campaign in Waterford for the upgrading of the third-level facilities available in the south-east.  There was a universal welcome for the report of the technical working group of the steering committee on the future development of higher education issued last January, spelling out the need for enhanced facilities in the south-east.  For the first time proof of what many people had been saying was provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Politicians of all persuasions welcomed the report as did business interests, those involved in education and the general public.  One hindrance to furthering the aims of the south-east <Col N="1153" /> was lack of cohesion on exactly what was required and where it should be sited.  As soon as the technical report was published this more or less stopped. Everyone thought this was the definitive position because of the research on which the decision was based.  The report contains the view of the group that there is a case for the enhancement of degree level facilities in the south-east. It considered this should be accommodated by expanding the existing regional technical college in Waterford which would be upgraded to the status of a higher technological institute. While this would not confer university status, it would take Waterford regional technical college out of the mainstream of other regional technical colleges and allow the region to develop.</P>
    <P>I am conscious of a SERTEC report on technological developments within the EU which was published a few years ago.  According to their league table Ireland came last.  Using the same criteria within Ireland, the south east region comes last.  If this does not prove the necessity for higher technologically-motivated courses within the region, nothing else will.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>When the interim report was published many other regional technical colleges felt they too should enjoy the same advancement as Waterford Regional Technical College. Their arguments were based on the academic levels which had been reached within those institutions and, on that basis, a case was put forward for upgrading. There is little doubt that some of these institutions could sustain such a move but they missed the real point in the report and in the case advanced by Waterford and the south east.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The case was advanced on geographic grounds.  Obviously, there had to be an institute within the region capable of taking on such a challenge.  Such an establishment existed in Waterford Regional Technical College.  The other <Col N="1154" /> regional technical colleges trying to jump on the bandwagon were located in regions which already enjoyed university status.  I am very annoyed at a report which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday which I am sure was leaked in order to try to soften the university lobby in Waterford.  If that was the purpose of the leak it will not work. I and others intend to be heard on this issue until we get what is rightfully due to us.  I know there are vested interests at work in the steering committee on the future development of higher education who do not want the region to be upgraded.  They are not interested in what is right or wrong for the south east or what is in the best interests of the students from that area.  They are interested only in their own patch and making sure there is no more competition. They have a cosy little club and have decided there should be further access to it.</P>
    <P>It seems strange that people with such vested interests are deciding on what is best for the future of higher education. I suggest they are not acting in the best interests of the boys and girls who wish to improve their educational opportunities and who, if the leaked report is correct, will be disadvantaged in the south east compared with their counterparts in other regions.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister for Education to reject what is now being suggested and accept the report of the technical working group.  By doing so she will do what is right and I firmly believe she knows that.  I note that Thurles and Dún Laoghaire are mentioned for enhanced third-level facilities.  These are purely political decisions and there is no objective analysis to support the provision of such educational establishments in these centres.  I note the Minister tonight referred again to a commitment to establish a regional college in Dún Laoghaire, which happens to be in her constituency, and one in Tipperary.  If she wishes to be political about this, I will remind her of a decision taken at the Labour Party conference held in Waterford a few years ago, when she <Col N="1155" /> was in Opposition, which affirmed that it was Labour Party policy to support the provision of a university in Waterford.</P>

A person from Cork pursuing a similar degree in that university city can attend the course by day and is entitled to have fees paid and to avail of grants. The student from Waterford who cannot afford to stay in Cork and must depend on daily lifts is not entitled to a grant.  That is another inequity in the system.

      <P>I congratulate Deputy Martin for tabling this motion, but I am disappointed with the Minister's response.  It was left to Deputy Ryan to <Col N="1156" /> mention problems such as those experienced by private colleges like Mater Dei.  I am disappointed that the Minister did not have good news in respect of those issues.  The admission rate to third-level education in Dublin is significantly lower than in other parts of the country, particularly in respect of diploma courses where admission is exceptionally low, in some cases 35 per cent lower than that which prevails elsewhere. Any examination based on postal districts indicates enormous disparities in terms of access to third-level education.  The report indicated that 15 times more people from affluent areas than from disadvantaged areas attend degree courses.  Young people from disadvantaged areas often do not complete second-level education, and even when they do, their propensity to apply for third-level education is low and their success rate in securing offers is very low, particularly in some parts of the city.  The diploma course acceptance rate by students in disadvantaged areas is quite good.  Dublin has the added problem of students from other parts of the country attending colleges there. That puts pressure on the points system and disadvantaged students lose out.</P>
      <P>As stated in the interim report of the Higher Education Authority on the future of education, the area most in need of a new college is the northern fringe and the report recommends Finglas as an ideal location.  I know Deputy Ryan referred to a development plan and that he has Swords in mind but that is not what the professionals recommend.</P>

Why did the Minister, who announced her free fees policy in such a blaze of glory, spoil matters by omitting some categories?  Why did she discriminate against students attending the colleges I mentioned?  A distinction must be drawn between private commercial colleges and colleges such as All Hallows, Mater Dei and so on.  They are not in the business of making money from the courses they run.  Their sole intention is to break even financially.  The courses run by those colleges benefit society and should be fully supported as other third-level institutions.  They may be private colleges, but they are designated by the NCEA.  Grants were made available under the existing higher education grant scheme to benefit students, not the colleges or the institutions.  Surely the abolition of fees similarly is for students' benefit.  Why has the Minister discriminated against those students? Does she not care about the financial strain being placed on them and their parents?  Why has the Minister classified those colleges differently?  In other EU countries I understand no distinction is drawn between theological or philosophical education courses and other studies.  Is this the usual Labour Party agnostic streak&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Can the Minister not deal with the matter professionally without giving vent to normal Labour Party ideology? Does theological-philosophical education run counter to her party's ideology or is she hell bent on one form of ideology, the gospel according to Dick or Fergus?  Can she not broaden her horizon, consider other forms of education and support other courses? Those colleges are providing good courses and I hope the Minister will reconsider her stance on them.  The degree courses in those colleges are of the highest quality and students, when qualified, generally have little difficulty in securing employment.  Deputy Foley referred to Mater Dei from which it is a bonus to have a qualification.  A qualification from Mater Dei is a prized possession and students with such a qualification encounter no difficulties in securing jobs in secondary or vocational colleges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We need an immediate review of accident and emergency services in Dublin so that further industrial action on the part of nurses which commenced on 15 March and which is to continue tomorrow can be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Problems have arisen in Dublin, with a shortage of acute hospital beds, no co-ordination of accident and emergency services, resulting in ambulances travelling to the same hospital many times while beds in other hospitals remain unfilled.  A cohesive plan is required to deal with overcrowding in accident and <Col N="1159" /> emergency departments in the major Dublin hospitals.  The two ambulance services, those of Dublin Corporation and the Eastern Health Board, are not properly co-ordinated.  We need that co-ordination put in place immediately.</P>
    <P>The Mater and Beaumont hospitals, which are located in densely populated areas, at present take 50 per cent of ambulance calls especially from elderly, who frequently require the services of both hospitals.  This means that both hospitals are subjected to constant incredible pressure.</P>
    <P>There is something inherently wrong when the Minister for Health makes funds available to address bed shortages on the one hand and further substantial funds for the third consecutive year to shorten waiting lists in circumstances in which both problems are interlinked and incapable of separate resolution.  It is imperative that a serious attempt be made to address the problem on a Dublin-wide basis.  While the Department of Health has allocated £8 million to reduce waiting lists, separate new waiting lists are developing because local hospital managements are cancelling elective-surgery patients' admissions. Those patients go on to the waiting lists or return as emergencies to the hospitals that have cancelled their admissions. Local managements are also refusing to accept responsibility for managing the accident and emergency departments. They pass the buck to the Department of Health, who pass it back and, as a consequence, the service to the public suffers.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health is to be commended for proposing a non-confrontational forum within which to examine the accident and emergency difficulties in hospitals but it is important that staff participate so that the onus is placed on the Minister and his Department to convince them that this will not be just another talking shop.</P>
    <P>There is a critical need to evaluate the number of beds available, and put in place a mechanism for ensuring that <Col N="1160" /> accident and emergency patients are divided among available beds, together with the co-ordination of all services to ensure movement and removal of patients in order to free-up urgently needed acute beds.  It is unacceptable that patients have to wait up to 48 hours on beds, trolleys and armchairs in hospitals such as the Mater, Beaumont, the Meath and others.  It is also unacceptable that nurses must work in such conditions and take abuse because of overcrowding.</P>
    <P>The Minister must act quickly to avoid any extension of the dispute to other Dublin acute hospitals.  Nurses become very distressed watching the pain and agony of patients, are subjected to verbal and other abuse and pressure, even at times assault, from agitated relatives demanding why their loved one is not being admitted.  All of us agree that nursing staff do marvellous work.  It is unfair that they should be the victims of the inefficiencies and inadequacies of the Eastern Health Board and the Department of Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should inform Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn that I am replying to her question on behalf of the Minister for Health who is unavoidably absent.</P>
      <P>I should emphasise that my colleague, the Minister for Health, has taken a keen interest in the difficulties being experienced in the accident and emergency services in Dublin.</P>
      <P>As already indicated to the House, the Minister for Health has already made a sum of £850,000 available in 1995 to the Eastern Health Board to help reduce the pressure on the six major Dublin hospitals.  This money has been used to provide nursing home and convalescent beds for people who would otherwise have to be kept in an acute hospital but who no longer require an acute hospital bed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Placing these patients in the type of care most appropriate to their needs is a major component of the strategy to ease the pressure on the acute hospitals. Since 1 January 1995 the Eastern Health <Col N="1161" /> Board has provided appropriate places for 225 patients who have been discharged from acute hospitals in north Dublin.  Putting additional consultant-staffed beds into the acute hospitals, therefore, is not the most effective or efficient way of tacking the problem.</P>
    <P>In general, the six major hospitals can cope with the accident and emergency workload which tends to present itself in terms of peaks and valleys, and delays in admissions do occur from time to time.  Of course this is a matter of regret, but the objective must be to ensure that the operation of the entire hospital, especially the bed provision, is managed in such a way as to ensure that patients are moved to more appropriate care as soon as possible, thus freeing up beds for those awaiting admission.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health is very aware of the need to ensure that the operation of the Dublin accident and emergency service is managed as effectively as possible having regard to the workload of individual hospitals within the system. The service is co-ordinated by a steering group chaired by the programme manager, general hospital care, Eastern Health Board, and includes the six accident and emergency consultants, together with their hospital managers-CEOs. While the primary responsibility for the management of the workload rests with the individual hospitals, this group meets regularly to ensure that the response by the Dublin hospital service to the demands of the accident and emergency workload is effectively co-ordinated.</P>
    <P>As no service is ever perfect, the need to further improve communications between those operating the service has been recognised.  Last week, to this end the chairman of the Dublin Accident and Emergency Steering Committee met the unions involved in this action and agreed to co-opt the accident and emergency ward sisters from the six hospitals involved onto the steering committee.  The Eastern Health Board has also agreed to convene a meeting between the chief executive officers and <Col N="1162" /> consultants from the hospital with the union representatives to discuss accident and emergency services in Dublin. In addition, the Eastern Health Board has agreed to meet the accident and emergency ward sisters from the six hospitals, as the situation in the accident and emergency service demands.</P>
    <P>In respect of Beaumont Hospital, the Minister for Health has been informed that nurses in the accident and emergency department there intend taking industrial action tomorrow.  He has, however, been assured that all patients in need of emergency treatment will receive appropriate treatment at the hospital and non-urgent cases in that area should go to their general practitioner for treatment.  In fact one of the difficulties in the area of accident and emergency services is that far too many people go to the accident and emergency department of general hospitals, especially in Dublin, when they should go to their general practitioner in the first instance.</P>
    <P>During the period of the industrial action tomorrow the Eastern Health Board ambulance control centre will monitor the accident and emergency service in all hospitals to ensure that the workload is spread as fairly as possible and that the effect of the industrial action on patient care is minimised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the record seizures of massive hauls of cannabis and ecstasy over the weekend I wish to record my utter disbelief and outrage at the inaction of the Minister for Justice.  The two massive drugs hauls, worth almost £21 million, seized within 48 hours of one another, no doubt represent the tip of a monstrous iceberg.  There is evidence from those on the ground that the drugs problem facing this country is at a level much greater than that evident in the drugs-rampant early 1980s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the Government doing about this tremendous problem?  It is high <Col N="1163" /> time the Minister for Justice admitted she has no policy to deal with the drugs problem other than a desire to stumble from crisis to crisis while suffering as little political embarrassment as possible. At a time when the country is awash with drugs the Minister for Justice is frozen in studied inactivity, bereft of either a policy or the political will to implement one.  If indecision and prevarication were drugs the entire Cabinet would be high.</P>
    <P>No doubt we can expect the announcement of the usual &ldquo;fix&rdquo;&mdash; the establishment of a committee, policy group or working party which the Minister ingests at the onset of every difficulty to keep her removed from reality. The time for prevarication and indecision is over.  If the Minister is unable to take the lead by announcing a coherent strategy to combat the trafficking in drugs, she should have the grace to follow and implement the concrete steps I have been proposing for some months.</P>
    <P>It is clear that existing legislation is hopelessly inadequate to deal with the drugs crisis.  The Misuse of Drugs Acts, 1977 and 1984, set out to make possession of a controlled drug the primary offence.  That has not succeeded in stemming the flow of drugs into this country nor has it prevented thousands of young people from becoming addicts. It is time for a new policy that will attack the evil of drugs on two fronts. The use of any controlled drug, with the exception of opium, is not a criminal offence.  This must seem inexplicable to the thousands of decent citizens whose lives are made a misery by the demented activities of addicts.</P>
    <P>At a time when the Garda and the forensic science laboratory have the ability and the technology to analyse alcohol or other prohibited substances in a person's blood, the continued absence of any offence relating to the consumption of a controlled drug is an encouragement to addicts and pushers alike.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1164" /> It is intolerable that people who abuse drugs become immune from prosecution the moment the drugs enter their bloodstream.  The Minister could rectify this glaring anomaly within days if she had the determination or the political will to do so.  If her past performances are anything to go by, all we will get is waffle, followed by a committee and prolonged inactivity.</P>
    <P>The criminalising of the consumption of drugs is only one aspect of the overall strategy needed to fight the menace of drugs.  An all out war against the people who import and sell drugs is also needed.  Every weapon at the disposal of the Government, the Garda, the Customs Service, the Revenue Commissioners, the Navy and the Air Corps should be used in this battle.  A coherent and co-ordinated approach to policing our shores and ports must be devised and implemented.  In addition, the proceeds of drug trafficking must be ruthlessly pursued and confiscated.</P>
    <P>I have already pointed out to the Minister that existing legislation does not permit money to be frozen in a bank account in the course of an investigation of a criminal offence.  I have published a Bill to rectify the position.  The Minister has greeted my warning and my Bill with characteristic paralysis.  That is her privilege but it is one she will have to answer for on a future occasion.  I invite the Minister to take the first step in the war against drugs by announcing that she will introduce legislation to outlaw the use of controlled drugs.  This will be the acid test of her commitment.  A Minister who refuses to outlaw the use of drugs is waving a white flag at the pushers and signalling political capitulation to the drug barons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy not think Deputy O'Donoghue was provocative? I think it right and proper to place on the record of the House my appreciation, and that of the Government, of the tremendous efforts of the Garda and the Customs and Excise service in seizing record quantities of controlled substances in recent days.  Last Friday, 31 March, Customs officers, assisted by gardaí from Harcourt Square, seized 2,000 kilogrammes of cannabis resin in Dublin Port.  On Sunday, 2 April the Garda seized approximately 25,000 ecstasy tablets in Dún Laoghaire Port.</P>
      <P>These seizures follow a number of very successful Garda and Customs operations so far this year.  Prior to the seizure of the 25,000 ecstasy tablets, there was a very important seizure of 5,000 tablets in Feburary, also at Dún Laoghaire.  The following day, gardaí seized a half of a kilo of heroin at Dún Laoghaire.  February also saw a major seizure of amphetamine tablets when 1.5 kgs were seized in Cork.  Last month there was a significant seizure of 95 kgs of cannabis resin and, for the first time, a seizure of the drug commonly referred to as &ldquo;khat&rdquo;&mdash; a drug most associated with Somalia.  In so far as the last seizure is concerned, I should make it clear that the drug was seized during trans-shipment through this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will appreciate, I am not in a position to make any detailed <Col N="1166" /> comment on the operations which led to these successful seizures.  Suffice to say that the Garda and Customs personnel deserve all our thanks for their seizures of these drugs.  These are significant seizures which show that the law enforcement agencies are hitting the traffickers where it hurts most.  Most of all, these seizures show there is no substitute for intelligence-driven operations if we are ever to tip the scales against the traffickers.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House, however, that nobody is complacent because of these finds.  On the contrary, the scale of these seizures &mdash; irrespective of whether the drugs in question were intended for this country or elsewhere &mdash; puts the dimension of the drugs problem into perspective.</P>
    <P>In particular, concern has been expressed about the dangers of the drug commonly known as ecstasy.  I fully share these concerns and deplore any effort to present this drug as a harmless, recreational &lsquo;soft&rsquo; drug.  Ecstacy is a dangerous drug which has claimed young lives.  Its association with heroin use has been clearly established.</P>
    <P>The Deputy asks about publication of the report prepared by my Department designed to identify the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem.  As the Deputy will recall, I dealt with this issue when responding to a parliamentary question regarding the recent cocaine find in County Clare tabled by him for answer on 14 March. As I said on that occasion, the report is being finalised and it is my intention to bring proposals to Government, based on the report, as soon as possible.  This remains the position.  I can assure the Deputy there will be no delay in submitting these proposals.  I am fully committed to putting in place, as soon as possible, detailed arrangements to ensure the fullest possible co-ordination and co-operation of the Garda, Customs and Excise and the Naval Service.</P>

When tabling various questions to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment in recent weeks I received stern letters from the office of the Ceann Comhairle stating that the Minister said he had no responsibility to speak to the Dáil on FAS matters.  I found that extraordinary.  I checked the Official Report and found that Deputy Ruairí Quinn and I, on every occasion, replied to Adjournment debates and questions on FÁS matters.  Finally, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment agreed and the Minister of State has come in his stead to reply.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We are here to discuss a very serious matter, community employment.  I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is exercised by this issue.  I recall standing in for Deputy Bertie Ahern, then Minister for Labour, on many occasions when Deputy Rabbitte had numerous questions on the Adjournment seeking the prolongation of social employment <Col N="1168" /> schemes, the commencement of the new SES, the additional numbers on SES or more funds for an SES.</P>
      <P>I have had calls from community groups all over the country complaining that they cannot take on or replace personnel on community employment programmes. I understand the embargo will be in place until at least June, possibly September, and that community employment sponsors are being told tidy towns applications will be dealt with in September.  To tell tidy towns committees that their projects will be given the go-ahead in the month of September is comical in the extreme.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be aware that throughout the country last weekend there were many anxious sponsors who had their proposals ready and many workers had hoped to gain admission to community employment projects.  The cutbacks have hit in several ways.  At the end of 1994 there were 41,900 people on community employment projects.  I never heard such a pathetic, fumbling excuse as the one put forward yesterday by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton, in regard to the estimates for community employment.  He said it was Fianna Fáil's fault that there was no extra funding for the community employment programme.  I wish to remind the Minister for Enterprise and Employment that the estimates were produced by him and, in many cases, were different from those produced by the minority Fianna Fáil Government. While the Minister increased the funding in the budget following dire warnings from me, the reality is that 7,500 people will either drop out of the community employment programme or fail to get places this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is interested in projects in his community.  Community groups have written asking if I will give the go-ahead to their projects.  I have to gently remind them that I cannot give the go-ahead to anything and that all I can do is raise the matter on their behalf.  I am talking about tourism groups, cultural <Col N="1169" /> groups, social groups caring for the disadvantaged, people in education, infrastructural projects, tidy towns projects and museum projects.</P>
    <P>The country is being kept going by FÁS, the people working on these projects and the failure to provide adequate resources raises serious doubts about the Government's commitment to take action on the long-term unemployed. The Minister and the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, have been dodging the issue for weeks by claiming that they have no responsibility for community enterprise programmes run by FÁS.  They can no longer try to avoid this problem and must face the music, so to speak.  This year 7,500 people will be unable to gain entry to community employment as a result of inactivity in this area by the Government.</P>

As the Deputy is aware, the numbers had increased further to 41,993 by the beginning of March.  If we are to survive within the increased allocation of £255.75 million, participation cannot be greater than 35,000 at the end of the year.  The previous Administration had provided for expenditure of £232.3 million only for the programme in 1995.  I want to be very clear on the background to the funding requirements this year.</P>

      <P>I have attended to this matter personally.  FÁS has been requested to manage the reduction to the end-year level of 35,000 as sensitively as possible and guidelines have been drawn up to assist local FÁS offices in managing the programme within available resources.</P>
      <P>The guidelines propose the amalgamation of smaller projects, the staggering of start-up dates for both projects and participants and small reductions in participation levels in projects generally. I am aware that any delay in participation is a source of great disappointment to individuals, local communities and groups hoping to participate in the programme.  Nonetheless the provision of opportunities on the programme for an average of 38,500 persons during 1995 is evidence of the Government's commitment to the provision of opportunties for the long-term unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the context of the increased funding available this year, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Richard Bruton, is engaged in discussions with FÁS on how to ensure the <Col N="1172" /> better management of the community enterprise programme so that maximum value and impact is gained therefrom. FÁS recently undertook an analysis of the operation of the community employment programme in 1994.  This indicates that of the 3,500 sponsors of projects, 44 per cent were involved in community social projects, environmental projects represented 32 per cent and projects in the tourism, education, arts, culture and sport areas represented the balance.  In terms of participants, 57 cent were between 25 and 44 years of age, 26 per cent were over 45 years of age, just over 50 per cent had dependants and the level of female participation increased to 32 per cent from approximately 20 per cent the previous year.</P>

In addition to the funding of £255.75 million provided for the community enterprise programme, a sum of £6 million has been set aside for the establishment of the local employment service being set up on a pilot basis in 14 areas.  This service will bring all the relevant agencies together at local level so as to ensure that their resources and competencies are co-ordinated in a manner tailored to the individual needs of the long-term unemployed person, the ultimate objective being to secure their reintegration into the labour market.  The Task Force on Long-Term Unemployment is continuing its work and will report in the autumn on further targeted measures to tackle long-term unemployment.</P>

      <P>On 16 December 1993, the day after the Joint Declaration and the announcement by the British Minister for Agriculture in the House of Commons that the go-ahead had been given for THORP, I said that the British Government was in effect treating this nation in a cavalier way in regard to THORP.  However, this cannot compare with the cavalier way in which the Government has treated my efforts to raise this issue in recent days.  I have the greatest of respect for the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade, Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan, but I thought that the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, who has had much to say in recent days, or a senior Minister, would have come into the House to reply to this debate.</P>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle and his office were hoodwinked last Thursday.  When I tried to table a Private Notice Question on this matter I was informed that, on the advice of the Department and the Attorney General's office, this matter was not regarded as urgent, but rather an ongoing one.  At the very time I would have been asking the question, if I had been allowed, the Minister of State, Deputy Gilmore, was stating on national radio that the matter was extremely urgent and that the Government was treating it in that way.  He was also meeting a number of members of the STAD group, but he would not come into the House to answer questions on the matter.  I had to raise it another way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's attitude on the STAD case and Sellafield is laudable &mdash; I am sure there is all-party agreement in that regard &mdash; but is contradicted by its attitude to the Fianna Fáil motion on <Col N="1174" /> nuclear weapons and the non-proliferation treaty.  The Government, in effect has sided with the major powers who are in favour of nuclear power.  It did not support our motion.  Many interest groups, in particular Greenpeace and Earthwatch, are disappointed with the Government's attitude to the renewal of the treaty.</P>
    <P>I exhort the Government to row in behind the four courageous people from my constituency who took a case to the courts on this matter when Governments &mdash; including the Government of which I was a member &mdash; failed to do so.  People, particularly those living on the east coast, are very concerned about Sellafield, especially the commissioning of the THORP plant.  With two Deputies from other parties, I visited the plant more than a year ago and was astounded at what I saw.  I came away more despondent than ever.  I was not surprised the British Government gave the go-ahead to the commissioning of THORP because £3 billion was spent on the plant's expansion.  I ask the Government to row in behind the courageous people from my constituency who have, in effect, done what the Government should have done many years ago.  Will it take over the case and indemnify those people who have literally put their lives on the line by taking this case against all the odds?  They were told by numerous legal advisers that they did not have a case.  They have got their case past the first hurdle, but there is a long way to go.  It is incumbent on the Government to support them.</P>
    <P>The Government should also examine the question of transporting hazardous material to and from the plant through the Irish Sea.  We are all aware of the difficulties in regard to Canadian waters and Spanish fishing rights.  The Government should have a say in regard to the transport of materials in the Irish Sea.  Will it take into account the fears of people, particularly those living along the eastern seaboard, and take over this case?</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern for sharing his time with me and express appreciation of the determined efforts of Mark Dearey, Mary Kavanagh, Ollan Herr and Constance Short, the four Dundalk people who took the case to court and were given the go-ahead to sue BNFL, which runs the Sellafield nuclear plant, through the Irish courts.  I also applaud Mr. Justice O'Hanlon for his judgement in the case.  In expressing my appreciation of those four people, I speak from the experience of having twice visited Sellafield.  I first visited it during a protest meeting outside Sellafield and subsequently while participating in an RTE radio programme hosted by Mr. Joe Duffy from the plant.  I came away from both those visits with a feeling of horror and despair, horror at the scale and size of the plant and despair at the intransigence and stubborness of BNFL which is determined not to listen to the genuine concerns of the Irish people about the dangers of the plant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the period of the last Government, in which I served as Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs, every opportunity was availed of to raise this issue at European level. I am sure all Members are opposed to the developments planned for Sellafield, especially the THORP plant.  Until now legal obstacles emerged regardless of the efforts made to take on Sellafield, but this judgment has changed everything which means, for the first time, the door has been truly opened for the Irish Government to take a legal challenge against Sellafield all the way to Europe. Stop THORP Alliance Dundalk &mdash; STAD &mdash; can now proceed with its action against BNFL in the Irish courts, but is not in a position to incur the costs of taking such an action any further. The Government has a moral duty to take on this case on behalf of the four brave people concerned and on behalf <Col N="1176" /> of Irish people in general and must indemnify the costs of their legal action.</P>
    <P>My visits to Sellafield were disturbing. The full commissioning of THORP would increase tenfold radioactive emissions into the Irish Sea.  It would also increase substantially the risk of a major accident at the plant.  On behalf of future generations and for the sake of our children let us grasp this historic opportunity to fight Sellafield where it matters and where it will hurt, namely, in the courts.  Let us fight to win.  Those four Dundalk people have opened the door for the Government.  I urge the Minister and the Government not to walk away at this critical stage. Will the Minister grasp this opportunity? I appreciate he is Minister of State at the Department of Tourism and Trade, but I hope he will speak on behalf of a Government that has given consideration to this matter since it was first raised by Deputy Dermot Ahern and me.</P>

      <P>Like Deputy Dermot Ahern, I was in London on that historic day, 15 December 1993, and I, too, was disappointed the following day when THORP got the go ahead.  I would have thought that in the interim Deputy Ahern would have used his very powerful position to highlight this matter rather than raise it on the Adjournment tonight.  While this is an important vehicle by which to get the message across, we should use every opportunity to make known our views on THORP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years, successive Irish Governments have shared a general national concern about nuclear power <Col N="1177" /> installations at Sellafield, the continuation and expansion of spent fuel reprocessing facilities on the site, including THORP, discharges of radioactive waste into the marine environment and shipments of radioactive materials through the Irish Sea.  It has repeatedly been argued that the only way to resolve Irish concerns about Sellafield is to close the plant.  These views have been conveyed repeatedly to the UK Government, but to no avail.  As a result, the Government has decided something more positive needs to be done to tackle the problems of Sellafield, particularly the threat of pollution and its effect on the health and safety of the Irish public. The Government's policy agreement, A Government of Renewal, sets out a series of actions the Government will pursue in relation to Sellafield.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Stagg, has drawn up a blueprint to implement the various commitments on Sellafield and the Irish Sea, including a reassessment of the legal possibilities of taking a court case against Sellafield and the question of requesting arbitration on THORP's radioactive discharges into the Irish Sea under the Paris Convention on Marine Pollution.  The Attorney General has been asked to advise as a matter of urgency on these legal matters. The blueprint for action on Sellafield is also being studied by my colleagues, the Minister for the Environment and the Minister of State at the Department of the Marine, and it is expected that the inaugural meeting of the task force of Ministers and official experts will take place shortly. The aim of the task force will be to develop a concerted strategy for implementing the Government's proposals on Sellafield, is the first comprehensive initiative taken by any Government to date to tackle the problems of Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The Government considers that the THORP reprocessing plant, which began operations last year, represents an additional and unnecessary risk to <Col N="1178" /> the health and safety of the Irish population. When THORP was originally given the planning go-ahead in 1977, nuclear power was still generally believed to have a prosperous future and reprocessing was thought to be a key factor in the uranium fuel cycle. Today, the arguments for reprocessing are not convincing.  The anticipated expansion of nuclear power has not materialised and the plutonium and uranium recovered from spent fuel are no longer required for reasons of economy or security of supply.  Indeed, they are adding unnecessarily to the huge stockpile of nuclear materials which exists worldwide and which is considered by some countries, including Ireland, to be a major security and political problem.</P>
    <P>During 1993, many requests were made to the UK authorities, by Ireland and other EU member states, to hold a public inquiry into THORP and to have an environmental impact assessment undertaken, but these requests were refused by the UK Government.  The decision of the High Court, which established the jurisdiction of the Irish courts to hear the substantive case brought by a group of Dundalk residents against British Nuclear Fuels Limited concerning THORP, therefore is welcome.</P>
    <P>The four plaintiffs from Dundalk are seeking an injunction to restrain operations at the THORP plant until it has fully complied with the EU directive on Environmental Impact Assessment and also the justification principle under EURATOM legislation.  Ireland and the Attorney General have been named as co-defendants in the proceedings on the basis that the State should have intervened to ensure that EU legislation was fully complied with before the plant went into operation.  On 22 March 1994, Mr. Justice Carney made an order allowing the plaintiffs to serve a plenary summons, outside the jurisdiction on British Nuclear Fuels.</P>
    <P>Counsel for BNFL applied to the High Court on 8 December, 1994 to have the company discharged from the proceedings.  It put forward a motion <Col N="1179" /> seeking to set aside the earlier court order of 22 March 1994 allowing service outside this jurisdiction.  The application of BNFL was heard in the High Court by Mr. Justice O'Hanlon over six days from 9 to 20 December 1994.  Although Ireland and the Attorney General are named as co-defendants in the substantive case taken by the Dundalk residents, the Government also resisted the application of British Nuclear Fuels to have an order allowing service of the summons out of the State set aside.  This is a clear illustration of the Government's commitment to do all in its power to eliminate the threat posed by Sellafield and THORP.</P>
    <P>In his judgement, Mr. Justice O'Hanlon concluded that the original order made by Mr. Justice Carney giving leave to serve out of the jurisdiction was validly made and he, therefore, refused the application to set aside the order giving such leave.  It is understood that BNFL is likely to appeal the judgement to the Supreme Court.  The Attorney General's office is examining the judgement and will advise the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications on its implications and the further action required on our part.  There have been many requests that the plaintiffs should be indemnified by the State in respect of their costs of pursuing the <Col N="1180" /> proceedings.  It was indicated, in response to two parliamentary questions on 24 January, that it was considered appropriate in the circumstances to await the outcome of the case taken by British Nuclear Fuels Limited before reaching a decision, one way or the other, upon that request.  The Attorney General's office will now consider that matter further but if, as expected, BNFL appeals to the Supreme Court, the Attorney General will await that judgement before reaching a decision.  Deputies can be assured that, in the event of an appeal by British Nuclear Fuels to the Supreme Court, the Attorney General and the Chief State Solicitor will be instructed to strongly resist such an application, as in the High Court case.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there is widespread opposition in this country to all operations at Sellafield.  The Government is committed to taking all possible action open to it to secure the objective of the eventual closure of the plant.  Such action includes the possibility of taking legal action if a sustainable case can be shown to exist based on sufficient evidence. As I have already stated, the Attorney General has been asked to reassess the legal possibilities of taking a court case against Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 5 April 1995.</P>

      <P>As announced by the Government on 11 January 1995, the resources allocated to the priority area of Anglo-Irish relations have been strengthened by the creation of a new post of Second Secretary to head up the Anglo-Irish Division in the Department.

      <P>Other key needs arise within the Economic Division of the Department where an additional section will be established to address the consequences for Ireland of the longer term development and enlargement of the European Union; and within the Political Division where a new section will be established to address the important and sensitive issues arising in the area of security and disarmament policy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 42 and 60 together.</P>
      <P>I have consistently emphasised to the British authorities the need to respond to the new situation created by the ceasefires, including giving consideration to the dismantlement of emergency legislation enacted over the past 25 years.  It has been pointed out that this would be appropriate not only in the context of the ending of the campaigns of violence, but would contribute to creating a climate conducive to agreement and political progress.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Prevention of Terrorism Act, we have made clear our view, including indirect contact with the independent reviewer appointed by the British Government to monitor its operation, that serious consideration should be given to the non-renewal of the Act, or at least to allow significant sections to lapse.  While the British Government recently decided to renew the Act in its entirety, it indicated that it would continue to keep the need for existing provisions under close review.  We will avail of every appropriate opportunity to make known our views on this matter, including the contribution which the ending of emergency legislation can make to the consolidation of the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="962" /> An aspect of the legislation which causes particular concern is the provision for exclusion orders.  Our views on this issue were made known to the British authorities at all levels.  They would have been fully aware of these views prior to the recent decision to lift a number of exclusion orders in Britain. While this decision is welcome, the continuing provision for such orders in the legislation is likely to ensure that they remain a source of controversy and public disquiet.  We will continue to make known our concerns in this regard to the British authorities.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland supports the creation of economic and monetary union (EMU) and a single currency in accordance with the timetable in the Treaty of European Union.  The Treaty timetable for movement to the third stage of European monetary union is, briefly, that if a majority of member states meet the conditions, the third stage can begin in 1997.  If a date for the start of the third stage has not been set by the end of 1997, the third stage will begin in 1999.  It is as yet too early to say whether a majority of member states will meet the necessary conditions in time to enable European monetary union to be formed in 1997.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy of successive Governments has been that Ireland should so conduct its affairs as to enable us to be among the first group of countries to move to European monetary union when it is established.  In this context it is relevant to recall that Ireland and <Col N="963" /> Luxembourg were the only two member states not judged to have an excessive deficit when the Treaty excessive deficit procedure was implemented in 1994 for the first time. A Programme of Renewal makes clear the Government's commitment to ensuring that Ireland continues to meet the fiscal conditions set out in the Treaty for participation in European monetary union.  The recent budget was in line with this commitment.</P>

      <P>A special provision of £3.5 million has been made in this year's Vote for the Department of Foreign Affairs for preparations for our 1996 Presidency.  While this amount has been fully allocated for various Presidency-related purposes, most of the actual expenditure will take place in the latter part of the year.  Further expenditure on Presidency preparations will occur in 1996 and the budget for this will be decided later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A wide range of officials in my Department, at home and abroad, is involved in preparations for the Presidency.  Officials in other Government Departments and Offices are also engaged in such work. While it is not possible to give a precise figure for the total number of officials involved, it may be assumed that all officers who work in areas connected with the European Union, as well as those concerned with Departmental management and administration, will be involved <Col N="964" /> in the planning and running of our Presidency next year.  There are no bodies outside the Civil Service working directly with my Department on Presidency preparations.</P>
    <P>The programme of preparations for the Presidency in the period up to 1 June 1995 will involve a continuation of the planning which has been under way since last year.  A number of working groups both within my Department and at the interdepartmental level are working on administrative and policy planning for the Presidency.  A calendar of formal meetings to be held during the Presidency is under discussion with the Council Secretariat in Brussels.  It is my aim, by the summer, to finalise as far as possible my Department's detailed staffing arrangements for the Presidency. Work is also continuing on the identification and preparation of the issues that will arise during our Presidency.</P>

      <P>The resolution that was passed at the 49th United Nations General Assembly last October calling for an end to the US embargo on political, economic and commercial relations between the United States and Cuba envisages a review of the issue at this year's session of the General Assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year's vote took place against the recent background of the opening of bilateral discussions between the US and Cuba.  In considering its position on that occasion, the Government was anxious to encourage that dialogue and <Col N="965" /> allow it time to develop.  As we made clear at the time, our abstention in the vote did not mean that we supported the embargo.  On the contrary, the Government agreed with the call in the Resolution on all states to refrain from promulgating and applying laws of the kind adopted by the United States.  I hope that, before the next General Assembly, the conditions can be created for the lifting of the embargo and the normalisation of US-Cuba relations.</P>
    <P>I must say, however that recent developments in the US Congress on this issue are not encouraging.  The Government is deeply concerned about proposed legislation in Congress which would strengthen the extra-territorial dimension of the embargo.  With our partners in the European Union, we have made clear our opposition to any actions designed to involve third countries in the measure taken by the United States.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach will continue to be guided by what it considers can best contribute to a positive evolution of US-Cuba relations.  We will examine any draft resolution that may be proposed in relation to the embargo at this year's General Assembly on its merit and decide Ireland's position in the light of the circumstances prevailing at that time.</P>

      <P>I wish to see the principle of equality of opportunity and advantage implemented at all levels and in all contexts in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Irish and British Governments are <Col N="966" /> committed to &ldquo;a society in Northern Ireland in which all may live in peace, free from discrimination and intolerance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Most recently, in the Joint Framework Document, the two Governments have stated that we envisage that the arrangements set out in the document will be complemented and underpinned by &ldquo;an explicit undertaking on the part of each Government, equally, to ensure in its jurisdiction in the island of Ireland, in accordance with its constitutional arrangements, the systematic and effective protection of common specified civil, political, social and cultural rights&rdquo;.  We will discuss and seek agreement with the parties in Northern Ireland &ldquo;as to what rights should be so specified and how they might best be further protected, having regard to each Government's overall responsibilities including its international obligations&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I believe that in these discussions the issue of race relations legislation could very appropriately be considered.</P>
    <P>The two Governments have also suggested in the Framework Document that democratic representatives from both jurisdictions in Ireland might adopt a charter or convenant, one of whose components would involve a commitment to &ldquo;the right to equal opportunity in all social and economic activity, regardless of class, creed, gender and colour&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, it is the Government's intention to introduce in this jurisdiction equal status legislation which will prohibit discrimination on a wide range of grounds, including &ldquo;race, colour, nationality or national or ethnic origins&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Against this background, I would favour consideration by the British Government of the introduction of legislation to outlaw discrimination on racial grounds in Northern Ireland, while recognising that the primary grounds on which discrimination has occurred in Northern Ireland have been, and continue to be, those of religious or political belief.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 41 and 59 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish and British Governments have indicated in the Framework Document that we wish to see a comprehensive and inclusive talks process begin as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>We have asked the Northern Ireland parties to study the document carefully and to let us have their considered views on it.</P>
      <P>We believe that the approach proposed in the document offers enormous potential for the achievement of a new and lasting political accommodation between Nationalism and Unionism. We hope that others will recognise this and will accept it as a basis for future discussion.  Both Governments have made clear, however, that we will welcome all other proposals from any quarter designed to meet the same ends.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach and I have made clear our availability for immediate discussions with the parties, separately or collectively, on the way forward, whether as proposed in the Framework Document or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular we would hope that the leaders of the main Unionist parties will reconsider their present position, both <Col N="968" /> in regard to the Framework Document and the overall objective of comprehensive dialogue, which the document seeks to promote rather than preempt.  Pending the establishment of formal discussions, we will continue to seek to advance the process of dialogue with these parties in all the private or informal contacts open to us.</P>
    <P>The goal of comprehensive and inclusive round-table talks, of course, will require the agreement of all potential participants.  Until that can be achieved, both Governments will seek to maximise dialogue on a bilateral level.  I would hope the Northern parties would embark on bilateral contacts among themselves, so as to further the process of understanding, including of the Framework Documents, which unfortunately have unfortunately been misrepresented in various ways for polemic purposes.  Such bilateral contacts at all levels would not substitute the need for comprehensive, round-table, talks. However, I believe, they could be a valuable preparation for them and help to bring them closer by enhancing the general confidence that an honourable accommodation can be achieved, with flexibility and goodwill on all sides.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 50, 71 and 74 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is deeply concerned about the recent escalation of violence in Burundi which was resulted in the deaths of hundreds of innocent people in Bujumbura and the displacement of more than 23,000 refugees to neighbouring Zaire.  According to reports, between 50,000 and 100,000 Rwandan refugees, who had fled to northern Burundi last year, are being forced to move, this time to Tanzania.</P>
      <P>To prevent further deterioration of the situation, the Government considers it important that all political parties and other forces in Burundi should implement the terms of the Convention of Government agreed on 10 September 1994, the provisions of which constitute the institutional framework for the necessary national reconciliation in Burundi.</P>
      <P>Ireland has strongly supported the EU Declaration on Burundi made at the informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers I attended in Carcassone on 19 March.  This was later developed into the common position of the EU on Burundi, of 23 March.</P>
      <P>The main provisions of the common position are:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; a Ministerial troika visited Burundi on 24 March.  The report of this visit, which was under the leadership of the French Minister <Col N="970" /> for Co-operation, Mr. Bernard Debre, is now to hand.</P>
    <P>&mdash; the EU will assist the Burundi Government to organise a national debate to consolidate national reconciliation and reconstruct democracy.</P>
    <P>&mdash; the EU is prepared to lend its support to sending human rights experts to Burundi within the framework put in place by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and the necessary contact will be made with the UNHCR to define the conditions of EU participation.  An amount of ECU 3 million may be contributed by the EU to the funding of this operation.</P>
    <P>&mdash; the EU is prepared to assist in restoring the rule of law and strengthening the Burundi judicial system.</P>
    <P>&mdash; the EU supports the rapid convening of a round table of donors for Burundi.</P>
    <P>&mdash; the EU is prepared to implement, for Burundi, the action plan for refugees which was adopted at the International Conference on Refugees in the Great Lakes region, which Ireland attended, in Bujumbura, last February.</P>
    <P>In the Carcassone Declaration we also undertook to expedite an international commission of inquiry into the assassination of the President and subsequent massacres which took place in Burundi in October 1993.  Such a commission is regarded as an essential prerequisite to national reconciliation because it would break through the culture of impunity which surrounds those suspected of being involved in the 1993 atrocities.</P>
    <P>The EU is giving urgent consideration to the implementation of these measures, particularly those concerning human rights observers, stengthening the judicial system, the convening of a <Col N="971" /> round table conference and the plan of action for refugees.</P>
    <P>Ireland, together with its EU partners, supports the call by the UN Security Council on the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) to continue to use their influence to stabilise the situation in Burundi.  We also strongly favour the holding of a regional conference on peace, stability and security, which has been proposed by the Security Council.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will share the Government's concern for the safety of Irish citizens and aid workers, almost all of whom have now left the country.  The necessary arrangements have been made through the EU regarding contingency plans for those who remain.</P>
    <P>We had extensive contacts with the World Food Programme, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the European Commission regarding the food supply situation in the region after receiving reports of a severe disruption in the food pipeline.  While the immediate shortfall has been bridged, funding remains potentially serious, especially if the situation deteriorates.</P>
    <P>The EU Commission has assured us that it has assembled a stockpile of food in the region which will help it to respond, at least initially, to any contingency. The Commission approved an additional allocation of 12 million ECU in emergency assistance on 9 March, half of which is food aid, bringing the total amount committed by the EU to ongoing emergency programmes to 62 million ECU.  The EU and its member states have contributed generously to the Rwanda/Burundi crisis providing about half of all the assistance that the region has received from the international community since the outbreak of the Rwandan crisis in April 1994.</P>
    <P>The Government has recently allocated a further £750,000 from the Emergency Humanitarian Assistance Fund to meet the emergency needs of refugees from Burundi and Rwanda.  This decision means that Government funding for emergency relief operations in Burundi, Rwanda and neighbouring <Col N="972" /> states during the past twelve months has reached IR£4 million.</P>
    <P>My Department will continue to monitor the situation closely in conjunction with the EU and the international agencies.</P>
    <P>The Government is doing all it can to ensure that the disaster of Rwanda is not repeated in Burundi.  I am glad to be able to conclude on an encouraging note &mdash; however slight &mdash; by referring to the joint declaration which was issued on 29 March in Burundi by the leaders of the Government, the political parties and the military, which is designed to reassure the population and concentrate energies on the pursuit of peace.</P>

      <P>There are hopeful signs that Peru may be emerging from the political and economic instability which has affected it in recent years. The Peruvian authorities have been making efforts to improve the protection of human rights, which has been a source of concern to the international community.  Pursuant to the new Constitution, approved by referendum in 1993, the Peruvian Congress recently enacted legislation establishing a Tribunal of Constitutional Guarantees &mdash; a body which will rule on the constitutionality of legislation and government action. The new Constitution also makes provision for the creation of an Office of the Defender of the People &mdash; which is intended to fulfil a role akin to that of an Ombudsman in relation to the protection of human rights.  The terrorist repentance law, used in the struggle against guerillas of the Shining Path movement and which allegedly led to <Col N="973" /> arbitrary detentions based on false accusation, has been repealed.  Efforts have been made to address the issue of impunity of State security personnel.  In this regard, Congress passed legislation last year which paved the way for the conviction of a number of military officers in connection with the abduction and killing of nine students and a professor from La Cantuta University in 1992.</P>
      <P>Ireland and her partners in the European Union have followed developments in Peru with close attention and will continue to do so.  At the recent session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, the Union welcomed the improvement in the human rights situation there and called on the Government of Peru to pursue its efforts in that direction.  In particular, we stressed the importance of the application of impartial and transparent judicial processes for the consolidation of democracy.  The European Union is also giving practical and political support to the consolidation of democracy throughout Latin America, for example, through its dialogue with the Rio Group of countries, of which Peru is a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress has also been made towards a peaceful resolution of Peru's border dispute with Ecuador through the mechanisms of the 1942 Rio Protocol which defines their common border.  When fighting broke out on the border in January, the European Union expressed its profound regret that, despite the current process of co-operation and integration in the Latin American region, hostilities had broken out leading to the loss of life.  We have supported the mediation of the guarantor States under the Rio Protocol, namely the United States, Brazil, Chile and Argentina, which has led to a ceasefire, the withdrawal of both countries' troops from the disputed area and the deployment of military observers from the guarantor States. We will continue to urge the two Governments concerned to work for a <Col N="974" /> negotiated settlement within the framework of the mechanisms of the Rio Protocol.</P>

It has repeatedly called on all sides to cease all acts of violence to allow for peaceful dialogue and reconciliation and has pointed out that respect for human rights is an obligation on all political forces and individuals in Algeria.

      <P>APSO's target is to achieve 1,250 placements in 1995. This is in line with the Government's commitment to bring about a significant increase in the number of skilled Irish people working in developing countries.</P>
      <P>APSO estimates that about 1,040 of these placements will be long term development workers on assignments of a year or more.  The remaining 200 or so assignees will be on assignments of less than a year, most of them in the field of emergency humanitarian work with Irish NGOs, missionary orders, and international agencies.  APSO also expects to place 70 people in the category of senior service overseas or consultants, and some 20 as election monitors taking part in the Government's programme of support for democratisation in the Third World.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> APSO is funded from the Government's programme of Official Development Assistance, Irish Aid.  As stated in the programme for <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> the expansion of APSO's activities will be based on an assessment of the needs and resources of the developing world.  While it is important that APSO should make every effort to maximise and encourage service by skilled Irish people in developing countries, the quality of service, rather than overall numbers, must remain its paramount concern.  The Government will continue to monitor APSO's activities to ensure that the technical assistance which APSO offers on behalf of Irish Aid will always be of a kind which will promote sustainable development, stimulate linkages with and training of local people and strengthen local human and institutional capacities.</P>

      <P>The assignment of Defence Forces personnel to Irish Embassies has been considered on a number of occasions.  There is no reason in principle such appointments should not be made.  For example, there has been a military adviser from the Defence Forces assigned to the Irish delegation to the CSCE &mdash; now renamed OSCE &mdash; since the 1970s, and an officer of the rank of Colonel is currently serving with the Irish delegation to the OSCE in Vienna.</P>
      <P>The question of whether other such appointments would be warranted in the future will depend on an assessment of Ireland's interests and requirements at the given time.  I will continue to keep the matter under review in consultation with the Minister for Defence.</P>

      <P>I have no plans to change the present system of appointing ambassadors.</P>
      <P>Ambassadors are expected to promote the entire range of Irish interests and concerns overseas, with particular focus on our political and economic interests.  It is therefore desirable that they have a wide range of diplomatic experience, a detailed knowledge of the relevant policy areas and an ability to work effectively in a foreign environment.</P>
      <P>In my view the knowledge and skills required are best developed over the course of a career in the diplomatic service. For this reason it would not be my intention to change the practice of successive Irish Governments of selecting persons for appointment as ambassadors from among our professional diplomats.</P>

      <P>The Preamble to the Statute of the Council of Europe, adopted in 1949, states that &ldquo;it is necessary forthwith to create an organisation which will bring European States into closer association&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For 40 years the division of Europe ensured that this association was limited to the States of the western part of Europe only but the momentous events of 1989 provided an historic opportunity to make a reality of the preamble and <Col N="978" /> construct an organisation of all European States.  Since that time we have seen the organisation grow to its current membership of 34 States.  Almost one-third of this number is composed of the democratic States that have emerged from the collapse of communism.  Seven others, including Russia, have applied to join.</P>
    <P>The Government welcomes this development.  We believe that the enlargement of the Council of Europe to embrace the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe is one of the most important contributions which can be made towards underpinning the stability of the countries concerned and, ultimately, of the Continent as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Council of Europe is now engaged on the task of entrenching its norms and values in these States, with the aim of creating a common political and legal culture throughout the whole of Europe.  This is one of the major challenges for the remainder of the century. The successful accomplishment of this process requires the strongest possible commitment on the part of the Council of Europe's older members.</P>
    <P>I believe that we need to reassess our priorities for the organisation.  We need to acknowledge that the process of enlargement may require substantial change in the overall orientation of the council which for so long has been focused on the established democracies of the western part of Europe.  We need to identify those areas where the Council of Europe can be of most assistance to the new States and, where necessary, increase activities there.  We need to regularly review the programme of assistance to assess the extent to which they are helping to promote reform and target them more effectively, where required.</P>
    <P>However, if the Council of Europe is to make an effective contribution to the stability of the Continent it is essential that its standards are not compromised by the process of enlargement.  Therefore, I welcome the new procedures which have been introduced to monitor member states' compliance with their <Col N="979" /> accession commitments.  However, it is important that these procedures are used constructively to identify problem areas and assist the new member states to overcome shortcomings.</P>
    <P>At the Council of Europe Summit in Vienna in October 1993 Heads of State and Government concluded that the Council of Europe was the pre-eminent European political institution, capable of welcoming on an equal footing and in permanent structures, the democracies of Europe freed from communist oppression.  They agreed that, for that reason, the accession of those countries to the Council of Europe was a central factor in the process of European construction based on the organisation's values.  Ireland fully shares these views and will continue to work actively to assist the Council of Europe through its enlargement process to contribute to the consolidation of peace and stability on the Continent.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Treaty on European Union identifies a number of issues for consideration at the European Union Intergovernmental Conference in 1996. In Title V of the Treaty, which sets out the provisions on a common foreign and security policy, it is specified that Article J.4, concerning questions related to the security of the Union, may be revised at the Intergovernmental Conference.  It is also stated that the Conference convened to review the security provisions under Article J.4 shall examine whether any other amendments need be made to provisions relating to the common foreign <Col N="980" /> and security policy.  Clearly, the intention reflected in the Treaty on European Union is that the Intergovernmental Conference would deal essentially with amendments to the treaty, rather than with specific policy areas such as the control of arms exports to third countries.</P>
      <P>The agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference has not yet been established. Member states and the Commission are free to bring forward for consideration at the Intergovernmental Conference proposals for changes to the Treaty on European Union falling within the areas already identified for review or outside of those areas.  In this context, Ireland will consider whether it would be appropriate for the issue of the control of arms exports to be raised at the Intergovernmental Conference.</P>
      <P>The Government is seriously concerned at the effects of arms exports, especially to developing countries, and has already raised this issue in the European Union as well as in other international fora.  Under the common foreign and security policy, EU member states increasingly inform and consult each other on matters of arms export policy, which remain national policies at this stage.  This process should contibute to the development of more effective controls on the export of arms from EU countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposed establishment of a campus of the University of Ulster at Springvale between West and North Belfast is of major significance both in terms of improving access to higher education and in contributing to the regeneration of one of the most economically and socially deprived areas in Northern Ireland.  The <Col N="981" /> Government has consistently made clear its support for this imaginative initiative, including through the mechanism of the Anglo-Irish Conference, and has encouraged a positive response by the British authorities.</P>
      <P>A feasibility study of the project commissioned by the University of Ulster found that the proposed campus, in addition to taking 3,750 full-time equivalent students, would generate up to 1,500 new jobs.  Experience elsewhere also suggests that the presence of the campus would be helpful in attracting much-needed inward investment.  This is clearly of great importance in an area which has been characterised by high levels of unemployment, poverty and social deprivation.  The projects's potential in helping to promote employment and assist community development has already been recognised by the International Fund for Ireland which announced last November that it was committing £5 million by way of pumppriming support to the cost of the project.</P>
      <P>If the project is to be of maximum benefit to the community, of course it is essential that the community be involved in its planning and execution. Therefore, I welcome the university's intention to work closely with local communities, both by establishing courses which meet the particular needs of the area and by developing a dialogue with community representatives so that the project can move forward on the basis of the widest possible consensus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that the British Government is continuing its examination of the proposal and that a further study of its economic impact is likely to be completed shortly.  I am confident &mdash; on the basis of the extensive research already carried out &mdash; that the proposed campus would make a valuable contribution to the development and renewal of this seriously disadvantaged area.  I will continue to follow progress on this project closely and to encourage a positive response by the British Government in <Col N="982" /> the interests of all the communities concerned in North and West Belfast.</P>

      <P>The monitoring and review of the Inhumane Weapons Convention, Protocol II of which contains provisions prohibiting the indiscriminate use of landmines, in the first instance, is a matter for the States Parties to the Convention.  Ireland ratified the Convention on 13 March 1995 and therefore as a State Party, will, be a full participant in the Review Conference of States Parties to the Convention, which will take place in Vienna from 25 September to 13 October 1995.  Forty nine countries, including 13 member states of the European Union, have ratified the convention to date.  This places Ireland, and the EU, in a position to contribute significantly to the success of the review conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="983" /> The review conference is expected to focus on strengthening those provisions of the convention, contained in Protocol II, concerning landmines.  Ireland favours a total ban on the manufacture, stockpiling export and use of anti-personnel landmines.  We will continue to make every possible effort to convince others, including our EU partners, that a total ban is the desirable objective. The Government believes that this objective would be advanced by the inclusion in Protocol II of the Convention of provisions which would substantially strengthen the restrictions or prohibitions on the use of anti-personnel landmines.  This has been accepted as an important objective of the evolving EU position for the review conference.</P>
    <P>The inclusion in the convention of provisions for an effective verification mechanism is another important objective for Ireland.  The absence of provisions to verify compliance with the obligations imposed by the convention has severely limited the role which the Inhumane Weapons Convention has been able to play in the past.  This obvious deficiency will have to be addressed at the review conference.</P>
    <P>The question of verification is linked to that of regular reviews of implementation. Opportunities for state parties to demonstrate their full compliance with legal obligations which they freely assumed are an important means of reinforcing the credibility of international legal instruments and of building confidence among states.  Regular reviews of the implementation of a stronger Inhumane Weapons Convention would also offer the possibility of taking preventive action in relation to other excessively injurious conventional weapons.  For these reasons, Ireland will work to secure reviews of the implementation of the provisions of the convention at regular intervals in the future.</P>
    <P>The Government hopes that many more countries will adhere to the Inhumane Weapons Convention in the future.  Promoting the universality of the <Col N="984" /> convention is an objective of the EU.  It is important to spare no effort, on the one hand, to secure agreement at the review conference to the strongest possible prohibitions or restrictions on anti-personnel landmines while, on the other, encouraging as many countries as possible to accept and comply with the convention.</P>

The <Col N="987" /> board, although appointed by the Irish and British Governments, is an autonomous body and is independent in its decision-making powers.</P>
      <P>Article 10 of the founding agreement also provided for the establishment of an advisory committee to assist the board.  It comprises civil servants from both Administrations and is co-chaired by a senior official in my Department. The joint chairpersons of the advisory committee attend the board meetings of the fund where they provide advice on policy matters and projects for decision. Nevertheless the board is the ultimate decision maker in respect of all matters pertaining to the fund.</P>
      <P>In addition, in accordance with the founding agreement, the two Governments provide the secretariat which acts as the administrative support for the board.  The fund secretariat have offices in Dublin and Belfast which are staffed by civil servants.  The officials of the fund secretariat based in Dublin are drawn from my Department.</P>

In response to his earlier question, I have described the various ways in which the special historical and cultural links between Ireland and Newfoundland are being recognised. Honorary consuls are normally appointed for different reasons: to look after a sizeable community of local or visiting Irish citizens or to promote particular economic interests.  While these criteria would not readily apply in Newfoundland, I certainly would not <Col N="988" /> exclude such an appointment and am having the matter looked into.</P>

      <P>I am concerned at reports on the situation of the civilian population in Iraq.</P>
      <P>The importation of medical supplies and basic foodstuffs into Iraq is not prohibited by UN sanctions.  In addition, UN Security Council Resolutions 706 and 712 permit the export of oil in order to fund purchases of food, medicines and goods for essential civilian use.  Iraq has refused to accept the terms of these resolutions and must bear some if not all of the responsibility for the continued deterioration of living standards.</P>
      <P>The UN operates a humanitarian assistance programme in Iraq on the basis of a Memorandum of Understanding concluded between the UN and the Government of Iraq in October 1992. This programme concentrates in particular on assistance in the health sector, water supply and food distribution to vulnerable groups.  Over 150 UN personnel are involved in this relief effort, supported by local Iraqi staff.</P>
      <P>Ireland has decided to provide a grant of £100,000 for UNICEF programmes in Iraq, in response to a consolidated UN inter-agency appeal for humanitarian assistance in that country, which was launched on 21 March.</P>

      <P>On 14 February 1995, the EU Commission approved a set of draft guidelines for the Initiative for Peace and Reconciliation.  The draft guidelines are, at present, under consideration by the management committee on EU Initiatives, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, and the European Parliament. When the guidelines are completed, following this examination process, they can be formally adopted by the Commission.</P>
      <P>The two member states concerned will then be asked to draw up an operational programme for the initiative.  In this context, the Government will invite the submission of applications from relevant national and local bodies for assistance under the various headings of the initiative.  The completed programme will be submitted to the Commission for its approval.</P>
      <P>The precise procedures for the implementation of the initiative remain to be determined.  It is the Government's intention, however, to facilitate a widely based consultative process with interested parties in the Border region on all aspects of the initiative.  We wish to ensure that all possible information about it is given wide dissemination at both national and local level.</P>
      <P>As part of the information and consultation process, the Government has decided to convene a conference in the Slieve Russell Hotel in County Cavan on 25 April to which, <i>inter alia</i>, major representative groups from the six Southern counties will be invited.  The Government wishes to provide local and community interests in the Border area with an opportunity to contribute to the preparation and implementation of the operational programme for the new initiative.  It is envisaged that the cross-Border development aspect of the initiative will receive priority attention at the conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious of the need to ensure a high level of co-ordination between the new EU Initiative and existing funding arrangements in the Border region.  This <Col N="991" /> important aspect of the new initiative will be kept under close review during the preparation of the operational programme.</P>

The Sixth VAT Directive provides that such bodies are exempt from VAT.  This means that they do not charge VAT on the services which they provide in the course of their activities but, as a necessary corollary, they are not entitled to recover the tax borne on the goods and services which they purchase in the course of those activities.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 91 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Irish Wheelchair Association is experiencing difficulties in financing current levels of service at the driving school.  As the Deputy knows, current statutory funding for this service is provided through a capitation payment by each health board to trainees approved by the board who pass the regular driving test.  In regard to the level of funding currently provided through the health boards, the association has stated that there is a shortfall in annual running costs of approximately £80,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All health boards have been advised by my Department to pay valid debts within 45 days.  My Department wrote to the health boards on 16 March 1995 asking them to ensure prompt payment of grants to the association in respect of eligible claims.  They were also asked to supply details of eligibility criteria applied by each board so that the extent of uniformity in assessment of claims and payment of grants can be measured and for their views generally on the value of the service.  This information has not yet been received from the health boards.  I have also made arrangements with the National Rehabilitation Hospital for the recoupment of the cost to the Irish Wheelchair <Col N="999" /> Association of providing a driving school service to patients at the hospital.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the association has been contacted by the Northern Ireland organisation Disability Action with a view to developing a 32 county service. I have asked my officials to contact the Irish Wheelchair Association for further information and, following receipt of full information from the health boards, to examine all options for future funding. I will contact the Deputy in due course on the matter.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As health board computerised records do not distinguish between married and cohabiting couples for disabled person's maintenance allowance, payments, compiling the information requested by the Deputy would require a manual examination of approximately 6,000 individual files in all of the various health board community care areas.  As this would take considerable time and effort by a significant number of health board personnel, I do not propose at this stage to request the health boards to supply the information.  I would hope that, when the disabled persons maintenance allowance scheme is transferred to the Department of Social Welfare, computerisation of disabled persons maintenance allowance records will facilitate the provision of this information.</P>

    <P>This agreement was preceded by the 1990 agreement which provided for a series of annual price realignments followed by a 12 month price freeze.  When this agreement was introduced on 1 <Col N="1002" /> August 1990 it resulted in a reduction of approximately 10 per cent in the prices of all drugs and medicines on the Irish market.  The annual price realignments which took place in August 1991 and August 1992 resulted in price increases of 1.7 per cent and of 0.36 per cent respectively.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The provision of services for patients in County Tipperary, (South Riding) is a matter for the South Eastern Health Board in the first instance.  However, I have made inquiries of the board in this matter and have been informed that in April 1993 the person in question was granted approval to have treatment carried out in the United Kingdom which procedure was carried out in June 1993.</P>
      <P>If the person in question requires further attention it is open to that person to contact his/her general practitioner who will be in the best position to discuss the case with the consultant concerned.</P>
      <P>A sum of £100,000 was provided by the Department towards the establishment of a Cochlear Implant Unit at Beaumont Hospital in 1994 and additional funding of £175,000 has been provided in 1995.</P>
      <P>I understand that the first cochlear implant procedure in this country was carried out on 31 March 1995.</P>

      <P>The next assessments are due to be carried out not later than March 1996. The departmental guidelines for the assessments will be reviewed in the light of the findings of the Economic and Social Research Institute study of housing needs which has been commissioned by my Department.

      <P>Details of water and sewerage grants for 1990 to 1994 are set out in the following table.  It would not be practicable to provide a detailed breakdown of water and sewerage grants for the 1985-89 period, having regard to the time available and the inordinate commitment of staff time and resources that would be involved.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school is determined by its enrolment on 30 September of the previous school year.</P>
      <P>The enrolment of the school in question on 30 September 1993 was 61, which warrants a teaching staff of principal and two assistants for the current school year.  The enrolment as of 30 September 1994 was 55 which will warrant a staff of principal plus one assistant teacher for the 1995-96 school year. An enrolment of 58 would have been required in order to retain the post of second assistant.</P>
      <P>The only exceptions to the normal staffing arrangements arise where the maximum class size is being breached, or where the school can be classified as a developing school.  Since the school in question does not fall into either category, it is not open to my Department to depart from agreed procedures.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the post of second assistant will be supressed with effect from the end of the current school year, and the name of the teacher in question has been placed on the panel for redeployment for the 1995-96 school year.</P>

Vocational education committees make their own arrangements for accommodation for these courses from the funding provided in accordance with the relevant schemes.

      <P>As there is a Garda station already located in Raheny it is not clear from the question precisely what information the Deputy is trying to elicit.  The Garda station in Raheny is a district headquarters and has a present strength of 61.  The Garda authorities are satisfied <Col N="1032" /> that the policing arrangements for Raheny are adequate to meet the needs of the area.  However, the position will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that there are no plans to establish a Garda substation in the Raheny district.  In fact, such a move could prove to be counter-productive.  The difficulty with opening a new Garda station, apart from the capital cost involved, is that it would absorb manpower which could be better used on outdoor patrol duties.  The essential point the Garda authorities make is that it is far better to maximise the number of gardaí available for outdoor patrol and crime duties rather than tie up manpower indoors in manning a new Garda station and taking up the additional burden of administrative work which this would inevitably involve.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda at the Bridewell station are aware of the incidents in question and that a member of the local neighbourhood police unit called to the scout den on 28 February.  The member discussed the relevant incidents with the scout leaders and assured them that mobile and foot patrols would pay special attention to the area, particularly in the evenings.  The member has also arranged to maintain regular contact with the scout unit.  In these circumstances, it is clearly incorrect to say that the Garda have treated the incidents with inaction and indifference.</P>

      <P>The general scheme of a juvenile justice Bill was circulated to interested Government Departments and offices on 4 August 1994 for any observations they might have on the scheme.  The scheme was circulated on the understanding that certain policy matters would be subject to ongoing interdepartmental discussions.  The Departments circulated were: Taoiseach, Finance, Health, Education, Environment, Social Welfare, Enterprise and Employment, Equality and Law Reform and Defence and the <Col N="1034" /> offices were those of the Attorney General and Tánaiste.  Observations have been received from all those Departments and offices.  However, in the case of the Departments of Education and Health, the observations dealt only with technical or drafting matters leaving over for discussion certain core policy issues relevant to those Departments and my Department.  Formal discussions are taking place between all three Departments in order to identify and solve all outstanding issues.</P>

      <P>The family income supplement (FIS) scheme is an income support for families on low earnings which attempts to address disincentive problems. A Government of Renewal envisages the replacement of FIS and child dependant allowances with a child benefit supplement.  This will eliminate some of the worst proverty and unemployment traps in the tax and social welfare systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, as part of the Government's overall plan for major restructuring of child income support, the income thresholds for FIS were retained at the 1994 levels.  However, a sum of £103 million in a full year has been allocated in the 1995 budget to improve the child benefit scheme, as a first step towards a <Col N="1037" /> basic income for children.  The monthly payment rate for each child will be increased by £7 from September 1995 which represents an increase of 35 per cent for the first two children and an increase of 28 per cent for the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <P>The cost of the increases in income thresholds for family income supplement was £1.5 million in 1994 and £3.3 million in a full year.</P>

      <Quest>if he will provide an old age pension at a reduced rate to people who reach 66 years with fewer than ten years PRSI in view of the introduction of the scheme for self-employed.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the Social Insurance Fund during the course of a person's career. This condition applies to self-employed persons in the same way as it applies to all insured people.  Accordingly, self-employed people, who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension.  They are, of course covered for survivors' and orphans' pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, self-employed people in that age group who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56 could qualify for the old age contributory pension.  Such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes. Refunds of the old age contributory pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten <Col N="1038" /> years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either old age contributory or non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Detailed consideration has been given by my Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the old age contributory pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time as self-employed contributors less than ten years before pension age.  In this regard, costings done in 1989 estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors, who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned.  The extra rate of contribution which would need to be paid by self-employed contributors generally to finance such an extension would be 2.4 per cent over a 50 year period. Allowing self-employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years' contributions in order to qualify for an old age contributory pension would also be very costly unless the payments made by the individual self-employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis.  The cost to an individual contributor buying rights on this basis would be prohibitive.  The National Pensions Board in its final report &ldquo;Developing the National Pension System&rdquo; puts forward, <i>inter alia</i>, a number of recommendations relating to eligibility for old age pensions, including proposals for a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime. However, they also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for an old age contributory pension be increased from 156 (three years) to 520 (ten years) contributions.</P>
    <P>The report and its recommendations are being studied within my Department at present and I intend, in due course, to bring forward proposals on the issues addressed in the report.</P>

      <Quest>if he will review the present Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994 to 1999, in view of the provision in this programme determining Killarney as a metropolitan area, as a result of which all Killarney tourism projects are now excluded from European Regional Development Fund funding; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny) Enda Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Trade (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, does not determine that Killarney is a metropolitan area, nor does it indicate as a general principle that metropolitan areas are ineligible for European Regional Development Fund funding under the Operational Programme.  Consequently, I can assure the Deputy that, in general, tourism projects in Killarney remain eligible for EU assistance and that the question of reviewing the programme for the reasons indicated by the Deputy does not arise.</P>
      <P>In fact, there is only one reference in the Operational Programme to the exclusion of metropolitan areas, and this relates to a small element of the programme, namely, the selective hotel accommodation improvement scheme. This scheme was established to enable support to be considered, in very limited circumstances, for certain improvements to existing small and medium hotels with a current capacity of up to 100 bedrooms and graded up to and including three star.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the scheme, assistance will be considered in exceptional cases where it is clear that improvements are necessary to bring the premises up to modern international standards in a new or developing tourist area, where accommodation needs cannot otherwise be met and where the proprietors are able to provide satisfactory evidence that they will cater for new tourist business to Ireland.  The main metropolitan areas (which have been defined as the county boroughs of Cork, Dublin, Galway, Limerick and Waterford and the new administrative counties of Dublin) as <Col N="1040" /> well as any works eligible for tax incentives in all special designated areas are specifically excluded from assistance under the scheme.</P>
    <P>Given the limited nature of the scheme and the very high level of applications for assistance already received, it is likely that the Product Management Boards for the Operational Programme &mdash; with whom the decision-making authority resides &mdash; will have to apply the eligibility criteria strictly.  This is likely to have the result that hotels in Killarney will not have access to the selective hotel accommodation improvement scheme, because Killarney is not a new or developing tourist area where accommodation needs cannot otherwise be met.  However, each individual application will continue to be considered on its merits.  Hotels in Killarney, of course, will continue to be eligible for other assistance under the Operational Programme and such support has already been approved this year.</P>

      <P>There are two inspections carried out on private forestry plantations prior to payment of premiums.  The first inspection occurs prior to planting and, on this basis, inspection grant approval is either granted or refused.  Following planting a further inspection is carried out for grant payment purposes.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the Department introduced a scheme which allows certain contracting companies to undertake assessment of plantations prior to planting and at grant payment stage.  In these cases the Department inspects one-third on average at each stage.</P>

      <P>Oyster bed licences and oyster fishery orders were granted historically for the preservation and working of natural oyster beds.  The Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959 retained these provisions but also made provision for fish culture licensing.

      <P>Oyster farming, as opposed to working natural beds, is a recent development and this intensive form of cultivation, as with aquaculture generally, is dealt with by way of licence under the Fisheries and Foreshore Acts.</P>

      <P>I confirm that there was consultation prior to the establishment of Ballyteigue Burrow as a National Nature Reserve in 1987 with the various Departments having relevant responsibilities at that time.</P>
      <P>The then Department of Tourism, Fisheries and Forestry was responsible for aquaculture licensing and for nature reserves.  It consulted the then Department of Communications which had responsibility for the State foreshore, which had no objection to the proposed national nature reserve designation for an area which comprised State owned lands.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Marine which was established in March 1987 was consulted in April 1987 by the Department of Energy which had acquired responsibility for conservation and wildlife, on the inclusion of an additional area comprising State foreshore in the proposed nature reserve.  In response, the Department of the Marine confirmed that it had no objections to the proposal.</P>
      <P>I am aware that from the 1970s BIM has been engaged in assessing areas of possible potential for aquacultural development around the coast including the south east.</P>
      <P>The first application for licensing of oyster growing development in the area was lodged with the Department of the Marine in October 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1048" /> As I advised on 7 February last in a previous reply, the Department requested the National Parks and Wildlife Service on 9 November 1994 to reconsider urgently the extent, if any, to which aquaculture could be accommodated within the conservation area.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service formally advised the Department on 9 December 1994 that any aquaculture development would have an adverse impact on the nature reserve from a wildlife conservation viewpoint and that, consequently, development could not be facilitated within this area.</P>
    <P>No licences for aquaculture have been granted for the area in question. Department officials recently met oyster growers in the area, at their request, to review the situation.  I am advised that the developers will be discussing the matter directly with the National Parks and Wildlife Service in an effort to secure its agreement to their continued operation at existing locations within the nature reserve.  The Department will keep in touch with both sides on developments and is ready to assist as required.</P>
    <P>I can confirm that the technical services of both the Department and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will be available to the developers in identifying alternative locations.</P>
