      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Dr. Jim McDaid.  I call on Deputy McDaid to state the matter of which he has given me notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Standing Order 30 I seek the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss a matter of immediate concern to the people of the six southern Border counties, that is the proposed change in the proportionality of the European Union £240 million package, in that now 20 per cent only of these funds will be available to the Border counties as opposed to 80 per cent in the six counties of Northern Ireland involved in that package.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Having considered the matter fully, I do not consider it to be one contemplated by the relevant Standing Order.  Therefore, I cannot grant the Deputy leave to move the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, may I seek your advice on this matter? How can I raise the issue?  It was well <Col N="314" /> known in advance that the meeting was to take place.  How was it, then, that the three Northern Ireland MEPs attended but there was no representation from this side of the Border?</P>

      <P>The matter to which the Deputy refers this morning is ongoing.  There are many ways and means open to him and to other Members of the House for raising such matters.  My office is at the Deputy's disposal in that regard.</P>

    <Title>Order of Business.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take item No. 5.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 11.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House welcomes the apparent progress achieved yesterday by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs on the draft framework document.  Would the Taoiseach confirm that one outstanding matter is specification of the exact changes the British Government will make by amending or repealing the Government of Ireland Act, 1920?  Bearing in mind that there will be a further meeting tomorrow to tidy up issues and engage in final clarifications, would the Taoiseach ensure that the British Government appreciates that reciprocal change must reflect the same principles and not leave intact any British territorial claim to jurisdiction regardless of consent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy quite some latitude.  I am not at all satisfied that the matter, though very important, is appropriate to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I too would like to say how much I welcome the obvious progress made yesterday by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the <Col N="315" /> Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. I am optimistic that the document will be fair and balanced.  In advance of its publication, would the Taoiseach confirm that he and the Government will use every opportunity, indeed seek out opportunities, through the media and otherwise, to try to allay the fears of the Unionist community?  I urge the Government to seek as many opportunities as possible to allay those fears before the publication of the document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that I am trespassing on your order by answering any of these six questions.  Nonetheless, I look forward to meeting both Opposition Leaders on Friday next, when I will give them a somewhat fuller briefing on progress than it is possible for me to give in circumstances like these.  I pay tribute to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and his officials for all the work they have done.  As has been said, considerable progress was made yesterday.  A number of difficult issues remain, but there is constant, steady progress accompanied by much hard work on all sides.  This process of preparing the framework document dates back a long way, with all of the parties in this House having been involved, in one way or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not be drawn into answering specific questions raised by the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Bertie Ahern. All I will say is that the document will be balanced and fair to all.  There is nothing in it for anyone to fear and it will form a framework for discussion. Every party with concerns or interests to promote will have an opportunity to promote or protect those interests within the discussions that will flow from the document, so that there is no ground for any fear.  I would describe this as a positive &ldquo;sum game&rdquo;, a circumstance in which everybody can gain from the dynamic that will be created by <Col N="316" /> reconciliation of the two communities in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us not have a continuation of the matter.  I have allowed some latitude having regard to the circumstances prevailing but let that be the end of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask the Taoiseach a procedural question.  Would he confirm that the detailed constitutional proposals on both sides will be issued at the same time as the framework document?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, I will not become involved in specifics of that type.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not become involved in detailed procedural questions either.  I consider that appropriate since I have offered a briefing to the Opposition parties, something that was not forthcoming a few months ago&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it is true because I was in Deputy Bertie Ahern's position a few months ago.  It would be better if Deputies Bertie Ahern and Harney would allow me to brief them, as I have agreed to do, on Friday next and in so far as is possible, I will answer their questions then.  It may not be possible for me, even then, to provide full answers to some of their questions and I hope they will understand that. However, I appreciate the constructive approach being adopted by both Deputies Bertie Ahern and Harney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In the Taoiseach's consideration prior to the meeting on Friday next &mdash; while welcoming the progress that has been made &mdash; since he <Col N="317" /> emphasised the discussion nature of this framework document, how does he envisage discussion taking place within this Republic between the parties as well as talks within the Northern Ireland context between the parties there?</P>

      <P>Given the widespread concern, particularly in educational circles about the lack of debate in relation to third level education, promised legislation in relation to the governance of universities Bill and the welcome by the Minister for Education for the need for a debate, will the Taoiseach agree to give Government time for a full debate on the de Buitléir report on the third level grants system?</P>

      <P>I am heartened by the anxiety of Fianna Fáil Deputies to discuss the de Buitléir report in view of the fact that they refused to publish it for several months and it was not published until they had left office.  Their enthusiasm for discussing it now is something I heartily applaud.</P>

      <P>I hope it will be possible for a discussion to take place on this report at the Select Committee on Social Affairs when it is established.  It is probably better that a discussion on a complex report of this kind would take place in a committee setting where a more detailed scrutiny would be possible.However, if the Opposition wishes to put down a motion about the matter in Private Members' time, we will be more than happy to discuss it at that time also.</P>

      <P>I want to raise a matter that concerns the Chair as much as every Member of the House, the serious problem that has arisen due to over supply of milk because of the quota system.  Many farmers in the Munster area face bankruptcy because they have not received payments from their local co-ops and dairy societies.

In view of all that has been said, I ask the Taoiseach to give in on the request to have a briefing today rather than Friday so that he could have the advice of the two Opposition party Leaders in this regard.

      <P>It is without precedent for a Government to offer briefing of the type we have offered to the Opposition.  The only time I was consulted about Northern Ireland by my predecessor was in regard to the terms of reference for the forum.  There was no routine briefing when I was Leader of the Opposition.  The Opposition should appreciate that.  Furthermore, the meeting tomorrow is simply another comparatively routine meeting between officials and there will be further meetings.There is no particular significance in tomorrow's meeting over and above any other meeting.  An arrangement for briefing the Opposition Leaders next Friday has been made.  It is the first occasion, to my knowledge, that the Taoiseach has briefed the Opposition.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the debate adjourned I was referring to the negative role played by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, in this budget and the increases which he had given to social welfare recipients.  Since then I learned of the vast profits made by the banks, as announced by the AIB yesterday.  When we take into account the extraordinary profits announced by AIB yesterday it puts into context the 2.5 per cent increases granted to social welfare recipients, the lowest in 30 years.  The benefits the banks derived from the budget have to be taken into consideration.Since 1987, Fianna Fáil led Governments have not given increases of less than 3 per cent and more often we have given 4 per cent or 5 per cent. The Minister pointed to the increase in child benefit, but over 240,000 pensioners will not benefit from that increase.  In referring to the 1994 budget increases Deputy De Rossa, the Minister for Social Welfare said the miserable level of most of these increases told their own story.  In 1989 he said the failure to provide adequate increases in social welfare payments is particularly cruel although there had been a general increase of 3 per cent and a 9 per cent increase for the long term unemployed. <Col N="325" /> I said last evening this was the first opportunity for a socialist government to show its concern for the weaker elements of society.  Having read the budget and listened to what has been said all I can say is &ldquo;God help the weaker elements in our society&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>For many years I have requested that schemes and benefits generally available to old age pensioners such as free telephone rental, electricity allowances etc. be made available to widows and widowers.  In 1979 when the then Minister for Health and Social Welfare, Mr. Charles Haughey, introduced the telephone rental allowance he considered introducing these allowances for widows and widowers.  Unfortunately that has not happened and all Governments are to blame.  I am disappointed because this is one of the greatest anomalies in the social welfare system where the weakest in society are ignored.  Women whose husbands were in receipt of invalidity pension received all these benefits but when the husband died, the widow lost all these benefits at a time when she was most vulnerable.  The only positive part of the budget is the earlier payment of social welfare increases.</P>
      <P>The old, the widowed, the sick and the unemployed were not the only sectors of society on whose behalf I made pre-budget submissions.  I asked for a full tax allowance for farmers and self-employed and for an extension of the PRSI allowance.  On 1 February 1995 I was assured by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry that these matters were being considered by him. However, I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that he was asked to introduce an 11 per cent stock relief and an accelerated capital allowance for on-farm investment which would allow greater compliance with European Union regulations on milk hygiene, pollution control and all important animal welfare.  That he found it inappropriate to comment on my suggestions may be due to the fact that once again on vital issues he was prepared to do very little.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be less than gracious of me to greet the first budget of a Labour <Col N="326" /> Minister without a word of praise for some of its provisions.  The inclusion in my own constituency of Rothe House and the Lory Meagher Heritage Centre in the list of sporting, cultural and social projects, due to receive aid is most welcome.Those who know me are well aware that I have long been a supporter of both and I am happy to see them get the recognition they richly deserve.  That is where the good news stopped in that scheme.  While I am happy with the inclusion of these two elements from the sporting, cultural and social projects list, as a former Minister for sport I am disappointed with the provisions made for the future of sport in general.  The money allocated to sporting and cultural bodies has proved to be the best investment, pound for pound, made by the State in the interests of our people.  I am proud of the achievements recorded by clubs and associations at all levels in partnership with the Department.  I hope work begun by successive Governments, with which I was privileged to serve, will continue into the future.  The benefits to be gained were so evident that I felt they could not be ignored by any administration.</P>
    <P>The reduction in the allocation made to sports sections of the Department of Education leaves me baffled.  When I left office a short time ago I left £250,000 in the major capital programme budget for many worthy causes, such as the national basketball arena in Tallaght.  I got a reply to a Dáil question yesterday informing me where that money went.  Within the space of two days, on the reappointment of the Minister for Education grants of £150,000 and £100,000 were allocated by the Minister for Education to the Tralee sports centre and to the Kerry diocesan youth centre in north Kerry, respectively.These grants were allocated towards the cost of major refurbishment works and extensions at both centres. That proves that transparency and accountability has gone out the window. The allocations went to the Tánaiste's constituency which had done exceptionally well in the allocations prior to that. <Col N="327" /> Those allocations constitute a slight on the new Minister for Sport.  I left that money there in the knowledge that he would outline his own priorities, but he did not get an opportunity to do so because his partners in Government had ensured that money was spent before he came into office.  That speaks for itself. If one looks at the sporting, cultural and social projects one will see that north Kerry also got more than its fair share.</P>
    <P>Under the sports programme a miserly sum is provided this year, last year it was £25 million but this year it is nearer to £7.5 million.  That shows the lack of interest by this Government in the future of sport and organisations who look after the interests of young people.  I would have thought a modest increase might have left the Minister open to criticism, but the reduction is nothing less than a massive slap in the face to those voluntary bodies who seek to improve life for a wide range of people at a time when leisure and recreation are more important than ever.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a recommendation in the Price Waterhouse report &mdash; the Ceann Comhairle will be interested in this &mdash; that half the Army barracks in the country should be closed down. That is of particular interest to me in Kilkenny and to you, a Cheann Comhairle, in Clonmel.  The Minister should put that report in the waste paper basket.</P>
    <P>Much more can be said on this budget but further comment from me would only show the catalogue of failure, lost opportunity and neglect of those who had every right to expect more from this Government.  The hype is over and we are left to face the reality.  The first budget from a Labour Minister has done nothing to lift the spirits of the underprivileged in society.  The welfare recipient, the widowed and those living alone have seen the gap between them and the reasonably well off even widen. The real beneficiaries of this year's <Col N="328" /> budget have been the professional commentators, but they, like me, can find very little of substance in it.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this year's budget debate.  As a Labour Deputy, budget 1995 is without doubt a historic one for the Labour Party.  It is the first budget in the history of the State to be presented by a Labour Party Minister for Finance, my party colleague, Deputy Quinn.  It is indeed a testament to him that the only criticism about it so far concerns the leaks from his speech to its presentation in the Dáil.</P>
      <P>As the Minister said on 8 February, the purpose of the budget is to reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity.  One of the main aspirations of this year's budget is to get people back to work.  Job creation is undoubtedly the biggest challenge facing this country and the Government must play a leading role in creating the economic conditions which permit more enterprise and boost job creation.</P>
      <P>In the last two years the unemployment rate has been falling steadily and many of the taxation measures in the budget will ensure that the trend continues to move in a downward direction. The outlook for 1995 is very favourable. I welcome the £6 million commitment in the budget for the introduction of an intensive guidance and placement service for the long term unemployed.  This budget will boost job creation and redistribute wealth to the less well-off in society.  It is forward-looking and progressive.I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Deputy Quinn for presenting such a bold and radical budget.  His experience at the Department of Enterprise and Employment will stand to him during his time at the helm in the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="329" /> The people of east Cork are well aware of Deputy Quinn's hard work on their behalf, particularly during the difficult days at Irish Steel.  When other parties were calling for the closure of the steel plant Deputy Quinn stood by both the workers at Irish Steel and the people of east Cork, and we are very grateful to him for that.  In his budget, Deputy Quinn has shown he is determined to implement an economic strategy which improves the living standards of those on low pay and keeps social welfare payments in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>I welcome the £15 million allocation in the capital expenditure programme for Irish Steel which can make a major contribution to the east Cork economy if it is given the opportunity to do so.  I urge the Government to ensure that Irish Steel will still be one of Cobh's biggest industries in years to come.  With my constituents, I await the report of the task force on Cobh which was established by the former Minister for Enterprise and Employment and I hope that his successor, Deputy Richard Bruton will implement its recommendations.</P>
    <P>This budget is the most pro-family budget to be presented in modern times as it contains a series of measures designed to help families.  I welcome the decision to increase child benefit by £7 per month and the commitment to pay £60 million this year in social welfare equality payments.  In particular, I welcome the increase in child benefit which will have a double effect: it will ease the financial burden on parents and will be an incentive to work.  This initiative will give genuine hope to people who have been out of work for long periods of time.  If we do not begin to tackle or address the effects of long term unemployment now, the situation will become worse in years to come.  If long term unemployment is allowed to continue in its present form, generations of families will never have experienced work.  This would be a damning indictment on public representatives.</P>
    <P>The decision to introduce a new tax incentive scheme for seaside resort <Col N="330" /> towns will improve the tourist facilities and amenities in these towns.  I am glad to say that Youghal has been included in this pilot scheme.  It will be of major economic benefit to the people of Youghal, a popular seaside resort which is used by many of the citizens of Cork city and county as well as many foreign tourists.  Over the years Youghal has suffered the slings and arrows of industrial decline, particularly the closure of its textile factories.</P>
    <P>Irish Rail has much to answer for in Youghal's decline as it closed down the train service to Youghal a number of years ago.  This seriously affected the people of Cork city and county as the majority of people used the train service to get to the seaside.  Irish Rail is still treating the people of my own town, Cobh, as second class citizens.  Cobh is an island connected to the mainland by a bridge at the village of Belvelly and by a rail service.  This rail service is very important to the people of Cobh many of whom use it to get to work and students use it to get to college.  Sometimes the train does not arrive on time and sometimes it is replaced by a bus service which is totally unsuitable for the needs of the people of Cobh, Glaunthaune and Little Island.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make funds available to Irish Rail to upgrade the line and replace the existing carriages which are up to 30 years old and leaking.The rolling stock on that line needs to be replaced.  Promises were made in this regard by a number of Fianna Fáil Ministers.  Deputy Seamus Brennan promised a couple of years ago to upgrade the line and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, when opening the Queenstown Heritage Centre in Cobh last year, promised the people of Cobh he would ensure that the Cork-Cobh rail service would be upgraded and rolling stock replaced.  Ministers come and Taoisigh go, but the people of Cobh have to put up with a dilapidated train service which is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I welcome the commitment in the budget to allocate £8 million to the county roads investment programme. <Col N="331" /> As a TD from a rural constituency I urge the Minister for Finance to allocate more funding to this area, particularly in view of the bad weather of recent months, as the county roads are in a very bad condition.  There are some very fine roads throughout Cork, but many of the secondary roads are covered in potholes.  This is unacceptable to the people of my constituency and I urge the Minister to find more money to upgrade these roads.</P>
    <P>This budget reflects Labour's priorities to increase job creation and promote enterprise.  It is, I hope, the first of three budgets to be introduced by Ruairí Quinn.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a week since the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, introduced the budget and in that time an attempt has been made to divert public attention from its contents to the so-called leaking controversy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The so-called budget leaks have received much attention in the media, television, radio and newspapers and have been the subject of much public debate.  The surprise expressed by members of Fianna Fáil at these leaks has been exaggerated.  It has been of the tongue-in-cheek variety.  They have used the leaks as an excuse for not carrying out a factual examination of the budget.  One would think that the Fianna Fáil Deputies who have expressed their horror at the leaks were born again politicians.  They seem to have arrived by parachute from outer space, unaware of the realities.  Fianna <Col N="332" /> Fáil was never backward in terms of influencing the press and using leaks and I take its comments and criticisms with a pinch of salt.</P>
    <P>As the Ceann Comhairle is aware, there has been a revolution in communications since he first became a Member of the House.  At that time Ministers may only have spoken once every three months, their contributions were reported in the press word for word and there was little or no analysis or criticisms.If he was lucky enough, a Minister would open a school or factory, visit his constituency and answer some questions in the House.  There has been a revolution in communications during the intervening period and the media are now much more volatile and competitive.In many respects the media are players in the world of politics. Members of the media follow the movements of politicians morning, noon and night and there is much coverage of political events in both national and local press, radio and national and international television.</P>
    <P>There has also been substantial growth in financial journalism during the past two decades and there is now an army of financial journalists working for television, radio and newspapers. Some of these financial journalists fancy themselves, so to speak, and while they are very good afterwards at analysing what went wrong they are not very good at predicting what will happen.  I wish some of them would tell us what we should do when dealing with a crisis such as the monetary crisis of two years ago.  Their silence was deafening during that crisis but they were very good afterwards at telling us what we had done wrong and what we should have done. Given the world in which we live, it is only natural that financial journalists and commentators should endeavour to anticipate the contents of the budget and analyse it, which is what happened in this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance had little room for manoeuvre this year.  Ireland is a small country on the periphery of Europe with a population of three and a <Col N="333" /> half million people and relatively small gross national product.  The multinational companies operating in the banking, manufacturing and services sector areas have autonomy to set their own agendas and the Minister can only do his best for people.  We live in the fast lane and there is no going back to the old days.  It behoves us all not to indulge in the carping criticism we have heard in the past few weeks or the opportunism we have witnessed in the House during the past week.  Rather efforts should be made to point the country in the right direction and to make positive and constructive criticisms of the budget.  There is very little to fear from constructive criticism and analysis.</P>
    <P>It is time the concept of the budget was changed.  A budget is not a magic panacea pulled like a rabbit from a hat by the Minister.  People seem to think that when the Minister comes into the House with the budget he will pull a lot of goodies out of his hat and everything will be fine for the next 12 months.  That is not how the system works.  The budget is merely a framework for financial action and decision-making in many areas of Government during the coming year.  One could compare it to a household budget for a week, month or year where one has X amount of money to spend and must spend it wisely, must not borrow too much at any given time and must ensure that any borrowings are paid back.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the criticisms which have been made of the budget.  We have been told that we will have a budget deficit next year for the first time.  Yet the same people have criticised the 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare benefits and have described it as miserly. One cannot have it both ways.  Every week during Private Members' time the Opposition criticises the Government for not spending more money in certain areas.  It is very easy for Opposition Deputies, who do not have responsibility for spending even a half penny, to call for the spending of billions of pounds.  I am amazed that Fianna Fáil, <Col N="334" /> having been in Government for approximately 50 of our 75 years of self-government, can throw aside the duties and responsibilities of government when in office and can come into the House a few weeks later with a different philosophy in Opposition.  One must be prudent in Government and one can only spend what is available.  Despite its track record in Government, Fianna Fáil puts down the most outlandish and preposterous Private Members' motions which call for the spending of billions of pounds and do not say where this money will come from.</P>
    <P>Every day Fianna Fáil backbenchers criticise the Government for spending too much money in certain areas.  Yet during the Adjournment debates they condemn Ministers for not spending more money in their constituencies. One cannot have it both ways: one cannot criticise the Government for being over generous in certain areas and at the same time criticise it for not spending enough money.  There is no consistency in the criticism of the Government by Fianna Fáil.  It is merely seeking to make life difficult for the Government and to embarrass it.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of more openness, accountability and transparency in budgets.  I am not too impressed by the criticisms of the so-called leaks.  There should be secrecy and confidentiality in regard to certain sensitive areas, which are few enough in the context of the overall budget.  It is essential that decisions in these areas are protected and that there are no leaks which would benefit certain people at the expense of the public.</P>
    <P>This is a good budget which takes a practical step forward in many areas. While it could have been improved in certain respects, nevertheless I support it.  While an increase of 3 per cent could perhaps have been given to social welfare recipients, the increase of 2.5 per cent is in line with the rate of inflation. No reference has been made to the increase of £7 in child benefit or to the fact that more people will be taken off the dole and given an opportunity to <Col N="335" /> work.  The 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare benefits must be viewed in the context of the overall budget.  We have witnessed much opportunism in the House in recent times.  I hope there is more real criticism of the budget instead of the bogus criticism to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>It may have been possible to allocate more money for country roads, an issue with which we will all have to deal in the next 12 months.  I would favour taking money from some other area and spending it on country roads, many of which are in a very bad condition.  I hope consideration will be given to this issue in the next few months.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of stroke politics. Deputy Aylward referred to the money allocated to north Kerry.  I am not prepared to hide behind anybody from north Kerry or anywhere else and if one preaches about the need for openness and transparency one must stand by that.  If he can prove that north Kerry is getting more money than it should, then I will be the first person to criticise that. It is important that no Minister should use his or her influence and power to ensure that his or her constituency gets more money than more deserving constituencies.People in glass houses should not throw stones.  Deputy Aylward, who has left the House, had responsibility for sport in the previous Government and by all accounts much of the allocation for sports has already been accounted for, if not spent.  A soccer club in my city of Limerick, Pike Rovers, has in its possession for two years a piece of paper guaranteeing it £5,000 but, despite my best efforts in writing to Deputy Aylward it has not been able to secure the money.  I am sure that this can be replicated throughout the country although I am not an expert on this matter.  Perhaps the new Minister of State with special responsibility for sport, Deputy Allen, who is present in the House will address some of those questions.  Deputy Aylward is threading on dangerous ground; it is said that people in glasshouses should <Col N="336" /> not throw stones &mdash; perhaps people in stone houses should not throw glass &mdash; especially if they are in their bare feet.</P>
    <P>I am not in favour of stroke politics, abuses of power and what the Americans call &ldquo;pork barrel&rdquo; politics &mdash; a piece here, there and everywhere &mdash; especially as resources are limited.  It is important that we use our resources in the most advantageous way possible given that we are living on borrowed time.  The money we receive from the European Union will diminish rapidly. Therefore it has to be used to provide infrastructure and invested wisely to guarantee progress in the decades ahead.  It cannot be frittered away.  Too many strokes have been pulled in the past; we have been be devilled by that. It is wrong for people in politics to use their power and influence to take from those who are deserving and give to those who are seeking.  Too many people in politics, including myself, have a blinkered view of the world and do not care where the money comes from or who suffers, be they widows, pensioners or the handicapped, so long as they get what they want.</P>
    <P>In relation to the allocation for sport, it is important that we set priorities.  The way lottery funding has been allocated in the past does not stand up to scrutiny; there has been preferential treatment and no national criteria to ensure that money is allocated to those who deserve it.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to Irish Steel.  It has been suggested that the Government is divided on the future of the company.  This is a red herring to frighten the workers and people in Cobh about the Government's attitude to the company.  I am not in a position to speak on behalf of the Minister of Finance or the Minister for Enterprise and Employment but as a backbencher I have commonsense.  The Government has no intention of reneging on its commitment to Irish Steel, the money will be paid in full.</P>
    <P>It is important that Fianna Fáil which has raised the issue understands that it cannot run with the hare and chase with <Col N="337" /> the hound whereby it calls on the Government to pay one day and questions it the next.  This is not good enough; we have to face reality which is that this is the last big pay day for Irish Steel.  The company has to be made viable and more efficient; in the future it should only pay out what it earns.  The same applies to Team Aer Lingus and other public companies.  The days of dipping into a bottomless pit and shovelling money into any company are over; there has to be accountability.</P>
    <P>Perhaps this is not very romantic the day after St. Valentine's Day, a feast day we did not celebrate when I was a young man though that does not stop me thinking about lost opportunities as impressed in the quotation, &ldquo;in spring a young man's fancy turns to thoughts of love&rdquo;, but some years ago a right wing commentator, Constantine Fitzgibbon, wrote a book entitled <i>When the Kissing had to Stop</i>, a good title for a book. Unfortunately, in the case of Fianna Fáil it has to stop; it is time it changed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the national question, in response to public pressure, Fianna Fáil turns green.  It also changes its colours on the question of public expenditure.  The public are both intelligent and educated and are not prepared to accept opportunism on the part of Fianna Fáil.  The party has an obligation to the public to be serious, responsible and, above all, consistent.  It is time the kissing stopped; we have had enough huffing, puffing and bluffing from the Fianna Fáil benches during the past week.  It has a thick skin and a hard neck and has espoused a philosophy it does not believe in.  Nobody could believe the fairytales.  It is time the budget was addressed and analysed in an honest way.  Members should by all means highlight the flaws; I have pinpointed two.  They also have an obligation to say that this is a good and balanced budget which points the right way forward. Like Deputy Mulvihill I, too, hope that in the next two budgets we can build on the foundation laid by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am in favour of openness, transparency and more public accountability in the formulation of budgets.  The criticism which has been expressed about the leaks must be put in context.  A Minister of State made a mistake and resigned.  For the future I would be in favour of giving the public as much information as possible about the budget and how monetary policy is decided by the Government and the House.  The people should not be kept in the dark; they have a right to know while the media is impatient and volatile and tries to keep up-to-date with the news in the formulation of Government policy in this area.  There is no point trying to pretend otherwise.  I am not upset, shocked or horrified about the <Col N="339" /> leaks.  I am in favour of the Government's policy in this regard.  I hope this heralds a new era, in terms of job creation and Irish economics.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I am pleased to know that one's years in politics does not stem it.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to the general increase of 2.5 per cent in social welfare and pointed out that this is in line with the rate of inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This remains to be seen.  It has been forecast by economists that the rate of inflation will be of the order of 2.7 per cent to 2.9 per cent. Therefore this is the first time that a Government of any hue has provided for an increase which does not match the rate of inflation.  No matter how one tries to get around it, this remains a stark fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced a collective Government decision was taken so that the old and the disadvantaged would not protest or come in groups to TDs' clinics or to the Dáil, that their needs could be dispensed with and a 2.5 per cent increase was enough for them.  That was a serious and damaging mistake but, most of all, it was an insulting one.  It was a studied insult, to use the words of my colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh.  If we do that to people who are old and vulnerable, where does that leave inclusiveness, caring and social concern? Where does that leave the concern that <Col N="340" /> must be shown when dealing with the old, the disadvantaged and those who have no family and no way to defend themselves?</P>
    <P>These people will not form a vociferous lobby.  All of us have mothers, fathers, aunts and uncles, wider families who feel distraught and disturbed as a result of this decision by the Government.It is distinctly odd that Fine Gael, which produced the just society policy back in the early 1960s, has now abandoned every vestige of that just society. That society envisaged an harmonious climate in which people would feel cherished at whatever stratum of society they lived.</P>
    <P>The document, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, which sets out the Government's priorities for its term of office states: &ldquo;Government too belongs to the people.... that relationship must be renewed [that is, Government and people] so that the people of Ireland will have total confidence in Government and in a political system which is fully inclusive&rdquo;.  The budget has effectively defied that dogma as laid out in the programme.  It has not got the confidence of the people, it is not inclusive and it will not promote openness or harmonious relationships between Government and people.</P>
    <P>When the Taoiseach was Leader of the Opposition he spoke every day in the House about the need for the then Government to be open, transparent and accountable.  I was one of the first to applaud the Taoiseach and wish him well on his appointment.  I particularly spoke about the spirit of fortitude which he displayed in difficult times but each day on the Order of Business, the Taoiseach defies that very principle which he himself laid out.</P>

      <P>If this is the way the Taoiseach portrayed himself as Leader of the Opposition, never has there been such a transformation.  I respectfully suggest he should apply for an equity card because he has surely equipped himself with an actor's facility to transform himself so readily.  It is disheartening for democracy that somebody who promised so much in such a short space of time has transformed himself into a robot who will only answer when it suits him, deal with questions that suit him and who has cocooned himself within an army of advisers who tell him when to open his mouth and when to shut it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is confusing, incoherent and inconsistent. There are three missing ingredients. There is not any proper employment strategy, caring social policy or responsible fiscal policy.  As a former school teacher &mdash; for which I am constantly being berated here &mdash; I would mark a D-minus on the report card on all three fronts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent budget and the earlier Estimates were lost opportunities for employment.  With strong end of year financial returns and a forecast of healthy growth, there was a chance to devise a proper employment strategy.  I applaud some aspects of the budget, including the PRSI changes which are excellent.  They are part of the staged <Col N="342" /> process begun by Deputy Bertie Ahern in 1994 which will hopefully continue this year, in 1996 and 1997.</P>
    <P>In general, a fragmented approach was taken in the budget.  Coming from rural Ireland as I do, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, you will be familiar with the saying about Johnny McGrory's dog; he went a bit of the road with everyone. The Minister for Finance's budget goes a bit of the road with everyone but satisfies no one. That is why the reportage of it by respected business economists in all the major newspapers over the weekend was so damning.  It is not correct to name reporters in the House and I will not do so, although it was done yesterday, but one particular business newspaper printed various headings and marked the Minister out of ten on all of them.  He did not gain a D, which is 40, in any of them.  I have kindly given him a D-minus.</P>
    <P>The Johnny McGrory's dog approach of going a bit of the road with everyone leaves one feeling dissatisfied about this budget.  Three measures should have been taken.  There should have been an attempt to retain and consolidate existing jobs, encourage new jobs and tackle decisively the problem of long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>What can we do about retaining existing jobs?  If any of us were in a position to announce a new plant which would provide 40 jobs, the news media would be there and we would never stop patting ourselves on the back.  Yet, from time to time, we seem to blithely allow the opportunity to create jobs slip through our fingers.  There is greater opportunity to consolidate existing jobs rather than to chase rainbows &mdash; perhaps &ldquo;rainbows&rdquo; is not the proper term to use bearing in mind the present climate.</P>
    <P>One of the areas in which jobs can be consolidated and retained is training. When I was involved in labour affairs in the Department of Enterprise and Employment, the then Minister, Deputy Quinn, and I commissioned two reports on training.  One of those was in-house with some outside practitioners and the <Col N="343" /> other was a comprehensive IBEC report which they produced themselves.  These reports were effective and there was a third report on Youthstart.  We are way behind the rest of Europe in training for employment.  Rather than hide behind the White Paper on training, which the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is doing &mdash; if one asks him a question on these matters his reply is that he is awaiting the publication of the White Paper &mdash; he should have obtained agreement at the budget meetings to kickstart his training proposals.  In that way, they would act as a catalyst, particularly in the area of retention of jobs.</P>
    <P>How do we encourage the creation of new jobs?  One way would have been to target the reduction in corporation tax. Deputy Kemmy stated earlier that the Opposition came into the House with irresponsible proposals and he wondered how we could pay for the extra pittance if we introduced a social welfare increase of 3 per cent.  We could pay for it if the corporation tax measure was targeted towards small business. The banks did not seek, and were quite bemused to receive, this windfall of a 2 per cent reduction in corporation tax.</P>
    <P>To the large firms whose representative group said that the budget would not help employment I say that they got a 2 per cent reduction which is a massive retention of money for them and that they should put that towards the retention of jobs or the creation of extra employment.  Likewise let us look at the IDA, Forbairt and the county enterprise boards.  There was definitely a sleight of hand in the Estimates which has shown in replies to parliamentary questions because it transpires that most of the Estimates for IDA Ireland is already committed to plants already in operation here and the amount of money left for new growth or attracting new industries is minor.  It is likewise in regard to the county enterprise boards which could be dynamic.  They have made a very good start.  I compliment them on that and remember with clarity the utter <Col N="344" /> scorn poured on them by Deputy Richard Bruton when he was Opposition spokesman for Enterprise and Employment.On the <i>volte face</i>, the Bruton brothers should become a performing duo on how to change one's views in such quick time.  Deputy Bruton was scathing in his remarks about county enterprise boards.  Now he explains that the money allocated to county enterprise boards is also already spoken for and that a small amount remains for new start-ups and new ideas.  I would think that the way ahead for county enterprise boards is to give them their own financial and operational autonomy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Enterprise and Employment at the time, Deputy Ruairi Quinn and I, as did Deputy Séamus Brennan, developed proposals during our period in that Department.  I would have thought that, two months on, the Minister would have been able to present his proposals to us.  I have spoken to members of county enterprise boards throughout the country.  They are enthusiastic and want to encourage and foster local entrepreneurship and quickly give the green light to people who have good ideas.  However, they must communicate with the Department of Enterprise and Employment in Kildare Street and every £1 has to be cajoled and begged from the Department.It is no wonder not only the people with ideas but the people who serve on the county enterprise boards, often voluntarily, are becoming disillusioned and disheartened because of the slowness of bureaucracy in releasing to them the operational autonomy to do their business.  It cannot be right that an application must be made to the Department for the smallest amount of money.  I ask the Minister to loosen the apron strings of central bureaucracy.  It was never the intention when the county enterprise boards were set up that they would be restricted but that they would be free and able to do their business.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Séamus Brennan, set up the task force on small business during his tenure in the <Col N="345" /> Department of Enterprise and Employment.I note that only 12 of its 107 recommendations have been implemented and 11 partially so.  This is not good enough.  The task force on small businesses was hailed on all sides of the House and in all areas of business as a leap forward in dealing with small firms, particularly firms that were owner managed or owner directed.  However, there is still this tardy approach to it.  I was disappointed that the Minister for Finance did not pay much more attention to the area of small businesses.  He had a chance to do something about the dividend share and to target corporation tax.  Most of all in the area of new job creation a great opportunity was missed because it is well recognised that small businesses are the growth area for employment, where jobs can be created without much fuss or finance.  I would have thought that specific targeted help for small businesses would have been the way forward in job maintenance and job creation.</P>
    <P>The third area where the budget has missed its mark is in tackling long term unemployment.  A distinct trick was tried in the Estimates by portraying the numbers on community as reaching a level above that of 1994.  That is not so. An effort was made to remedy that in the budget by allocating extra money, and I welcome that.  However, there are still many thousand fewer on community employment than when this Government took office in December. There are now 40,400 people following through on community employment projects.  In every village and town in Ireland people are restoring abbeys, compiling genealogies, working on tourism projects, manning schools as caretakers and secretaries and doing infrastructural works in their local communities.  There are men and women who, every day now, have a reason to get up, who go to their place of work where voluntary sponsors are breathing life into ideas.  I know Deputy Allen and the members of his party agree that community life has been shaped and changed by the community <Col N="346" /> employment scheme.  There is no area in Ireland that has not benefited and that does not have a project ready to go for approval by their local FÁS area office.  However, voluntary sponsors are now being told that they will have to wait until March, April or May and that there is no certainty that their project will go ahead, and this is because the Minister for Enterprise and Employment has cut back on the numbers who will be available to work on community employment projects.  It is easy for us, cocooned here in the Dáil to state that fact and leave it at that, but even as I speak I am receiving letters and telephone calls from sponsors who fear that their project will not go ahead and from people who are waiting to take up work. I received a remarkable letter this morning from a young woman, an archaeological student, who has finished her degree in archaeology.  She was expecting to start on a dig involving the restoration of an archaeological historic project.  She has been told that she cannot start her project because FÁS has not received its allocation and the growing uncertainty about the numbers that will be allowed to be placed on such projects.  I have every reason to hope that the Minister shares this concern with me and will work to cover this deficit.</P>
    <P>I certainly welcome the £6 million towards special approaches to long term unemployment which will include direct counselling which will enable the long term unemployed to feel they are not just numbers, not just a group but that each person is an individual with individual needs with potential and hope for the future.</P>
    <P>We speak of the unemployed as a mass, but 50 per cent of those out of work are long term unemployed and the number is growing.  It is horrific and a moral issue not just for the Opposition or Government but for society.  When thinking about unemployment it is the group rather than the individual that comes to mind but it is the individual to whom we should look.  I have noticed from reading economic reports that the <Col N="347" /> countries that have had the best result in tackling unemployment are countries that have given it an intensity of intention where it figures daily on the national agenda, such as Austria, Switzerland where the alleviation of unemployment is the major task of Government.I would encourage such an approach here.</P>
    <P>Together with my colleagues, Deputies Dempsey and Cowen I was involved in talks on the formation of a Government with our Labour Party colleagues, Deputies Quinn, Taylor and Howlin &mdash; those far off days, it seems like 20 years ago although it was only three months ago.  During those meetings I put forward a proposal that each region would target numerically the number of long term unemployed so that there would be an objective towards which to aim and each region would be encouraged to provide not only the total employment-unemployment statistics each month but the long term unemployment statistics thus helping to focus attention on that number of people.</P>
    <P>That was part of our policy programme with the Labour Party but it was, strangely, missing from the &ldquo;green book&rdquo;, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>.  The &ldquo;green book&rdquo; of openness, transparency and accountability was to be the basis of a Government of renewal but surely the first step towards renewal should be care and concern for the long term unemployed.  This proposal is omitted and was removed from the Government of renewal document&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We commissioned a report from the ERSI and UCD on work-sharing, issues and options.  We were briefed on it in October but as we left office in November we never saw the final document.  I have been told that it had been furnished to the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton.  It was part of the previous Government's programme that on completion of that report, budgetary measures would be put in place which would make work-sharing an attractive option and a measure to alleviate unemployment.I am reliably informed that the title of the report is Work-sharing, Issues and Options.  Certainly Deputy Quinn's budget did not contain any measures which would make it attractive for employers to offer work-sharing to employees.  Conspiracy would be too strong a word but I think there is a mutual understanding that this report should not be published or the matter debated.  It was the basis of a very good report and I would like to see it published.</P>
      <P>Deputy Quinn outlined a range of measures to phase out convenants.  Next to the 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare payments, which was despicable and sad in the extreme, is the way the covenant issue was dealt with.  I am talking about covenants in general.  Deputy Quinn has left a maelstrom of deep worry particularly among those who care for elderly relatives.  I note in particular the worries of the Alzheimer Society and others who have parents or relatives in long term institutional care, such as the person who telephoned me last night.  She told me that there were three in their family and they wanted their mother to live in as near a homely environment as possible in her old age. They had clubbed together and were paying, with whatever small pension she had, for her to stay in a private nursing home.  The covenant measures as outlined by Deputy Quinn will mean that that small comfort that her children were able to provide for their mother will have to change as the new covenant procedures come into effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="349" /> I ask the Minister for Finance to think carefully about the covenant scheme before he produces the Finance Bill. Our party spokesman, Deputy McCreevy, will be tabling amendments on this matter but I wish to record what has been said to me at clinics, in letters and in telephone calls.  It seems that in an effort to indulge the whims and fantasies of his colleague, Deputy Bhreathnach, the very worthwhile measures in the covenant scheme will be thrown aside so that the Minister for Education can portray herself as a socialist Minister &mdash; but never was a title so misjudged.To be a socialist means in general that you seek to help the disadvantaged to attain parity of esteem with others in society but her measures will positively discriminate against the disadvantaged in favour of the well off. Everybody has asked that the levels of maintenance grants be raised substantially as this would enable young people and their parents to get on the first rung of the ladder of third level education. The covenant system provided hope but this has been stripped from them.  The increase in the maintenance grants will be the nominal consumer price index increase, if that alone.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bhreathnach had a chance to give a real leg up to middle income earners on PAYE, whose children have a chance to go to college but cannot take it because they are at the wrong level of income.  If the Minister raised the income threshold and raised the maintenance grant she would at one fell swoop have &ldquo;middle Ireland&rdquo; included in the educational proposals. Instead she chose to go the route of helping the well off to the disadvantage of the middle class and the disadvantaged.I urge a rethink on that proposal.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have had the opportunity of addressing the House on budget 1995, a confused, incoherent and inconsistent budget with a report card rating of D minus.</P>

      <P>I propose to outline the current position and planned programme in the areas of sport, youth and local government reform.  The increased allocation for sport in 1995 will allow me to continue to assist in the promotion and development of sport at all levels this year.  This is a very important, indeed critical, year in international sport as the preparation for the Olympic Games in Atlanta next year gain pace.</P>
      <P>New qualification systems for the Atlanta games mean that competitors must achieve top class results in specific events and championships this year if they are to compete at next year's Olympic Games.  This is putting extra pressure on the individual sports people, their governing bodies and the Olympic Council of Ireland.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to announce, therefore, that I will be allocating an increased grant, this pre-Olympic year, to the Olympic Council of Ireland to help our competitors prepare, train and compete at the optimum level as they face the challenges of Atlanta 1996.</P>

    <P>Ireland is hosting the seventh European Nations Cup in men's hockey this summer.  The world athletics championships, world cycling championships and European swimming championship, to name but a few, are being held in various venues around the world in 1995. The role of the governing bodies of sport and the commitment of thousands of voluntary people from local club level, coaching and administration right up to national level are key to the continuing success of Irish sport throughout the years.  As Minister of State with responsibility for sport.  I will work in close co-operation with the governing bodies in assisting them in the development and promotion of sport here.  I <Col N="351" /> stress the crucial role of these people who give of their time on a voluntary basis.  Too often, their contribution and dedication is taken for granted.</P>
    <P>The recent allegations of child abuse in sport have upset all of us.  They have cast a shadow over sport and have not been encouraging to those people who work so hard for sport, for children and young people in clubs all over Ireland.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week, I appointed an expert group to draw up a code of ethics and good practice in sport which will provide guidelines and directions for coaches, administrators and others who work with children in sport.  This code should be of enormous benefit to all involved and will help prevent the problems and difficulties we have heard and read about recently.</P>
    <P>We do not as yet have a national drug testing programme for sport.  I have set myself the urgent task of introducing a dope testing and educational programme as a matter of priority and I already have had detailed discussions with my officials and with Cospóir, the national sports council, on the matter.  A number of measures are being developed at present and I will announce details of the programme for this area in the near future.</P>
    <P>On another front, I am concerned as Minister with responsibility for Sport and Minister of State at the Department of the Environment that people should be able to attend sporting and entertainment events in safety and comfort.  A code of practice and safety at outdoor venues is being finalised and I am anxious that this will be published and circulated to the appropriate authorities as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Too few Irish people take part in regular physical recreation and sport and this is to the detriment of the health and well-being of the individual and the nation.  There is need to give fresh impetus to our &ldquo;Sport for All&rdquo; programmes.In this regard, I am working with Cospóir, and the various statutory and voluntary organisations, to increase <Col N="352" /> the level of participation in Ireland.  A specially commissioned survey to establish levels of participation in physical recreation and sport will be published soon and will provide us with very important information and data on which to base our future initiatives.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to mention the matter of funding for the Collins/Eubank title fight in Millstreet next month.  I hope the same number of punches do not land on Collins as the number of verbal ones that landed on me for my decision.  This is a major sporting event for our country, our world boxing champion fighting for a second title in his own country.  You would have to go back a long way to find the last time such an event took place here.</P>
    <P>While it is a great occasion in sport and will be a great sporting weekend, which can well be valued on that intrinsic value alone, it should not be forgotten that the holding of the fight in Ireland has a moment us economic value to us also.  Sport is fun but it has a very important economic aspect also.  Some people tend to forget that critical point. Those who do not forget are the many people here involved in hotels, guest-houses, catering, transport and a variety of other businesses who are already experiencing a dramatic increase in business as a result of the contest taking place in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Cospóir and my Department published a major research document, &ldquo;The Economic Impact of Sport in Ireland&rdquo; last year.  This report outlined in clear and dramatic detail the number of jobs created in sport, the value of sport events to Ireland and the income which this country derives from the sport tourism area.  This should be studied because the economic value of sport to the country is not appreciated.</P>
    <P>Attracting major sport events to Ireland is a most important policy area of my sport section and of the Department of Tourism and Trade and Bord Fáilte.  The economic benefits are there to be seen.  We have already proved that fact.  We should not hesitate to take <Col N="353" /> advantage of these opportunities to generate income and business for our country and economy.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to give a brief outline of my proposals for youth services in the context of the 1995 budget.  As Deputies know, the vast bulk of the allocation for youth services is financed by the surplus proceeds of the national lottery.</P>
    <P>The total allocation for 1995 for subhead B8 &mdash; Exchequer &mdash; and B 9 &mdash; Lottery &mdash; which deals with youth services is £12.615 million which compares to the 1994 out-turn of £12.151 million, an increase of 3.8 per cent approximately.These money's will be expended largely on grants to about 30 youth organisations under the youth services grants scheme and 195 special projects to assist disadvantaged youth.  It will also be possible for me to fund the existing network of youth information centres and 11 local voluntary youth councils.</P>
    <P>Leargas, the exchange bureau, which deals with transnational educational and vocational exchanges, will be funded as well as other exchanges including those operated by Co-operation North and the Franco-Irish Exchanges.  As part of my commitment to our disadvantaged and socially deprived young people I will ensure that as much money as possible is allocated to special projects for disadvantaged young people.</P>
    <P>One initiative which I feel strongly should be continued is that in the youth arts area.  I have asked my Department to report to me as soon as possible after the period of review at the end of April next.  This report will enable me to establish what funding would be appropriate for this area in the future.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe that youth work should be an integral part of the educational system and as part of the informal sector it should have strong links with the formal sector.  In this regard, it is my intention to appoint an assessoradviser to my Department at an early date who will be of great assistance in policy formulation and development as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="354" /> I will also provide grant-aid in 1995, in collaboration with the Council of Europe and the National Youth Council of Ireland, for an English language course and the Irish campaign against racism, xenophobia, anti-semitism and intolerance.</P>
    <P>In the area of youth information I intend to create as soon as possible a permanent post of national youth information co-ordinator.  My Department will instruct the Civil Service Commission at an early date on the arrangements for interviews and related formalities.I am glad also to be able to say that I have agreed to the creation of a post of assistant to the co-ordinator and the necessary arrangements will be put in place as soon as possible this year.</P>
    <P>These proposals are but an indication of what I hope to achieve in my first year as Minister of State in the youth area.  Already, I have met a number of the major youth organisations and visited some special projects.  This is but part of a learning process for me in a very complex area to which I will give the utmost priority.  The voluntary concept is the bedrock of our youth service. I wish to place on record my appreciation of all those adult volunteers who give so unselfishly of their time and energies in the service of our young people.  This country is in their debt and I appreciate their massive contribution to making Ireland a better place for our young people, especially those who are disadvantaged and alienated.</P>
    <P>The measures I have outlined will in no small measure help all involved in the youth area to continue with their crucially important work.</P>
    <P>We are now at a very important stage in the reform of local government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>What about money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We must continue with the modernisation of local government law, giving greater discretion and flexibility to local authorities and enhancing the role and status of their elected representatives.There are also some core issues to be resolved.  The three key priorities <Col N="355" /> in this regard are the future shape of town local government, local government funding and local authority functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>What about district councils; will they be reformed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The programme for <i>A Government of Renewal</i> focuses directly on the questions of considerable complexibility and the wide ranging implications.They are not matters that can be finalised overnight but I am confident there will be significant progress within this Government's lifetime and that the basis of lasting reforms will be firmly laid down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard it all before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The other key reform issue is, of course, the longstanding question of town local government.  This issue is now being addressed.</P>
      <P>As the House knows, a local government reorganisation commission is currently carrying out a review of town local government and will report to the Minister for the Environment within twelve months.  There are a few important points I want to highlight in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>This review will lead directly to the implementation of reforms.  The Commission's brief is not to compose a treatise of theory and aspirations, nor will it compile a collection of opinions to provide fodder for a further phase of political discussion or debate.  It must produce clear, practicable proposals on specific issues to be readily implemented through the process already set out in the Local Government Act, 1994.  This will involve Oireachtas approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this review is not just to carry out some sort of bureaucratic reshuffling.  The services provided by local authorities and the regulatory functions they exercise have a direct impact on people's day to day lives. <Col N="356" /> Local government has the potential to exert a significant positive influence on the social and economic life of our towns and cities.</P>
    <P>As urbanisation continues and social pressures increase in scale and complexity, it is all the more important that local authorities play a full role in local and community development.  This is something of which I am very conscious from my youth and sport perspective at the Department of Education.  Indeed there are important links between my two Department roles in this regard. There is room for a more active and creative role for local authorities in this whole area.  The creation of a modern, vibrant system of town local government on the basis of the Commission's review can help to bring this about.</P>
    <P>Another desirable outcome of this review will be that, by putting to rest the long standing debate about town local government, greater attention can be focused on the further development of local government, including the establishment of an enhanced, more productive role for town authorities in the development and promotion of their areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>What about financing them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Local government must adapt to changes in the general environment in which it operates and there must be readjustment in emphasis and priorities, where necessary.</P>
      <P>The Commission's review can help to focus attention on where new priorities need to be recognised and point to possible new approaches and methods of operation, including the scope for increased partnerships, joint ventures and other co-operative initiatives with community and private sector interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope there will be a positive approach and a strong spirit of co-operation right across the political spectrum in the interests of developing the best possible system of town local government.The Commission has invited submissions from local authorities and <Col N="357" /> other interested parties.  This input will be of paramount importance to the success of the Commission's review.  There must be a rigorous, critical examination of the system, openness to new ideas and approaches which are practicable, which offer the prospect of more effective representation, more efficient administration and a high standard of service for the people of our towns.  The quality of input from public representatives and particularly the elected members of local authorities, will be crucially important.  I also look forward to the wholehearted support of every Member of this House in the task before us.</P>
    <P>In line with the commitment in the policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, a professional study will be commissioned as soon as possible to see how a fair, equitable and reasonable system of local government financing can be introduced.  The objective is that this study should lead to the publication of a Government White Paper and facilitate development of maximum consensus on this issue.  In order to build the necessary consensus representative local government organisations will be consulted throughout the process.  The General Council of County and City Managers' Association have already been asked to submit their views on the scope of the professional study and its terms of reference.</P>
    <P>All of the above, then, provides for the House a comprehensive and integrated programme plan for the areas within my remit.</P>
    <P>I look forward very much to undertaking the operation of those programme plans.  I have already set in train mechanisms for their implementation.</P>
    <P>As the House will have observed, a wide range of issues fall within the ambit of sport, youth and local government.I look forward to the support and co-operation of all Members in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate my colleague, and, I suppose, my political <Col N="358" /> friend, Deputy Bernard Allen on his appointment as Minister of State at the Departments of Education and the Environment.  It is my sincere conviction he will bring much good to his native city and to Cork North-Central. Indeed, I envy him his potential success in that area.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has been much criticised for his Budget Statement which concentrated on three points, two of which, reward for work and the promotion of enterprise, are of special concern to me as my party's deputy spokesperson on employment with special responsibility for science, technology and commerce.</P>
      <P>It is my duty to congratulate the Minister for Finance and his officials on the improvement in the PRSI system for employers and employees, in addition to the welcome allevation of the PAYE burden which will help especially the lower paid worker.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has been generous in his public acknowledgment of the contribution of his predecessor, former Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, during his period in that Department from the end of 1992 to the end of last year.  It must be remembered that not all Ministers for Finance enjoy finding the nation's books in such good condition, something for which former Minister for Finance, Mr. MacSharry, could vouch.  Given the reasonably good state of the nation's finances and the objectives-aspirations so eloquently enunciated by the present Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement his 1995 budgetary proposals are most disappointing.We all want to develop, foster and promote enterprise.  We all want to encourage companies to prosper and grow and to help families develop their businesses.  This budget is not a radical one.  The prose may be proud but the reality is a rudderless flight into fiction. The budget does not have a growth dividend.What will happen in 1995 that would not happen without this budget? Not a lot in terms of enterprise and employment.  This budget, the first introduced by a Labour Minister and to <Col N="359" /> be announced before the budget day, started last year with the Book of Estimates and will finish in the summer of this year with the passing of the Finance Bill, 1995.  After all this time and effort the Minister announced changes in revenue of 1.4 per cent and an expenditure of 1.2 per cent.  Is this a radical budget with a growth dividend?  Those changes will cost £159 million and £143 million respectively which palls compared to £2,500 million needed in 1995 to service the national debt, in other words, to pay interest on past borrowings by Governments plus a further £813 million which will be borrowed by the Exchequer this year, excluding State-owned ventures which will also borrow more.  Is this radical?Is it a dividend?  Is it growth?</P>
    <P>In his budget speech the Minister claims that by following a framework 1994 showed a small current budget surplus.In 1995 we have reverted back to current deficit budgeting not allowed to housekeepers and an increase in the Exchequer borrowing requirement-gross national product ratio from 2.2 per cent to 2.4 per cent.  Where is the budgetary discipline referred to the Minister's budget speech?  The Minister stated that these targets represent continued budgetary discipline and today's improvements have been formulated within that framework.  That is not the position as I see it.</P>
    <P>Being mindful of our interest bill of £2,500 million per year, I will consider some enterprise and employment aspects of the 1995 budget.  There are 160,000 small businesses run mainly by families and small enterprises.  Nearly all enterprises in Ireland are small businesses by European and international criteria.  Small businesses here are very small indeed and need help.  The small business owners still have to take a wage or salary from the business and pay personal tax and levies at a rate of more than 50 per cent.  Motor vehicle registration tax remains high.  Corporation tax, PRSI and communication costs are among the highest in Europe. The reduction of corporation tax by 2 <Col N="360" /> per cent to 38 per cent which will cost £43 million a year will not trickle down in any noticeable way to very small businesses which should, as in many parts of the world, have a low corporate tax rate. Apart from banks and retailers the bigger companies in Ireland generally pay only 10 per cent manufacturing tax, which in reality is even lower due to various other tax reliefs.</P>
    <P>The cost of borrowing for smaller businesses remains high due to commercial risk and it is not always easy to obtain loans and working capital.  The proposals regarding banks taking a charge on book debts will be helpful.  In almost all cases banks require personal guarantees as a pre-condition to any lending, thus denying the owners of the smallest businesses the right of limited liability and giving them the additional worry of placing all their personal and private assets, such as they may be, at risk.  Some family business men and women who refuse to expose other family members have to borrow outside the mainstream lenders at iniquitous rates of interest or deny themselves the chance of expansion.  People with small businesses are exposed already to hard work, long hours, responsibility for people working in the business and the strain and worry that goes with the turf.</P>
    <P>With banks being the sole beneficiary of the abolition of the bank levy, which will amount to £36 million a year, and hardly a creator of jobs in recent years, surely now it is time to review their rigid policy regarding personal guarantees.  I am not attacking the banks who provide a very necessary service and I welcome the abolition of the bank levy.  I am sure banks will remember why it was introduced.Banks cannot underwrite bad lending, but I put it to the Minister that a reduction in the powers and entitlements of borrowers in respect of businesses employing people and seeking to create work should initially limit personal guarantees to a maximum of 40 per cent of assets held outside and not <Col N="361" /> used for an enterprise.  A business borrowing off the back of personal guarantees is not being given any favours by the lender.</P>
    <P>The seed capital scheme improvements costing £4 million are to be welcomed and more details of what the Minister has in mind would be useful before the Finance Bill is published. The stock relief for farmers of £1 million and the stock relief of young farmers of £800,000, not subject to clawback, are to be welcomed as are the measures providing a compulsory disposal of livestock under the animal disease eradication programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister recognised the position regarding the condition of county roads and the allocation of £8 million is a start, albeit a small one, to address a major problem for farmers and small businesses as well as other rural dwellers and tourists.  A cogent tourism development plan is needed to develop one of our major natural resources.  The additional £2.3 million allocation for tourism promotion is very welcome and must be spent to good effect.  The pilot scheme for the renewal of traditional seaside resorts is an interesting idea.  It is budgeted to cost only £1 million in 1995.  Could it be expanded to include inland tourist centres?  It is hardly fair to ignore the east coast, the Glen of Aherlow, scenic routes and the history and heritage attaching to those areas.</P>
    <P>I would have expected a Labour-Democratic Left-Fine Gael Government to have introduced more measures to assist employment creation.  The Minister addressed but did not resolve the tax wedge anomaly.  Surely the £43 million adjustment in reducing corporation tax could be much better spent on a new 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for small companies.  Remuneration taken out of companies would be taxed as normal.  I also advocate a reduction of 1 per cent per annum for four years in the 9 per cent PRSI rate and an increase in the threshold of £12,000 up to £15,000 in stages.  To create work and promote enterprise we need to keep improving the business climate and the <Col N="362" /> taxation regime for the employer classes.  In some respects the Minister is aiming in the right direction.  May he change from aiming to delivering.</P>
    <P>While this budget has something for everyone in the audience, and some of its measures are imaginative and of real benefit, there is no mention of science and technology or research.  The arts and sporting projects are covered, but real science is not.  We, a nation, have been very successful in attracting overseas employers to our shores due to sound Government, mainly under Fianna Fáil and policies used to good effect by the Industrial Development Authority.  These industrial companies have brought developed products to Ireland such as electronics and computers.Research in Ireland is vital in order to sustain those jobs.  Those companies are now facing another generation of product innovation.  There are existing tax incentives for inventors. However, research is different and needs special treatment.  Corporate tax relief is not suitable as Irish manufacturing subsidiaries pay a very low corporation tax and their mother companies are aware of the advantages of locating highly paid research jobs in other countries in which they operate where there are low personal tax and high corporate tax rates.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Brennan was the Minister responsible for this area, he commissioned a report from the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council, which was not completed before he left office.  There does not appear to be any reason why that valuable report could not be officially published tomorrow.  To avoid more leaks, the sooner that study is in the public domain, the sooner it can be implemented in full or with modifications.</P>
    <P>There is a need to update Cork Regional Technical College.  I appeal to the Government parties to agree to this and to change its name to a technological institute in line with what it was set up to do.  It is to the forefront of technological education in the Cork area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="363" /> Much reference has been made in the House to third level undergraduate fees and covenants.  The Minister intends to restrict tax relief on existing covenants and abolish tax relief on covenants generally, with humane exceptions for the disabled.  Short of reducing the rate of income tax to zero per cent can this be done in respect of existing and binding contracts?  If not, another Minister for Finance will face a large bill well into the future.  However, the Deputy from Cork East will not double guess the wisdom of the Office of the Attorney General on the Act of covenants.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy alluded already to pitfalls in undergraduate fees.  Approximately 60,000 out of 90,000 third level students pay no fees.  The cost for the remainder has been put at £40 million. At an average cost of £2,000 in fees per student the cost could be higher still.  It seems only a matter of time before graduates doing an MD, MA or research, for example, will be included. If we are going this road, approved post graduate degrees should be covered but what about night or part-time students?</P>
    <P>Will the covenants be abolished?  Will this save £23 million or £34 million? Certain other costs will emerge.  Will free undergraduate courses result in the educational bodies increasing fees now that they are free of marketplace constraints?Will more students, who do not see a school leaving job on the horizon, apply?  Probably &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and this will involve the State and the universities and colleges in capital costs for more buildings, lecture theatres, etc., plus more lecturers and professors with attendant back-up staff.  Will the higher entrance requirements be made even tougher thus denying students education, apart from the question of who pays for it?</P>
    <P>Free education is not like the property tax which arouses great anger. People would like it but they know they cannot afford it.  Is the State obligated to set students off on a wealthy and privileged career for nothing?  At present the fees paid represent about <Col N="364" /> one third of the total cost with two thirds of students not paying anything and the remainder being heavily subsidised.Before proceeding further we should know the full cost &mdash; capital and current &mdash; as well as seeking to measure the effect on initiative of making everything &ldquo;free&rdquo;.  What about the effect on our national debt and the present annual bill of £2,500 million?</P>
    <P>This money, whatever it amounts to, could be used to develop foreign markets and create jobs at home.  The European Union will pay fees for universities and schools within the EU.  Our young people should be encouraged to attend them or work abroad in South America, the Asia-Pacific zone as well as the continent of Europe.  They could be given maintenance grants initially and loans at low rates of interest from the State and the private sector, to further develop and expand our overseas connections and markets, to learn Latin American-Spanish, German, Japanese or other languages and improve our marketing and exporting skills.  You cannot learn French from a book or do satisfactory business in France without a knowledge of the customs and the spoken language. Under the proposals of the Departments of Finance and Education we would be exporting a surfeit of BAs, BScs with pass degrees and B.Comms.</P>
    <P>Accountability is a word in vogue. The Minister invites us to begin to plan for the future.  The Government should lead the way.  The Irish Distillers, the Dairygolds and other Irish businesses do not budget 11 months ahead.  Businesses have plans and budgets, targets and forecasts for five or more years ahead.  Estimates are updated regularly. Governments should do the same and not just focus annually on adjustments of 1.4 per cent or 1.2 per cent of revenue or expenditure.  In this way the people could see the growth in our national debt and where this is leading us.  How do we plan now in good times for future changes in our funding from European funds?  Must most of our income and PAYE taxes go out the door on unproductive interest repayments?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="365" /> A Government keeps its books on a cash basis, like some other Governments, but unlike real businesses.  This gives very odd results and should be changed to the worldwide normal accounting convention.  In this way expenditure contracted for and incurred would appear in the books even if it was not paid for until after the calendar year.  On the other side, Government Departments and agencies rush to spend their entire allotment of funds before 31 December in case it would otherwise reduce their allotment for the following year.  In the real world the opposite is the case and management would be praised, encouraged and rewarded for keeping incurred expenditure down.  Cash accounting does not disclose unpaid incurred costs.</P>
    <P>Balance sheets are a must.  The famous black hole of a few years ago would not have escaped attention if there were balance sheets at the start and at the end of the accounting periods.  Accountability and transparency require proper accounting.</P>
    <P>In the past few days many commentators claimed this budget will overheat the economy and send a new spiral of inflation with added interest rate increases which will further discourage the incentive for employment, job creation and industrial development. That is an alarming and frightening scene because it means debt is being piled upon debt.</P>
    <P>From a constituency point of view I welcome the pilot scheme for the historic town of Youghal where the first potatoes were grown by Sir Walter Raleigh.  I have no doubt this scheme will be availed of with vigour by the local community.  In my constituency it is not ten year old cars but 100 year old roads that are a serious problem.  The problem is to get goods and services delivered to the nearest point of activity.  On the N73 from Mallow to Mitchelstown to Killarney during the beet season, approximately 50 trucks travel daily with loads of beet weighing from 20 to 40 tonnes.  In that area we have the largest developed dairy <Col N="366" /> enterprise in Europe which handles approximately 200 million gallons of milk which has an annual turnover of almost £1 billion.  The transport of that product puts extraordinary pressure on the road structure.</P>
    <P>The Government has failed in this budget to provide for the upgrading of secondary roads after the main arterial roads.  This is necessary if we are to have the type of development that will maintain the jobs and enterprises.  There are many other areas to which I could refer. The scenic route, the N72 Fermoy to Mallow forms part of the Rosslare to Killarney route brings many tourists and holidaymakers to the area.  The N72 and the N73 are in need of restructuring and regrading.  I have no doubt with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, in the driving seat today he will take note of what I have said and will ensure that extra funding is provided from the budget.  Money is being spent anywhere and everywhere and it is very difficult to identify where it has been spent.</P>
    <P>I look at Irish Steel where a commitment was given last July by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to an investment of £50 million to update and modernise that facility in the Cork harbour area.  This is the last traditional industry remaining in the Cork Harbour area.  Now we are being told of indecision in Government although the Tánaiste still favours it. We would like to see a statement of fact on that industry and the necessary funding put in place to boost morale where, I understand, there has been a substantial downturn in production during the past month or six weeks over last year's level of production.  I want to see a statement clarifying the position without delay.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the former Government, and in particular the former Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Walsh, on the upgrading of Mallow racecourse to become the Cheltenham of Ireland.  Its development as a tourist attraction depends on a proper road structure.  We do not have such a <Col N="367" /> structure.  I appeal for the upgrading of the N73 as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>I do not want to sound over-critical of the budget but many people have been forgotten and there have been many bruises.  Old age pensioners suffered most since the days when a Cuman na nGael Government, led by W. T. Cosgrave, reduced the old age pension.  The budget was the nearest the Government came to reducing the old age pension. Under Fianna Fáil administrations there have always been social welfare increases especially for old age pensioners, the down and out and the disadvantaged in society in the region of 3 per cent to 4 per cent.  The 2.5 per cent increase this year, the lowest increase in the history of the State, is an insult to those people.  The worst measure in the budget is the 10p a week increase in living alone allowance.  If a person in need came to your door you would give them more than that.  Those are the harsh realities of the budget.</P>
    <P>In every paper at the weekend there were headlines such as &ldquo;Air Of Disappointment&rdquo;, &ldquo;A Difficult Job Shirked&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tax Decision Increases Brain Drain&rdquo; and so on.  There are many such paper cuttings from the various commentators, intelligent people who write fairly on matters.  They would have written constructively on this budget if they had anything to write about, but there was merely a little for everyone.  The measure on PRSI is a step in the right direction, but otherwise there is very little in the budget.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the attack on the small saver &mdash; I referred to this matter on budget night &mdash; with the increase in DIRT from 10 to 15 per cent, a 50 per cent increase.  That is an attack on the small investor, the old age pensioner, the person with money on deposit. Account should be taken of this matter in the Finance Bill and the figure should be reduced to its previous level of 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>After a short time in Government the people want to see the end of this rainbow Coalition.  Time constraints bring <Col N="368" /> me to the end of my contribution on this rainbow budget, with shades of blue, purple, violet and indigo and an agenda of red, yellow and green.  The Minister has designed a grey structure, with debt laid upon foundations of debt.  The national debt of about £30 billion will be increased this year by £800 million. The Minister opposite is a good economist, a man I greatly admire, who had many answers when he was on the other side of the House &mdash; I am sure he will answer all the questions when he presents his case in a few minutes.  How does he propose, in the event of a hiccup in the international economy, to deal with the finances?  The Coalition Government of 1973-77 which inherited a strong economy from the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, ran riot with the finances, and the excuse it came up with was that there was an oil crisis.  I wonder, at the end of the term of this rain-bown Coalition, with all its colours, what answers will it give when this economy is led into the ground and buried in debt.</P>

      <P>This is a reforming budget and I want to confront Fianna Fáil head-on regarding the contradictory and inconsistent nature of its charges against Democratic Left and Labour, the left wing parties in this Government of renewal.  On the one hand we are charged with the crime of fiscal recklessness &mdash; Deputy O'Keeffe repeated the charge that we are adding to the public debt.  With Democratic Left and Labour now in Government the charge is that the public finances are in dangerous hands, that we are, as a nation, going back to the spendthrift days of the past, but what is that past to which they allege we are going back?  It is Fianna Fáil's past in Government, the past reckless behaviour, for which its current Finance spokesperson, Deputy McCreevy, criticised his own party over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with the consequences of that past.  We are tackling its legacy and committed to restoring order, <Col N="369" /> finally, to the public finances.  In Government as much as in Opposition, the Left is opposed to fiscal recklessness because it is the people we represent, the taxpayers and the poor who suffer most from recklessness in the public finances.  Working people have no vested interest in a worsening public debt and my contributions to this House during the years have consistently argued that position.</P>
    <P>In the next breath, Fianna Fáil accuses us of selling out.  Instead of being reckless reds we are fiscal skinflints, all this in the same breath.  At this stage they must be badly in need of physiotherapy because of the cricks in their necks from their twisting, turning and contortions as they level their conflicting and contradictory charges and accusations against us.  That is at best. At worst they will need intensive psychotherapy to sort out the mental problems they are creating for themselves, but that is par for the course for the party that set this country into a tailspin with its commitment in the past to fiscal recklessness.</P>
    <P>I would ask of the Deputies on the Opposition benches, if they are so committed, as Deputy O'Keeffe said, to fiscal rectitude, what would they have cut in this budget?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>What tax reform would they not have implemented?  What additional spending would they have cancelled?  Would they, in the name of their professed commitment to discipline and the hairshirt, have increased class sizes in primary schools, for example, as Deputy O'Rourke did as Minister for Education in 1987?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If they are, on the other hand, so committed to high spending &mdash; Deputy O'Keeffe wants the roads in County Cork improved &mdash; how much extra would they have added to spending this year?  For example, how much extra would they have allocated to social welfare?We have their own word for it: 3 per cent instead of 2.5 per cent.  What <Col N="370" /> that means for old age pensioners is 35 ½p per week or ½p in the pound, or 30p for the single person on unemployment assistance.  The fact is that this year, the Government allocated an additional £90 million to the social welfare budget compared to the £70 million package from the bleeding hearts of Fianna Fáil last year.  Within this year's global increases, which protect social welfare recipients against inflation, this Government made a conscious and deliberate decision to target as much available resources as possible on children.  I will return to this matter.</P>
    <P>I am, with my colleague and leader of Democratic Left, the Minister for Social Welfare, particularly pleased with the direction of the tax reforms introduced by the Minister for Finance in this budget.  This is a radical budget in that it has begun the process of real tax reform where it counts most, from the bottom up.  This has not been, as claimed, a bourgeois budget.  This is a PAYE budget.  Middle income earners are not the bourgeoisie, the ruling class.  They are the backbone of the PAYE-PRSI taxpaying classes and they are finally getting the benefit of having a Government committed to bottom-up tax reform.</P>
    <P>For far too long the approach of Governments, especially the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, has been to give the bulk of tax concessions and reliefs to relatively high earners while doing little or nothing for middle income workers and those on low pay.  The changes introduced in the PAYE-PRSI systems this year particularly benefit these two groups, and not before time.</P>
    <P>The budget will remove 10,000 people from the tax net.  The tax wedge has been significantly reduced by the introduction of an allowance of £50 per week for full rate PRSI contributors, the widening of the standard rate income tax band and the increase in personal allowances.  The fundamental reform of the PRSI system introduced in the budget addresses what I have always viewed as a major fault in the system. <Col N="371" /> PRSI is effectively a form of taxation. Yet it departed from one of the most important canons of taxation, that those on low incomes should be absolved from having to pay.  Before the reforms were introduced last Wednesday, PRSI was levied on low incomes in a regressive way.  The budget also introduces rent relief for those in private rented accommodation.This is a much needed reform for the taxpayers concerned and an overdue anti-evasion measure.</P>
    <P>Residential property tax has also been reformed.  The Government has reversed the reduction in the threshold values introduced last year by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and which Fianna Fáil is now so anxious to disown.  The Minister for Finance has stated that the tax will be considered in the context of a study on local government financing.</P>
    <P>The budget also provides for a substantial increase in profit sharing schemes which exist to enable workers to participate in the wealth they create. I know Deputy O'Keeffe supports this provision.  The changes in personal income taxation will make a significant contribution towards rewarding labour over other factors of production.  The widening of the standard band will reduce the number of taxpayers paying at the higher rate from 38 per cent to 36 per cent.  However, this is still far too high.  A third of the nation's taxpayers are not so wealthy that they can afford to pay tax at the marginal level.  Last Wednesday was just the beginning, the first of three budgets.  It was a good day's work, a good beginning.</P>
    <P>A budget involves a great deal more than reforming the distortions created by the tax system in labour markets and the delivery of socially desirable changes.  As Minister of State with responsibility for commerce, science and technology at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, I am proud of the way this budget has set out to create a more supportive environment for investment especially in the <Col N="372" /> small firm and family firm sector of the economy.</P>
    <P>The changes in both the capital gains and acquisitions taxes will enable family businesses to be transferred more effectively than before.  It is essential that the transfer of small family businesses receives at least the same tax-based support as the transfer of other assets and enterprises such as farms.  At least in the case of land, even if it changes hands, it remains intact and productive.  On the other hand family firms often face dissolution on transfer of ownership with a loss of economic value to both the family and society as a result.</P>
    <P>The budget also addressed the rate structure of corporation tax.  Clearly the recent long overdue changes in our corporation tax system which involved both reductions in rates and the removal of shelters, have yielded handsome dividends.The yield in 1995 will be £1.3 billion, approximately three times the yield in 1990.  I have in the past, and I now repeat, my commendation of the achievements of the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, in closing off some of the tax-shelters.  While the yield from the corporate sector has increased, there continues to be wide differences between the 10 per cent rate for the manufacturing sector and the 40 per cent general corporation tax rate although the service sector has been the main engine of employment growth in recent years.  In a global economy the distinction between services and manufacturing, traded and sheltered businesses, is becoming ever weaker.</P>
    <P>Our rate of corporation tax is also above the prevailing rate in most OECD countries.  For example, in the UK the rate is 33 per cent.  We have to compete with these countries in a global economy and we cannot indefinitely sustain the differential without restricting growth, investment, enterprise and, ultimately, employment expansion.  Wearing my Enterprise and Employment hat, I, therefore, welcome the commitment given by the Minister for Finance to further reduce the rate as resources permit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="373" /> We have had directly conflicting responses from the two organisations representing small business.  Contrary to the complaints voiced by the Small Firms' Association, small businesses will clearly benefit from the improvements and reforms to both personal and corporate taxation announced last Wednesday.  They will also benefit from the other changes announced at that time.</P>
    <P>The changes in the seed capital scheme should help to provide start-up businesses with much needed finance. Furthermore, the proposal to change section 115 of the 1986 Finance Act so as to secure more loan finance for small firms should help to address what is perhaps the most important constraint facing small firms, that is the availability of finance to survive and thrive.</P>
    <P>I have come in for sustained attack from the Opposition benches because of the changes in bank taxation, the decision to phase out the levy and the reduction in corporation tax, which affects the banks as well as the corporate sector generally.  The supposed &ldquo;windfall&rdquo; to the banks has risen from the original Fianna Fáil estimate of £36 million to a revised Fianna Fáil estimate today of £40 million.  Both figures are wrong.  The then Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government decided in the 1992 Finance Act to allow the banks to offset the levy against corporation profits tax.  The decision on the bank levy in the budget does not, therefore, cost the Exchequer one penny.  Like the rest of the corporate sector, the banks benefit from the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 40 per cent to 38 per cent to the extent of £7 million in a full year, and not by £36 million as alleged by Fianna Fáil or by £22 million as claimed by Vincent Browne in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil Deputies have shed crocodile tears by the bucketful on behalf of the ordinary taxpayer.  What is the Opposition saying?  Is it saying it is in favour of continuing with the levy? Will it put down an amendment to the Finance Bill to restore the levy?  Of <Col N="374" /> course, Fianna Fáil has no intention of putting down any such amendment.</P>
    <P>The banks have agreed to a compensatory cash flow arrangement whereby in 1995 they will pay £12 million by way of an earlier payment of corporation tax to cover the £12 million reduction in the levy as required by the change introduced by the then Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government.The Exchequer will not be at a loss and the compensatory arrangement will be continued in subsequent years.  There is also an agreement with the banks that they will develop and enhance their support for small and medium sized enterprises.  In addition, the tax position of the banks will, as the Minister for Finance stated, &ldquo;be kept under continuous review, and responsible tax planning by financial institutions is expected&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I want to make some general points about the banks.  Banks are not like any other business.  Over the years their spin doctors have made much of the proposition that they are like other businesses, particularly when arguing against the levy.  However, they are not like any other business.  They hold a crucial and influential position in the economy in that they have significant ownership and control of the single most important aspect of the economy, the monetary system.  We cannot do without banks; in our personal and business lives we are in constant need of the banking system.  The entire fabric of personal and economic life needs the banking system.  That makes banks different from any other part of the business or corporate world, it puts them in a vital position in society and gives them enormous power and influence.  They are absolutely vital to the well-being of the nation and the economy.</P>
    <P>The banks have control of our savings and personal finances through their deposit taking mechanism, they influence the well-being of the corporate and business sector generally through their lending mechanism and they form a vital part of the social fabric of the <Col N="375" /> country through their money transmission systems.  When a branch closes or restricts its opening hours this has an effect on the life of the surrounding community.  The public heaved a sigh in recent years as the banks finally moved to extend their opening hours.  In this last respect it is worth noting that a small State controlled bank, the TSB, had more socially acceptable opening hours for a long time and led the way in extending hours.  Because banks are different it is necessary to treat them differently to other businesses in the economy.  The Central Bank continuously monitors their activities in a way in which no other State body monitors the affairs of any other industry.  It cannot be otherwise and the banks do not object.  They are licensed and regulated in a way in which no industry is regulated and it cannot be otherwise.  My own involvement with the banks, as Minister of State with special responsibility for commerce, is in the area of the regulation of the terms of consumer credit and customer service.  This area is the subject of important legislation from my Department &mdash; the Consumer Credit Bill.</P>

      <P>Yesterday the Taoiseach replied to a question from Deputy Cullen on leaking budget information.  In his reply the Taoiseach indicated that he understood there was no record of any investigation by the then Minister for Finance into the extensive leaks which took place in either 1990 or 1994.  This was based on <Col N="376" /> information supplied by my Department in response to a query from the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>On checking the matter further my Department now finds that in 1990, at the request of the Minister for Finance, a limited investigation did take place in the Department of Finance and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners. This consisted of the officials most closely involved being asked whether they could shed any light on the source of the leaks.  No breach of budget security in this Department or in the Revenue Commissioners was found as a result of this inquiry.</P>
      <P>I regret that incorrect information was given to the Taoiseach yesterday and that based on this he inadvertently misled the House.  I wish to take the earliest opportunity to put the record straight.  The position about the 1994 leaks remains as indicated by the Taoiseach &mdash; there was no investigation into those leaks.</P>

      <P>I opposed the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government decision to allow the banks to offset the levy against corporation profits tax.  This budget is formalising that decision in a phased manner that will lead to no loss to the Exchequer.  The <Col N="379" /> tax position of the banks will be kept under continous review and the Government is committed to the promotion of the third force.  The tax take from the banks has grown enormously in the years since the levy was introduced.For example, since 1988-90 the total tax take from the banks has risen from around £63 million to £135 million in 1993-94.  The levy has achieved its desired effect.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil will not reintroduce the bank levy since it effectively abolished it.  Now having been found out, it says that instead of reducing corporation profits tax from 40 to 38 per cent it would have conceded a special rate of 25 per cent to small business.</P>

      <P>The parties of the Left and the Government in general stand accused of being welfare Scrooges, penny pinching with pensioners and <Col N="380" /> devoid of concern for the problem of poverty but nothing could be further from the truth.  After years of failure by previous Ministers of Social Welfare payment will be made six weeks earlier than usual and there is the commitment from the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, to press for earlier payment of increases in future budgets.  He has already asked his Department to gear itself up to changing its production schedules to facilitate this to the greatest extent possible.  Why should social welfare recipients have to wait longer than taxpayers for the benefits of the budget?</P>
      <P>Within the global increase special attention has been paid to marginalised groups of recipients, especially mothers who are caught in low income and poverty traps.  We have provided for the biggest increase in child benefit in 50 years.  In other reforms the first step has been taken towards the development of a basic income approach to support for children.  There is also a commitment after ten years to pay 70,000 women their equal treatment payments starting this year.</P>
      <P>There is a number of other significant reforms for various groups.  The disabled persons maintenance allowance is being transferred to the Department of Social Welfare; the rate of unemployment assistance paid to young people living at home is being increased while child benefit for 18 year olds and those in full-time education, including those attending certain FÁS courses, is being extended.  There is further improvement in the carer's allowance and the significant extension of the back to work allowance.  The qualifying age is being reduced as is the period of attachment to the live register.</P>

      <P>The Conference of <Col N="381" /> Religious of Ireland has strongly criticised the tenor and thrust of the Budget. It is wrong.  The organisation has made much of the Government not adopting the basic income approach, but I would ask the members of CORI to read the speech of the Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>The changes in child benefit amount to a first step to taking a basic income approach in that area of the social welfare system.  As the Minister for Social Welfare pointed out, an expert group is currently examining the question of the integration of the tax and social welfare codes, a concept to which he and Democratic Left have long been committed.</P>
      <P>The expert group will address the question of the extension of the basic income approach to all citizens.  I would ask CORI to wait and see what the expert group has to say &mdash; and that is not a political fob-off.  As to the arithmetic calculations the CORI post-budget response indulges in to show that this is a budget in which the poor have come out badly, one cannot take it from looking at the social welfare allocation in isolation and comparing it to other global areas of spending that this budget has not taken sufficient action to tackle poverty.  The CORI approach ignores the fact that many thousands on low pay are also caught in the poverty trap.  One must look to policy in its totality to see that this budget does a great deal to tackle poverty.</P>

      <P>It tackles poverty in a real way.  For those who are poor as a result of being low paid, there is a real reduction in the tax wedge effect and the poverty and unemployment traps that have, for far too long, been part of the system as a result of the interaction between the social welfare system and an unfair system of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the long term unemployed there are the enhancements to the back to work allowance.  There is also the introduction of the locally based intensive <Col N="382" /> guidance and placement service on a pilot basis initially.  This is the implementation of a concept developed by the National Economic and Social Forum.  Provision for the community employment programme is being increased and my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, dealt with that yesterday.</P>
    <P>I could go on but the basic point is clear.  This budget sets out to maximise the growth dividend for all the people of Ireland.  In particular, it sets out to bring the benefits of that growth dividend into the unemployment blackspots, the marginalised communities, to make it work for and benefit those groups thereby fighting poverty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In fighting poverty, we must look beyond what the Government is doing through the budget measures.  Those measures fit into a wider framework, that of the European Union's Community Support Framework and its various operational programmes, virtually all of which have now been announced.</P>
      <P>This week we saw the unveiling of the Human Resources Development Operational Programme, with its significant emphasis on strengthening the education base at primary and secondary levels and improving the educational opportunities, training and life chances of early school leavers.  The problem of early school leaving is a critical ingredient in the long term danger of people in poverty-ridden unemployment blackspots being caught in a permanent poverty trap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has been left foundering in the wake of a budget it would dearly loved to have delivered.  Indeed, some of its former Ministers act as if they did deliver it.  Their criticisms are not serious.  They feign outrage over the leaks, mock concern at the 2.5 per cent general increase to pensioners and outright opposition to what they would have us believe are the consequences of <Col N="383" /> abolition of the bank levy.  None of these criticisms withstand serious examination.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil led Governments leaked budget details with impunity.  There were no investigations and no resignations in 1994.  The difference between the 2.5 per cent social welfare general increase and the 3 per cent which Fianna Fáil said it would provide ranges from 30p to 35p per week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Exchequer, far from losing £36 million, does not lose a penny and the levy included in the 1992 Finance Act was a Fianna Fáil decision when it was in Government with the Progressive Democrats.</P>

      <P>I want now to refer briefly to the Progressive Democrats.  I have been invited by Deputy Harney to comment on the increase for pensioners. I thought that a leader of the Progressive Democrats would want to avoid any mention of pensions.  Deputy McDowell posing as the champion of the poor is about as plausible as Ian Paisley announcing his candidacy for the papacy.  Deputy McDowell's criticisms are out of date.  On the night the Government was formed and following a speech by Deputy Bertie Ahern, who could not detect any left-wing influence in the programme for Government, Deputy McDowell told us that it was a left-dominated programme for Government.Both cannot be right.  Deputy McDowell went on to vent his indignation against the Labour Party in particular.He gave us a long dissertation on Tony Benn.  Deputy McDowell seems to know a great deal about Tony Benn, but seems never to have heard of Tony Blair.  The more I hear Deputy McDowell's contributions &mdash; and I always enjoy them&mdash; the more I am reminded of the Japanese soldier who emerged from the jungle a few years ago waving his sword and threatening to resume the Second World War.  Deputy McDowell resembles that soldier more and more.  He now has to construct his own imaginary windmills before he can tilt at them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This side of the House should, <Col N="386" /> however, concede that, for an Opposition, floundering in the wake of the budget, the controversy surrounding the leaks was a Godsend.  No one can in the least condone what happened. However, it goes to show how much the present system of budget formulation is in need of reform.  It shows also the difference between a Fianna Fáil-led Government and this Government.  A Fianna Fáil Minister would rather cut off his or her own toe than resign office.</P>
    <P>We inherited our budget system from the 19th century British Empire.  I cannot remember who it was among the leaders of the independence movement who summed the movement up by describing himself and his associates as the most conservative bunch of revolutionaries ever to achieve power.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms at least of the budgetary process we inherited from our founding fathers, which they took intact from imperial Britain, he was absolutely right.  Budget day is only a small part of the equation.  The Estimates and the capital programme have all been decided well in advance of budget day.  The Estimates procedure begins around mid year.  The budget, the Estimates and the capital programme are all framed in the context of the European Union Community Support Framework &mdash; a five year framework subject to ongoing review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, in the context of budget day itself, the sight of the media circus, of the pre-Christmas pre-budget submissions and delegations from the various lobby and interest groups as they march in to see the Minister.  Like the children who, at around the same time, are writing to and queuing to see Santa, they have their lists and are hoping for the best at a time when they know many of the major decisions have already been taken.  We should begin to change this.  We should create a more open and transparent budget procedure.  There should be more timely discussion of the parameters, the overall framework <Col N="387" /> within which the budget will be cast and we should have time to debate priorities.Apart from anything else, that would be healthy for politics.</P>
    <P>This <i>Government of Renewal</i> has taken a major step in enunciating in its progamme a fiscal framework, a medium term financial strategy.  It is the first Government to do so.</P>
    <P>This is a budget that sets out to maximise the growth dividend to everyone in our economy and society.  It seeks to maximise growth.  By that I mean the level of real economic activity carried out within our society.</P>
    <P>It seeks to redistribute the fruits of our economic growth, firstly, through seeking to secure jobs for more and more of those too many people in our society who are seeking work.  It seeks, through our taxation system, to redistribute wealth in our society and yet avoid penalising reward in a way that would ultimately undermine investment and effort.  It begins to put a welfare policy in place that seeks to provide those who cannot find employment with access to as high a standard of living as our society can afford and also a system that affords those seeking work the support they need to re-enter successfully the labour market.  It begins the process of educational reform &mdash; to create a high quality education system to which each person has equal access.</P>
    <P>There is much still to be done, but this is the first of three budgets and it must be seen in that light.  The process that began with budget day will continue to unfold in the ongoing process of reform that we will see through the rest of the year and beyond.  We have made an effective start to the process of renewal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The mantle of ministerial office has deeply afflicted Deputy Rabbitte.We still appreciate his sense of humour, but a sense of humour and barbed comments do not make for the type of debate we should be having on a budget.  It is remarkable that we have descended to a level of personal abuse in this Chamber which I am quite <Col N="388" /> uncomfortable with &mdash; that is not to say that it comes from just one side.</P>
      <P>In his budget speech last week, the Minister for Finance made many claims and set out objectives about rewarding work, promoting enterprise and strengthening social solidarity.  I agree with many of the Minister's claims. Work is the key to our success as a people and as a society.  We should develop, foster and promote enterprise, and much of what the Minister says about business and the need to develop and participate sounds very good.  The Minister says that Ireland must become a good place in which and with which to do business.  The word &ldquo;radical&rdquo; has been bandied about by many Ministers in the context of the budget.  This budget is certainly not that.  It is a budget that increases our rate of borrowing at a time when we are better placed economically than we have been for years.  It is a budget that increases spending by three and a half times the rate of inflation.  It is a budget under which a worker on the average industrial wage will still pay a marginal tax rate of 55.75 per cent, exactly the same as before the budget.  There is very little incentive for people to work harder.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party, in its efforts to please as many people as possible, has forgotten the maxim that one can fool all of the people some of the time, some of the people all of the time but not all of the people all of the time.  The Minister does not appear to have any underlying strategy and he has missed his opportunity.  There is no radical reform of tax, rather a fiddling around with the system.</P>
      <P>There are some good things in the budget, My party welcomed the abolition of PRSI on the first £50 of income per week.  This does not go far enough. In 1987 my party advocated that the first £3,000 should be exempt from PRSI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why did we not avail of the opportunity of this budget to pay some of our debts?  Instead, borrowing will be about £161 million higher than before.  Perhaps there is a question as to why we <Col N="389" /> need radical reform, but since we do not have radical reform, let us see what will happen if the more relaxed attitude of this Government continues.  Exchequer borrowing requirement will be at the highest level since 1987.  The underlying trend is even greater because of the delay in the receipt of the £124 million from the EU Structural and Cohesion Funds.  Taking this and other factors into account, the Exchequer borrowing requirement last year should have been about £500 million, and this year's figures would be £990 million.  A spot of creative accounting conceals the slippage in this year's budget.  The current budget moved from a surplus of £15 million to a deficit of £310 million.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to discern a strategy when there is no commitment on the part of the Government to reduce the level of new borrowings in future years as part of a policy to consolidate the progress that has undoubtedly been made up to now to rectify the state of the public finances.  Under the Maastricht guidelines the 3 per cent of GDP maximum level of borrowing has become a target rather than a maximum.  Ireland is not in recession, and with this high level of debt overhanging us we have small justification for increasing our new borrowing requirement.  Our level of debt now will not even stay static.  In giving a little here and a little there and not attacking the tax system with true reform the Minister has allowed a golden opportunity to slip away.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to say that the Progressive Democrats have not considered those people in receipt of social welfare benefits.At least when we were in Government we were not responsible for implementing a disgraceful increase of 2.5 per cent for social welfare claimants.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to discover so far any substantial work done on this matter prior to my accession to office.  I do not have any body of work, of which I am aware, to build on, beyond the very valuable work that is being done in the forum where there has been an exchange between the parties about how we could value the concerns of the Unionist tradition in Ireland.  I have made suggestions in this regard and in regard to commemorations and other such recognitions of the value and validity of the Unionist tradition on the island of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of increased pluralism in our society is an important issue as far as the Unionist community is concerned.It is important, however, and I am making this point in deference to the previous Government, that it is clearly stated in paragraph 6 of the Downing <Col N="391" /> Street Declaration that the changes referred to are to be considered in the course of political dialogue with the Unionist tradition, in other words it is clearly anticipated in the Downing Street Declaration that the Unionist tradition should tell us what it is about this State that it regards as being in any way threatening and that we should act on the concerns expressed, not that we should set out to transpose our own ideas about what they might think into reality and say that is designed to satisfy them.  It is a matter for them to say what is of concern to them and we have not reached the point since the Downing Street Declaration where such a level of political dialogue has occurred that one could say one had had authentic representation from the representatives of the Unionist community of the type of changes that might be needed to remove the obstacles they might regard as being there to a fuller understanding between them and us.</P>

In that regard would the Taoiseach not consider in advance of the constitutional issues, and they are separate from other legal issues, setting in train a review process so that we can review for our own sake the things that make this society less acceptable to those who want to see pluralism?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="392" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two parts to the Deputy's question.  First there is her statement that it is most unlikely the Unionist tradition would wish to express views about changes required here, but if that is the case part of paragraph 6 of the Downing Street Declaration is defunct.It states:</P>
      <P>In recognition of the fears of the Unionist community and as a token of his willingness to make a personal contribution to the building up of that necessary trust, the Taoiseach will examine with his colleagues any elements in the democratic life and organisation of the Irish State that can be represented to the Irish Government in the course of political dialogue as a real and substantial threat to their way of life and ethos,...</P>
      <P>It is clear that that passage in the Downing Street Declaration, about which the Deputy has put down a question, is exclusively predicated on the expression by Unionists of a concern in this matter. The Deputy has said that she regards it as unlikely they will ever do.  If that is the case both her question and that passage in the Downing Street Declaration are beside the point.</P>
      <P>I happen to disagree with her as I think in the process of coming together in terms of understanding the two traditions on the island it is reasonable that we should listen to criticism from people on the other side.  From time to time we are willing to criticise certain aspects of the Unionist tradition but if that is the case we should be equally willing to listen to criticism in the course of political dialogue that he might wish to make to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Second, the Deputy asked whether we should make such changes for their own sake.  Of course we should and the Government is intent on doing that. Precisely because we recognise that such changes should be made for their own sake.  The Government is in the process of initiating an overall review of the Constitution and is also proposing certain other specific changes to the <Col N="393" /> Constitution which are referred to in the joint programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach.Paragraph 6 was not meant to be a unilateral declaration by us or a unilateral examination of where we fall down on pluralism but when we finally start talking to the Unionists and engage in dialogue on an all-party basis we can do that.  Paragraph 6 goes on to state:</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach hopes that over time a meeting of hearts and minds will develop, which will bring all the people of Ireland together, and will work towards that objective,...</P>
      <P>Even if the Taoiseach were to take the view that we had some work to do &mdash; and he has said recently at Question Time that his constitutional review will be commenced &mdash; there are changes already under discussion as part of the framework document.  We have a strong record on pluralism in education at first, second and third level.  For example, we have a Muslim school whereas in the UK they have none &mdash; it is frowned on. On that, we have a strong position.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that the reason no work was done on this issue was that it was never intended that we should try to force anyone?  There was never to be a unilateral examination, but cross-party dialogue after the framework document was completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is broadly correct.As I read that paragraph of the Downing Street Declaration, it was never the intention that the Irish Government should write the Unionists' agenda for them.  It is a matter for them to write their own agenda.  Deputy Harney has a point in that regard which was dealt with at the forum.</P>

    <P>We must make the maximum effort to understand Unionist concerns.  If I were asked to express a personal opinion about that I would say that their concerns are broader than simply questions of pluralism in terms of laws or various subjects.  Unionists feel they are British and have a loyalty to Britain and to the <Col N="394" /> sense of a multinational state which is Britain.  They consider themselves to be simultaneously Irish and British.  The challenge for us is to try to find a way to accommodate that within our sense of what it is to be Irish &mdash; to have a sense of Irishness which is inclusive of people who feel they are Irish but who are, at the same time, British.</P>
    <P>This year marks the 50th anniversary of the ending of World War II when 10,000 Irish people from both sides of the Border wearing British uniforms lost their lives in bringing to an end the worst tyranny in the history of mankind. April 15 will be the 50th anniversary of the liberation by British forces, some of whom were Irish, of the concentration camp at Bergen-Belsen where a huge number of people, including Jews and other European nationalities, were put to death by Nazi tyranny.  Great credit is due to those in British and other uniforms who gave their lives to bring that appalling tyranny to an end 50 years ago this year.  If we want to reach out to people of the Unionist tradition, show an appreciation and understanding of their sense of being British, the value of that tradition to them and its global value in other senses, we should be willing to commemorate that triumph of goodness over evil.  I hope we will have the courage to do so.  For my part, I intend on the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Belsen to pay my tribute to those who gave their lives to end that tyranny and to the memory of so many, particularly Jewish people, who lost their lives before that war was successfully brought to an end.</P>

      <P>I am very pleased with the Taoiseach's reply.  I was going to ask him if the Government could find its way to honouring those who died in World Wars I and II.  Both Dr. Alderdice and Roy Garland last week referred to the fact that the Republic does not seem to have any memorials to commemorate the other tradition on this island.  Roy Garland went further and said he thought many of the memorials were to saints.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="395" /> As regards the pluralist society, when the declaration was published I took the view it should not require others to tell us what to do but that we should do it for our own sake.  I disagree with the Government's approach to constitutional change and believe it is unnecessary to appoint a committee of experts in advance of politicians looking at it.</P>
    <P>I understand it is the intention of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to publish legislation on equal status. He has given some details of what the legislation will entail and made it clear that it will prohibit discrimination on grounds of gender and race but did not refer to religion.  Will the legislation prohibit discrimination on grounds of religion?</P>

      <P>I will ask the Minister for Equality and Law Reform to consider that.  I cannot go further at this stage.  Although it is a valuable suggestion it has been made without notice and I would wish to discuss it with the Minister.</P>
      <P>The Irish State has maintained at public expense the war memorial at Islandbridge and successive Governments have maintained it in very good condition.  Recently I had occasion at the forum to pay tribute to my colleague in Meath, the then Minister of State at the Department of Finance for the work the Office of Public Works was doing to maintain the memorial.  That work was continued under Deputy Hogan and will now be continued under Deputy Higgins.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The constitutional review is underway.  However, will the Taoiseach agree that there are many areas in life <Col N="396" /> where we could improve the climate for the Unionist people and diminish any sense of threat or fear?  One of these is the area of multi-denominational education here and integrated education in the North.  Successive Ministers have sought to bring about a system of multi-denominational education.  Does the Taoiseach agree that parents who put forward such ideas should be openly welcomed?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

The separation of Church and State is a crucial matter which must be dealt with here if we are to improve understanding between the two communities and between Protestants and Catholics in this State.</P>

      <P>Question No. 1 relates to paragraph 6 of the Downing Street Declaration which specifically relates to Unionists' concerns about this State and is not related to changes we <Col N="397" /> might wish to make for our own sake.  I hope the Deputy understands that.  Her question does not derive from the question tabled by her party leader.  As far as the matter on which she has expressed an opinion is concerned, I regard the Churches as having a very valuable role to play in all political dialogue in this country.  I do not see anything threatening about any Church expressing opinions on issues of legislation or otherwise.  It is important that people in elected political office have the courage and self-confidence to disagree with Churches when that is appropriate and equally the confidence to agree with them when appropriate.  We should not find ourselves in the position where, for reasons of political correctness or otherwise, we feel we have to disagree with an opinion coming from a particular source, for example, a Church just because it happens to come from that source.</P>
      <P>We must show a willingness, as a mature democracy, to accept the representations of Churches as representations, nothing more and nothing less. We must remember the great record of the Churches in the provision of social services in many instances before the State provided them.  The Churches have every right to express their opinion, we must listen to it but, in the end, we are the people who must make the decisions.</P>

      <P>The report was published this morning by the NESC, having been considered by the Government.

      <P>The question asked was not whether the Government had an opinion on the matter; rather if the Taoiseach received a report on rural <Col N="399" /> development from the NESC; and, if so, when he intends to publish it.  I answered that question.  As far as the intentions of the Government are concerned, the Government will devise a pilot programme for public services which will be established and monitored by me.  This programme will implement the NESC recommendation that innovative approaches to delivery of services in rural areas should be explored.  The Government is also committed to reform of the system of local government to render it more a vehicle for rural development.  A statement of Government policy on this will be issued by the end of April next.  Various Ministers, and relevant Departments, will assess the recommendations in this detailed informative report.</P>

Indeed, when representations were made to the outgoing Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Cowen, he said he was unable to change the policy.I am attempting to pursue the line pursued by NESC in finding a single suitable place where all of these services can be co-ordinated, such as services <Col N="401" /> provided by post offices, banks, health boards and county councils.</P>

      <P>Action to tackle unemployment, especially long term unemployment is one of the Government's main priorities and as such is relevant to the operations of a number of Departments and agencies.The concentration in particular areas of high levels of unemployment and of social exclusion requires a targeted approach to address, not alone the issue of unemployment, but all of the facets of deprivation which result from and reinforce unemployment.</P>
      <P>The major instrument for tackling long term unemployment and targeting areas of disadvantage is the operational programme for local urban and rural development which is supported under the EU Structural Funds and co-ordinated by my Department.  The operational programme comprises three sub-programmes &mdash; local enterprise, integrated development of designated disadvantaged and other areas, and urban and village renewal.  Its primary objective is to provide a framework in which communities become the prime movers in an integrated approach to their own development.  This will aim to integrate the long term unemployed and other marginalised groups into the labour market to promote education and training measures to tackle social exclusion and to regenerate the environment in cities, towns and villages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disadvantaged areas to be targeted under the sub-programme have been designated and the boundaries will be announced in due course.  In these <Col N="405" /> areas partnership companies will be formally established over the coming months.  Funding of approximately £84 million will be available.</P>
    <P>In unemployment blackspots the Government will be seeking to develop a more co-ordinated and targeted approach to the delivery of mainstream services to the unemployed.  For example, community employment is a key resource in the designated areas. Community employment achieved an average participation level last year of 31,000 and provision has been made in the budget to achieve an average participation level of 38,500 in 1995.</P>
    <P>The percentage unemployed in the Dublin region in the years 1966, 1975 and 1985 was 3.7 per cent, 9.7 per cent and 19.4 per cent respectively.  The labour force survey figures used are based on the principal economic status classification.Comparable labour force survey data is not available for 1965, hence the 1966 Census of Population results are given.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  On occasions in the past I heard the Minister vigorously make an issue of unemployment in the Dublin area and suggesting ways to address the problem.  To borrow a phrase from a colleague, there was a good deal of waffle in the first part of the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>The £84 million will <Col N="406" /> be spent in 19 areas in Dublin which will form 11 partnership companies.  In approximately 35 partnership areas throughout the country the money will be allocated through ADM Limited which is funded by the Exchequer and the EU.  It will be targeted at disadvantaged areas identified in a scientific and impartial manner.  I will announce the precise boundaries for those areas shortly.  Single person employment opportunities or opportunities for employing one to five persons will be identified in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>It is my intention that over a period this will result in the creation of a substantial number of jobs.  I suggest that a reasonable target for job creation over a five year period is in the region of 8,000 jobs.  Deputy Callely will be aware that as Lord Mayor of Dublin I set a number of strategic moves in motion, some of which are bearing fruit.  Dublin is a blackspot and in recognition of that 19 areas of the county will form approximately 11 partnership companies which will be funded through this scheme.</P>

That is why of all the regions in the country, Dublin will have 19 designated disadvantaged areas forming 11 partnership companies, approximately one-third of all the partnership companies in the country which will operate at a local level in disadvantaged areas.  The objective of this scheme is that it be integrated and targeted.</P>

      <P>Since the Minister accepts that Dublin is the largest blackspot in the country, can he make more global decisions, such as, announcing an end to the decentralisation programme? It is a sore point with many Dubliners that even though Dublin has the highest percentage unemployed there is a constant transfer of existing jobs to other parts of the country which involves a cost as many civil servants have to be as it were, bribed and promoted out of turn to encourage them to move from Dublin.  Having regard to that will the Government announce an end to the decentralisation progamme?</P>

Many of those women are only marginally above the means test levels and, consequently, do not qualify for unemployment assistance although they are in great need of assistance from programmes tackling social exclusion.  Will the Minister arrange for at least a percentage of women on credits to participate in the schemes under this major investment?</P>

The statistical data used to determine deprivation was the percentage in higher and lower professional classes; the percentage leaving school at 15 years or under and 20 years and over; the percentage in the unskilled manual classes; the unemployment rate, which includes the unemployment rate for women; the percentage in small scale farming; the labour force participation rate, which answers, part of the question raised by the Deputy, and the age dependency rate.

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is yes. Governments do not create jobs but Governments can facilitate communities in creating jobs.  The objective of this scheme is to empower people to create jobs for themselves.  It is not just an exercise in job creation it is an exercise in empowerment and local democracy. So far as my Department had any input into that in the recent budget, £84 million is being made available, approximately £250,000 of which will be Exchequer funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  The Minister made a number of points, with which I agree, about targeting, an integrated approach and co-ordination.  He said there would be a scientific examination of the areas identified.  Who will carry out the scientific examination and who will identify the areas?  He said he would announce shortly the designated areas.  Huge sums of money have been spent in the past on many of these areas. Presumably, the areas on which money has been spent on pilot programmes will <Col N="410" /> be used for the schemes.  I am particularly concerned about the inner city schemes which would be of interest to both of us.  It is an area in which a huge amount of State resources has been spent on targeting schemes.  Will the Minister try to co-ordinate the work of the ADM companies the partnership companies, FÁS work and the other educational schemes &mdash; work we have not completed &mdash; because they all work in the same communities and do not always co-operate together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>While I recognise there have been co-ordination difficulties in the past I will consider the Deputy's points.  The pilot programmes in place will remain, with the exception of one change, if the proposals I am proceeding with are finalised, but it will be to the benefit of the local community and it will not affect the north inner city, if my recollection is correct.  There are seven parts to this: statistical data which provided a ranking of areas in terms of overall deprivation; the live register; age by duration analysis; application for the global grant for local development; the development of social welfare community development programme &mdash; the Department of Social Welfare's community development programme &mdash; data relating to the percentage unemployed in local authority rented accommodation; the report on County Dublin areas of need and extensive consultation on an area-by-area basis by the national co-ordinating team.  The boundaries have been chosen on a scientific basis and in consultation with the communities.</P>

Is the Minister aware of concern expressed by people involved in combating poverty that some of the community employment schemes and the partnership companies are not attracting the long term unemployed?Given the continuing growth in unemployment will he agree to monitor <Col N="411" /> these projects to ensure that the uptake is coming from within the statistical base of the long term unemployed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I did not have an opportunity to do so either for-maly or informally.  In answer to an earlier question the Minister praised the community employment scheme and gave the average rate during 1995 <i>vis-à-vis</i> 1994.  In 1994 the participation rate increased from 20,000 in January to 40,000 in December, giving an average participation rate of 35,000.  We are now starting at a participation rate of 40,000. Therefore, the numbers which the Minister proposed of 38,000 &mdash; plus are a decrease on the number employed in very worthwhile projects.</P>

I set the target that most of those companies should be up and running by June.  If, by September there is not a partnership company in every area throughout the country there should be a steering committee.  If we can set that pace the follow through in terms of jobs in those blackspot areas should be swift.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>In my written reply to Deputy O'Rourke on 26 January, I set out the details of Government financing and subsidies for Irish Steel in the years 1983 to 1994.  The total equity currently held by the Government is £125 million, £25 million of which was held prior to 1983.</P>
      <P>As part of its viability plan submitted to my Department the company has sought a capital injection of £40 million and a loan guarantee of £10 million.  The amount per job that the capital injection represents is £125,000.  It is not easy to determine the cost of the loan guarantee but if this is regarded as similar to the capital injection it would bring the total amount per job to £156,250.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly the cost of the proposed viability plan is quite significant. <Col N="417" /> Against this, however, the cost of closure is also likely to be significant.  In that context, the Government is carefully assessing the company's application for funding and I am hopeful that the assessment can be concluded at an early date.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with its assessment of the company's application for funds, the Government is currently examining the possibility of securing a strategic partner for Irish Steel.  Any such partner would have to be capable of contributing to the financial success of the company and also to securing economies for the company through improved marketing and rationalisation of the product range.</P>
    <P>Any proposed aid to Irish Steel is of course subject to European Union approval.  In considering applications for aid in the steel industry, the European Commission applies the criterion that the company should attain viability within a three year time span.  In assessing viability, the Commission specifies the gross operating margin which steel companies must achieve under normal market conditions in order to attain lasting financial viability. In submitting any application to the Commission for approval of aid to Irish Steel, it is important that the Government be in a position to satisfy the Commission that viability can be attained on the basis of the criteria set down by the Commission.  The Government assessment of the company's application for funding is also being considered in this context.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for the reply.  A similar reply could have been given last April, August, October or December.  We on this side of the House wish to remain helpful about the whole issue of Irish Steel.  How does the Minister explain, two months into office, the delay in considering the viability plan and in attracting a strategic partner?  What urgency is being injected into the plan to get a strategic partner and how many strategic partners have been identified?  The Minister <Col N="418" /> may say it is a matter of market sensitivity, but we read in the papers every day about the would-be suitors for Irish Steel and, since they are floated in the papers, the Minister may wish to float them in the Dáil also.  First, why is there a delay in this matter; second, when will a decision be made; third, who are the likely suitors and, four, when will the Minister go to Europe with his begging bowl.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the Deputies' questions <i>seriatim</i>.  On the question of delays, clearly any incoming Government needs to give very careful consideration to a project which is so important to the Cobh area.  I make no apology for giving very careful consideration to the issue.  There has been no undue delay in this matter.  The company has set itself ambitious production targets which are part of its viability plan and is seeking time to assess its ability to meet those targets which are clearly of crucial importance in terms of the Government's consideration of the issue.</P>
      <P>The Government will consider this issue at an early date.  As the Deputy correctly said, the number of suitors is not a matter which I want to discuss in public but I can say that my Department is taking steps to ensure it has the necessary expertise available to it to assess proposals as they are put forward and that no time is lost in dealing with those who have expressed an interest in the matter.  On the question of going to Europe with the begging bowl, this does not arise as the Commission would not allocate funds to such a project.</P>

I have been informed that production levels dropped during the last quarter of 1994 and January 1995.  I appreciate the Minister's points about market sensitivity but somebody in his Department is giving very graphic and comprehensive information about proposed suitors for Irish Steel.

      <Quest>the measures, if any, which have been taken by him to establish a special unit in his Department to assist the social partners in developing new ways of working, increasing labour management co-operation and strengthening economic and social partnership at enterprise level, as promised in the policy document A Government of Renewal.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>Work is progressing in my Department on establishing the special unit signalled in the Programme for Government to assist the social partners in developing improved management-employer relationships at the level of enterprise.  In line with the partnership approach, the social partners are being asked to supply a guiding input to the work of the unit.</P>
      <P>An objective of the unit's work is to encourage greater management/labour co-operation in the management of change so that confrontation is avoided. Following the recent dispute mentioned by Deputy O'Rourke, ICTU made a suggestion for a mechanism to be put in place to identify companies at risk from competitive forces.  An early warning process is in existence and is under constant review to ensure its effectiveness. However, I am in contact with both ICTU and IBEC, as well as with State agencies, about establishing a liaison group to advise on particular areas of industry where adjustment to competitive pressures and threats is required. This could be the most effective way of anticipating, in so far as can be done, what must be addressed in particular areas of business so as to adapt and prosper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I specifically asked the Minister about the special unit to which, I think, there is a reference in the Programme for Government.  I take it from what he said that advice is being sought from ICTU and IBEC.  Will a unit be dedicated to carrying out this work within the Department; in other words, will people be given the function?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A unit will be established to deal with new ways of working, <Col N="421" /> increasing labour/management co-operation and strengthening partnership at an enterprise level.  Part of its task will be to foresee the changes needed to achieve world class manufacturing status etc., and to facilitate greater interchange of information and participation by workers generally.  An advisory group, involving the social partners and the agencies, has been set up to liaise with the unit.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions was anxious that we would look specifically at companies which are facing competitive threats. Discussions are taking place with the social partners on the establishment of a liaison group to see how best we can involve the social partners in the process of anticipating particular difficulties which might arise in various sectors. While these are essentially two different tasks they clearly overlap to a considerable extent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it from what the Minister said that there will be two groups &mdash; a loosely convened consultative group who will be on the look-out, so to speak, for signals from particular segments of industry which foresee potential storms and a dedicated unit within the Department which will carry out the same task on a regular rather than a sporadic basis.  This is very laudable.When I was in the Department I was constantly referring to the need for such a unit but at that time it was noninterventionist.I wish the Minister and his Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte &mdash; I think the Minister's other colleague, Dame Eithne, is in Australia &mdash; every success in this regard.  There is a need for industries to anticipate threats rather than wait for the storm to crash around them, as happened in the recent dispute to which I referred in my question.Instead of waiting for the danger signals the Department and the unit should anticipate threats long before they arise.  I did not see any reference in the budget or the Estimates to dedicated funding for this unit.  Obviously it will be funded out of the subhead for the Department.  It would be good&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am at present examining a number of issues in relation to the long term unemployed, including the recommendations of the National Economic and Social Forum.  In this context I will consider the possibility of targeted number reductions in long term unemployment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's reply.  I hope you will bear with me, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, while I make a brief point.  During our negotiations with the Labour Party on the formation of a Government, I made a specific recommendation that there should be numerical targets for the long <Col N="423" /> term unemployed as distinct from targets for the unemployed.  This recommendation was not included in the programme of the rainbow Government.  It is the only way we will be able to help the long term unemployed; we are inclined to think of unemployed people as one mass instead of as individuals with potential and aspirations which are dimmed as each month goes by.  As the Minister said, the number of long term unemployed increased last year, despite an increase in employment, and it continues to increase.  I urge him to act on his instincts and set numerical targets for the long term unemployed.  If we fail to achieve them we can make an even greater effort the following month or quarter.  When I met the Minister for Social Affairs in Belgium I was informed that they do this satisfactorily. This would provide institutions and organisations with an incentive to find a remedy to the problem.</P>

A sum of £6 million has been set aside in the budget to establish on a pilot basis, a local employment service targeted at the long term unemployed and those considered to be at risk of becoming long term unemployed.  This is the product of the work of the NESF and we hope will lead to a more coherent and client-driven approach being adopted in our intervention to support the long term unemployed.</P>

      <P>The policy agreement for Government provides for the strengthening of the competition law by giving the Competition Authority powers of enforcement and by enabling the courts to impose stiff fines on those found to be engaging in unfair competition.Providing for fines by the court meets the concern I expressed in the July 1994 newspaper article in relation to the Competition Authority having real teeth when is comes to enforcement.</P>
      <P>The policy agreement also provides for the reconsideration of proposals contained in the Competition Bill, 1994 in relation to mergers and take-overs, in discussion with the social partners.

I do not have the information sought by the Deputy on the projects which have applied to the board for grant aid.  Over 2,700 individual projects have been approved by the 35 boards since their inception in 1993 to 31 December 1994. It would be impractical to list these individually and in any event it is a day to day matter for the boards.

      <P>Is the Minister happy that each county enterprise board will receive the same contribution of £500,000 and that there is no system under which he could discriminate in favour of areas where there is economic and social deprivation?  In this regard Dublin, where one-third of the population live, is being discriminated against.  Is the Minister aware that as the boards concentrate mainly on their obligation to provide grant aid they lack qualified staff to provide assistance and advice?  Will the Minister comment on a two paragraph rejection of an application by a father and son who went to great trouble in making the application only to be told that it had been examined, that there was an over-supply of business in the area and that they were not in a position to fund the project? That type of rejection letter to an applicant does not do anything to assist in stimulating the project idea put forward by that individual.</P>

      <P>Decisions such as the one described by the Deputy are delegated to the local board and would not be routinely brought to my attention. The boards must take into account certain criteria in deciding on projects, one of which would be the potential of displacement, as it is called.  In other words, would the establishment of one project put another project out of business?Issues such as that can result in a rejection of what might seem, to the promoter, to be a worth-while project.  I accept the Deputy's point about the same poundage being allocated to all enterprise boards.  In the longer term I would not like to see that continuing.  It was a short term measure to get the boards up and running but we should relate grant aid to the quality of programmes put forward and the type of problems they are designed to address. I also accept the Deputy's point in relation to the need for advice and other such supports to be available to the county enterprise boards.  I am glad to say that, when the details of the operational programme on local development are in place, the county enterprise boards will have access to the provision of soft supports, as they would be described, for their clients.</P>

      <P>Before the sos I was referring to the fact that the word &ldquo;radical&rdquo; had been used &mdash; or rather abused &mdash;<Col N="493" /> by several Ministers in relation to this budget debate.  I do not know if the Members who spoke about a radical budget understand the word &ldquo;radical&rdquo;. In this present favourable economic climate it is disappointing that the Minister for Finance did not seize the golden opportunity to bring in a radical budget, particularly in relation to tax reform.  A number of economic commentators said that the Minister has basically tinkered around with the system.  There is nothing particularly radical or innovative in the budget and it is unfortunate that this opportunity was missed.</P>
      <P>With regard to social welfare recipients, many people will be glad of the £7 per month increase in child benefit. However, we should examine this issue from the point of view of general income because it is not right that wealthy people should receive exactly the same amount as those who are finding it very difficult to hold their heads above water.</P>
      <P>I am particularly disappointed that a Government which includes both Labour and Democratic Left &mdash; and particularly a Democratic Left Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; should have provided a mere 2.5 per cent increase for social welfare claimants.  That is regrettable. When one considers what inflation figures may turn out to be for this year, we are perhaps talking about 3 per cent rather than 2.5 per cent.  That is obviously open to argument but if we have another budget from this Government &mdash; Minister Rabbitte talked about having three more budgets &mdash; I hope I will not be in a position to say &ldquo;I told you so&rdquo; because in terms of pensioners it would be a terrible indictment of a Government if their increases do not even match rates of inflation for this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to mention an area about which I am particularly concerned and that is the whole area of education.  The debate on covenants is very pertinent to this area also.  To a certain extent the budget saved the Minister's blushes because a promise that seemed like a <Col N="494" /> good idea last July &mdash; perhaps there was talk of an election &mdash; had to be accommodated.The Minister promised free third level education at a time when she has received the de Buitléir report which investigated the area of third level grants etc.  It would have been a good idea if it had stemmed from a genuine regard for those hard-pressed PAYE workers who are squeezed out of the system and need to be accommodated.However, by that announcement last July, the Minister pre-empted all discussion on the de Buitléir report.  She published part of the report, for political reasons &mdash; I cannot say who was responsible for that decision.  The Minister still holds that portfolio and she should have taken responsibility for this.  She published only that part of the report which it was politically expedient to publish and which had to do with the question of administration of grants.  We did not see at that time what the report had to say about expanding the grants system. That report makes an uncontestable argument for the taking into account of capital assets in assessing eligibility for higher education grants on the grounds that it is reasonable that those who have the wealth should finance their own children's education.  In common with other Members, I have repeatedly called for a full debate to examine those proposals to see if the measures proposed would address the imbalances and inequalities that existed and still exist within the system.</P>
    <P>The de Buitléir report recommends that the system of convenanting income to children in college should be abolished but the Government has taken a blunderbuss approach.  I should like to give an example.  There are many who are extremely concerned about the abolition of tax relief on covenants.  I speak in particular about people who, like myself, have had the struggle of caring for elderly relatives, especially parents, in their own home if they are lucky.  There are circumstances where that is not possible.  I am sure many Members heard the reaction of the <Col N="495" /> Alzheimer's Society to the abolition of tax relief on covenants.</P>
    <P>I have here correspondence from a constituent which is a good example of the concerns which need to be addressed by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Bill.  This letter expresses concern about the interpretation of the budget provisions on covenants.  The writer goes on to say that his wife's mother, aged 92, suffers severely from senility and is in a nursing home where she receives 24-hour medical and/or nursing attention; that they have a covenant which alleviates their tax bill and all the money saved is paid, together with a substantially greater amount of their income, to the nursing home.  Those of us who have had elderly relatives or parents in nursing homes know exactly how expensive that is. This practice is most certainly not a ploy to avoid income tax but is solely for the benefit of the elderly sick person.</P>
    <P>According to an interpretation in <i>The Irish Times</i> it is proposed to limit such covenants, even those for the benefit of the elderly, to 5 per cent of the incomes of those covenanting.  My constituent and his wife are assessed jointly for income tax purposes and such a limitation of 5 per cent would severly affect their capacity to continue funding the nursing home outlay and would have serious personal consequences for them both.  There are many other couples throughout the country who avail of this method of helping their elderly parents.  The letter writer goes on to say that he is sure it was never the intention of the Minister for Finance to punish the elderly and their carers in such a way because it would be so unfair.  I do not think it would be the active intention of any Minister for Finance to do that.  I ask, therefore, that this matter be rectified or, at the very least, if concerns such as this are unnecessary that the Minister make it obvious to people that they will not be caught in this appalling situation and, if necessary that it will be corrected in the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="496" /> To return to the field of education, there is no doubt that the post-leaving certificate colleges have been further disadvantaged through this budget.  At the moment they provide 17,500 places. The Minister has said that next year it will be about 20,000 places.  These colleges have no maintenance grants and now covenanting is not available either. The many students in those colleges will be faced with the worst of all worlds. They have secured places on reputable PLC courses which have certification but they cannot take up offers because they have no eligibility for maintenance grants.  To take an example from my own constituency, Dún Laoghaire Community College which runs post-leaving certificate courses has an excellent reputation and has many courses which attract students from all over the country.Those students have to pay rent, travel and eat and they are being utterly disadvantaged by the lack of covenanting and the fact that there are no maintenance grants either.  Some of those courses last up to three years and it is inherently unfair that those students should be left out of the circle.  The Minister must examine the whole question of PLC colleges.  Somebody told me yesterday that many people do not know what is meant by a PLC course, although vast numbers of young people are being accommodated within that system.  There is good and bad in this budget.  The budget is bad for PLC colleges and detrimental to many young people.  The question of covenanting must be re-examined in the context of the Finance Bill.</P>

      <P>People in business talk about trends.  A radical budget does not mean knocking 2 per cent off corporation profits tax.  It means doing something substantial that will make a difference.What I would look for in a budget is innovation, direction and strategy, <Col N="497" /> and this is where the Minister has fallen down.  He has attempted to do good here and there but in the final analysis the budget is not much good at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing her time.  The 1995 budget was hailed well in advance as having the potential to be one of the most significant budgets of recent times.  This Minister had a far more favourable opening position than any of his predecessors for more than a decade.  Since last September the public have been assured that the tax yield from 1994 was well in advance of what had been anticipated, that all the economic indicators were encouraging and that the Irish Exchequer was bursting with good health.  This created a sense of anticipation in every sector in society.  To add to the spice, this was to be the first budget since the foundation of the State to be introduced by a socialist Minister and to have input from three political parties supposedly spanning a broad policy spectrum.  After all the anticipation, what happened?  The mountain laboured and brought forth a mouse. This budget is, by any standards, a measly, miserable budget with an aspiration for everything and a prescription for very little.  We might well ask who will benefit at the end of the day in any significant way.  I am sure we will be in a very good position to make that judgment long before we make our contribution on budget 1996.  In overall terms, this is a threadbare budget, lacking in any strategy aimed at tackling the fundamental economic and social problems besetting our country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The PAYE sector continues to be penalised despite very minor adjustments in the budget.  This was the budget of lost opportunities where the favourable opening position gave substantial scope for tax reform and tax reduction but in spite of that, the PAYE sector continues to be penalised.  A comparison with our counterparts in Northern Ireland helps to illustrate the point, where not alone is the tax free allowance higher than in the Republic <Col N="498" /> but, additionally, £20,700 of income is taxed at the rate of 25 per cent whereas in the Republic only £8,200 is taxed at the lower rate of 27 per cent.  In taxation terms a single taxpayer in Northern Ireland can be more than two and a half times better off than his counterpart in the Republic.  Not alone does this illustrate the position of PAYE and other taxpayers, it also illustrates a difficulty that will have to be confronted in these days of increasing mobility of labour and goods between the two parts of the country &mdash; which I hope will increase and expand in time.  Not only are we grossly overtaxed compared with our nearest and other European neighbours but do we get value for money for our taxes?  Do we have better public services?The contrary is the case.  The standard of public services here is at best patchy and, in many cases, grossly inadequate; so we end up with poor public transport, appalling road conditions and an inadequate health service, an underdeveloped system of community care, a system of education where thousands of young people leave Irish schools lacking in basic numeracy and literacy skills and without any of the skills that would lead them to a lifetime of employment and self-sufficiency.  As well as that, the local authority services that determine our everyday living standards, particularly in urban areas, have deteriorated in many cases to the point of disintegration.  We might well feel sour at being called upon to pay such a high level of taxation in return for such a poor level of services.  In other European countries such as Denmark and Germany people pay high taxes but they have superb public services.  However, that is not the case here and it is about time taxpayers began to analyse the value they are getting for money.</P>
    <P>The budget has done nothing of significance to break the cycle of dependency and poverty which seems to be endemic in many parts of my constituency and almost every other constituency.I find that very disturbing.  I had hoped that with a Democratic Left Minister for Social Welfare the budget <Col N="499" /> would introduce significant measures aimed at breaking the cycle of dependency and encouraging and rewarding people who were willing and able to take on a job creating earned income to enhance the family budget.  This did not happen in the budget and, as a result, I can point to examples in the heart of my constituency where women &mdash; and I use this only as an example &mdash; on community employment schemes in the Glen who, because of the policy of means testing social welfare benefits, end up taking home £8 of additional income having worked a 20 hour week. Surely that is a very poor incentive to get women to take on self-improvement courses and jobs that will enable them to earn some of the family income. Instead of being rewarded for their effort and motivated to do that, they are penalised to an extent.  Is it not a scandal that a woman who works for 20 hours per week ends up £8 better off?  Surely, there is something fundamentally wrong that needs to be addressed and I hoped it would have been in the context of this budget.  Even at this stage I appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare to take this matter into account when he frames the Social Welfare Bill.  Unless it is, casual and part-time workers, mainly women, and those on community schemes will lose heart, abandon the schemes and decide it is better to stay at home and remain dependent on the State.</P>
    <P>I strongly appeal to the Minister for Social Welfare to take this example as not merely including a small number of people in a given area but as being widespread.  I have with me hundreds of signatures from people in that position which I intend to present to the Minister before the end of the day, ask him to apply himself to this matter in the context of a Social Welfare Bill and, more fundamentally, in the context of next year's budget if he still has an input into it.  The reality is that it stems from the amount of money in take home pay that any family is allowed to have before they come into the tax net.  Part of the <Col N="500" /> reason we have such poverty is that this figure is too low and must be addressed if we are to motivate people to break the cycle of dependency and become self-sufficient with the resultant benefits for individuals and families in society.</P>
    <P>Another matter not addressed in the budget, which saddens me, is that the budget made no provision to pay compensation to the victims of hepatitis C. It is now exactly 12 months, February 1994, since it was disclosed that hundreds of women throughout the country, through no fault of their own, had contracted hepatitis C as a result of contaminated anti-D product.  This startling revelation caused unprecedented worry and trauma for a number of women and their families.  There are 90 such women in the Cork region, 51 of whom live in the city.  The Minister for Health and the Programme for Government promised to make compensation available for these helpless victims.  It is welcome indeed but no provision of any kind has been made in the budget to make that promise a reality.  That is a great mistake because women in that position are incurring expenses by the day and have reasonable expectations that compensation moneys will be provided for and paid to them this year.  The matter was first revealed in February 1994.  Will they have to wait until February, 1996, 1997 or 1998 before money is provided for in the budget?  I hope not.  I hope a supplementary budget will be introduced this year so that the payments due to these women can be made.</P>
    <P>The increase in social welfare benefits saddened us most particularly as they relate to the elderly and poor in society. To offer old age pensioners a miserable 2.5 per cent increase was perhaps the meanest measure of this budget, as Shakesperare said &ldquo;the unkindest cut of all&rdquo;.  Even in the bleakest days of bleak budgets there was never a figure as low as 2.5 per cent offered to recipients of social welfare.  When we were in Government with Fianna Fáil and dubbed Thatcherites we never gave an increase less that the rate of inflation to social welfare recipients.  I wonder who <Col N="501" /> are the new Thatcherites of this Government and what difference does it make to Government strategy to have Democratic Left make its input to it?</P>
    <P>During the course of successive election campaigns we were told service charges would be abolished and other benefits would accrue to the electorate but what do we find?  Not alone are service charges copperfastened but they will be introduced in other areas as a result of budgetary measures.  This is a bad budget for every sector of the community.I expected more from the three parties who make up the Government. Instead of getting more everyone got less.  The parties in Government will rue the day they did not seize this opportunity which may never again present itself as economic factors may never again be as favourable as they were on this occasion.  They are condemned for failing to grasp the nettle and put in place a budget that will benefit the country.</P>

    <P>Deputies will be aware from the newspaper columns among other sources, of the extremely lively debate which has taken place in recent weeks in connection with funding for the arts in the context of the Estimates in the 1995 budget.  I welcome the emergence of a strong and coherent voice which articulates the rationale for Government funding of the arts and overall, the recent high level of media attention given to this topic has been beneficial in advancing the debate on this important subject.</P>
    <P>The House will by now be aware that, in line with the commitment in the <i>Programme for Government</i> of the previous administration, I requested An Chomhairle Ealaíon to prepare a three year plan for the Arts in late 1993.  I enjoyed the support of Cabinet colleagues in so doing.  Indeed, the significance of this initiative in that Government should not be lost to the House.  Only once before has any Government committed itself to a planned approach for the arts when, in 1987, the White Paper <i>Access and Opportunity</i> was published by the then Coalition Government in which my party was a member.  That White Paper held out the hope that the arts would move from the margins of Government's concerns by means of a planned and structured policy programme. Unfortunately, a change of Government very early after the publication of the White Paper put paid to those optimistic expectations and relegated arts activity to what might be called the relative doldrums once again.</P>
    <P>The publication by An Chomhairle Ealaíon last week of <i>The Arts Plan</i><Col N="503" /><i>1995-97</i> represents only the second commitment by a Government in the history of this State to approach both the promotion of the arts in Ireland and arts funding on a planned basis.  In this context, I would like to place on the record of the House the fact that there has been an important qualitative shift in the commitments made towards the plan in the programmes of the previous administration and that of this Government.While the 1993 programme for a Partnership Government stated: the Arts Council will be asked to operate on a co-ordinated three-yearly plan for funding of the arts.</P>
    <P>I believe there is even stronger commitment in the document <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> which is the policy basis of this Government, since it states clearly that <i>The Arts Plan 1995-97</i> will be a basis for a programme of action for the arts.  I welcome this qualitative shift in emphasis in this Government's programme.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the fact that <i>The Arts Plan 1995-97</i> has been prepared by An Chomhairle Ealaíon in close consultation with my Department and I am already on record as saying that the emergence of this strategic alliance between An Chomhairle Ealaíon and my Department will represent an important element of how we can achieve the plan's goals in the minimum time possible.</P>
    <P>The House is by now aware that the 1995 budget, in providing an additional £2 million for An Chomhairle Ealaíon to bring its total allocation this year to £16.25 million, presents a clear signal that the commitment in the Government's programme is already being generously responded to.  As for the future, <i>The Arts Plan 1995-1997</i> contains proposals which have both funding and policy implications for other Government Departments &mdash; for the Department of the Environment in the case of its implications for local authorities; the Department of Education in the case of its impact on the educational system; the Department of Enterprise <Col N="504" /> and Employment in the case of its implications for FÁS and the cultural industries sector; the Department of Foreign Affairs in the case of the plan's recommendation for a new independent international arts agency and the Department of Social Welfare in the case of possible implications for the social welfare code.  I am awaiting the detailed observations of these Departments and I expect to submit <i>The Arts Plan 1995-1997</i> to the Government for consideration in a matter of weeks.</P>

      <P>To answer another question posed by somebody with a connection like mine, within the historic county of County Clare, I noted that Deputy Síle de Valera and the press said that there will be dismay at the amount I have provided for the arts. However, having moved arts funding from £10 million to £16.5 million in just over two years since assuming office, I predict there would have been dismay if the public and the Arts Council were dependent on the £11.7 million which the interim Government had planned for the arts.</P>

      <P>As the Minister will know, the arts plan was for a sum of £19 million for 1995 alone whereas, as he has said, we are now talking about £16.25 million.  Therefore, I hope the Minister will be able to make up the shortfall of almost £3 million in 1995.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking up that point, I am sure the Deputy will agree that, <Col N="505" /> when I left in November, with the Arts Council having agreed £14.25 million, it is getting nearer to £19 million to move it to £16.25 million than to revert to the figure of £11.27.  Therefore, I am happy to allow the public to judge in which direction I and that interim Government were moving.</P>
      <P>In my introductory remarks on funding for An Chomhairle Ealaíon, I adverted to the welcome emergence of an arts lobby.  I would emphasise to the House that, for such a lobby to prove effective, it is important that it remains strong, cohesive and coherent.  As I already stated, the recent media attention on arts funding is broadly welcome. However, I have a problem with one aspect of that lobby which criticises funding for one aspect of the arts on the rather spurious grounds that this implies less funding for the particular arts activity in which they are involved.</P>
      <P>In launching <i>The Arts Plan 1995-1997,</i> I stressed that the arts and cultural areas will not be well served by a politics of envy.  I repeat here that each project for which I have responsibility has an importance and logic of its own. One does not succeed at the expense of the other; all will contribute to an enriched arts and cultural landscape.  I did not ask Government to choose, nor did I choose, between the importance of Teilifís na Gaeilge and the arts plan, or film, or any of the other areas for which I have responsibility.  They are building blocks on a future cultural landscape which will be comparable with what preceded it.</P>

Ba í 1994 an tríú bliain déag i ndiaidh a chéile ina raibh glanmhéadú san fhostaíocht i dtionscail faoi scáth na heagraíochta sin.</P>
    <P>Cruthaíodh 1,072 bpost nua lánaimseartha ar an bhfód i 1994 i dtionscail a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás agus, tar éis caillteanais de 630 phost &mdash; an líon is ísle post a cailleadh ó 1985 &mdash; a chur san áireamh, bhí méadú glan de bheagnach 450 post sa bhliain sin.  Ba é sin an méadú glan ba mhó in aon bhliain ó bunaíodh Údarás na Gaeltachta, rud a fhágann go raibh buaicphointe de thart ar 6,300 post i dtionscail faoi scáth an Údaráis ag deireadh 1994.  Tá ardmholadh tuillte ag an Údarás dá bharr.  Ar ndóigh, tá fostaíocht shéasúrach antábhachtach don Ghaeltacht freisin agus tháinig méadú de 160 ar líon na bpost sin le linn 1994 go dtí 3,072 dhuine.</P>
    <P>Is í straitéis an Údaráis béim a chur ar uasghrádú scileanna lucht saothair na Gaeltachta agus uasghrádú a dhéanamh freisin ar theicneolaíochtaí d'fhonn cumas iomaíochtaí chuideachtaí na Gaeltachta a threisiú.  Leanfar leis an obair sin in 1995.  Maidir le teicneolaíocht eolais, tá an tÚdarás gníomhach i gcónaí sa réimse sin ar mhaithe le forbairt na Gaeltachta.  De bharr dul chun cinn maidir leis na saoráidí sin, ní féidir a rá feasta go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht ar an imeall.  Tá sainaitheantas tugtha ag IDA Ireland do theileasheirbhísí mar cheann de na réimsí is mó fáis do thionscadail infheistíochta nua.  Táthar dóchasach go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht sa staid anois gur féidir léi a cion féin den fhorás sin a bhaint amach dá muintir.</P>
    <P>Maidir le forbairt fhisiciúil na Gaeltachta, ní miste dom a lua freisin gur suim £3.86 milliún a bheidh ar fáil i mbliana le caitheamh ar Scéimeanna Feabhsúcháin sa Ghaeltacht.  Bainfear feidhm as sciar maith den soláthar sin chun an mhórscéim muiroibreacha ar Inis Meáin/Inis Oírr a chríochnú.  Beidh airgead substaintiúil ar fáil freisin le haghaidh muiroibreacha eile, bóithre áise, forbairt chomharchumann, hallaí agus Coláistí Gaeilge agus saoráidí ilghnéitheach ar nós páirceanna imeartha, cúirteanna leadóige agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="507" /> Caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil áthas ar leith orm go bhfuil soláthar dóthaineach déanta le haghaidh tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht &mdash; in ainneoin iarrachtaí a rinneadh sa tréimhse eadar-Rialtas chun deireadh a chur leis na deontais feabhsúcháin tithe sna ceantair sin.  Is deacair a chreidiúint gur ghearr an Páirtí a bhí ag gíomhú mar Rialtas ag an am sin £800,000 &mdash; breis agus 63 faoin gcéad &mdash; as na meastacháin tithíochta don Ghaeltacht ar 29 Samhain 1994 tré dheireadh a chur leis na deontais feabhsúcháin tithe.  Ghearr siad na putóga den scéim. Bhí ormsa, mar thoradh air sin, cuid mhór ama agus oibre a chaitheamh, ó d'fhill mé ar an Roinn roimh Nollaig, ag iarraidh an t-airgead sin a fháil ar ais, i dtreo is go mbeadh dóthain airgid ar fáil do na deontais tithíochta Gaeltachta i 1995.</P>
    <P>In relation to the operation of the cultural institutions for which I am responsible, I am pleased to refer to the increased amounts which will be made available to them under this year's provision to enable them to continue their vital work in educating, informing and conserving the diversity of our cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>In addition to the normal operating costs involved, this year will also see specific sums being allocated in respect of the equipping of the new facility for the National Museum at the former Collins Barracks site.  The initial phase of this project &mdash; which I see as a flagship project for Dublin &mdash; saw an investment of £10 million in 1994 and is now nearing completion.  Detailed work will now be put in train to transform this 18th century building into a facility which will propel the National Museum into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>I am confident that this transition will be greatly assisted by the report of the Interim Board of the Museum I appointed last year to advise and make recommendations on the future of the museum and which I understand will be presented to me very shortly.</P>
    <P>Planning will also be facilitated in the allocation to the Chester Beatty Library <Col N="508" /> to assist it in preparing for its move to better, more accessible, prestigious new home at Dublin Castle, in 1997.  I look forward to continued co-operation with the trustees of this library to bring this work to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>Capital sums are also included to provide for major developments, not only in Dublin, but also at regional locations throughout the country, for example, in Limerick, Cork, Galway and Longford. I also welcome the allocations provided in the budget for a number of specific cultural projects.  Deputies will be aware that I recently invited applications in relation to cultural capital projects which would attract funding under the operational programme for tourism. Over 150 applications have been received by my Department which are currently undergoing initial appraisal. Although the funding available for the programme is certainly limited, I am confident that a number of significant cultural projects will be completed over the remaining five years of the programme.</P>
    <P>Recent media attention on the level of funding to be provided for An Comhairle Ealaíon, the Arts Council, under &ldquo;The Arts Plan 1995-1997&rdquo; has sometimes failed to acknowledge the existence of separate substantial funding for the contemporary arts which is being directed at Bord Scannán na hÉireann, the Irish Film Board, this year.  I emphasise to the House that the £16.25 million I have secured for the contemporary arts through An Comhairle Ealaíon in this year's budget must be viewed in the context of additional funding of £3.25 million which I have secured for Bord Scannán na hÉireann in this year's Estimates and even these figures ignore the annual funding which is provided by my Department for the Irish Museum of Modern Art and the National Concert Hall.  Staying with film, I should say that one of the purposes of this increased funding to Bord Scannán na hÉireann is to make the point that my commitment and that of my Department is for the development of cinematic technique and expression throughout the country <Col N="509" /> on the part of our own community and Irish practitioners.  The film industry, which sometimes receives more attention, is but one part of that cinematic expression.</P>
    <P>In 1973, with the amendment of the Arts Act, 1951, film was given recognition by the Oireachtas as an art form in its own right, one that was worthy of support by An Comhairle Ealaíon. Since the enactment of that amendment, the State's response to the promotion of film as an art form has been rather patchy.State support for the National Film Studios of Ireland in the 1970s was replaced by rather modest funding for Bord Scannán na hÉireann in the period 1980-87.  This, in turn, was replaced by section 35 incentives in the Finance Act, 1987, which limited investments in films to corporations and at relatively low levels.</P>
    <P>The implementation by me of the recommendations in the report of the Special Working Group on the Film Production Industry, which was presented to the Taoiseach in December 1992, has witnessed a radical shift in the Government's policy towards the promotion of film both as an art form in its own right and as a central element of economic and social strategies.The re-establishment of Bord Scannán an hÉireann; the substantial improvement of the section 35 incentive scheme, notably to include investments by individuals; the amendment to the Broadcasting Acts which links RTE statutorily to the independent production sector; the establishment of Teilifís na Gaeilge; the continued funding by An Comhairle Ealaíon of film and video awards as well as the provision of funding for important European-wide initiatives such as EURIMAGES, Eureka Audiovisual and the EU MEDIA desk here in Dublin &mdash; all these measures are now in place to ensure that Ireland's film and audiovisual production industry can be developed to its full potential.  An idea of the significance of the change is illustrated by the fact that last year we finished 15 films and up to 11 television <Col N="510" /> series, in the previous year too, the number of films completed was 15 while in the previous 14 years only 11 films were made in Ireland.  That gives one an idea of the dynamism these measures have released.  They are providing an art expression and jobs while the economic and social benefits are spread nationwide.</P>
    <P>The report of the special working group on the film production industry recommended funding for Bord Scannán na hÉireann rising to £3 million in the third year of operations.  It is a matter of particular satisfaction to me that I have succeeded in exceeding this funding target in 1995, which is the third year of the board's operations, by securing an overall allocation of £3.25 million for Bord Scannán na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>For the information of the Deputies, and many contact me, the support offered by Bord Scannán to Irish film productions is in the form of development loans and production loans. Development loans are given up to a maximum of £25,000.  They provide for feasibility studies and preparatory work which are necessary before the production of a film can commence and are repayable on the first day of principal photography.  Production loans are awarded on the basis of repayable equity participation of some 10 per cent of the total production budget.  In some cases of indigenous projects of exceptional quality, the board may go above this figure.  The board appoints an executive producer to each project, whose role is the monitoring of progress on the production of the film and the preparation of a report for the board.</P>
    <P>In assessing projects for assistance, the board considers a number of factors, the principal of which are: the creative strength of the project; the track record of creative team, particularly its ability to handle larger projects; in this context, the board is also committed to promoting something very important, new emerging talent; another criterion is Irish employment at all levels, particularly at Head of Department level and <Col N="511" /> among the cast; the spend on the production in the Irish economy; the commercial potential of the proposed production and the recoupment of the board's investment.</P>
    <P>In 1993, Bord Scannán na hÉireann provided development and production finance of £1 million.  In 1994, the corresponding figure was £2 million and the projection for 1995 is £2.85 million.  In 1995, it is anticipated that some £14 million will be spent in Ireland in the production of films supported by the board.  It is likely that other projects may come through before the end of 1995 and the figures could be higher. The board will also co-fund with RTE a new short films scheme for new Irish talent called Short Cuts and these six half hour films will be transmitted in the autumn of this year.  The board is providing 50 per cent of the £200,000 budget for 1995 towards this scheme.</P>
    <P>Cúis mhór áthais dom go raibh ar mo chumas, i gcomhréir le cinneadh Rialtais den 20 Eanáir 1995, cead a thabhairt do RTÉ tús a chur leis na hoibreacha caipitil i ndáil le Teilifís na Gaeilge.  With regard to the funding of the new channel, the Government decided that the total capital cost of the Teilifís na Gaeilge project, estimated at £16.1 million will be funded by the Exchequer and the moneys accumulated by RTE in excess of the revenue limit imposed by the Broadcasting Act, 1990, estimated to be £6.4 million including accumulated interest to date; to make provision in the 1995 Estimates for my Department which will enable RTE to expend £10 million on capital works associated with the project; that the balance necessary to complete the construction of the technical infrastructure necessary for the project, estimated to be £6.2 million will be made available from the Exchequer in 1996; to make provision in my Department's Estimates for 1995 of £2.5 million for running costs in the current years together with a contribution of £10 million towards running costs in 1996; and in 1997 and the years thereafter to make an annual contribution of <Col N="512" /> £10 million from the Exchequer towards the running costs of the station.</P>
    <P>Is é atá i gcinneadh seo an Rialtais ná mór-gheallúint poiblí do sholáthar Theilifís na Gaeilge le seirbhís dhá uaire an chloig in aghaidh an lae mar thús.  Ní bheidh aon bhac ar an gComhairle, i gcomhairle le hÚdarás RTÉ, moltaí a chur os comhair an Aire a ghinfeadh cistíocht le haghaidh cláracha breise.  Tá mise ag súil leis go mbeidh an stáisiún nua ar an aer roimh deireadh 1996.  Teilifís na Gaeilge will be perhaps the most significant development in supporting the Irish language as a living language in over 20 years.  The new station will provide a national service to Irish speakers and those with an interest in the language.  The decision to fund Teilfís na Gaeilge without recourse to an increase in the television licence fee is evidence that the Government recognises the essential position occupied by the Irish language at the heart of our culture.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to introduce a special tax relief for donations to national collections of important heritage items, including paintings.  The purpose of the provision is to assist our national collecting institutions in acquiring important items of our moveable cultural heritage.  This decision is an important milestone in the development of our major cultural institutions as it represents Government acceptance of the principle that important items of our heritage should be retained in the country and be accessible for the enjoyment of all our citizens whose heritage it is.</P>
    <P>In the cultural sphere one of the most regrettable failures of the Irish State since its birth has been its seeming reluctance to put in place a mechanism to prevent important heritage items being lost to the country.  Our Statute Book provides us with some limited measures that mitigate the disincentives but collectively they represent a minimalist, even token response.</P>
    <P>We think of the many irreplaceable pictures, archives, books, collections of books, archaeological objects with rich and resonant associations with Ireland <Col N="513" /> that have ended up in auction rooms of Sothebys and Christies, sold to the highest bidder, usually to someone based outside of Ireland, because this State did not muster the will not the capacity to act.  Were it not for the generosity of so many selfless donors, who in the past have filled the storehouses with records and examples of the genius of the Irish people in every field of human endeavour, our storehouses would be depleted and bare.  The losers are the Irish people who have been denied access to crucial facets of their social, spiritual and cultural development.</P>
    <P>It is not right that we must forever rely on haphazard circumstance and individual benevolence to protect our moveable heritage.  We need to craft a systematic way of retaining our heritage so that never again can we be accused of not caring.  Much more needs to be accomplished.  A provision for tax relief on donations of heritage items as proposed in the budget represents but one facet of the overall equation, an equation which needs a more comprehensive response.  In the forthcoming Bill relating to the national cultural institutions I will be bringing forward proposals in this regard.  Within this broader context, the provision for donations represents a not insignificant step in the right direction.  My colleague, the Minister for Finance, is to be commended and I thank him for his initiative.He can be assured of my full assistance and support in the run up to the Finance Bill as we engage in the process of devising a structure that will I hope result in a sound foundation for the protection of our moveable heritage, a foundation which I hope will stand the test of time and last for decades.</P>

      <P>The Government would have found it much more difficult to prepare the budget if the national economy had not been handed over to it in such a sound financial state.  I welcome aspects of the budget which are a continuation of some Fianna Fáil policy. Last year, for example, Fianna Fáil increased child benefit by 25 per cent, the Government continued this policy and increased it again this year.</P>
      <P>The widening of the standard rate income tax band was part of Fianna Fáil policy also.  During the last few years Fianna Fáil made many changes to the income tax system.  Last year the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, now leader of Fianna Fáil, introduced a new low rate of PRSI on incomes below £9,000.  I hope the media will take note of these facts so that the public is aware that this Government is not the first Government to make reforms in these areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is relevant that it is not a people's Government that introduced this budget.  This Government was not elected in a general election.  It was not formed as a result of party policy agreement but rather as a result of party political demands.  That is the reason this is an overspending budget which, in the short term, makes it attractive but in the <Col N="515" /> long term means increased repayments for servicing our national debt.</P>
    <P>One cannot live on what one has not earned.  Borrowing does not solve problems as most people would agree.  They know it is much more difficult to repay a debt than receive a loan.  Other people would say it is much more difficult to keep a car on the road than to buy one. In this budget there is provision for overspending and this will help increase our national debt.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance had a deficit of £107.2 million before compiling his budget.  Tax and non-tax revenue was £11,557.8 million as against Central Fund service costs plus non-capital supply services of £11,665 million, leaving a deficit of £107.2 million.  He reduced taxation, and PRSI, and increased social welfare and so on, all of which cost £364.8 million. This left a budget deficit of £472 million. He decided to borrow £310.2 million to pay off 65 per cent of the £472 million deficit.  He then had to find £161.7 million.He got 23 per cent of £161.7 million by increasing taxes on cigarettes, etc., abolishing relief on covenants and increasing DIRT tax and he said the balance of 77 per cent would come from savings estimated by Departments analysts, net affect on spending changes and tax revenue.</P>
      <P>I am concerned about this budget because there is a certain amount of doubt or chance about it.  If the Minister cannot achieve savings as set out in the budget we could end up with a much greater budget deficit than the £310.2 million stated.  This is the position as I see it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following many years of good financial planning by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, the budget deficit was brought down to zero level.  This was not an easy target to achieve.  I said earlier you cannot live on <Col N="516" /> what you have not earned.  However, this Government has decided to do just that.  It has budgeted for a deficit of £310 million in its first budget but the deficit could be greater at the end of the year. Capital spending has been increased to £800 million.  It is clear the national debt will be in excess of £30 billion at the end of 1995.  It is obvious the three party Coalition Government has availed of the good work done by Fianna Fáil during the past six or seven years and has satisfied the wishes of the different political parties in Government by overspending in the budget.</P>
    <P>Economists will advise that capital overspending will help increase inflation and interest rates.  If this is so, the 2.5 per cent social welfare increases will lose their value and pensioners, the long term unemployed and others will suffer. Instead of getting a 2.5 per cent increase they could end up with only 1 per cent or less.  Pensioners and the long term unemployed assumed they would get a minimum annual increase of 3 per cent. As far as these people are concerned they got a decrease in the income they expected.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has worked hard to keep interest rates down, inflation under control and to slow down capital spending. People would be much better off this way and business people could plan. That is Fianna Fáil policy.  The danger is that this three-party Coalition Government will continue over-spending and in the long term will reduce the standard of living for our people rather than improve it.  As our national debt increases, so will our annual repayments.As a result of this budget, we will have to pay £2.14 billion to service our national debt.  That is a huge amount of money to have to pay for past borrowing before one penny is spent on services such as health, education, social welfare and environment.  The last Fine Gael-Labour Coalition doubled our national debt from £12.7 billion to £25 billion in four and a half years.  The taxpayers are still paying back that money and will do so for many years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="517" /> Some Government will have to tackle this problem because we cannot go back to borrowing more money again.  Fianna Fáil had the courage to get the budget deficit down to zero and to take proper control of capital spending because we knew in the long term this was the correct thing to do in the interest of our people.  We reduced Exchequer borrowing from 12 per cent to 2 per cent of GNP.  Will this Government reverse that position and go back to its old policy of over-spending?  I hope the national economy will continue to flourish and that the revenue estimates which are a very important part of this budget will be achieved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the courts in favour of social welfare equality for women and I hope the Government will provide the finance for this purpose in future budgets &mdash; £240 million will be needed, a substantial amount.  The Government was able to provide only £60 million this year, £50 million of which was taken from the successful social insurance fund built up by Fianna Fáil.  I hope the Government will continue these social welfare payments each year for the next few years until they are completely paid.</P>
    <P>Unless some Government seriously tackles the problem of our county roads the country will be faced with a massive repair bill in future years.  I speak for most if not all county managers, county engineers, councillors of all political parties and people who are fed up, as I and Deputies opposite are, with the disgraceful condition of many county roads.  It is unacceptable to expect people with families, pensioners and others to use such roads.  EU funding and motor tax goes towards new motorways, national and regional roads, and I accept there has been much improvement in that area, but county roads are left to local authorities to look after.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the successful negotiations undertaken by the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, with the European Union to set up a new funding scheme <Col N="518" /> for county roads.  Meath County Council will benefit this year from that fund, thereby releasing extra cash to spend on other roads.  I assume the same applies in other counties.  Local authorities find it most difficult to raise the extra money needed to provide all the services expected of them.</P>
    <P>I have been a member of Meath County Council for the past 15 years and am aware that the financial allocation for county roads is usually left until last, when all other services are provided for.  Some Government must come up with a new policy for county roads, which are as important to trade and commerce as other services.  The present position is very serious.  People find it difficult to pay local taxes to the county councils.  As far as they are concerned, they are paying enough tax at national level.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed that an extra £8 million will be provided for county roads this year, but that is completely misleading.  In this budget, including the so-called £8 million extra, the total allocation for non-national roads will be a little more than £100 million.  Is the Minister saying that all this money will be spent on county roads?  The total allocation in 1994 was £107 million, greater than the provision in 1995, and it helped a little.  I hope the media will inform the public that there is a shortfall of money in this budget, that although £8 million was provided, £7 million was taken from the overall figure.  This financial juggling is very misleading.</P>
    <P>Let us look at where the so-called extra £8 million will come from.  A sum of £4 million will come from revenue and the other £4 million will be transferred from community initiatives, as outlined in the principal features of the budget.  This is a hidden cutback of £4 million for community initiative.  I heard the Minister for Social Wefare, Deputy De Rossa, say on radio this morning that an extra £50 million has been provided to train unemployed people and get them back to work, but I hope the £4 million will not be taken out of that fund.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="519" /> The £8 million seems to be earmarked specifically for county roads, but when it is shared among the various local authorities I doubt if it will be half enough to repair fully the damage done to county roads as a result of flooding. It is clear that there will be less money available in 1995 for county roads than in 1994, and this is unacceptable.  I challenge the Taoiseach, a constituency colleague of mine, and the Minister for the Environment to give up the codding and do something constructive to assist local authorities with the serious county road problem.  Something must be done about this national crisis.  Meath County Council is no different from any other local authority in that we struggle year in year out to find extra cash, but it is not available.</P>
    <P>In recent years local authorities have been obliged to provide new services which come under EU regulations.  The funding required is increasing each year. The Government has a responsibility to finance these costs, which take from county roads funding.  The Government should make a strong case to the European Union for special funding for all county roads which are vital to trade and commerce.  There is also a social side to this problem.  If residents were willing to subscribe to assist local authorities to repair county roads, such subscriptions should be deemed tax free. Every pound subscribed locally should be matched by the Government and the local authority.  Responsibility for implementing European Union regulations should lie with the Government rather than the local authorities.</P>
    <P>For the three years 1992-94 Meath County Council spent an average of £2.5 million on county roads each year. Whereas for the three previous years, 1989-91, it spent a total of £3.3 million. The reason for the reduction in spending was that the council had greater commitments and liabilities.</P>
    <P>There are 2,000 miles of roads in County Meath, 1,500 miles of which are county roads.  In 1987 the budget for the maintenance of these roads was <Col N="520" /> £783,000.  It is estimated by economists that the budget for the maintenance of these roads today should be a minimum of £4 million, £1.5 million more than the current budget of £2.5 million.  Heavier traffic and increased rainfall have done untold damage to these roads, yet the budget is £1.5 million less than it should be.  The Government has said it is making more funds available under the budget but I am sorry to say this is not the case.</P>
    <P>I mean no disrespect to the local authorities who have been doing their best to repair county roads with limited resources, but the reality is that the condition of county roads is getting worse and will continue to get worse unless some radical action is taken.  Filling potholes is much more costly than putting down surface dressing, most local authorities are forced to fill potholes as they do not have the funding for surface dressing.  If a national roads plan is not formulated then money will continue to be wasted.</P>
    <P>The first job which must be carried out is reconstruction so that there are proper foundations.  A sum of £15 million is required to reconstruct all the county roads in Meath.  I am sure the level of funding required to upgrade the roads in other counties is the same, if not greater.  There is no point in wasting money by filling in potholes.  Meath county council requires £15 million over the next ten years to do a proper job, thereby saving money in the future. There are 100 Land Commission roads in County Meath.  When the Land Commission laid these roads in the 1940s and 1950s they were regarded as great roads but they are out of date.  Meath County Council is faced with the problem of finding extra funding to reconstruct these roads.</P>
    <P>The Government provides block grants for the maintenance of regional roads but not for county roads.  I found this very difficult to understand even when my party was in Government. Ninety per cent of the funding for county roads comes from local sources while the remaining 10 per cent or less <Col N="521" /> comes from block grants.  In order to get the remaining 10 per cent the local authority must nominate the county roads which require improvement and get the approval of the Department for the spending of that money.  If one were to judge the budget on the basis of the funding made available for county roads one would have grave doubts about it.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about the National Roads Authority set up by the Government last year because matters relating to national roads are no longer the direct responsibility of the Minister. The authority was set up to ensure value for money, and I have no doubt that it is carrying out its task.  I ask the Minister The authority was set up to ensure value for money, and I have no doubt that it is carrying out its task.  I ask the Minister for the Environment to inform the National Roads Authority about the traffic chaos in Navan.  I have already written to the Minister about this problem and I know he will do his best to solve it.  Will he ask the National Roads Authority to tell Meath County Council to appoint immediately a consultant to carry out a survey and draw up plans for the new bridge and spur road?  Meath County Council has commenced work on the new bridge and spur road with funding out of its own pocket in order to speed up the work.  Meath County Council and Navan UDC are conscious of the damage being caused by this problem to trade and commerce in the town.  The traffic chaos causes great inconvenience for business people, families, pensioners and children.  The Garda Síochána has tried to ease the traffic chaos but it has found it very difficult to do so as there is a constant flow of traffic on the bridge.  There is a new town on the north side of the river but all the important services are on the south side.  Some day soon the fire brigade or ambulance service will not be able, due to traffic chaos, to cross the bridge to save the lives of people involved in accidents or fires.  Will the Minister ask the National Roads Authority to inform Meath County Council to appoint a consultant to carry out a survey and draw up plans?  Otherwise funding for the new bridge and spur <Col N="522" /> road cannot be included in the 1996 Estimates.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the serious accidents which have occurred on the Slane bridge in County Meath.  Recently a bus carrying 40 to 50 children overturned on the bridge and it was only the grace of God which prevented a tragedy.  Motorists using the bridge are afraid that the drivers of heavy trucks will not be able to stop as they come down the hill towards the bridge and will sweep them off the road into the river.  I appreciate that there are similar problems in other areas but I am fighting my corner.  The National Roads Authority must give serious consideration to these two problems.A large number of trucks from Northern Ireland use this road on their way to the south-east.  This is another major concern for Meath County Council and I hope the National Roads Authority will give it serious consideration.</P>
    <P>This is a very interesting budget and it is not possible to refer to all the provisions in it.  There have been large handouts in a few areas and ten or 15 Mickey Mouse handouts of £500,000 or £250,000.  I do not have enough time to refer to these.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to subhead A.7 of the Estimates.  The cost of consultancy services has been increased from £9.77 million in 1994 to £13.477 in 1995, an increase of 37 per cent.  It appears that the Civil Service system is being eroded &mdash; the advisers hired by the Government check up on the civil servants, argue the case with them and come up with what they believe is a better conclusion.I accept that Fianna Fáil hired consultants when in office but the Government parties, who criticised the hiring of consultants when in Opposition, are being hypocritical in increasing the cost of this service by 37 per cent.</P>
    <P>I want to give a few examples to illustrate this point.  I hope the media will not just take note of these points but will inform the public about them.</P>

Much of the money used to fund these increases could have been given to voluntary organisations, people looking after children in crisis etc.  However, the Government seems to think that consultancy services are more important.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Government has decided to increase the rate of DIRT from 10 per cent to 15 per cent.

It pursued policies to keep interest rates as low as possible, achieved the highest growth rate in the OECD and looked after our senior citizens and the long term unemployed properly.  I hope when Fianna Fáil takes over from this three party coalition Government after the next general election the national finances will be in as good a shape as when we left office.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to a number of the matters raised by my good friend, the Deputy from County Meath.  He mentioned county roads, a subject which has received a good airing during this debate.  As I am sure he is aware, a substantial extra allocation was provided last year and again this year. The Government is conscious that we will not be able to tackle the problem unless it is done in a co-ordinated and concerted manner.  That is the reason the Minister for Finance, in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment, <Col N="525" /> has asked for a report from all county managers on the condition of county roads.  Otherwise we will attempt to provide £10 million to £20 million per annum without seeing any results.</P>
      <P>The two main priorities of this Government in this budget are simply stated.  First, we must translate the growth in our economy into jobs and a secure future for our people.  Second, we must help in every way we can to build a lasting agreement among the people who live on this island.</P>
      <P>Those two priorities dominate everything we do.  They represent both an exciting opportunity and a daunting challenge.  They have to be approached in the knowledge that no one politician or political party has a monopoly of all wisdom, that every Member of this House has a contribution to make and that many of the best ideas that will help us to secure those priorities will come from within the wider community we seek to represent.</P>
      <P>The 1995 budget was one of the many instruments available to us in setting out to achieve the first priority I mentioned. In the time available to me I want to commend that budget to this House for what it does and to deal with one or two specific areas of the budget of direct concern to me as Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
      <P>First I want to refer to the other priority &mdash; the task of building agreement on this island.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland and I had a very productive meeting which overcame a number of complex issues that had been delaying completion of the Joint Framework Document.  In the next few days, I hope to be in a position where the document can be sent to the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister for their consideration.The aim is to publish it as soon as possible and to invite the people of these islands to consider it.  Especially we want to invite the political parties of Northern Ireland to examine it closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not expect anyone to like everything they find in the Joint Framework Document.  Anyone, on either side of <Col N="526" /> the divide, who expects to find a victory for their point of view in the document is going to be disappointed, but my strongest hope is that anyone who expects to find betrayal of their hopes and aspirations in the document will be relieved.</P>
    <P>This document is no sell-out, neither is it a magic wand that has been waved over the divisions of years, to make them disappear.  It is no more and no less than we have ever said it was &mdash; a framework for discussion and negotiation, representing the best effort of the two Governments to provide impetus and focus for those negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Joint Framework Document, complex as it may seem, is based on a simple premise.  The cease-fires of last year were a start.  As I have said many times, the cease-fires took the violence out of the conflict, but the conflict goes on.  It will not end until mistrust is replaced by co-operation and until people are prepared to work together for commonly agreed objectives.  The ending of the conflict does not require, and cannot spring from, victory or defeat for either set of passionately-held beliefs.</P>
    <P>The last Irish Government knew, just as the present Government knows, that the ending of the conflict cannot come either from the maintenance of any perceived threat over the population of Northern Ireland.  Our purpose and determination is to remove any sense of threat, territorial or otherwise.</P>
    <P>We want to help in achieving a new dispensation, where the future development of Northern Ireland is a matter for the people of Northern Ireland, free of any threat or the perception of a threat, and underpinned only by principles of fairness and equality.  We want to arrive at a point where the issue of sovereignty is no longer an issue that drives people apart.</P>
    <P>The process we are engaged in is not about forcing either side to settle for whatever it can get.  It is about encouraging both sides to settle with each other.  The essential principle that has <Col N="527" /> underpinned our approach &mdash; the approach of the last Irish Government just as much as the present one &mdash; to all these talks is the principle of consent. That means no more or less than it says. There will be no change in the constitutional position of Northern Ireland, and no Irish Government will seek to change it, without the consent of the people of Northern Ireland.  For many years now it has been recognised that we cannot solve the problem without addressing all its dimensions.  Nobody will ever persuade Nationalists to give their allegiance to a state that denies their fundamental aspiration to Irishness and no one can successfully coerce Unionists into a state that denies their fundamental aspiration to Britishness.</P>
    <P>That is why approach to the problem must recognise that there is a complex set of relationships involved.  The North-South relationship is a difficult one for Unionists to address, but relationships within Northern Ireland present fundamental difficulties for Nationalists.  Everyone has to face those difficulties in their own way.</P>
    <P>The Joint Framework Document seeks to challange, not to appease.  It is not based on the comfortable assumption that no one needs to compromise. That assumption is a receipe for disaster.The truth is that everyone needs to compromise &mdash; the Governments, the parties, the traditions.</P>
    <P>That is why our only appeal, in relation to the Joint Framework Document, is to ask people to read it: &ldquo;Don't look for victory &mdash; you won't find it. Don't look for betrayal &mdash; you won't find that either.  Look for a new way forward, through agreement and better relationships &mdash; that's what is on offer.&rdquo; That is all that is on offer &mdash; no secret deals, no hidden agendas.  All the cards are going to be put on the table and they are all going to be dealt face up.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the budget, it is widely accepted that our economy is in a very strong position.  That strength would not have been possible without sacrifice on the part of thousands of <Col N="528" /> families.  Now that the economy is growing strongly, those families are entitled to share in that growth.</P>
    <P>That is what we have tried to do in this budget.  We are giving people a dividend, a share of the growth they have helped to generate.  The decision to approach the budget in that way reflected the concerns and policies of each of the parties in Government. Every Minister, from whatever party, played a full role in putting forward ideas and arguing for them, and the process of putting the budget together involved frank and serious discussion, conducted in the most constructive atmosphere in which I have ever participated.</P>
    <P>The budget will help every family in Ireland.  The increases in child benefit, widely recognised as the most essential weapon in the struggle against family poverty, are the biggest ever.  The tax reliefs are more than three times the rate of inflation, and will be felt in every single pay-packet in April.  I am particularly proud of the fact that the balance of resources devoted to this area has clearly favoured the hundreds of thousands of Irish workers who are in low-paid jobs.</P>
    <P>The jobs impact of the budget will be very substantial and positive, especially for the long term unemployed.  We are putting special measures in place &mdash; measures they have campaigned for themselves &mdash; to help them make the breakthrough.  We are trying to gear all the approaches we make to business and enterprise towards encouraging more and more investment in jobs.</P>
    <P>I am delighted with the progress we have made in one area in particular. 1995 will be remembered as the year we began to make education free at every level.  The abolition of third level fees is a huge psychological breakthrough for thousands of young people.  It is a very important start on the investment in education that is a crucial part of our future.</P>
    <P>In overall terms, this is a budget with a human face, a budget for people.  We have put it together while at the same <Col N="529" /> time maintaining a strong and careful approach to the management of peoples' money.  We have achieved a budget that will encourage even more growth in the economy, and a better future for everyone.  My prediction is that those critics and commentators who have ignored the potential for stronger growth in our economy, and the contribution that the budget will make towards that, will be forced to eat their words by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I want to refer to two issues arising from the budget, of direct concern to my ministry &mdash; the forthcoming Presidency of the European Union and the further moves we have been able to make to improve Ireland's contribution to the developing world.</P>
    <P>The main obligation on any Presidency is to ensure an efficient and effective approach to the discharge of the Union's business.  Ireland has a good record in this respect in the conduct of past Presidencies, achieved through timely planning, preparation and the adequate allocation of resources.</P>
    <P>However, there are a number of new challenges facing our Presidency in 1996 and which will have to be taken into account in the planning process.  In addition, our Presidency will take place against the background of a view among some members of the Union that the smaller member states are no longer capable of adequately carrying out the responsibilities of the Presidency.  Our performance as Presidency of the Union will be judged, therefore, not by our performances in 1975, 1979, 1984, and 1990 but against the standard set by Germany, France, Spain and Italy, countries that immediately precede us in the Presidency.</P>
    <P>The major development since the Presidency in 1990 has been the adoption of the Maastricht Treaty.  The main features of the Treaty which will have an impact on the work of our Presidency in 1996 are as follows: the move towards economic and monetary union; the strengthening of procedures for systematic co-operation in common foreign <Col N="530" /> and security policy; matters coming under the justice and home affairs or third pillar of the Treaty on European Union including immigration, asylum aspects of judical co-operation in civil and criminal matters, the fight against drugs, fraud, customs co-operation and police matters; new policy areas of the Union and those expanded by the Treaty on European Union including education, public health, culture, consumer protection, industry, development co-operation and trans-European networks and the expanded role of the European Parliament, particularly the co-decision procedure which allows the Parliament to reject legislation in certain areas.</P>
    <P>While it is too early to predict the issues that will dominate our Presidency in 1996 the issues facing the European Union, and likely to provide at least part of the framework for our Presidency, can be identified broadly.  These include the Intergovernmental Conference due to start in 1996 and likely to be in place for the duration of our Presidency; the issue of growth, competitiveness and employment and action for economic recovery; the decision on the move to the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union which must be taken not later than 31 December 1996; implementation of the Common Foreign and Security Policy; immigration, extradition, organised crime and drug smuggling seem likely to remain dominant issues on the justice and home affairs agenda and the further development of relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe with a view to accession.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the budget and the Estimates for 1995 should contain a number of measures aimed at assisting the peoples of the developing world. People in all walks of life in Ireland have gone to great lengths to support those living in poverty and deprivation in the Third World.</P>
    <P>Crises such as that which struck Rwanda last summer bring out the best in the Irish people.  Their generosity is second to none.  Not only did they contribute in cash and kind to help the <Col N="531" /> Rwandan people, many of them went out to that country and to the refugee camps in Tanzania and Zaire to give direct assistance, often at considerable personal sacrifice.</P>
    <P>These concrete examples of commitment and solidarity with the disadvantaged both at home and in the developing world highlight the fact that, within the limits of our means, we in Ireland recognise that our collective responsibility for the alleviation of poverty and disadvantage in our own society does not eliminate our responsibility to assist those in greater relative need in other countries.  I strongly believe we are generous enough in our approach to accept that action for social justice and human rights at home is complementary to action on these very same issues internationally.</P>
    <P>The budget contains two provisions designed to recognise and support the public's efforts to assist the Third World.  First, the Government has decided to give a tax rebate on private donations of between £200 and £750 to designated Third World charities.  The effect of this will be to make a donation of £750 worth over £1,000 to the charity concerned.  I believe this measure will be a strong incentive to people wishing to contribute to the Irish NGOs which are making such an effective contribution to the developing world.</P>
    <P>Second, my colleague, the Minister for Finance, has announced that he intends to introduce measures to protect the pension rights of public servants doing voluntary work in developing countries for the Agency for Personal Service Overseas.  I very much welcome this initiative.  Those who carry out voluntary work in the Third World should not be at a disadvantage because of their humanitarian actions.  I hope the private sector will be encouraged to introduce similar measures for their employees in the light of the Government's initiative on volunteers from the public sector.</P>
    <P>The Irish people have clearly demonstrated their wish to help those in need <Col N="532" /> and it is right that the Government should match this private generosity by allocating an appropriate level of public funding to official development assistance.This year's allocation for ODA is 26 per cent higher than last year's.  It means that for the third year in a row funding for ODA has substantially increased.  The total to be spent on ODA in 1995 will be £89 million; this is more than twice what was spent in 1992.</P>
    <P>In allocating this record level of expenditure, the Government is delivering on the promise to raise Ireland's Official Development Assistance to the kind of level which our European partners allocate.  We are also committed to making steady progress towards the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP.  This year's increase puts us well on the way towards that target.</P>
    <P>Emergencies in countries such as Rwanda, Angola and Sierra Leone are what we most frequently see on our television screens, and they cost a great deal of money to put right.  Despite the end of the Cold War there has been no let-up in the number of conflicts throughout the world.  One estimate is that there were 160 significant cases of conflict worldwide in the two years 1993-94.  The international community's response has been to increase the amount of money spent on emergency assistance but, with limited resources available, this has meant a serious drop in the amount of funding being made available for long term development.</P>
    <P>I am glad to report that Ireland is bucking this trend in that our spending on development aid, both emergency and long term, is steadily rising.  The purpose of long term development is to create a culture of self-help among countries and communities so that they can take charge of their own affairs. Ireland's approach is to concentrate on meeting basic needs in fields such as health, education, water and infrastructure and we work in close partnership with the peoples of those countries which we assist.  The expanded funding which is being made available in this <Col N="533" /> year's Estimates mean that we can strengthen and diversify our programmes of assistance to enable countries which are suffering poverty, malnutrition and lack of basic facilities to improve the standard of living of their citizens.</P>
    <P>Last year we added Ethiopia and Uganda to the list of countries enjoying priority status for Irish aid.  This year we are increasing the level of our co-operation with Mozambique and are stepping up our programme of assistance to South Africa where we will be concentrating on education, water resources and community initiatives.</P>
    <P>Increased ODA will also mean that we can support initiatives designed to strengthen the democratic process and observance of human rights in the developing world and particularly in those emerging democracies where these concepts are still fragile.  We will, of course, continue our strong commitment to the co-funding of projects with non-governmental organisations such as Concern, Goal and Trócaire; to development education and fellowships for students from overseas and to contributing to the operations of the major multilateral aid agencies such as UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the UN High Commission for Refugees.</P>
    <P>Nobody could underestimate the challenges which face us in our relations with the developing world.  However, the extent of the needs which persist should not and cannot weaken our resolve to play our part in resolving crises and conflicts and promoting sustainable development.  Our policy and approach must be developed on the basis of clearly enunciated principles &mdash; in this regard the public discussions on the White Paper on Foreign Policy is timely and welcome.</P>
    <P>We must continue to provide increased levels of aid to countries in the south and to promote support for human rights, but I also believe that we are obliged to make every effort to <Col N="534" /> ensure that the aid we give is used effectively to alleviate basic needs, to support human rights and to promote the ability of people in the developing countries to help themselves.</P>
    <P>This year's budget was the first of three that my colleague Deputy Ruairí Quinn will introduce on behalf of this Government.  Our programme, as a Government, is aimed at renewal, and the budgetary strategy we intend to follow will be a strategy of renewal.  That is why the emphasis in this budget was on jobs and families, and why the same emphasis will inform the 1996 and 1997 budgets.  We intend to carry on the process of making it easier to employ people, of opening up options to people who are in long term unemployment, of ensuring that resources are effectively targeted where they can do the most good.</P>
    <P>We intend to ensure that growth remains high.  We also intend to ensure that growth is channelled effectively into the areas where it is most needed &mdash; into families and into work.  Our people have worked for growth &mdash; now we have to make growth work for them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>When I addressed the House on Thursday last at Question Time I expressed my sympathy to Deputy Phil Hogan on the misfortune which had befallen him.  He, like others before him, had been sacrificed on the altar of moral rectitude.  Irish politics is now at an important crossroads.  For a number of years the real issues which concerned the decision makers and those who rely on them to deal effectively with the management of this country have been subsumed in the relentless sequence of personal witch-hunts by certain elements in politics. Politics is much the worse for the introduction and perpetuation of this personality-led culture, and I am concerned that the political system is now gravely wounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The stench of moral rectitude lies like a poisoned cloud over these buildings.  I wonder if any of those people in this House have paused to consider that, in <Col N="535" /> pursuit of openness, transparency and accountability, what may be lost is the traditional values of decency, understanding and forgiveness.  These traditional values have long served the Irish people well and, in the light of what I, as a long serving Member of this House have seen over recent years, I wonder if we now have finally succumbed to what in the United States is commonly referred to as the Watergate syndrome. It seems that every political cause needs a personal sacrifice.  Around every corner must exist a conspiracy and, as the upshot of all this, is a lust for public human sacrifice.  We have witnessed a succession of heads on the pikes of political expediency.</P>
    <P>To be a politician in Ireland today, one must have no past, because if one has then one will certainly have no future; one must be a Dan Quayle type person &mdash; someone who has done no wrong and no right.  Do wrong and one will be hanged, drawn and quartered, like the unfortunate Deputy Hogan; do right and one is labelled a firebrand, a troublemaker or a renegade.  Either way, there appears to be no place for you in his House and I hope that the architects of the high moral ground are satisfied with the creature they have created.  What is not needed in Irish politics is blandness or conformity; what is needed is imagination, energy and courage.  The Irish people do not need political eunuchs; they want and need leaders.</P>
    <P>As I approach the twilight of my career in politics, I hope I have learned a little about what is right and what is wrong in politics.  One thing of which I have no doubt is that there are Members of this House who should be ashamed at the way they have calmly and coldly looked the other way as the political funeral of Deputy Phil Hogan passed by.  Only they know the extent of their own guilt.  I doubt if they are particularly disposed to accept any advice from me, but I will say &mdash; and they may listen if they wish and ignore me at their peril &mdash; they should guard <Col N="536" /> their own secrets with great care, because the people out there are waiting.The people like nothing better than to see the righteous found to be sinners and in these days, where loyalty means less than nothing in some quarters, if there is dirt there, it will come to light sooner or later and then there will be red faces for all to see.  My party has had its share of troubles and we have learned a hard lesson in a hard school.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with open government.  I see great merit in an informed electorate.  That is not to say I accept that openness gives a licence to any politician who is in a position of trust and sensitivity to use &mdash; or, more correctly, abuse &mdash; that position for purely political ends.  The responsible exercise of political office requires observance of the rule of law and a respect for the wishes of the electorate. In a coalition, as we in Fianna Fáil appreciate in the most practical sense, there is an added requirement of respect for the stance of other coalition partners.I can speak of this with some authority.The most recent example of political one-upmanship is the presentation of the contents of last week's budget to the media by one, or other, or all, of the parties which make up the so called rainbow coalition.  From where I stand, the accusations of dishonesty and duplicitousness so recently levelled at Fianna Fáil by some Members now sitting across the House in Government have a strangely unreal memory.  Perhaps it is now our turn to alert the Irish people to low standards in high places and when the truth comes to light and is subjected to public scrutiny, nobody on this side of the House will be either sad or upset.</P>
    <P>I, for one, take some comfort in the old story of the dragon who required regular human sacrifice as a price for his tolerance.  This mythological protection racket lasted only so long as the population would permit it.  Eventually, like all bullies, the dragon met its match; in this case the people, having gorged themselves on political entrails, will seek and find other prey and the higher <Col N="537" /> the pedestal, the longer and harder the fall.  Ordinary people enjoy witnessing the fall.  So I say to the harbingers of rectitude to beware.  When the fall comes, and come it will sooner rather than later, the fall will be both swift and tumultuous.  There will be few to shed tears at their political funerals.</P>
    <P>There is a parable in the Gospel, where the poor, wretched prostitute was to be stoned by the mob for her sins. The mob, hostile and righteous, gathered around her, spat on her and collected their stones.  Jesus intervened to ask anyone in the mob who was without sin to cast the first stone.  In the Gospel, the mob dispersed shamefaced.  It appears that in this House, among some, no such human feelings apply.</P>
    <P>Almost every detail of last week's budget was known to the media long before Deputy Hogan's fateful faxes issued.  Who was responsible for that? Who among those who normally occupy the empty Government benches across the floor ordered that these details be given to the media?  Which of you briefed a favourite journalist?  At least on this occasion, Fianna Fáil can take some comfort in the knowledge that none of us can be accused of breaching Cabinet confidentiality, of putting one over on our coalition partner, or of breaching the letter and the spirit of the Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the three parties in Government are as happy this week with their decision to form the rainbow? I wonder if any Member of this House on the Government side believes that justice has been done over this sorry affair?  Is any Member of this House on either side happy that justice has been seen to be done?</P>
    <P>We are at a sorry pass.  Is it any wonder that young people cannot be bothered to vote, when all they see is a catalogue of cant and hypocrisy, masquerading as the voice of the people?  Irish people expect certain standards of their politicians, but they do not expect us to be perfect.  Ordinary people have ordinary personalities and are as frail and as fallible as ordinary <Col N="538" /> people are expected to be including me. In Irish politics, however, to be human is to be suspect, and to display human characteristics is risky in the extreme. Why else would we see the likes of Deputy Phil Hogan, a decent hardworking Deputy, offered up as a blood sacrifice?</P>
    <P>I can hardly ignore the irony of the manner of Deputy Hogan's demise, given the manner in which he pursued my colleague, Deputy Cowen, over his shareholding in Arcon.  I take no pleasure in highlighting the irony of what has happened, rather do I recall these events as an example of the wheel of life completing yet another inevitable turn.  <i>Sic transit gloria mundi.</i></P>
    <P>The demise of Deputy Hogan as a Minister has had the added effect of deflecting public scrutiny from the budget which caused it.  Enough has been said since last Wednesday about this sad, threadbare, patchwork quilt of a budget and I intend to confine my contribution to what this budget did not contain and the extent to which this rainbow coalition has betrayed the members of the three parties involved.</P>
    <P>I cannot let this opportunity pass without commenting that, in the past, Fine Gael's sorties into Government, have inevitably resulted in a serious downturn in the nation's economy.  The facts speak for themselves, and anyone with an interest in the truth will only have to look at the figures for confirmation.</P>
    <P>On this occasion, yet again, Fine Gael, numerically, at least, the principal party of Government, are presiding over a budget which fails to grasp the basic thrust of the economic and social policy of the past eight years or so.  Over that period, slowly and painfully, the national finances were rescued.  Now, when the rainbow parties are barely used to sitting around the Cabinet table when sound economic management demands prudent husbandry, what are they doing?  They are scattering the seed corn to the four winds, and for what?</P>
    <P>What is the use of asking the people to brace themselves for stormy weather, <Col N="539" /> as successive Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance have done since 1987, if the new crew are dead set on running before the storm instead of facing it down?  We in Fianna Fáil asked the Irish people to be patient.  We doled out nasty medicine, but we promised that the medicine would work and that the cure would inevitably follow.  In that task, I acknowledge the part played variously by our partners in Government.I now share the amazement of Members on this side of the House that the rainbow coalition has immediately set about dismantling the carefully and painfully crafted economic foundation which they inherited.  I am particularly amazed at the part played in this by the Labour Party, having worked with them for the past two years.  They were good colleagues and excellent Ministers.</P>
    <P>What do they think they are doing? Does the Labour Party and the Democratic Left believe that their traditional constituents will thank them for the 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare payments?Does Fine Gael believe that taxpayers will say &ldquo;well done&rdquo;, when the truth of what the budget really means is explained to them.  Will our partners in the European Union stand idly by and watch our economy stop and backtrack towards the days of high inflation, punitive interest rates and soaring unemployment which will be the legacy of this budget and this Government?</P>
    <P>By failing to recognise, or worse, to understand, that now is not the time to return to deficit budgeting, the Government has recreated the formula for emigration.In a time when we should look forward to keeping more and more of our children at home working in jobs which properly reflect on their education and ability, I fear that we are once again on the road to Ellis Island.</P>
    <P>I am not an economist and I do not understand the difference between marginal propensities to consume and to earn, yet I have raised a family and watched my children grow over the past 25 years.  I dread to think that our children will face a future more bleak than <Col N="540" /> previously.  All the free third level education in the world will not compensate for an overheated economy and a reducing workforce.</P>
    <P>Inflation simply means that our goods are more expensive to export and our country a more expensive place to visit; increasing interest rates means more expensive mortgages, fewer houses being built and higher unemployment. These simple facts convince me that now is not the time to spend more than we earn.</P>
    <P>The rainbow coalition had the opportunity to take up where the previous Government left off, but they could not resist the temptation to try to be popular and at the ultimate expense of the people whose affections they are trying to win.  The quick fix for the short term gain simply shows an addiction to popularity &mdash; a very dangerous addiction in public life.</P>
    <P>In those areas of Government within my brief, tourism has shown a relentless growth in employment figures for the past decade; 90,000 new jobs are directly attributable to tourism and I wish to pay a sincere tribute to CERT, the training body for the hotel and catering industry for the part which they are playing. Their success in placing trainees in sustainable jobs deserves more recognition and I wonder how much they could achieve with more resources.  The Government has missed the opportunity to further develop this aspect of tourism in the budget and I will pursue the need for additional support for CERT.</P>
    <P>This country no longer lives off the cow's back.  Most western counties now earn more from tourism than from agriculture and I was interested to hear the respected Teagasc Director, Dr. Liam Downey, recently admit that tourism is replacing agriculture in the life of the rural economy.  Tourism, like the elephant, is easy to recognise, but difficult to define; it is at once a product, a service, a trade, and dare one say it, an industry; in addition it is a craft and one, which I may say, to which the Irish people are well suited.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="541" /> In all fairness to the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Enda Kenny, I wish to commend him on what is without doubt the single spark of imagination in this budget, I refer, of course, to the pilot scheme for urban renewal in certain seaside resort towns. For too long, the charming resorts around our coastline have been mired in official neglect and apathy.  I express the hope that this pilot scheme will preserve the historic core of our seaside towns and I look forward to the extension of this worthwhile scheme to other towns. The south-east and western seaboards should not monopolise this scheme and there are many towns around our coast and, indeed, throughout the country, which would benefit greatly from the recognition of their worth as an intrinsic part of the nation's heritage.</P>
    <P>As to the manner in which the scheme is to be administered, I seek the Minister's assurance that the measures envisaged will not be confined to major tourist developments.  The small B &amp; Bs play a vital part in the renewal of local economies and the harmonious restoration and conversion of traditional buildings is essential to preserve and, where necessary, recreate, the beauty and character of towns around the country.</P>
    <P>This scheme is innovative in the area of tourism, in that it is aimed at improving tourism as a product.  Before this, most effort went into marketing Ireland to foreigners, and to the Irish people as a place to go on holiday.  Too often, unfortunately, the rosy picture painted in advertising campaigns was not matched by the product.  Visitors will not come back if they are not happy with what they find and I hope that this shift of emphasis is followed by further efforts to ensure that people who holiday in Ireland not only come back again and again, but that they tell their friends about us and they, in turn tell their friends.</P>
    <P>A personal concern is that the streets of all the towns in our country should be safe for all.  The Minister will need to <Col N="542" /> maintain a close liaison with the Minister for Justice, to ensure that all the necessary steps are taken towards achieving this end.  A visible presence of police on the streets is often enough to discourage the type of random violence against tourists to which we have become accustomed.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the Garda Síochána are exceptional; the force is well trained and well motivated.  In Dublin, everybody is aware that some areas are just not safe at any time.  Other cities and towns are plagued by similar problems and it is now time that the gardaí were put back on the street.  It is also time that, in line with scaling down the security operations in Northern Ireland as a consequence of the cessation of paramilitary violence, those members of the Garda who are engaged in security duties in Border areas should be quickly reassimilated into the ordinary duties of gardaí and used, where necessary, to bolster the drive against crime in our towns and cities.</P>
    <P>In the area of trade, I believe that our semi-State organisations provide a valuable and worthwhile return on the public moneys allocated to them; they often operate in hostile trading and political environments and I commend them for the service they give to the people. Ireland will continue to depend more and more on acquiring new markets for our exports and, as the need arises, developing new products to meet demand from abroad.  We have an official presence in many developing countries and the expansion of our international relationships generally will afford us excellent opportunities to broaden our trading horizon in the future.  I am glad to see the growth of the &ldquo;Ireland House&rdquo; concept which means that all the areas of trade, tourism and diplomacy right across the board of Irish endeavours are incorporated under one roof.  I understand that an &ldquo;Ireland House&rdquo; will open in Japan, if it has not already been opened and <Col N="543" /> I would like to see this throughout the world, north, south, east and west.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware of the need to get out and sell Ireland and our goods and services.  He has the necessary expertise at his disposal and I believe he has the will, and while the resources allocated to this area are modest, much will be expected of him during the life of this Government.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing that this source, or sources, of all the various leaks of the details of this budget, having been identified and that the persons who are guilty of breaching the letter and spirit of Cabinet confidentiality will display the same degree of honour as Deputy Phil Hogan.  This is an issue which the House should be concerned to resolve and, in the stated standards of openness, transparency and accountability &mdash; how these words will come to haunt this House &mdash; the rainbow parties must be called to account.  It is not acceptable that the standards set for Fianna Fáil in Government should not apply equally to the rainbow parties. The high moral platform on which they stand is of their own making and I, with all honest observers, want to see whether the Government can be trusted to tell the truth.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Kenny.  We have heard a very fine sermon on public and political morality and the economic revisionist theory which I am sure would not stand up to scrutiny. I would remind Deputy Andrews that the increase in public spending last year was 9 per cent whereas it will be 6 per cent this year.  This budget will reverse the trend in public spending since 1991 and that is welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1977 the Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government handed over a booming economy with a 12 per cent growthrate to Fianna Fáil.  It proceeded to <Col N="544" /> destroy the country and it took ten years to recover from that.  Deputy Andrews should remember when chastising Fine Gael and pointing the finger at that party that Fianna Fáil's record may not stand up to close scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I will confine my remarks to the effect of the budget on the rural and agricultural community.  As the Minister for Finance announced this budget is designed to reward work, promote enterprise and strengthen social solidarity.To achieve these objectives, he introduced a number of significant changes in the tax and PRSI codes which will have the dual benefit of increasing take home pay and reducing for employers the cost of creating jobs. In addition, the measures announced by the Minister for the longer term unemployed, which are in line with the recommendation from the national economic and social forum, will help them.</P>
    <P>I am most concerned about unemployment in rural areas where the problems of low income and lack of job opportunities are often severe.  Indeed, many counties are suffering from declining population as younger people leave to find work elsewhere.</P>
    <P>This budget offers a comprehensive package of measures which will contribute to reducing unemployment and improving standards of living: employers PRSI is being reduced; personal allowances have been increased and the 27 per cent tax band significantly widened; £6 million is being provided for the employment service for the long term unemployed and £11 million has been added to the estimate provision of £232.5 million for the community employment programme.</P>
    <P>Some 38,500 people are expected to participate in the community employment programme.  In addition, the Structural Funds in the agriculture, food and rural development areas are: the operational programme for agriculture, rural development and forestry; the food sub-programme of the industry <Col N="545" /> programme; INTERREG and Leader II.</P>
    <P>These will all contribute to significantly improving employment prospects and to creating opportunities for enterprise and development in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The farming organisations lobbied the Government on stock relief before the budget.  As anyone familiar with accounting and tax knows, money spent buying stock is not classified as an expense for tax purposes.  This follows standard accounting practice where the value of stock is treated as an asset and money spent on stock is not treated as an expense for tax purposes.  Unfortunately, it also means that money must be found for building up stock from net income after tax has been deducted.</P>
    <P>This can cause severe cash flow problems for farmers.  Most people accept that farm stock is expensive, grows slowly in value and the time lag between purchase and sale or purchase and production can be well over a year, a very long time relative to many other types of business.  The problems this leads to are especially severe for those who have to build up stock, usually people starting out in a career in farming or those faced with the task of restocking after losing their herds.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to helping young people take up farming as a career and to seeing that they are well trained for the job.  In keeping with our commitment in <i>A Government for Renewal</i> full stock relief has been introduced for young trained farmers.  This will be of significant benefit to those starting a career in farming.  For the first four years, a young trained farmer can effectively treat the cost of buying stock as a normal business expense.  That will greatly improve cash flow allowing farmers to build up stock and to bring their farms up to maximum production as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Farmers forced to destock for disease eradication purposes will be relieved to see the introduction of stock relief on the profits which can arise from the compensation paid.  It should be noted <Col N="546" /> that these profits are not real as the money must be invested in new stock. The introduction of full stock relief on these paper profits gives farmers the chance to reinvest the full amount of the compensation without having to pay tax on it first.</P>
    <P>Many farmers will be pleased to see that the Minister for Finance did not take this opportunity to let stock relief lapse.  The current regime of stock relief at 25 per cent with no clawback for any subsequent reduction in stock value was introduced two years ago for a period of two years.  It was announced in the budget that these provisions will be continued for at least another two years. This will be of major benefit to farmers enabling them to get some tax relief for stock purchases.  At the same time the absence of any clawback gives them the flexibility to dispose of the stock without having to take the tax implications into account.  I welcome the further progress made in reducing the burden of capital acquisitions tax on farmers.  Business relief applying to livestock and machinery, has increased from 25 per cent to 50 per cent and agricultural relief on land and buildings over the £300,000 threshold has increased from 30 per cent to 50 per cent.  This will make a considerable difference to most farmers.</P>
    <P>It is important that people realise that agricultural relief for capital acquisitions tax is necessary to ensure a farm can be transferred without incurring a tax bill which could render it non-viable. Agricultural relief is given in recognition of the fact that the earning potential of land is much lower than its capital value would suggest.  Without agricultural relief, a gift or inheritance of even a relatively modest farm could result in an unmanageable tax burden.</P>
    <P>I am sure this concession is welcomed by all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Efforts were made this morning to raise the de Buitléir report.  Many farmers will be pleased with the budgetary provisions regarding third level fees. <Col N="547" /> Some farmers have expressed their concern to me about the report to the Minister for Education on the eligibility criteria for higher education grants.  The announcement in the budget that higher education fees for publicly funded colleges are to be abolished is most welcome.Of course, if fees are being abolished then the principal reason for giving tax relief on covenants also disappears.I expect most people who used covenants as a way to save the money needed to put their children through higher education will find themselves much better off with no fees.  I welcome the initiative taken by the Minister for Education.  Henceforth, it will mean that several middle income groups, who could no longer afford to send a second or third child to college, will be in a position to do so, which is most welcome.</P>
    <P>In regard to county roads in rural areas, the dispersed nature of our population and its low density, mean that rural roads are very important to us. Unfortunately, I am only too well aware that many are in an appalling condition, as a result of several years of underfunding and neglect, especially within the period 1987 to 1992 or 1993 when very litle money was expended on them. Most of these roads must now carry heavy lorries transporting farm supplies and produce necessary to our agricultural and food sectors.  In addition, in areas of heavy afforestation, these roads must carry very heavy loads of timber, leading to their further deterioration. These lorries and their loads are much heavier than the roads were ever designed to take and the appalling weather of last spring and this winter has rendered a bad problem even worse.</P>
    <P>The addition of £8 million will bring the Exchequer allocation for county roads to more than £100 million in 1995. I hope local authorities will use this money to effect a significant, lasting improvement to roads in rural areas.  It is my hope that this will be the mere beginning of a programme on the part of this, and future, Governments to <Col N="548" /> address the matter of county roads and their attendant problems, because it is time we tackled it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not constitute an increase, the allocation is a reduction on last year's.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy considers the facts, he will see that it represents a major increase.  In addition, I understand there will be other grants, allocated by other means, to county roads for their maintenance and upkeep.</P>
      <P>One of the most significant aspects of this budget is its provision for traditional seaside resorts which are in terminal decline.  I am delighted the Government saw fit to introduce a scheme, similar to the very successful urban renewal one, to address the problem of the decline of our traditional seaside resorts.  Certainly it formed part of my policy when Opposition spokesperson on tourism from 1992 to the end of 1994 &mdash; it was also very much Fine Gael policy &mdash; and I am very glad that the new coalition partners decided to introduce this scheme which will reverse that decline.</P>
      <P>The urban renewal scheme has been a tremendous success in many rundown urban areas which have been transformed.They benefited enormously from the various tax incentives and reliefs. However, many other areas suffer similar problems, especially old seaside resorts.  The application of tax incentives similar to those available for urban renewal will act as a strong incentive to people to invest in these areas, the hope being that this investment will break the vicious cycle of fewer visitors, causing less investment and a deterioration in property.  These incentives should lead to an improved climate for investment and improved and updated tourist amenities and facilities.  It would be my hope that the communities in those seaside resorts, most without a local council, will engage in this initiative, encourage investment, thus restoring them to their former place in Irish tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="549" /> I should like to deal with the farmers' charter of rights.  Like all other citizens, farmers have a right to top quality service from Government Departments. The advent of the CAP reform resulted in an increase in the number and complexity of schemes administered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  Various constraints, many imposed by the European Union but including inadequate resources and structures, have militated against the efficient and effective delivery of payments to farmers.  The delivery of a top quality service from the Department is one of the priorities of this Government, to which end a charter of rights for farmers will be announced by Easter.The commitment of the Government to the implementation of that charter is evidenced by the provision of an allocation of £5 million in this year's budget.  I am sure Deputy Leonard would agree that farmers deserve a better service and, hopefully, that service will be delivered to them by this Government through that charter of rights.  I look forward to it being put in place soon and to its effective operation.</P>
    <P>The farmers' charter will address a number of specific issues, including upgrading accessibility to information on farmers' entitlements, particularly at local level.  I am concerned, that farmers be informed as soon as possible of any problems in regard to their applications. In addition, the charter will provide for more flexible departmental office opening hours.  The existing opening hours, from 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 p.m., fail to cater for farmers' needs, especially those who must travel long distances.  In Kerry farmers from areas like Waterville and Caherciveen must travel to Tralee before the 12.30 p.m. closure.  That is very difficult for those who must work from the early hours of the morning. Therefore, the matter of opening hours must be addressed and resolved.</P>
    <P>The matters of departmental office accommodation and farmers' right to privacy and confidentiality are most important and will be addressed also in the proposed charter of rights.  Farmers <Col N="550" /> will not have to conduct their business in public and that is another welcome departure.  Some departmental offices have inadequate accommodation and facilities for staff, clearly inhibiting their ability to provide farmers with an efficient and confidential service.  It is proposed to upgrade all offices to cater for staff needs, thus enabling them accord the normal courtesies to individuals calling to their offices.  Ideally, departmental local offices should be centres where farmers can obtain information on their entitlements, assistance when completing application forms and information on their compensatory and premia payments, ultimately, rendering them &ldquo;one stop shops&rdquo; for farmers.  The charter will also overhaul the payments system to diminish anonymity, thus giving a more personalised, user-friendly service.</P>
    <P>The new Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, is committed to seeking changes in European Union rules to facilitate the earliest possible payment of compensatory and premia payments, there being many stages to the overall achievement of this goal.  For example, there is need for the Department to improve and enhance existing information technology in addition to improving the layout or design of application forms, rendering them more user-friendly, while complying with European Union requirements.Progress has been made in the Department on a simplified application form with easily understood language, so that there will be no confusion about its terminology.</P>
    <P>Of immense importance to farmers also is the establishment of a formal right of appeal, to include provision for oral hearings and an opportunity to have a claimant's chosen representatives present, much the same as applies in the case of social welfare.</P>
    <P>The ultimate aim of the charter is to enhance the service for farmers by the Department, to give an effective and efficient, streamlined service to all requiring it, which should be personal, user-friendly and transparent.  Needless <Col N="551" /> to say, this type of service should be available also to farmers in the agri-food and forestry sectors.  It will take time to achieve this goal but I know that the will and enthusiasm of departmental staff can be relied on fully in this task.</P>
    <P>If nothing else, this budget will ensure that, at last, farmers will receive their entitlements on time, that when they go to their local offices they will be received with the utmost courtesy &mdash; as has always been the case &mdash; with additional facilities improving existing arrangements.  This should remove the tension that has developed over delayed payments and the treatment of farmers whether on the telephone or when they meet departmental staff.  This charter of rights should be welcomed by all parties in this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKenny" hpid="Mr. S. Kenny Mr. S. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the budget debate.  As a Labour Deputy, I believe the 1995 budget is an historic one.  It is the first budget in the history of the State to be presented by a Labour Minister, my colleague, Deputy Quinn.  Nineteen-ninety-four was a good year for Ireland.  The economy's performance was one of the best in the European Union.  Employment increased by 36,000, average unemployment fell by 12,000, investment in our economy grew by over 7 per cent, consumer spending increased by 5 per cent and exports increased by an estimated 10.5 per cent. All this was achieved while maintaining an average inflation rate of 2.4 per cent. The outlook for 1995 is also favourable. Employment is projected to increase by 31,000 jobs and the number unemployed set to fall by a further 16,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn articulated the four fundamental beliefs of the Labour Party, the principles of freedom, equality, community and democracy.  Those fundamental rights can only be enjoyed by all our citizens if they are underpinned by a fair and just system of economic reward. This budget will boost job creation and redistribute wealth in our society.  The <Col N="552" /> budget reflects a strong determination to provide a strategy which will improve the living standards of those in low paid employment and at the same time keep social welfare payments in line with inflation.</P>
    <P>The combination of PRSI and income tax changes is to be welcomed for tackling the tax wedge which has been a barrier to employment growth.  The disregarding of the first £50 per week for full PRSI contributors together with the change in the existing income tax-PRSI allowance will result in gains of £2.75 per week for those exempted from income tax or on marginal relief, under £2 per week for those on the 27 per cent income tax rate and £1.40 per week for those on the 48 per cent tax rate.  I welcome the widening of the standard rate income tax band by £1,400 to £17,800 for married couples and by £700 to £8,900 for single persons &mdash; those increases are three times the rate of inflation.  The increase in the threshold for payment of the employment, training and health levies from £173 to £178 per week is in line with the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>.  The impact of the tax-PRSI package on a family with two children with one spouse earning £15,000 per annum on full PRSI and PAYE will be to leave them better off by £3.56 per week.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the introduction for the first time of tax relief for all tenants living in private rented accommodation, the cost of which will undoubtedly be reduced by an additional tax yield from landlords.</P>
    <P>The main goal of this year's budget is to get people back to work as job creation is the greatest challenge facing our country.  Through the budget the Government of renewal is creating economic conditions which encourage the development of enterprise and job creation.  For the first time in many years we are beginning to see the fruits of such policies.  This budget will make it financially more attractive for young people in particular to take up a first job <Col N="553" /> and take the all important first step of entering the labour market.</P>
    <P>During the past two years the rate of unemployment has been falling steadily and the measures taken in this year's budget will ensure that this trend will continue.  The £6 million committed in the budget for the introduction of an intensive guidance and placement service for the long term unemployed is especially welcome.  That initiative will give real hope to those people who have been out of work for long periods.</P>
    <P>The social welfare improvements in the budget are a clear signal of the commitment of the Government of renewal to social solidarity.  The increases in all personal weekly payments and adult dependant allowances will come into effect six weeks earlier than usual.  It has long been argued that the timelag between the start of the tax year in April and the increases in social welfare benefits made much later in the year should be shortened and I welcome the narrowing of that gap.  The increase of £7 per month in child benefit is the largest ever.  It is a targeted approach to help alleviate the employment and poverty traps inherent in the social welfare system and will be of great benefit to families.  For example, a mother with three children will receive £86 per month or just over £1,000 per year.  I welcome the extension of the child benefit scheme to include 18-year olds in full-time education or on FÁS courses.  The increase from £10 to £25 in the minimum unemployment assistance benefit paid to single people living in the family home is welcome.  It may slow the trend whereby young people are forced to move out of the family home to qualify for unemployment assistance and to qualify for a further rent allowance from a health board if they move into private rented accommodation.  I welcome the Government's commitment to payment of the entitlements of married women to social welfare equality payments.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Labour Party delegation to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, I particularly welcome <Col N="554" /> the extension of the free travel scheme to pensioners North and South for cross-Border journeys.  That will help underpin the peace process and will promote greater understanding between people on this island who will have an opportunity to meet without the worry of travel costs.  I pay a tribute to the successful negotiations by the Tánaiste, the Government and the Northern Ireland Secretary and I hope a Joint Framework Document will be presented shortly which will bring a lasting peace.  An economic dividend will be gained from peace which will enable us improve tourism and trade and allow a redeployment of gardaí now engaged in Border security.  Those gardaí are badly needed in our towns and cities, particularly in Dublin where there is a serious drug problem.</P>
    <P>Last summer the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, gave a commitment to the establishment of free access to third level education.  She has delivered on that commitment.  The removal of fees in publicly funded third level institutions will be implemented in two phases.  In addition, the Minister is providing £2 million to remove charges for post-leaving certificate courses.  The abolition of fees will encourage all students to remain and participate fully in the education system.  It aims at ensuring universal access to third level education and providing as a right an education system which aspires to be inclusive of all the needs of its community.A further wide range of initiatives and improvements has been implemented at first and second level education targeted at areas of greatest need.  Those include additional home school links and remedial and guidance teachers, as well as trebling the number of early-start pre-schools and a major increase in the disadvantaged fund for primary schools.</P>
    <P>The 1995 budget is an indication that the parties in the Government of renewal can work together and I look forward to two further budgets to build on what has been achieved so far.</P>

      <P>In this budget there was a little for everybody.  That is not a bad thing, but we all knew in advance because of the unfortunate leaks to the newspapers before budget day.  Those leaks were regrettable.  The people directly affected by the budget were very disappointed, particularly pensioners.The farmers and the self-employed were also unhappy with the budgetary provisions.  A scenario painted in one newspaper indicated that a non-smoking married couple living in rented accommodation with seven children in the tourist resort of Ballybunion would benefit under the budget, but for the majority of people the budget did not mean very much.  I hope the Government will be able to include Salthill in the next pilot programme as the people there were very disappointed that this major tourist resort in the west was not included in the package.</P>
      <P>I accept the Minister for Finance was in a difficult position because he had to allow the three parties in Government to have some input to the budget. Obviously he was trying to appease the three parties in the rainbow.  Fianna Fáil and Labour which provided sound Government since 1992 left the economy in a strong position and credit is due to those two parties which contributed a good deal to the peace process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first real test of this Government has been the manner in which it tackled the problem of flooding which was particularly severe in the west.  I am disappointed only £2 million was made available for a specific project to help farmers who lost fodder or livestock. Householders in County Galway and elsewhere who suffered great losses will not benefit from that measure.  Constituents have told me that they would like to build a wall to protect their properties, but there is no indication that any grant assistance will be available to help <Col N="556" /> people who want to take such remedial action.  Such minor issues should have been considered because householders have suffered.  The flood damage in County Galway was so severe that the £2 million allocation could be spent in that county alone.</P>
    <P>An anti-rural aspect of the budget is that the roads allocation was reduced from £108 million last year to £100 million, despite the extra money available. The social welfare increases of 2.5 per cent are disappointing.  During the last seven years Fianna Fáil led Governments have given a 3 per cent increase to social welfare recipients.  There is no increase in child dependant allowances or in family income supplement.  Old age pensioners also deserve better treatment from this Government.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, on the charter for farmers.  I welcome it and I hope it will include a charter for smallholders &mdash; the farmers in receipt of unemployment assistance who are not getting their rights.  The Department of Social Welfare does not accept the income of a farmer as assessed by the Inspector of Taxes, neither is a balance sheet from the Teagasc adviser acceptable.  I pointed out to the Minister for Social Welfare yesterday that where a Teagasc adviser assesses a farmer's income at, say, £2,500 and the Department of Social Welfare assess his income at £5,000, no consideration is given to the Teagasc assessment.  That is ridiculous.  I have documentation, which I will give to the Minister, to show this is happening in rural Ireland.  The sad fact is that if a smallholder makes £1 he loses £1 and that is not the way farming should progress in the west.</P>
    <P>I am also disappointed with the provision for group water schemes which are a basic requirement of modern life.  I tabled a question on this to the Minister when the Dáil resumed but increased grants were not announced.  Last year £3 million was provided, this year it is only £4 million.  Last year £1 million was <Col N="557" /> returned to the Department of the Environment as people could not use the money because the grants were not increased and schemes only operate on the basis of obtaining supplementary grants, through the Department of Finance.For that reason there is major disappointment in that area.</P>
    <P>I was further annoyed when I learned the Government proposed to give income tax relief of £150 to group water schemes where the water is supplied by the local authority.  It is unfair that people who set up voluntary group water schemes will not get the £150 income tax relief.  The Government do not realise the work involved in setting up and maintaining a voluntary group water scheme.  In Galway alone there are 400 such schemes.  In reply to a recent question I learned that 109 groups in Galway have applied to set up schemes.  These people are discriminated against on grounds of tax relief. The Government informed me it would lose £50 million if it did away with the charges.  This proposal is bureaucracy gone mad.  If one pays the water charge on time one will get a tax free allowance.This appears to be muddled thinking.</P>
    <P>The same bureaucratic thinking applies to tax on overseas development aid.  As my party spokesman on overseas development aid and the Third World I welcome the 26 per cent increase in ODA.  It would be more practical if a person was allowed to give money directly to the charitable organisation, obtain a receipt and a photocopy of the cheque which should be accepted by the Revenue Commissioners as a deduction against his or her income.  This would eliminate much of the Civil Service work involved, the charity would get the money direct and the taxpayer would be better off.  The Government has introduced a restrictive and cumbersome method of dealing with tax relief for donations to Third World charities.  Will the Minister clarify if it is his intention to restrict tax relief to a maximum of £750 and if it will be continued for a number of years?  I read <Col N="558" /> in today's newspapers that the National Charities of Ireland consider it unacceptable that they are not getting the same benefit from the tax relief for donations and say it will have a drastic effect on the home based charities.  The Minister may have to examine that area again.</P>
    <P>I had the honour of meeting the Minister of State with responsibility for western development, Deputy Carey, in my constituency last Monday.  I wish him well in his endeavours to maintain and improve rural life and further rural renewal.  Today he answered some questions on rural schools.  From his recent replies particularly to Deputy Micheál Martin, on schools that will lose a teacher by next September, I note in County Galway that 26 teachers will be lost in 23 schools.  He will have a big task in getting resources for those schools.  I hope the Minister for Education will look again at the pupil/teacher ratio and provide badly needed remedial and resource teachers. The problem of rural schools losing teachers is a serious one.  The reply to that question draws attention to the stark reality.</P>
    <P>On the health services in County Galway, in 1982 proposals were submitted by the Western Health Board for development at University College Hospital.  I understand we may only be able to get planning costs in 1995 which means the development will not take place for perhaps two years.  At the moment patients are being detained overnight, for long periods on trolleys, in the accident and emergency department.This is unsatisfactory from the point of view of patient care and the dignity and privacy of patients.  All booked admissions during the period August 1994 to January 1995 have been cancelled to maintain an emergency only service.  This equates to almost 40 deferrals each day.  Arrangements for the admission of some patients have been cancelled up to five times.  Professional standards of nurses and doctors and all other hospital staff are threatened in such conditions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="559" /> I hope the board's proposal will be taken seriously by the Department.  We want to convert an under-utilised area of the obstetrics department for use as a general ward.  This ward will be ready for occupation at the end of the month provided we can obtain funding.  Funding is the main problem.  I understand capital costs would be £59,000 and the operating costs for ten months would be £439,000.  This funding plus the fact that we may be able to use Merlin Park Hospital on a rota basis would give us the facilities we need in the short term. I hope that the short term proposals I have made for the interim development and the major development will soon be acted upon by the Department.  From August 1994 to January 1995, 185 patients were detained overnight in the accident and emergency department, some from six to 30 hours.  During the same period, August 1994 to January 1995, patients whose booked admissions were cancelled number 2,016.  That is the position in University College Hospital which should be the jewel of the west.</P>
    <P>As spokesperson for emigrants' issues I am very disappointed that statutory funding has not been made available for pre-emigration services in this country. All the agencies tell us that if emigrants from Ireland were better prepared and counselled they would not find themselves in difficulties in other countries. We often forget there are two sides to this coin, pre-emigration and post-emigration services.  I welcome the provision of funding through DÍON and FÁS, but a greater allocation must be made available for the few existing specialist pre-emigration services for which I hope the Government will put statutory funding in place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1994 the economy was in a very healthy condition, showing the best annual returns for many years. Claims have been made about the European and world market but we also have a very buoyant domestic market as a result of careful management by the <Col N="560" /> Government since 1987.  In recent years there has been an air of confidence which, in any area of life, is an essential ingredient.  That air of confidence existed in the agricultural and industrial sectors as well as other areas.  In recent years I met business people who admitted that we had a very good Government and those people were very concerned when it fell at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>One must be concerned at the fact that Fine Gael and Labour are back in Government and have their hands on the books again.  Since the 1950s when we had the first Coalition Government, every Coalition involving those two parties ended in disaster, leaving a mess for the incoming Government.  I remember speaking in this House after the 1983 budget introduced by Deputy Alan Dukes, a budget that spelled disaster for the Border region, with the increase in excise duty on cigarettes, petrol and diesel.  This resulted in many people going on shopping sprees in Northern Ireland.  It took years for the economy of that area to recover and it was only as a result of the MacSharry and Reynolds budgets that improvements were made. At that time we witnessed the withdrawal of funding for arterial drainage, the withdrawal of grants for agricultural buildings and so on.  The result of the measures taken in those years was that the national debt doubled from £12 billion to £24 billion.</P>
      <P>Last week I heard a Minister stating that this Government is acting as a unit. As the previous speaker said, it is a very leaky unit.  The leaks before this budget were unfortunate for the Minister for Finance and are a cause of concern to many people.  There is a lack of confidence at present in many aspects of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1994, for the first time in 27 years, there was a budget surplus, but it seems that was a once-off position.  In the 1995 budget the Government is returning to the policy of budget deficit &mdash; the figure of £310 million has been mentioned. Total Exchequer borrowing for the year is projected at £813 million.  A budget deficit was unheard of until the early <Col N="561" /> 1970s, around the time I entered the Dáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Up to that time budgets were always balanced.  The priority in industry, business and farming was to balance the books.</P>
      <P>Since publication of the Book of Estimates I raised by way of Adjournment debate the reduction from £4 million to £2 million in grant-in-aid for special housing for the elderly.  On that occasion I stated that health boards use FÁS employees to carry out work such as house repairs, the provision of water, sewerage and electricity and the installation of showers and baths.  To qualify for the grant the house must be owned by the applicant and priority is given to aged couples, handicapped people, persons living alone and widows with children.I strongly made the point that the increase provided for in 1994 was of tremendous benefit.</P>
      <P>In his reply the Minister stated that because of the high level of demand for assistance at the end of 1993 the number of applications awaiting action by the health boards had increased to 3,600 and that it was for the purpose of clearing as much as possible of this backlog that an extra £2 million was provided in 1994 from the proceeds of the tax amnesty.  The Minister went on to say that the extra provision from the tax amnesty had a positive effect on reducing the arrears.  With the extra £355,000 made available last year work was carried out on an extra 530 houses &mdash; the average cost per house amounted to £640.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister yesterday, to which he replied that at the end of 1994, 3,795 people were on the waiting list, an increase in the figure for the previous year.  That gives an indication of the demand for the scheme, an essential scheme which is good value for money. Having asked the Minister to consider this matter in the context of the budget, <Col N="562" /> I am disappointed that was not done.  In view of the increases in demand for the scheme there is a strong case for the provision of additional funding to the health boards for this purpose.  If the funding is reduced to its pre-1994 level, some pensioners will have to wait three to four years for draught proofing, the installation of a door or window or the replacement of slates.  It is ridiculous that 65 and 70 year old people should have to wait that length for this service.</P>
    <P>There has been much reference to the increases in social welfare.  I welcome the increase in child benefit but am critical of the 2.5 per cent increase for old age pensioners, the lowest percentage increase for that category for many years.  Even during very difficult times Fianna Fáil gave old age pensioners increases of 3, 4 and 5 per cent.  When the Minister for Social Welfare was in Opposition he said that the increases given by the then Government were miserable, that they told their own story.  He has changed his tune now that he is on the other side of the House.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to group water schemes.  There is reference in the budget to a figure of £10 million in 1995 under this heading but there is also a later reference to a sum of £4.5 million.  Most group schemes, which were funded to some extent by private subscriptions, require upgrading in order to comply with EU regulations. Funding is also required for treatment works and it is regrettable that more funding was not provided for this purpose.People in Monaghan town and Clones are waiting the approval of funding for a public water scheme.</P>
    <P>Since I am being parochial, I wish to refer to the waste study carried out in County Monaghan last year.  This study, which was grant-aided to the tune of £100,000 by INTERREG, identified the serious problem caused by large quantities of poultry litter and mushroom waste compost which was spread on land, filtered down to the water sources and contaminated the water with nitrogen and phosphate.  The Erne and <Col N="563" /> Blackwater catchments were contaminated in that way.  There is a need for funding for a recycling plant which will dispose of the waste.  I ask the Minister to provide funding for the proposed small generating plants which will deal with this problem.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the funding which will shortly come on stream under various headings &mdash; INTERREG, the IFI, the Delors initiative for Northern Ireland and the Border counties, the promised funding from President Clinton, Leader II and the county enterprise boards which have provided funding for small industrial developments in recent years.  It is necessary to put in place a structure which will ensure that this funding is put to the best possible use. As I have said on numerous occasions in the House, we have not made the best use of funding to date.  In anticipation of this money, community groups in counties Cavan and Monaghan are putting together projects.  However, if they apply for assistance under the IFI they have to have backing funding which is very hard to obtain in certain areas.  I ask the Minister to put in place a structure which will co-ordinate the distribution of this funding.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the funding for roads.  One of the most disappointing aspects of the budget is the reduction in the funding for county roads.  Even during difficult times Fianna Fáil gave a continuing increase for the maintenance of primary and county roads.  While this funding was never sufficient, additional funding was provided each year.  Given the favourable economic climate, there were expectations of substantial increases in the funding for county roads.  Instead, the Government has reduced the level of funding for this purpose by approximately £7 million.  This reduction will have serious implications for Border counties where, as a result of the peace initiative, many roads which had been closed for the past 20 years have been reopened.  Much money is required to repair these roads which are now used <Col N="564" /> by an increasing number of motorists. Additional funding is also required for the development of agriculture and tourism.  I hope the Government will provide this additional funding before the end of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the budget in general.  Regardless of whether one is in Opposition or in Government, one retains the right to be critical of aspects of it.  I share Deputy Leonard's anxiety about the need for extra funding for county and regional roads.  The issue of roads is of extreme importance in counties Monaghan and Cavan.  I will refer later to this point.</P>
      <P>Much reference has been made to the budget leaks.  Instead of focusing on this good budget the Opposition focused on the leaks.  I was interested to hear some members of the Opposition express their regret at the resignation of Deputy Phil Hogan as Minister of State. However, I would remind them that they sought his resignation.  His decision to resign was very honourable and it showed what our party stands for.  When I was in Opposition some people in Government refused to take responsibility for their actions.  I am proud to belong to the same party as Deputy Phil Hogan who made a major sacrifice.  I hope he will be restored to high office sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to the special provisions for aid to Third World countries. On numerous occasions in the recent past people have shown that they are extremely concerned about people who are worse off than themselves.  The extra funding provided for Third World aid shows the Government's commitment to this issue.  The tax relief provided for taxpayers who make long term funding commitments to agencies working in the Third World is extremely important.  I think all of us would admit that we give to these needy voluntary organisations only when there is a serious crisis.  These arrangements will lead to a stronger and more organised commitment to fund these voluntary organisations and will herald a new <Col N="565" /> beginning in the provision of aid to Third World Countries.  In this regard I congratulate the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and all concerned.</P>
    <P>The budget has been structured in such a way as to reward work and promote enterprise and to strengthen society.  On both these issues Fine Gael has a major and important role to play in the three party coalition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I stated last night that the right of every person to protect and vindicate their own good name and reputation is a fundamental one which must continue to be protected.  Any legislation which seeks to regulate or limit the law relating to defamation must have as its primary objective the protection of the good name of every citizen.  Legislation directed at the reform of the law in this area must ensure that all citizens whose reputations and good names have been attacked have readily available to them a suitable means of redress.  That involves an accessible, speedy means of having the issue considered and <Col N="566" /> resolved in court.  To this extent the proposal in the Bill which would allow declaratory orders to be made is helpful.</P>
      <P>There is also a need to ensure that the law is clear and rational.  There is no doubt that the existing law is in need of reform.  Some procedures and the nature of certain defamation pleadings are undoubtedly and unquestionably arcane.  However, the extent of the reform necessary must depend on the nature of the balance it is sought to achieve between a number of competing interests.</P>
      <P>The apparent conflict which can arise between competing constitutional rights to which I have already referred, such as the right to freedom of expression guaranteed by Article 40.6.1º, the right to communicate protected by Article 40.3.1º and the right to one's good name and reputation, must be resolved in a manner which protects the individual. Legislation should not seek to condone or reward unacceptable carelessness at the expense of the individual.  It must not seek to encourage or protect the type of tabloid journalism that unfortunately has now become common in the United Kingdom.  All rights carry a corresponding duty.  It has been wisely said that rights and duties are two sides of the one coin.</P>
      <P>In the same way the right to freedom of expression carries with it a corresponding duty.  It is an onerous duty and one which the court must be permitted to police.  It must be remembered that freedom of expression is not a licence to print money.  It is not an invitation to publish without being damned and does not give a right to express a damaging untruth as a fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the conclusion of the Law Reform Commission that the sensible course would be to repeal the existing 1961 Act and replace it with a new Act.  I acknowledge that this Bill put forward by Deputy McDowell is an attempt to address the difficulties presented by the existing law.  However I am not convinced that it strikes the <Col N="567" /> correct balance.  It would put unnecessary obstacles in the path of aggrieved citizens and would allow the careless unwarranted protection from the consequences of their actions.  In general we are fortunate in having high journalistic standards.  In reforming the law of defamation we must ensure that we do not encourage a lessening in those high standards and a devaluation of truth and accuracy.</P>
    <P>In this regard there is a strong argument, in tandem or in conjunction with this Bill, for the establishment of a press complaints council.  This would be of advantage not just to an individual who feels aggrieved but also to the press. Many people do not want the bother of going to court with their complaints; others cannot afford to do so.  The existence of a press complaints council would serve not just the general public but the media in that in all probability it would result in fewer actions and the speedy resolution of complaints.</P>
    <P>The question has arisen as to whether an action in defamation should lie in respect of published material about a deceased person which is untrue. Families can be extremely distressed and very upset by published material.  In this respect the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission that an action should lie is correct.  I do not say that such an action should result in damages; the correct procedure is that the personal representative of the deceased should be allowed to take the action in order to obtain a declaratory order to the effect that the material printed was untrue.  The reputation of a deceased person can be of the utmost importance to their family and subsequent generations.To that extent this provision should have been included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about section 22 of the Bill because it would establish a defence known as comment based on fact which is intended to replace the defence known as fair comment.  It would provide valuable protection for the expression of genuinely held opinions where those opinions are <Col N="568" /> based on facts and would further provide that where a defendant fails to establish the truth of the facts on which the comment is based he or she may still avail of the defence if reasonable care was exercised in ascertaining the truth of those facts.</P>
    <P>The reason I am concerned is that subsection (3) states that failure by a defendant to establish the truth of sufficient facts to support the comments would not by itself deprive him or her of the defence of comment based on fact if the defendant shows he or she exercised reasonable care in ascertaining the truth of the facts alleged to support the comment.In short it appears this would allow freedom not just to publish a falsehood but to make a derogatory comment about the individual about whom the false material was originally published.  The Bill does not contain a definition of &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo;, which can mean just about anything.</P>
    <P>In justice to the press and broadcasters, there is hardly ever an occasion when they set out deliberately to destroy a person's reputation.  I sincerely hope that this proud tradition will continue but while it attempts to address the problems relating to the law of defamation the Bill would in all probability lead to a lessening in those standards on the part of a minority.  People are as entitled to be protected against the actions of what may well be established to be an unscrupulous minority as they are against an unscrupulous majority.  I am thinking in particular of the possibility of the probability of certain British tabloid newspapers here being in a position to lower their standards.That would not be in the interests of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>Reform of this area of law is necessary but further consideration is required before we achieve the objective of a correct balance between the right of a citizen to his or her good name and the right of freedom of expression.</P>

      <P>I would like to join other Members of the House in commending Deputy McDowell for the work he has put into the preparation of this measure. The Minister for Equality and Law Reform explained last night the approach the Government is taking to the Bill and why we are not in a position to support the measure at this stage.  I have no doubt that both the Bill and the debate we are now having on it in the House will be of great value to the Government in reaching its ultimate decisions on the approach which should be taken, in the public interest, to the areas covered by the Deputy's proposals.</P>
      <P>I should also mention my appreciation of the work which the Law Reform Commission put into its reports on the areas covered by the Bill.</P>
      <P>While most of the Bill is taken up with reform of the civil law on defamation there are two areas covered by it which fall into my areas of responsibility: Part III, which deals with criminal defamation and Part IV which deals with contempt of court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will be aware, there are three Law Reform Commission reports dealing with the areas covered by the Bill: the report on the civil law of defamation, the crime of libel and contempt of court.  These must be read in conjunction with the very detailed consultation papers which the commission published in each of these areas in advance of finalising its recommendations.  Consideration of the reports on criminal libel and contempt of court in my Department will be completed in the context of bringing forward legislative proposals in these areas.  It is in the context of the development of those proposals that I am particularly interested in what is said in this debate by Members on all sides of the House and, by the same token, I am sure Members will appreciate that what I have to say about the detail of the Bill, in advance <Col N="570" /> of the Government finalising its own proposals, will inevitably be tentative.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that both in law and practice defamation is largely a civil matter and one in which the criminal law becomes involved only rarely. Indeed, in the Law Reform Commission's report on the crime of libel it considers in some detail whether a criminal offence of libel should be retained.  Before going into that I should say I do not envisage any difficulty with the proposal in section 37 of the Bill to abolish the common law offences of seditious libel and obscene libel.  The commission recommended their abolition primarily on the basis that other legislation deals adequately with these matters and, subject to any views which Members of the House might have on the matter, I am inclined to accept that view.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission also dealt with the crime of blasphemous libel.  Certain constitutional considerations arise in this area to which Deputy McDowell referred last night and I can well understand why he chose not to deal with this matter in his Bill.</P>
    <P>The remaining category of criminal libel is defamatory libel and the rest of Part III of the Bill deals with this.  While I might have difficulties with some of the detail of these sections, which I will mention, I do not foresee any great difficulty for the Government in accepting the underlying approach of both the commission and Deputy McDowell to changes in the law in this area.</P>
    <P>The key question is whether the criminal law should be involved in libel cases and, as I mentioned, this matter is considered in some detail by the commission.The &ldquo;abolitionists&rdquo; in relation to this offence argue that retention of criminal liability does not sufficiently recognise the value of free speech; the offence should be eliminated because it is virtually obsolete and the civil law is sufficient to provide a remedy for anyone who has been defamed.</P>
    <P>I can see merit in each of those arguments but from my preliminary examination of this issue I would attribute <Col N="571" /> more weight to the case which is made to the effect that civil remedies are not always sufficient, for example, where the victim may not have the money to pursue a civil case or where, realistically, there would not be any prospect of the person who did the defaming being able to pay any damages which might be awarded.  I believe the central consideration must be that some forms of behaviour are so despicable and unacceptable that they should be the subject of criminal sanctions.</P>
    <P>While there have been few criminal libel cases since the foundation of the State that, of itself, does not mean that the offence should not be retained in some form in our criminal law, albeit in the knowledge that it is likely to be used only rarely.</P>
    <P>In this context, it is useful to consider the Fleming case which was a prosecution for criminal libel in 1989 and, as far as I know, the most recent prosecution for the offence.  The defendant in that case believed that the victims, who were a married couple, were in collusion with the Agricultural Credit Corporation which had seized his land.  As some form of retaliation the defendant wrote obscene graffiti about the couple in a variety of public places all around the country.  The graffiti gave the telephone number of the couple as one to be called to arrange sexual intercourse with the persons living at the address. For about four years the couple &mdash; who had three children &mdash; received nuisance calls.  At one stage the number of calls each month was approximately 160 and they were generally received in the early hours of the morning.</P>
    <P>I could not accept the proposition that that type of behaviour should not be the business of the criminal law and, while I accept that hard cases may make bad law, I also believe that bad law cannot deal with hard cases.</P>
    <P>I assume that for similar considerations Deputy McDowell took on board the Law Reform Commission's recommendation that the offence should be retained but in a more confined form.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="572" /> Under Deputy McDowell's proposal, the new statutory offence of criminal libel would involve the publication of a statement which is both false and defamatory; the publication must be done maliciously and the person publishing the statement must know the statement to be false.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission made a number of other recommendations relating to the offence which do not appear to be addressed explicitly in Deputy McDowell's Bill.  The commission recommended that the prosecution should be required to show that the matter was false and defamatory and that the burden should also be on the prosecution to show that the necessary mental element for the commission of the crime existed.  I know it might be argued that given the way the offence is framed and the general legal rules which govern the burden of proof on the prosecution, there may be no need to make explicit reference to these matters in the legislation but this is something which I will consider further in the course of my examination of the Law Reform Commission report.</P>
    <P>The commission also recommended that the prosecution should be required to show that the person knew the statement to be false or was recklessly indifferent to the question of truth or falsity. In the offence as drafted by the Deputy there would have to be actual knowledge that the statement was false &mdash; reckless indifference is not included.  I can see some merit in the argument that there should be actual knowledge and that reckless indifference should not be sufficient for an offence to have been committed but, again, this is something which needs further consideration.</P>
    <P>It is important to note in terms of freedom of the press that under the Defamation Act, 1961, a prosecution against newspapers for defamatory libel cannot be taken without the consent of a High Court judge.  Established case law suggests that a court would not consent to a prosecution unless it was satisfied that the libel was a serious one and <Col N="573" /> that the public interest required the institution of criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission recommended that the requirement of consent by a High Court judge be dropped but that, instead, a prosecution would require the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Deputy McDowell goes half way down this road in that section 38 would require either the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions or a judge of the High Court. The Law Reform Commission argues quite strongly that retaining the High Court procedure is a uniquely anomalous exception to the general principle vesting the discretionary power to authorise a prosecution in the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions and that it should be removed. I know Deputy McDowell has strong views on this matter and, indeed, the Law Reform Commission in its report refers in detail to an article which the Deputy wrote for <i>The Irish Times</i> about this and other matters.  The commission strongly rejects Deputy McDowell's arguments and, while I am reluctant to interpose myself in a debate among such eminent legal luminaries, I would have to be satisfied that there are good and substantial grounds of public policy for retaining a role for the High Court as envisaged in Deputy McDowell's proposals.</P>

      <P>It is easy for Deputy McDowell to say that when the other side are not here to defend themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's Bill also reflects his unhappiness with the commission's proposal that the Director of Public Prosecutions should have the right to opt for summary disposal of an offence of criminal libel in the District Court. Again, as evidenced in the commission's response to the Deputy's arguments in this regard, the Deputy and the commission are poles apart on this issue.  All I will say at this stage is that I recognise that complex and difficult questions <Col N="574" /> arise in relation to this matter, and I will address them fully in my consideration of the commission's report.</P>
    <P>There are just two other points which I would like to make briefly about Part III of the Bill.  The first is that the Law Reform Commission recommended that there should be no defence of statutory or qualified common law privilege in proceedings for criminal defamation, but section 40 of the Deputy's Bill provides that any defence based on privilege under common law, statute or the Constitution will be available to the defendant in a prosecution for criminal libel to the same extent as the civil defamation proceedings.  It seems on the face of it, given the way the offence is framed in the Bill, that there are no circumstances in which a defence of qualified privilege could succeed as it would have to be shown that the statement in question was made maliciously, was false and defamatory and was known to be so.  In those circumstances the better approach may be to take on board the commission's recommendation that the defence should simply be not provided for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>What about a false and defamatory statement made in this House deliberately and maliciously by a Member?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise what the Deputy is concerned about.  Perhaps we can listen to the debate and examine that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second &mdash; and last &mdash; point which I want to make on this Part of the Bill is that while it abolishes the common law offences of seditious libel and obscene libel, it does not abolish the common law offence of defamatory libel even though the whole point of this Part of the Bill, as I understand it, would be to place the offence on a statutory footing albeit with a more restricted definition. While it is the case that the Law Reform Commission did not explicitly recommend the abolition of the common law offence I believe that it is implicit in its recommendations.  I cannot see that its <Col N="575" /> proposals on defamatory libel would make much sense otherwise.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals essentially with the protection of journalistic sources in relation to both court proceedings and tribunals of inquiry.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy agreement contains a commitment that the Government will examine the possibility of legislating to enable journalists to protect the confidentiality of their sources in certain circumstances.  That examination is being undertaken particularly in the context of the Law Reform Commission report on contempt of court which was published towards the end of last year.</P>
    <P>There is no point in pretending that there are easy answers in this area of the law.  What we have to do is strike the right balance between competing and important rights and, as the Law Reform Commission report itself makes clear, there are differences of view &mdash; even in the commission itself &mdash; as to how exactly that balance should be struck.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that all Members of the House would recognise the vital role which the media have to play in a democracy and it is fair to say that we have been well served in this country in this regard in that the media have avoided the types of excess which have arisen in some other jurisdictions.  It is clearly important that we do not include in our laws needless restrictions on the ability of the media to fulfil their role. The Government's commitment in this regard is clear from the approach which the Government policy agreement takes to issues such as freedom of information.</P>
    <P>It is, however, the case that occasions can arise where the understandable priority which journalists give to the protection of their sources can conflict with the fundamental rights of others. That reality is recognised in Deputy McDowell's Bill because it does not propose that there are no circumstances in which a journalist must reveal his or her sources.  Instead it sets out to define <Col N="576" /> the circumstances in which a court or tribunal could require the disclosure of journalistic sources.</P>
    <P>While related, the approach which should be taken in relation to court proceedings and that which should be taken in relation to tribunals give rise to somewhat different considerations, and I will deal with these separately.  In relation to court proceedings, it is a fair summary to say that our law at the moment means that while a court will have regard to the importance of freedom of speech it is ultimately a matter for the court, rather than the journalist involved, to decide whether the interests of justice require that a source be revealed in a particular case.</P>
    <P>A majority of the Law Reform Commission expressed themselves satisfied that the broad powers available to the court under the Constitution, particularly as decided in the O'Kelly case, should not and cannot be limited or restricted in any way.  A majority of the commission did not recommend legislation and instead wanted the law to be developed by the courts.</P>
    <P>A minority of the commission recommended that legislation should be introduced to provide that a court would not be permitted to order disclosure unless it was established that disclosure was clearly necessary to prevent injustice or in the interests of national security or to prevent disorder or crime.  They felt that this approach, while not conferring absolute privilege, would give appropriate recognition to the public interest in the protection of journalistic sources. This is the approach which Deputy McDowell has enshrined in Part IV of his Bill.</P>
    <P>I have not yet reached a conclusion as to which of the two approaches I have mentioned is the better one and I suspect that in reality there is not much to choose between either of them.  This arises particularly because it may well be that the law as applied by the courts would not differ from what others suggest should be included in a statute. Before reaching a conclusion in this regard I propose to consult widely and <Col N="577" /> I will have particular regard to what is said during this debate.</P>
    <P>In relation to tribunals, it would be unreal to ignore the context of what happened in relation to the beef tribunal.While it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the outcome of a particular court case, those proceedings underlined the need for us to have a fresh look at the law in this area and we are doing that.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission in its contempt of court report recommended that legislation should provide that a person may only be required to disclose the source of information contained in a publication for which he or she is responsible if it is established to the satisfaction of a tribunal of inquiry that disclosure is absolutely necessary for the purpose of the inquiry or to protect the constitutional rights of any other person.Deputy McDowell's Bill, instead, would apply the same test as would arise in contempt of court cases &mdash; that disclosure was necessary in the interests of justice or national security or for the prevention of disorder or crime.</P>
    <P>Proceedings of a tribunal are not judicial proceedings and I am not sure that the best solution is simply to graft the rules which would be set for court proceedings onto tribunals as well.  This House has never lightly used its powers in the past to establish tribunals of inquiry and would not do so in the future.  They arise where matters of grave public importance are at issue and we need to ensure that tribunals have all the appropriate powers to fulfil the functions which the House confers on them.  As against that, it would be at the very least ironic if we were to do anything which impinged on the freedom of the press to the extent that they were inhibited in reality from bringing such matters of grave public importance into the public domain in the first place. Again it is a question of striking the right balance and that is what my consideration of this issue over the coming months will be aimed at.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would like again to commend Deputy McDowell for <Col N="578" /> bringing this Bill before the House. While I appreciate that he is disappointed it has not proved possible for the Government to accept his proposals at this stage I hope this will be tempered by the fact that the Bill itself &mdash; and this debate &mdash; will have a significant influence in the formulation of policy in these areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for Justice for sharing her time with me.</P>
      <P>I welcome Deputy McDowell's initiative in seeking to reform the law.  Six years after his party entered Government promising to change the law, the parties opposite have undergone a late conversion in several areas.  It is particularly ironic that Fianna Fáil should be supporting this Bill, given their former Leader's fondness for scattering libel writs about him like snuff at a wake.</P>
      <P>In December 1991 the Law Reform Commission published a report on the civil law of defamation.  This is just one of a number of reports that were allowed to gather dust on Government shelves.  Much of the legislative heritage with which we are wrestling has its roots in English common law as well as in a vast body of legislation enacted during the 18th and 19th centuries and the 1961 Defamation Act.  The citizen's right to his or her good name is further buttressed by the Constitution.  The result is that the media, individuals and society as a whole are struggling under the burden of outdated laws which take no account of new technologies or of developments in the media as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Laws which were considered appropriate in the age of coffee house news sheets are scarcely appropriate today when newspapers are crippled by libel insurance premia rendering small newspapers even more uncompetitive in a market distorted by monopolies and foreign penetration.  At the same time individuals are able to protect themselves from justified inquiries into their doings &mdash; even when such inquiries are clearly in the public interest &mdash; by simply slapping a writ on the offending medium.  The mere threat of a writ will <Col N="579" /> generally do the job as certain prominent Members can no doubt testify.</P>
    <P>Few can have failed to note the decline of investigative journalism in recent years.  While that cannot be laid solely at the door of our defamation laws, there can be little doubt that some editors, and their publishers, may recoil from sensitive issues for fear of being held liable for defamation.  Ironically, the law offers scant protection to some individuals; to those without means and influence who, for whatever reason, are suddenly exposed to media scrutiny.  In this regard I urge the Minister to consider the need for a form of privacy legislation to protect individuals from intrusive reporting by the telephoto-lens school of journalism &mdash; something which is becoming increasingly common and which is not necessarily covered by our defamation laws.</P>
    <P>We need to ensure that private and public interests are vindicated and I believe that the implementation of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations will go a long way towards achieving that goal.  While I welcome the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, I have a few problems with Deputy McDowell's Bill, for example, I am baffled by the non-inclusion of the commission's proposal that defaming the dead be actionable.  I am sure Members and people generally have unpleasant memories of the plethora of tawdry stories which were published following the death of Fr. Michael Cleary.  Under the law as it stands, a dead person is fair game for every muckraker in town and this must be rectified as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>However, I appreciate the difficulties which a blanket provision in this regard could pose to historians, biographers and serious journalists and I hope that any legislation which may be introduced will address these difficulties in a balanced way.  We need to strike a balance between the public and the private interest.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the Law Reform <Col N="580" /> Commission's proposals are straightforward and I would like to see them on the Statute Book.  I welcome the provision that distributors and printers should be immune from defamation actions.  Their current liability has its roots in the 18th and 19th centuries at a time when defamation laws were used mainly as a means of political repression something to which none would wish to revert.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the placing of the burden of proof on the plaintiff to prove that the words complained of were untrue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy McDowell had an ally in me long before I came into this House.  This will certainly dissuade writ happy individuals from scattering defamation actions.  I appreciate the concerns expressed by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, and in general I do not see the reversal of the burden of proof being accepted as the norm.  In this case, however such a reversal will redress the current imbalance between influential aggrieved individuals and an increasingly vulnerable media and once again we must strike a balance between the public and private interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only by raising an issue, without sufficient proof at the outset, that matters of public interest can be fully investigated.In this regard, Members need only cast their minds back to the passports for sale scandal, where the truth emerged drip by painful drip in spite of many of the facts having been common knowledge for some time.  A few weeks ago we were faced with the appalling vista &mdash; and I use this phrase advisedly &mdash; of a journalist being imprisoned for contempt.  Until the case against her collapsed, it appeared that Susan O'Keeffe would be the only individual prosecuted and jailed as a result of her exposure of the Goodman débâcle.  Bearing this in mind I welcome section 21 of Deputy McDowell's Bill, providing for qualified <Col N="581" /> privilege in certain media reports of public interest and section 41, enshrining the principle that refusal to disclose the source of public information should not be construed as contempt of court except in exceptional circumstances.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the Law Reform Commission's proposals and the provisions in the Bill, we have to place them in a broader context.  In recent years the diversity of the Irish media has fallen victim to a number of factors such as increased media concentration, we now have the highest concentration of print media ownership in the European Union, this is rapidly squeezing out the smaller players and those who survive are battling with unsustainable insurance premia.  Our libel laws have, in effect, combined with media monopolies to restrict freedom of expression.  For far too long we have engaged in sticking plaster politics, plugging legislative gaps while turning a blind eye to the broader picture.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell's Bill has given rise to valuable debate and now that it has begun it must continue and be broadened out to look at the way we govern ourselves and society.  However, I believe that any moves to update our civil law of defamation must be accompanied by a through examination of issues ranging from media concentration to our outdated censorship laws which, as my colleague Deputy Eric Byrne recently pointed out, ban authors such as Bertrand Russell and films such as &ldquo;Monty Python&rdquo; although I do not believe there is a person who has not seen the film or read the book. It is about time that Irish society grew up.  I would like to see this debate broadened to include freedom of expression, a freedom upon which our democracy depends.  Only when these hot potatoes have been grasped will a reform of the civil law of defamation be fully effective.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Bill represents a regurgitation of the proposals of the Law Reform Commission which, naturally, he could not accept without deep reflection.  There is a weakness in that argument in that it would be quite valid if the Law Reform Commission had reported contemporaneously with the publication of this Bill but its report has been with us since 1991.  We are now moving rapidly through 1995 and the Minister tells us that some time towards the end of this year or perhaps early in 1996 he will be in a position to come in here with proposals.  Every objective observer will agree that the law in this area is out of line.  The law is tilted against the defendants, generally speaking the media but, of course, there can be other defendants and there is a need for reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We might not agree with every recommendation in the report of the Law Reform Commission but it does present us with a challenge.  Choices must be made sooner or later.  We have a body of experts, the Law Reform <Col N="583" /> Commission, which is funded by the taxpayer to propose law reform and make recommendations on difficult legal problems.  It does so following learned research and study.  The Minister has promised that the matter may be dealt within nine months time.  That is not good enough, though I welcome the fact that the Minister has accepted the Bill in principle.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat dubious about the Minister's promise to accept the Bill on Committee Stage in nine months time. My suspicion is based on the reply to a parliamentary question which I asked two weeks ago regarding the intention to reform the law in this area.  My understanding of the reply was that the Minister had so much business on hands this matter would not be reached during the lifetime of the Government, even if it lasts its full time which is becoming increasingly unlikely.</P>

      <P>It imposes a timetable on the Government and on 14 November I expect this legislation to be dealt with on Committee Stage.  There are a number of desirable proposals in the Bill which could be taken on board immediately.They could be detached from the main body of the Bill and implemented in law now.  I have not heard any satisfactory explanation as to why the Government will not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill proposes to abolish the distinction between libel and slander.  That is an uncomplicated, simple proposal. The only function of the present definition is to cause confusion.  I do not see why the distinction cannot be abolished. Deputy McDowell proposes, in line with the Law Reform Commission, that there <Col N="584" /> be a new definition of the term &ldquo;defamation&rdquo;.The only aspect of the proposed definition which might cause difficulty is the phrase &ldquo;tends to injure&rdquo;. The use of the phrase &ldquo;material which tends to injure someone's reputation&rdquo; can be criticised on the grounds that the plaintiff need not necessarily show actual injury to reputation.  Having said that, it must be borne in mind that there is a presumption that damage flows from a statement which is itself defamatory.The common law definition of defamation on which we are relying at present includes the phrase &ldquo;tends to injure&rdquo; so there is nothing exceptional or revolutionary about it.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that it should be made quite clear that an apology is not an admission of liability.  Section 17 of the Defamation Act, 1961 enables a defendant in a defamation action to give evidence that he tendered an apology in order to mitigate damages.  Despite that, because of uncertainty as to whether it constitutes an admission of liability, an apology is rarely tendered where proceedings are likely to be taken.  It is sensible to make it quite clear in legislation that an apology does not constitute an admission of liability.  We should make it quite clear that a judge has an obligation to give proper weight to an apology in this charge to the jury.  That is not a revolutionary or exceptional proposal.  It would not pre-empt the more difficult choices which must be made or damage the impending legislation or the law as it stands.</P>
    <P>In any civil action a defendant can lodge money in court.  Certain consequences flow from that from the point of view of cost.  It is a regular procedure. If a defendant lodges money in court he must at the same time state whether or not he is admitting liability.  However, in a defamation action the lodgment of money in court means the defendant must admit liability.  That is unfair and wrong.  I do not see why defendants in defamation cases who wish to lodge money in court are discriminated against <i>vis-à-vis</i> defendants in other civil actions.  After all, it is a tort and we are <Col N="585" /> talking about the general law of tort. The Minister stated we must find the origin of this rule which is peculiar to defamation cases.  A similar rule existed in the UK but was abolished in 1933, more than 60 years ago, on the basis that it was discriminatory and there was no logical basis for it, yet it exists here. If the Government is serious it could take this proposal on board in advance of a more detailed consideration of the legislation.  It would be of benefit to both plaintiffs and defendants and would be likely to result in a considerable reduction in the number of cases which come to court.</P>
    <P>The proposals in the Bill for declaratory judgments and declaratory and corrective orders are based closely, if not exactly, on the proposals of the Law Reform Commission.  Declaratory and corrective orders are quite unexceptional and should be added to the judgment a person receives for defamation or for libel.  The proposal for declaratory judgments is sensible.  It allows a plaintiff a speedy, cheap remedy.He can proceed by way of special summons to get a declaration that he has been libelled or defamed.  The proposal appears to be logical and should be incorporated into law.  In many cases if a person feels their reputation has been injured it is sensible that they have a speedy way to correct the injury and limit the damage caused rather than having to wait for three or four years before the matter is rectified.  Much damage can be caused to their reputation in that time and they can collect a pile of cash to cure it.  When the Government decides to deal with the Bill on Committee Stage there will not be much opposition to that proposal. The proposals in the Schumer Bill in the United States which proposed that certain defendants should have the right to convert an action for damages into one for a declaratory judgment were rejected by the Law Reform Commission and the parliamentary draftsman, who were wise to do so.  It goes too far.  In the United States the law on defamation is not balanced.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="586" /> I consider the Law Reform Commission and the draftsman of the Bill were wise to reject that proposal because it clearly goes too far.  Even in the United States where the law on defamation is also out of balance, it is titled the other way, against the plaintiff, that particular rule being confined to certain types of plaintiff only.  The Law Reform Commission took the view that, as it were, plaintiffs will rush out all over the place to seek declaratory judgments when that option is introduced, claiming there will be a substantial reduction in the number of actions for general damages.  While I hope that will be the case, I am not sure.  Declaratory proceedings, to some extent &mdash; and this is a matter for debate &mdash; should be open to the defendant.  For example, at present there is a procedure where somebody is allegedly libelled and seeks an apology.  Usually, they get their solicitor to draft an apology, one which is almost invariably out of line with the alleged libel.  They send this into a newspaper saying it is the form of apology they want printed, the newspaper will say it is clearly going too far and effectively, the libelled person can maintain that they sought an apology but did not receive any.  A speedy procedure should be devised whereby a court can declare on that.</P>
    <P>More seriously perhaps &mdash; I put this forward merely as a suggestion &mdash; a defendant should be allowed to institute declaratory proceedings on the basis that this would not prevent a plaintiff subsequently seeking damages, the result of the declaratory proceedings being taken into account ultimately when damages are being awarded to the plaintiff.</P>
    <P>I am worried also about the rules of court on pre-trial discovery in relation to declaratory proceedings.  In many such cases it would be very unfair to expect a defendant to defend these proceedings without discovery.  Journalists get their information from third parties, tip-offs and so on, and may be unable to <Col N="587" /> properly defend an action for a declaratory judgment without pre-trial discovery.The plaintiff may have documentation of great significance.  Surely the defendant should not have to defend a case against such a plaintiff without discovery?</P>
    <P>A court should be obliged to take a correction order into account when assessing damages.  I note there is no provision for costs in the section dealing with declaratory actions.  It should be made quite clear that, if and when anybody succeeds in getting a declaratory judgment, he or she will also get costs.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains a number of provisions in relation to defences.  For example, it is proposed that the defence of justification be replaced by a new defence of truth.  This appears to be clear, unambiguous and reflects the wording in the pleadings and the charge to the jury.  It should not be necessary for a defendant to prove that what was published was literally true in every detail.  &ldquo;Partial truth&rdquo; is dealt with in section 25, I have grave difficulty with its wording even though I know it comes directly from the Law Reform Commission proposal but, as we will not be taking the Bill in Committee for some nine months, I shall express my reservations then.</P>
    <P>The areas of absolute and qualified privilege have become unnecessarily complicated and are in need of clarification.The proposals here at least carry the merit of clarity.  While I could quibble with their individual details, they constitute a vast improvement on the present position.</P>
    <P>Section 22 replaces the defence of fair comment with a new defence of comment based on fact.  From a reading of this section it is clear that if the defendant cannot sufficiently establish the truth of the fact on which the comment is based, he can still be liable, even if he showed &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo; in trying to ascertain the truth of the facts on which the comment is based but the sanction will be confined to either special damages or a declaratory or corrective <Col N="588" /> order.  Therefore, perhaps it is not as bad as it appears at first sight.  Nevertheless, there should be some explanation in the Bill on what constitutes &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo;; the criteria should be clearly specified.</P>
    <P>Section 26 affords a general defence in relation to stated facts, not comment, to a claim for general damages where an allegation of fact is made if the defendant exercised &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo;.  While an alternative remedy is provided in section 22, section 26 says it is a defence to a claim for general damages.  I take it the intention is that there would still be provision to recover special damages there, and provision for a declaratory and correction order, but that has not been spelled out.  Again, in section 26 &mdash; it is a fairly radical, revolutionary concept &mdash; the circumstances in which &ldquo;reasonable care&rdquo; will be held to exist should be clearly and fully spelled out.</P>
    <P>The most revolutionary aspect of the Bill is the proposal to change the burden of proof.  Defamation is the only area of the law of tort where an essential ingredient of the plaintiff's case does not have to be proved by the plaintiff but rather disproved by the defendant. The general position in tort law is that the person who brings the case, namely, the plaintiff, must prove each and every ingredient of his or her allegation.  Defamation stands as an exception to that because, in the overwhelming majority of cases &mdash; because it is often quite clear what is and is not defamatory &mdash; the most important ingredient in what the plaintiff has to prove does not have to be proved by him at all but rather disproved by the defendant.  That seems to me to be quite illogical, wrong and unfair.  There is an onus on those who seek to support its continuation to clearly explain why; so far, it has not been explained to my satisfaction and I think it should be changed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the views of the minority of the Law Reform Commission about proving negatives etc. That is really more relevant to criminal law where one must prove something <Col N="589" /> beyond reasonable doubt.  We are talking here about the civil law.  In the civil courts, every day of the week, people have to prove that something is true, false, is right or is wrong.</P>
    <P>There is also a misconception that getting rid of the presumption of falsity is in some way shifting, creating another presumption, a presumption of truth.  Of course, that is not the case.  Removing the presumption of falsity does not imply that there will be a presumption that what was said was true.  What is proposed is that the law would merely take a neutral stance and, as in all other areas of tort law, compel the plaintiff who is bringing the action to prove all the ingredients of the tort he or she is alleging.  The present position has caused some difficulty for defendants; here I am not thinking in terms of multinationals or conglomerates but rather of the small, provincial newspapers who may be quite sure, on some occasions, that what they publish is true but may have difficulty in establishing it in court. I know of cases of plaintiffs, who knew very well that what was said was true but who knew also that the defendant could not prove it, have taken an action to court and got settlements; they took the action in the full knowledge that they would not have to give evidence or face cross-examination.  Surely, that is not satisfactory?</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the Bill in relation to printers, publishers and so on.  As far as I can recall, the proposal of the Law Reform Commission was that no liability should attach thereto. That proposal has been modified in the Bill to some extent &mdash; they can be liable if they publish the matter intentionally, knowing it to be defamatory, or if they are &ldquo;recklessly indifferent&rdquo;.  I welcome that provision.  Given the technological advances in printing and distribution it is unreasonable to expect printers and distributors to check all publications which come into their hands for alleged defamatory matter.  I shall conclude because I am sharing my time with two colleagues, to whom I apologise, <Col N="590" /> because I had forgotten until I saw them behind me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will endeavour to get a copy of his remarks in the intervening week.  Some of the provisions of this Bill are radical, requiring careful consideration and examination to ensure that the correct balance is struck, that they do not unduly upset the delicate balance struck in the 1937 Constitution.</P>
      <P>The Law Reform Commission's wide-ranging consultative paper and subsequent report are detailed.  The report suggests changes to our law as the law of defamation is based, in the main, on English common law as it evolved over four centuries.  As the report suggests, the law of defamation is out of date in many respects and fails to respond to the needs of modern Irish society.  That raises the question of what those needs are and what rights and obligations are required to be protected to allow for the constitutional right of freedom of expression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="591" /> The media have changed considerably not only since 1937 but from the passing of the 1961 Defamation Act. Not only has the number of periodicals and newspapers increased, but the expansion of the telecommunications media particularly has been explosive. With sophisticated marketing techniques and media proprietors targeting various sectors of the population, the drive for more sales and deeper penetration is intense.  For a small section of the media that success can only be achieved by being sensational and going for the lowest common denominator.</P>
    <P>I do not have the figures for the number of defamation actions commenced on an annual basis in our courts but it is reasonable to presume they are ever increasing.  I do not put that down to us, as a race, being more litigious, but rather individuals ensuring that their good name and character are vindicated under the law.</P>
    <P>Our Constitution under Article 40.3 states: &ldquo;The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen&rdquo;.  It further states: &ldquo;The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen&rdquo;.However, Article 40.6 guarantees subject to public order and morality certain rights to include the rights of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions subject to certain limitations.Accordingly, a balance must be struck in our laws to reflect the balance in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>One of the concerns I have about this Bill or any other Bill dealing with defamation is that we do not become victims of the same type of abuse as our counterparts in the United Kingdom. While I am aware that the majority of Irish newspapers would never stoop to the same level as the United Kingdom tabloids, we must ensure that those tabloids sold here comply with the highest integrity that is common place in the <Col N="592" /> Irish newspaper industry.  While I do not wish to give the impression that all Irish journalists are saints and should be wearing halos, I want to emphasise that they are a good deal more compassionate, conscientious and considerate than their counterparts across the water.  If there was a way of copperfastening this position, I do not believe anybody here would object to it.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on some of the provisions of the Bill.  The section that abolishes the distinction between libel and slander is non-controversial and accords with the Law Reform Commission's proposal.  As the explanatory memorandum states, section 9 is one of the more wide-ranging proposals of the Bill, namely, that the burden of proof that a statement published was defamatory rests on the plaintiff.  That was a matter of much consideration in the Law Reform Commission's deliberations and no unanimous view prevailed.The decision was three to two in favour of shifting the burden of proof. There is an expression &ldquo;never let the truth stand in the way of a good story&rdquo;. Fortunately, that maxim is not subscribed to by the vast majority of the media.  I agree with the minority position that it is for the defendant to establish the truth of what has been published.As the report states, the person, namely, the defendant who asserts, from his sources of information, that a particular state of affairs exists should bear the burden of proving his assertion. Otherwise a reversal of the onus of proof as suggested in the Bill would result, in effect, in a presumption that anything said of the plaintiff, no matter how damaging, is true.</P>
    <P>Mounting a defamation action for the ordinary layman against an adversary, usually a media proprietor, is not an exercise taken lightly, not least because of the enormous legal costs that would befall an unsuccessful plaintiff.  As is often the case, the balance of establishing a standard of proof is often a very fine line.  As the minority report states, if there is substantial uncertainty <Col N="593" /> on the issue complained of, the provisions of this Bill would ensure that the plaintiff would fail in his efforts to protect his good name because he would not have discharged the onus of proving the falsity of the allegation against him or her on a balance of probabilities.</P>
    <P>Allowing further time for reflection on this most fundamental point is desirable and hopefully will allow for the further generation of suggestions, ideas and reasons for changing the burden of proof.</P>
    <P>I agree with the thrust of sections 13 and 14.  Most people are satisfied with a retraction or correction.  The provisions, as drafted, appear balanced and reasonable.However, on reading the Bill I do not know if the proviso suggested in the report of the Law Reform Commission is retained, namely, it shall not be a defence to a claim for general damages in a defamation action that the defendant made a timely and conspicuous retraction of the alleged defamatory allegation, but the court should be entitled to take the publication of any such retraction into account in assessing the damages to which the plaintiff is entitled.  That needs to be clarified as in many instances, despite correction or retraction, the damage to a person's reputation cannot be undone and damages are a proper remedy.  Possibly section 27 covers that point.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 8 which provides a speedy remedy to a person who wants his or her good name vindicated without the additional remedy of damages. While most people will want damages, section 8 provides a speedy remedy to put the record straight and waste no more time or money in pursuing a full defamation action.</P>
    <P>Section 26 provides that damages shall not be paid where a defendant establishes to the satisfaction of a court that before publication of the matter complained of he or she exercised reasonable care in attempting to ascertain the truth of the allegation of fact. In that section the burden of proof is on the author of the alleged defamatory statement.  According to the way the <Col N="594" /> section is drafted, if he or she proves that he or she took reasonable care in attempting to ascertain the truth of that which was published, the onus shifts to the plaintiff to attempt to prove that the author did not take reasonable care. Much of the criticism of the present law is that defamation is a tort of strict liability, that is, at present it is generally no defence for the person who publishes a defamatory statement to show that he or she exercised reasonable care in relation to the publication.</P>
    <P>In the main, I am satisfied with journalistic standards in this country and I do not feel they have been suppressed in any way that is detrimental to the common good and the constitutional rights of citizens to express freely their convictions and opinions.</P>

In July 1989 when the Progressive Democrats were entering Government, the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Programme for Government stated that &ldquo;new laws ... changing the libel laws ... will be introduced&rdquo;.

      <P>I have tried to brief myself on libel and defamation and have got advice on it.  I am glad there is a nine month gestation period which should produce some type of baby at the end of the day. We will all have time to read the Bill.  A definition of defamation is the wrongful publication of a false statement about a person which tends to lower that person in the eyes of right-thinking members of society or tends to hold that person up to hatred, ridicule or contempt or causes that person to be shunned or avoided by right-thinking members of society.  In Opposition we were constantly told how hopeless some of our Bills were.</P>
      <P>Right thinking members of society are to be the ones to decide on whether there is defamation but who will decide who are right thinking people?  Section 6 (2) states:</P>
      <P>Matter shall be considered as injurious to the plaintiff's reputation if it injures his reputation in the eyes of reasonable members of the community.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Who are the wrong thinking members and who are the left thinking members of society?  To understand the definitions one needs to be advised on what defamation and libel is all about.  A balance must be struck on the question of libel. If the Constitution gives the right to free speech it also gives the right to protect one's name.  Where falsehoods are published about a person it is difficult not to feel sorry for that person.  On the other hand if the newspaper is publishing the truth, fails to get witnesses to back it up and ends up in court paying a huge sum in compensation, then the law is wrong in the other direction.</P>
      <P>Irish newspapers in general are good and correct in the way they treat people but one wonders, if freedom is given, whether what happens across the water would eventually creep in here and people would write what they liked, taking away a person's good name.  We should worry more about local newspapers struggling to present a very important facet of life in reporting the local happenings.  Certainly they cannot cope with claims which might be brought against them.  The bigger newspapers, the multi-millionaire group, may be able to stand up to long running claims and people may even forget about proceeding with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to maintain a balance in protecting people.  There has to be a huge distinction drawn between the publication of falsehoods and the truth. When newspapers publish the truth they have all my sympathy; if they publish a falsehood they have to accept the consequences.In Ireland we are inclined to seek compensation for almost everything; when we trip on the pavement we go to court.  We want compensation for our good name.  Subjectively we all feel that is right.  On the other hand, the system of declaratory action is a help in that one can have one's name vindicated.If the paper refuses to publish an <Col N="597" /> apology one cannot seek a declaration and is barred from getting compensation.I wonder about that.  If a newspaper refused to apologise and correct a mistake they put themselves in a position where they should compensate a person.</P>

I would take the example given by Deputy O'Dea where somebody writes out an atrocious apology which the newspapers could not publish.  There should be an onus on the newspaper to publish a correction unless it is prepared to stand over what it has published and then if it comes to a court case and it is fined for publishing incorrect material it must take the consequences.

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> How does one manage to get the balance right?  The American system which newspapers here are keen to adopt has been referred to.  If they can prove an article is of national or public importance they can defend their case.  It is very difficult to figure out what is in the public interest but there are probably examples in legal books in the American courts.  American newspapers are allowed to publish information that normally would not be acceptable if they publish it for the good of the public.  The public should be entitled to know certain information about individuals, groups or, perhaps, companies to protect themselves and not be conned.  If that system was introduced here I am sure newspapers would not feel so threatened.  That a person does not have <Col N="598" /> to prove a statement is false puts pressure on newspapers.  It gives an advantage to a person who wishes to sue a newspaper.  He can say he was defamed and produce people who say they identified him and his character was lowered in their eyes and, therefore, the newspaper may have to pay compensation. On the other hand how does one prove one's innocence?  If the obligation is on me to prove I am not a liar and a cheat how do I do it?  It can be quite difficult if you go from one extreme to the other where newspapers have to prove what they say is true and the plaintiff has to prove he is innocent.  It depends on the accusation.  I do not know how to strike a balance but it will take all of nine months to get that balance right.  In the end I hope the newspapers and investigative journalists will be able to do their work and individuals will have their good names protected.  I realise the issue of balance is very difficult.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> That is the danger, it could be much ado about nothing, but I hope not.  One newspaper was slightly critical of the Minister for not accepting the Bill.  In fairness to him he did what many other Ministers would not do: he accepted it but put a waiting period on it.  This Government is putting a great deal of legislation through, but no matter how much is introduced everyone is asking for more.  The Minister could have shot down the Bill as other Ministers would have done.  I am glad he did not because I realise its importance and what it means to the newspaper industry.  Newspapers have to survive and put their resources into modern technology rather than pay compensation to people who claim extreme damages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not sure compensation is needed when a person's character has been damaged and an apology is published rapidly unless it has done extreme damage.It does not do much for one's character if one has to wait three years <Col N="599" /> for compensation.  There should be a quick method of dealing with such matters.If the newspaper accepts it made a mistake and apologises that is fair enough.  If you get declaratory action rapidly, although courts can be slow, that should be sufficient.  If a newspaper refuses point blank and causes serious damage to a person's character by publishing a malicious falsehood as distinct from the truth, but the person cannot prove it, how can he prove the newspaper did not make a reasonable effort? It may be it telephoned somebody in Timbuktu and got a negative response.</P>
    <P>A question to be considered is whether newspapers should pay out huge sums in compensation.  For a very important person whose business or profession is destroyed compensation is vital.  There should be a quick and fair system for dealing with such issues.  I hope in the nine months remaining we will come up with a detailed study.  I intend briefing myself well now.  To date I did not have an opportunity to weigh up everything.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy McDowell on the work he put into the preparation of this Bill which deals with complicated issues that are in urgent need of attention.  Provincial newspapers, in pursuing a story, are concerned that they may be sued for libel and defamation and it is in that context the Progressive Democrats Party is addressing this matter.  Most of us agree that stories published should be at all times as close as possible to the truth if not the absolute truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some stories in daily and evening newspapers leave a lot to be desired, particularly when referring to politicians.A typical example was the way a member of the European Parliament, while away on business, was recently photographed by the seaside, with no explanation as to the time of day or how many hours the person had worked before going for a swim.  The view was created that this person spent all his time at the seaside.  There is nothing wrong with a person going for a swim after a day's work, but newspapers <Col N="600" /> create the wrong impression and sadly that is what the public believes.  Even though newspaper headlines and photographs may be far removed from reality, people have to live with the consequences.One wonders how people, particularly public representatives, could defend themselves against such media attention.</P>
    <P>We live in an era of technology, when it is possible to fax messages and photographs worldwide.  Libel laws vary from one country to another and the acceptable publication and reporting of cases in America may not be acceptable under our laws.  Recent events here have brought this issue to the fore. Section 43 deals with the question of contempt of court.  It introduces into the law the principle that refusal to disclose the source of published information is not contempt of court except in circumstances where the disclosure is necessary in the interests of justice or national security, or for the prevention of disorder or crime.  It provides that the court has power to compel disclosure only in those limited circumstances. This section deals with an anomaly whereby previously the messenger was taken to task.  It is a pity a journalist was recently taken to court and was released only on a technicality.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party is to be congratulated on preparing a Bill on the basis of various reports from the Law Reform Commission.  We are all aware that the existing position is unsatisfactory.Present law on defamation draws a distinction between libel and slander.  If a defamatory statement is made in so-called permanent form it is libel and if it is made in an impermanent form it is slander.  The idea is to strike a balance between two competing interests, protection of reputation and freedom of speech.</P>
    <P>Judgments in defamation cases are influenced by more than one type of law.  First, they are influenced by the commonly used definition of defamation as quoted by Deputy Browne, that is, the wrongful publication of a false statement about a person which tends to lower that person in the eyes of right-thinking members of society or <Col N="601" /> tends to hold that person up to hatred, ridicule or contempt, or causes that person to be shunned or avoided by right-thinking members of society.  Second, they are influenced by the provisions of the Defamation Act, 1961, and third and most importantly, by Bunreacht na hÉireann which guarantees that the good name of every citizen will be protected from unjust attack and guarantees freedom of expression.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission report on defamation makes a series of recommendations on the subject, many of which are incorporated in the Bill.  They include a proposal to abolish the distinction between libel and slander and the adoption of a more detailed definition of vital terms such as defamation and publication.  It is noteworthy that they also include a vital shift of responsibility from the defendant to the plaintiff in defamation cases.  This created problems for the Minister, Deputy Taylor, and many of us have had an opportunity to discuss the matter with him.</P>
    <P>At present the plaintiff has only to prove that the statement complained of is defamatory; he is not required to prove that it is false.  The law presumes that a defamatory statement is false and it is up to the defendant to prove the statement is true.  The Law Reform Commission was divided in its recommendations on this issue, and that is a matter of concern to the Minister.  A majority felt that the plaintiff should be obliged to prove the falseness of the defamatory statement as well, but a minority objected to this on the grounds that a person should not have to prove his or her innocence in this way.  In the light of this difference of opinion I welcome the Minister's proposal to defer a decision on this Bill for nine months by a proposal that the Bill not be read a Second Time.  This would allow the Minister, and his Department, to carry out extensive research on the matter while giving immediate priority to the vital reforms of family law, a matter which takes up much time of the Department at present.</P>
    <P>I note with interest the way the definition of defamation has been widened by the Law Reform Commission <Col N="602" /> report.  &ldquo;Publication&rdquo; is given the broader definition of &ldquo;the intentional or negligent communication of defamatory matter to at least one person other than the plaintiff&rdquo;.  In an age when communications are becoming increasingly sophisticated our laws must cover every possible outlet for publicity.  Technology advances beam sounds and images around the globe every second of the day, and the law should be flexible enough to protect citizens from infringement of their rights.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister, Deputy Taylor, that it is appropriate to consider alternative remedies in defamation actions, the principal one relating to damages.  The current awards of damages paid in defamation cases are high and new legislation should outline clearly the circumstances where such awards should be made.  I understand &mdash; perhaps someone will clarify this for me &mdash; that the Progressive Democrats Party has agreed to accept the Minister's motion.  I am glad the Bill was not voted down, that there will be further discussion on this matter and that we will have an opportunity to amend the Bill on Committee Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise with the Minister the extremely worrying reports in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i> that public money was allocated to Ministers' constituencies.  It is reported that £2.1 million in public money was earmarked in last week's budget for a variety of projects on what Civil Service sources describe as a &ldquo;political list&rdquo; drawn up by key Government Ministers.The reports state that, according to sources, these budget sweeteners were included at the behest of Ministers.According to the evidence, Labour Ministers, who have a direct line to the Minister for Finance, have fared <Col N="603" /> much better than their Fine Gael and Democratic Left colleagues.</P>
      <P>The evidence supporting these claims is manifestly clear.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, has been given £390,000 for his constituency, which includes £40,000 for the Cambridge Boy's Football Club at Irishtown.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, has been given £200,000, £100,000 of which is for an athletics track in Castleisland.  I note that there are no grants for south Kerry. The Minister of State to the Government, Deputy Rabbitte, and the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, have managed to get £50,000 for St. Mark's Football Club. That is not the end of the list.  I have no doubt all these organisations are worthy of support but I am worried about the criteria used in the selection of these projects.  When the Ministers were in Opposition they often referred to the need to apply objective criteria when allocating resources to projects.  This point also arose in the context of the allocation of national lottery funds.</P>
      <P>I welcomed the consensus which was emerging on the need to end this type of stroke politics and genuinely thought we were moving in this direction.  Given the high moral ground stance adopted by the Government, I was greatly taken aback to hear about these political strokes, the most blatant form of clientism we have seen and which cost more than £2 million.  It is clear that the Government has set up a slush fund in an effort to buy votes in various constituencies on the basis that it is seen to deliver on the ground.</P>
      <P>However, I hope the Minister will not use the argument that the same thing happened in the past.  I know it did but I have never seen such an obvious example of stroke politics during my time in Dáil Éireann.  I have never agreed with this kind of politics, which does not win votes among the public who are cynical about this type of dependency culture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put a number of questions <Col N="604" /> to the Minister.  There is a large community in Whitechurch, Ballyboden, in my constituency.  This area has a large population of young children, many of whose parents are on low incomes or are unemployed.  For some time St. Joseph's Youth Club, Ballyboden, has been trying to get financial support to build a sports hall to cater for the recreational needs of local children.  The miserly sum of £10,000 which it received from the national lottery under the previous Government &mdash; obviously my lobbying did not work &mdash; was not adequate, and even though it has raised additional funding it still does not have enough money to proceed with the work.  Is this project less deserving than those in the Ministers' constituencies?  If objective criteria were applied in the allocation of funding, how would this project compare with others?  Why were the projects in the Ministers' constituencies not funded under the national lottery, as happens in the case of all other local sports and recreational projects?  I have no problem with heritage or cultural projects which are of national significance.Were these projects pulled out of the hat merely because they had a ministerial tag on them?  It is time this type of behaviour in Government was ended once and for all.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  The Deputy will be aware that it has been the custom and practice to include provision in the budget for funding for a small number of worthwhile projects of a social, cultural and-or sporting nature.  This practice has been followed by successive Governments for many years.  While the budget may be regarded as radical in many respects, nobody could accuse it of breaking new ground in relation to this longstanding practice.  All of the projects included in the budget were chosen on their merits and on the basis of objective judgment of the valuable social and economic benefits which they would bring to local communities and voluntary groups.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to which the Deputy <Col N="606" /> refers suggests that decisions on the projects included in the budget were made on the basis of purely political considerations.I categorically deny this suggestion.While individual Ministers may have brought particular projects to the attention of the Minister for Finance, final decisions on the projects to be included were made only after careful consideration of the potential economic and social benefits which would derive from them.</P>
      <P>The amount of £2.15 million provided for these projects in the budget is very small in overall budgetary terms and accounts for less than 1 per cent of the total net additional spending of £220.5 million announced in the budget.  The amounts allocated to individual projects are also small, ranging from as little as £5,000 in the case of Ballintubber Abbey to just £250,000 in the case of the Famine commemoration projects.</P>

      <P>The Government is satisfied that the provision of funding at what can only be described as a minimal level is justified by reference to the considerable benefits which will accrue from the projects in question.</P>
      <P>I am not clear if the Deputy has a difficulty with any of the projects in particular.As I have already indicated, the Government is satisfied that each of the projects has value and merit in its own right, irrespective of the constituency in which it happens to be located.  As the article in <i>The Irish Times</i> rightly points out, many of the projects are not location-based and relate to a particular activity or group which has national coverage.  For example, the grant of £25,000 in aid of the Special Olympics, the grant of £50,000 to the Irish Countrywomen's Association&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the projects supported in this year's budget will benefit groups, communities and individuals from socially and economically disadvantaged backgrounds.  The modest level of funding provided will go a long way towards helping those individuals and communities to tackle the many problems which they face.</P>
      <P>Although the projects are all listed under the heading Sporting, Cultural and Social Projects, it should be remembered that many of them are tourism related and will bring much-needed economic benefits and jobs to many parts of the country.</P>
      <P>It is wrong to suggest that the projects listed for special funding in the budget were included for any reason other than genuine merit as socially, culturally and economically beneficial projects in their own right.  Furthermore, the suggestion that the inclusion of such projects is in any way unique to this budget or this Government is totally misleading.  It has long been the practice that additional funding is provided on budget day for special projects under the sporting, social or cultural headings.  I cannot speculate on the basis on which previous Governments may have selected their special projects, but I can assure the Deputy, if he is interested, that the projects included in this year's budget were selected entirely on merit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Up until last Saturday I viewed the concern about the incidence of meningitis as a politician and as my party's spokesperson on health but it was brought into sharp focus when my 15 year-old child arrived home from boarding school having suffered from a severe and violent headache with severe joint pain and a high fever&mdash; three of the symptoms one would associate with meningitis &mdash; for a period of seven hours.</P>
      <P>Unlike most parents, I telephoned my GP who gave me strong advice as to what I should do.  Thankfully, it was a viral flu which is prevalent throughout the country at present.  The vast majority of parents are not contacting their GP, rather they are presenting their children at the casualty unit of their local hospital.  The problem in Dublin has received widespread publicity although it is being experienced in the casualty unit of every hospital in the country.  Those who need immediate attention have to wait in the queue with everyone else who presents themselves at a hospital.  I appreciate the concern about the symptoms of meningitis but everyone has to wait longer, even when some cases are more urgent than others.</P>
      <P>All of us realise at this stage that the issue of meningitis is emotive and frightening.Parents who present a child with some or all of the symptoms are concerned that they receive attention immediately and it should be available. The timing is critical as is the question of what should be done to deal with the problem.  There are more cases than one would expect at this time of the year. We have to ensure quickly that the medical profession recognises what it is dealing with, be it bacterial, of which there are many varieties, or viral meningitis.We also have to ensure that parents and the public in general are made aware of and recognise the symptoms and take the appropriate action.  Prompt action is needed by both the medical profession and parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many children are kept at home with a high temperature, a scratchy throat, fever, vomiting, aching joints and so on <Col N="609" /> which are some of the symptoms associated with meningitis.  We need to alert parents to the fact that children would also be sensitive to bright light and have a definite rash.  Parents who are concerned should contact their general practitioner and present the child at the local hospital, but the warning signs have to be recognised.  Above all, we need to reassure parents.</P>
    <P>In this regard I wish to make two proposals to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, for presentation to the Minister.During the months of December, January and February, the crucial and dangerous months, the Health Promotion Unit of the Department of Health should conduct a publicity campaign in the national and local media to indicate to parents that this is a time of danger, to explain the symptoms in great detail and to outline the action they need to take.  This should be done as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>We do not have a national communicable diseases surveillance unit or centre.They have a good model in the United Kingdom.  Although it may not be possible to do this in the immediate future a policy decision should be taken by the Minister to establish such a centre, possibly within the Department of Health.  It would not involve huge costs or elaborate buildings but the centre ought to be able to avail of medical and nursing skills.</P>

Without being contentious or argumentative on this, I wish to say that perhaps on other occasions the Minister for Health and his Department failed to respond <Col N="610" /> adequately.  We should have immediately conducted a nationwide advertising campaign in the printed media, on radio and television to get the message across and explain the symptoms.  We should not have depended on the media to publish the information.  In the future we should be prepared for such an outbreak in order to save lives.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn for providing this opportunity to place on record the current situation about meningococcal meningitis.</P>
      <P>I repeat the assurance my colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, gave to the Seanad on Thursday last, that the incidence of the disease, which has been reported to the Department of Health by the health boards, is more or less the same as in previous years and as such does not constitute an epidemic or an unusual nationwide outbreak.  The Eastern Health Board, in whose area most of the cases occurred recently, has also confirmed that there is no epidemic of the disease but that there is a higher incidence than usual in the north Dublin area.  In addition, Temple Street Children's Hospital has confirmed that the meningitis infections which were confirmed in children admitted there recently were not of a single strain.  This reinforces the view that cases are not connected and that the disease has not reached epidemic proportions.</P>
      <P>The information from the monitoring of the disease shows that its incidence is running at approximately the same level as in previous years.  A total of 225 cases were reported in 1992; a total of 203 cases in 1993 and 239 cases in 1994.  For the period between 4 November 1994 and 11 February 1995, a total of 105 cases have been notified to the Department, compared with 84 cases during the same period last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department, and the health boards, are very vigilant about the surveillance of meningococcal meningitis and operate a comprehensive system for monitoring its incidence.  Under guidelines issued by the Department to the health boards, measures are in place to <Col N="611" /> monitor the disease at local level, at national level and at the level of individual cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>Following media reports of an epidemic of the disease in parts of Dublin, the Eastern Health Board issued a press statement on Saturday, 4 February confirming there was no major epidemic of meningitis in the area.  In this regard, the board stated that any reference to &ldquo;an epidemic&rdquo; was purely technical, in that there was an unusually high number of cases within a specified area and a specified period of time.  The cases occurred in different parts of north Dublin, which has a population of 400,000.</P>
      <P>My colleague, Deputy Currie, indicated to the Seanad on Thursday last that the incidence of meningococcal meningitis reported to the Department in recent months has not risen above its normal level.  However, the occurrence of five deaths from the disease during a relatively short period in January of this year is unusual and a cause for concern. I sympathise with the bereaved families and I am sure Members of this House join me in this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of these deaths, my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, took special measures to alert health professionals and parents about possible cases of the disease, as early diagnosis and treatment are essential for a complete recovery.  On 17 January 1995, the deputy chief medical officer of <Col N="612" /> the Department wrote to each director of community care requesting them to ensure that information concerning the disease is as widely available as possible to parents; that doctors should be extra vigilant in their assessment of patients, bearing the possibility of meningitis in mind, and that preventive measures be implemented as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The directors of community care were also asked that the leaflet prepared by the Department's health promotion unit on meningitis should be promoted appropriately in each community care area, for example, through schools, health centres and local health board offices.</P>
    <P>In addition, directors of community care were reminded of the necessity for early and comprehensive notification of cases of meningococcal meningitis to the Department so that any unusual incidence of the disease nationally could be quickly identified and appropriate action taken.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health also issued a press statement on 17 January 1995, which was carried on television, radio and the newspapers, advising parents and teachers they they should be aware of the symptoms of meningitis and to bring children to their general practitioners if worried.  Doctors were advised they should be extra vigilant in relation to cases or suspected cases, as early diagnosis and treatment is vital for a successful outcome in individual cases.</P>
    <P>A further letter was issued to the health boards by the Department on 31 January 1995, requesting the health boards to disseminate the health promotion unit's leaflet on meningitis, towards informing the public and professionals such as doctors, nurses and teachers who come into regular contact with children, of the symptoms of the disease, the treatment of cases or suspected cases of the disease and the prevention of infection in contacts of cases or suspected cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stressed the need for early detection and intervention on a television news bulletin that day.  In addition, the print media, radio and television provided excellent support and co-operation to the Department in <Col N="613" /> publicising information about the condition and the steps to be taken by parents, teachers and guardians of children.</P>
    <P>A free telephone helpline has been in operation in the Eastern Health Board since 3 February 1995, in order to give information, advice and reassurance to worried members of the public.  The helpline, which initially operated from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., is now operating from 9 a.m. to 5.30 p.m., Monday to Friday, and an answering machine service is in operation outside of these hours.  The level of concern among parents about the disease was demonstrated by the fact that 2,500 persons made calls to the Eastern Health Board on the first day of the helpline and this is now averaging ten to 12 calls a day.</P>
    <P>The necessary measures were therefore taken by the Minister, the Department and the health boards to inform the public about the current incidence of the disease and, in particular, about the need for vigilance for early symptoms and the importance of early treatment in ensuring a complete recovery.</P>
    <P>Finally, I reiterate that the current incidence of meningococcal meningitis is not unusual but this is not to say we should be complacent.  Parents, teachers and others dealing with children should familiarise themselves with the symptoms of this very serious disease and if they are worried they should consult their general practitioner as soon as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision of An Bord Pleanála in relation to Luggala is a landmark one in terms of content and tenor.  It is also a <Col N="614" /> decision that will inevitably form a precedent in respect of all future planning decisions in matters of this nature.  If the landscape of Luggala is adjudged to be of such great national importance, how much more important, precious and unique is the landscape of the Burren?</P>
    <P>If the proposed development currently under consideration by Clare County Council is given planning permission by that body, that decision will inevitably be appealed to An Bord Pleanála.It is reasonable to assume that if An Bord Pleanála is consistent with its decision in regard to Luggala, the decision by Clare County Council will be overturned and the appeal will be upheld.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to intervene at this stage and withdraw the Government application currently before Clare County Council.  If the Minister does that, it will avert further squandering of public moneys.  I am also asking the Minister to ensure that steps are taken immediately to restore the landscape at Luggala to its original condition.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works stands condemned for the manner in which it proceeded in relation to Luggala.  It knew it had no legal right to do what was done but nevertheless it proceeded with the work to the tune of £1.6 million.An additional £400,000 will now have to be provided by the taxpayers to undo the damage that has been done to Luggala.  The lesson from that surely is that the Office of Public Works must be stopped in its tracks in relation to Mul-laghmore.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to anticipate any future decision An Bord Pleanála might make in respect of this type of development, to intervene now and to call a halt to what is happening at Mullaghmore.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Following controversy in relation to these centres which led to a Supreme Court judgement in May 1993, that the <Col N="615" /> State is not exempt from the requirements to seek full planning permission, the then Government decided, in June 1993, that a process of public consultation should be conducted by the Office of Public Works, following which the then Minister of State in charge of that Office would decide the course of action to be taken.  As the Deputy knows, his decision was to apply for planning permission for slightly altered proposals in the three cases and the present position is as follows: in the case of the Boyne Valley, planning permission was granted by Meath County Council and upheld by An Bord Pleanála; in the case of Luggala, planning permission was granted by Wicklow County Council but rejected by An Bord Pleanála; and in the case of Mullaghmore, the planning application is still under consideration by Clare County Council.</P>
    <P>The policy agreement between the three parties forming the present Government states: &ldquo;The future of the proposed Interpretative Centres at Mullaghmore, Luggala and the Boyne Valley will be a decision by the incoming Government&rdquo;.  As Minister responsible for heritage matters, it will be for me to bring recommendations in relation to each of the three centres to Government and I will be doing this in the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The decision of An Bord Pleanála on 13 February 1995 to refuse planning permission for the proposed centre at Luggala and, in particular the grounds on which this decision was based, are very significant and have a bearing on the possible options which could and should be considered for that site or in the choice of an alternative site.  That decision must also be taken into account in my consideration of the Mullaghmore case.  My officials are looking into the technical aspects of the case but, as I have said, I will be putting proposals to Government in the coming weeks in regard to the policy which should be adopted in each of the three cases.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that Deputy Coveney is but a short time in office and I wish him well in his work, but he must have known that the cold-blooded and clinical statement given on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; yesterday was bound to create a furore in Army circles.  Not even the carefully crafted statement issued in <i>The Irish Independent</i> today, which unravelled during the day, eased the situation.  Hence, just a few hours ago, we heard another television broadcast by the Minister in which he indicated that the Taoiseach would bring forward a memorandum on the review of the Defence Forces, and perhaps even heightened tensions by indicating that there would be no closures until after a period of three years. In so doing he has hung the sword of Damocles over all the Army barracks. That time span will bring us beyond the next general election.</P>
      <P>Is this the way to treat loyal servants of the State who served with distinction at home and abroad, who have raised national morale and brought prestige to this country by their work in peacekeeping operations in far away places in difficult times, from the Congo in 1958 to the Lebanon today?  The Minister must without preconditions immediately enter into negotiations and consultation with everyone concerned and take the closure of barracks and the substantial reduction in the Army off the agenda. We would be glad to support that kind of dialogue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="617" /> The social and economic impact of the closure of barracks would be great. In Kilkenny there are 400 Army personnel generating a £6.5 million wage bill in a year.  At Kickham Barracks, with which the Ceann Comhairle is familiar, there are 300 Army personnel with a wage bill of £4.5 million.  That is what we are talking about.</P>

      <P>People in the Army barracks at Longford and in Mullingar have been agitated since the Minister, or someone on his behalf, spoke on Shannonside Radio yesterday and since his intentions have been made public in media reports. There is great disquiet in those towns.  I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to the folly on which he has embarked.</P>
      <P>Army barracks bestow social distinction and status on a town and generate much business, and there is a sense of pride among the personnel who work there.  I make my case straight-forwardly, as our spokesman on Defence has done.  The Minister should tread warily.  He has proven business methods but this is not the way to run the Defence Forces.  I plead again with the Minister not to touch Longford or Mullingar.</P>

    <P>I refer the Minister to Leo Murphy barracks in Ballincollig.  I am aware of the Minister's wish to keep that barracks open on the basis of a commitment given by him at a dinner there which we both attended at Christmas time.  I will not play politics with the Minister on this issue because he was in Opposition then and things change when one assumes the mantle of power. There are 180 people employed in that barracks.  The first field artillery battalion is based there, as is the industrial <Col N="618" /> munitions dump.  It is the training centre for the FCA in the southern command. It is an integral part of the town.  The population are proud of the barracks. Closing it would be like taking a major industry out of the fastest growing town outside of Tallaght and would have devastating effects on the economy.  I exhort the Minister to ensure that this barracks is kept open in the interests of us all.  Only today I spoke to Army members on the telephone and they are really afraid for their jobs and their livelihood in Ballincollig and are depending on the Minister to keep the barracks in our constituency open.</P>

      <P>I thank the Deputies opposite for their good wishes.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to clarify the present situation regarding the review of the Defence Forces by the Efficiency Audit Group.</P>
      <P>The Efficiency Audit Group, EAG, was established in 1988 to examine various Government Departments with a view to recommending practices and methods which would improve effectiveness and efficiency.  The group comprises senior figures from the public service, trade unions and the private sector. In 1993, the EAG was asked to carry out a comprehensive review of the Defence Forces.</P>
      <P>The Efficiency Audit Group submitted its report to the Department of the Taoiseach in late December.  The report has not yet been considered by Government. Accordingly, no decisions concerning the future of the Defence Forces have been taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This review did not commence out of the blue.  It was initiated for very good reasons when the Deputies' party was in Government.  It is widely accepted that there is something fundamentally wrong with the structure of the Defence Forces and that there is a need for change.  This was accepted by the Opposition when they were in Government.  It has also been accepted by the military authorities, by the military representative associations and by the Government. There is scope for debate as to the possible solutions, but there is no denying <Col N="619" /> the nature and extent of the fundamental problem.</P>
    <P>In many ways, the conclusions reached by the EAG and its consultants, Price Waterhouse, were predictable. Over four years ago, the report of the Gleeson commission highlighted serious shortcomings in the structure of the Defence Forces.  Similarly, the problems regarding the rising age profile have been the source of public debate for some time.  In 1993, the Government issued a revised statement of roles for the Defence Forces which re-emphasised the need to focus on the effective performance of operational tasks.  Given the acknowledged need for reform, it is in the interests of the country and of the Defence Forces that these issues be addressed.</P>
    <P>Before action of any kind can be contemplated on foot of the recommendations of the EAG, it will be necessary to establish an implementation group to prepare a fully costed implementation plan for phase 1 of the proposals.  This first phase, covering a period of three years, will not involve the closure of a single barracks.  It will concentrate instead on the more fundamental issues in the recommendations.  I will not, therefore, be presiding over the closure of any barracks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am committed to ensuring that any reforms will be implemented in a planned and sensitive manner.  There will be no compulsory redundancies. <Col N="620" /> There will be consultations with the representative associations, commencing next week, in accordance with the agreed system of representation.  Where changes are required, they will be introduced as part of a comprehensive programme and at a realistic pace.</P>
    <P>I am determined to tackle in a positive way the many problems confronting our Defence Forces e.g. the rising age profile, the imbalance between pay and non-pay spending, poor equipment, the excessive numbers working in civilian type jobs.  If these and other problems are not tackled, then the operational capacity of the Defence Forces will be seriously eroded.  Therefore a &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; approach is neither a realistic nor a responsible option.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to emphasise that the review process, which predates by several years my arrival in the Department of Defence, was not undertaken as an exercise in book-keeping.  On the contrary, Price Waterhouse, a leading international firm of management consultants, which included eminent Canadian military experts, conducted an in-depth analysis of all aspects of the Defence Forces.  In addition, the EAG was separately advised by a leading expert in military re-organisation from New Zealand. Senior officers of the Irish Defence Forces also participated actively in the study and are largely in agreement with its recommendations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The job creation target for 1995 set by my Department is embodied in the overall target of 20,000 new jobs per annum set out in the <i>Operational Programme for Industry 1994-99</i> recently <Col N="432" /> published by me.  This target was exceeded by the development agencies under my aegis in 1994.  I am confident that they will maintain this excellent performance in 1995 and indeed over the remainder of the period.</P>
    <P>My Department has not set any specific industry targets for 1995 but is in consultation with the development agencies on an ongoing basis in relation to their objectives and targets for employment creation in specific sectors, which clearly take into account medium-term development plans for these sectors.</P>
    <P>In relation to job opportunities for young people and school leavers, I would emphasise that the fundamental objective of the operational programme for industrial development is to maximise the number of self-sustaining job opportunities in manufacturing and international services for the labour force as a whole.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I have to point out that job creation in the manufacturing and services sector is clearly facilitated and encouraged by the overall business environment in which projects are operating, which has been the fundamental rationale in the strategy of the recent budget.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in this year's budget is on employment and growth.  In the budget, the Government introduced measures to address the main constituents of the tax wedge.  We have introduced a substantial allowance for employee PRSI and have raised the standard tax band and personal allowance for income tax significantly.  As a result of these measures, for a large number of employers, the cost of employing people will fall by three per cent.  I would expect that these changes would be of significant benefit to young people and school leavers in opening up new employment opportunities to them.</P>
    <P>One very important potential of job opportunities for young people lies in the services sector.  Indeed the service sector of the economy has shown strong growth for the past number of years and employment in the sector now stands at <Col N="433" /> 60 per cent of total employment.  The Government's commitment to continue to push down the corporation profits tax rate to levels comparable with those of overseas competitors will give a further major boost to job creation in the services sector.</P>
    <P>Increasing employment opportunities for school leavers and young people will require an increased focus on training and upskilling generally.  I have already indicated to the House that the national Youthstart programme, which covers employment and training opportunities for unqualified school leavers in the 18-21 age group, will be reviewed as part of the work currently under way on the White Paper on Training.</P>

      <P>The composition of county enterprise boards represents a partnership between elected representatives, State agency personnel, the social partners at local level and local business and voluntary sector interests.  I should point out that the enterprise plans to be prepared by the county enterprise boards for their areas are intended to provide a clear statement of the priority enterprise goals and sectoral objectives relevant to the local economy.  Already a number of boards have acknowledged the significance of the development of quality crafts and design skills, and of vibrant cultural and art enterprises in their areas.  These enterprise plans have identified specific measures to develop both sectors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 18 together.</P>
      <P>In September 1993, the former Minister for Labour requested the Health and Safety Authority to conduct a comprehensive review of safety in the Irish chemical industry.  A chemical industry inspection programme has been under way since January 1994 and, when complete, will have covered a total of 117 companies involved in the manufacture, processing and storage of pharmaceutical products, fine chemicals and other chemicals.</P>
      <P>Under the programme the authority is investigating the following issues:</P>
      <P>whether potential accident hazards are identified, with particular reference to:</P>
      <P>&mdash; exothermic reactions;</P>
      <P>&mdash; dust explosions.</P>
      <P>whether preventative and safety measures are in place with special attention to:</P>
      <P>&mdash; the design of plant and operation of processes, controls and back-up safety systems;</P>
      <P>&mdash; management capability and understanding of the process chemistry and thermo chemistry associated with their processes and operating procedures, in both automated and non-automated plant;</P>
      <P>&mdash; maintenance of plant and equipment;</P>
      <P>&mdash; chemical inventories, storage and transport;</P>
      <P>&mdash; add-on environmental protective systems.</P>
      <P>whether employees are provided with information, training and equipment to ensure safety.</P>
      <P>whether there are emergency arrangements and liaison with local emergency services.</P>
      <P>whether adequate information is available to the local population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> It is the intention of this programme that the advice and recommendations of the specialist inspectors involved will contribute, in an ongoing manner, to improve safety levels at the plants concerned in the future.  The inspection programme is expected to be concluded by the end of the third quarter of 1995 at which point the board of the authority will be advised of the outcome. Having regard to the functions and powers conferred on the authority under the health and safety legislation the question of any further action required to be taken at that stage would be a matter for that body.</P>
    <P>It is not intended that a report will be published on the specific matters being addressed as part of this inspection programme.However, summary details of enforcement action taken will be included in the annual report of the Health and Safety Authority which, in accordance with normal practice, will be presented to both Houses of the Oireachtas on publication.</P>

      <P>I have noted the Deputy's suggestion, and will bear it in mind in the context of my ongoing review of general policy in relation to the county enterprise initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should say that the assistance suggested by the Deputy would amount to grant assistance for certain forms of working capital, in contrast with the fixed capital to which county enterprise board capital grants may currently attach.  In view of the somewhat intangible quality of the objects to which a <Col N="437" /> working capital grant would apply, I would have to be very satisfied that a move in this direction represented a good use of limited Exchequer funds, having regard in particular to the objectives of the county enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>On that point, Deputies may be aware of the fact that the county enterprise boards are already in a position to assist small business start-ups and expansions by means of employment grants.  These are a specialised form of working capital grant specifically addressing a central objective of the county enterprise initiative &mdash; the creation of sustainable jobs in small businesses at local level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 23 and 64 together.</P>
      <P>The county enterprise boards have been operating subject to interim guidelines since they were set up in late 1993. Since establishment, their operations have largely been confined to the provision of grants for small businesses starting up or expanding.  Based on returns supplied by the 35 county enterprise boards for 1994, their first full year of operation, some 1,776 full-time and 263 part-time jobs were created at a total cost of around £5 million paid in grants from the Exchequer. In view of the interim, start-up nature of their operation to date, I am satisfied with this performance by the boards and would expect to see it enhanced in future years by the wider range of enterprise development supports which will be available to the boards under the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, 1994-99.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="439" /> Under the Operational Programme, which was launched by the Taoiseach on 2 February 1995, the county enterprise boards will be able to avail of Structural Funds supports for their current range of activities and for additional activities, including the provision of advice, counselling and mentoring supports for small business start-ups and expansions.</P>
    <P>In order to enable them to avail fully of these opportunities, I am pressing ahead with arrangements to establish the county enterprise boards as independent, locally-controlled enterprise development companies, limited by guarantee, in accordance with an agenda for local enterprise developed in their county enterprise plans.</P>
    <P>These changes, when effected, will meet the submissions made to me, in the main by the CEBs themselves, calling for a wider and more independent remit for the boards.  I should also mention the recommendation of the Task Force on Small Business that the CEBs should form the administrative base of a national business information network catering for small business.  This is entirely consistent with the expanded role of the CEBs which I have already outlined.  I am examining proposals for the implementation of this recommendation.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise boards were established to promote local enterprise within their functional areas.  However, they do not operate in isolation from each other.  The boards have been urged to consider the prospects for developing co-operation in the form of networking between themselves, between the boards and other agencies and between the boards and my Department.  The boards are also expected to maintain contact with each other relating to their common mandate; to share ideas; to assist each other in solving problems as they arise, particularly where counties are contiguous; and in the promotion of trans-county initiatives.</P>
    <P>Overall co-ordination and supervision of the county enterprise boards is exercised by my Department.  The main <Col N="440" /> State development agencies under my Department's aegis, including Forbairt and SFADCo, are represented on the boards and their evaluation committees, which are obliged to have regard to the requirements of the operational programme so as to identify activities most likely to be &ldquo;additional&rdquo; and to avoid any which would depend on taking market share from existing businesses in order to survive.  At national level, the Interdepartmental Committee on Local Development, on which my Department is represented, and the Monitoring Committees of the Community Support Framework and the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, on both of which my Department will also be represented, will be concerned to maximize the effectiveness of the various local development initiatives now in place so as to ensure maximum job creation and to minimize difficulties, such as displacement.</P>

      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that the subject matter of the conference he refers to extends considerably beyond the remit of my Department.  He will also wish to know that the venue for the conference has been switched from Philadelphia to Washington and is now scheduled to take place from 24 to 26 May 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the conference is being organised primarily by the United States, officials from my Department together with representatives of IDA Ireland and <Col N="442" /> Forbairt recently met the US assistant secretary for international economic policy, Mr. Charles Meissner, who was accompanied by representatives from the US Embassies in London and Dublin to discuss details of the conference. Mr. Meissner also met officials of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Tourism and Trade, representatives of a number of county enterprise boards, county councillors and numerous other interested parties from the Border counties and Northern Ireland.  Further meetings are planned with the USA representatives including one later this week when I am meeting Senator George Mitchell who has been charged by President Clinton with co-ordinating the Washington conference.</P>
    <P>Of the three main topics likely to be focused on at the conference &mdash; investment, trade and tourism &mdash; my Department is most interested in all aspects of foreign direct investment.  Inward investment, particularly by US companies, has been crucial to this country's economic success in recent years.  My Department will be co-ordinating the contributions of the industrial development agencies to the conference. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, the conference has a much wider remit. In this regard the Department of Foreign Affairs is co-ordinating the Irish Government's input into the conference and is in regular contact with the relevant offices in the USA and Northern Ireland.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Our pre-tax prices are higher than the European average according to a recent EU survey.The Fair Trade Commission's 1990 <Col N="443" /> report of its inquiry into the supply and distribution of motor fuels pointed out that a comparison of Irish prices with the average of all other European prices was unlikely to be valid because of differences in product quality, the intervention of government in certain EU countries through price control mechanisms and the existence of a &ldquo;Mediterranean&rdquo; market and a &ldquo;North West European&rdquo; market, with countries which are further from the Middle East tending to pay higher prices.</P>
      <P>The Commission's report also suggested that our geographical location, where product had to be shipped from a refinery in the UK in small vessels, was another factor contributing to our higher imported prices.</P>
      <P>In my capacity as Minister for Enterprise and Employment I am, of course, concerned that prices to Irish business and consumers should be as competitive as possible.  In this connection, I would draw the Deputy's attention to the policy agreement for Government which provides for the strengthening of competition law by giving the Competition Authority powers of enforcement and enabling the courts to impose fines on those found to be engaging in unfair competition.  It is my hope to proceed with these proposals as soon as possible.  I am also drawing up a list of areas where competitive forces might operate more effectively.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the years <Col N="444" /> there has tended to be a significant disparity in the sustained cost per job for overseas and indigenous industry, although in recent years there has been a noticeable closing of the gap.  The most recent figures show that the cost per job sustained in Forbairt companies in the period 1988-94 was £9,930 at constant 1994 prices, while that for IDA Ireland companies was £12,786.</P>
      <P>To the extent that Forbairt attempts to achieve repayability and value for money in assisting indigenous companies, in line with the Culliton recommendations endorsed by the Government, this would tend to reduce the net cost to the Exchequer of these jobs <i>vis-á-vis</i> jobs in overseas companies.</P>
      <P>The overall higher cost per job figure for overseas industry reflects the fact that IDA Ireland operates in an intensely competitive world market for mobile investment and that foreign industry projects tend to be more capital intensive reflecting a higher level of technology and associated cost.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, the cost per job for foreign industry is a function of the IDA having to pay the &ldquo;going rate&rdquo; to secure projects, a point the Culliton report also recognised.  However, I would emphasise that State financial support for inward investment is not given at the expense of support for the development of indigenous industry which is the primary focus of industrial policy.  The commitment to the development of indigenous industry is reflected in the resources being allocated to indigenous industry in the new operational programme for industrial development which I announced recently.  Over the period of the programme, 1994 to 1999, funding to improve the capabilities of indigenous industry will be increased by 29 per cent compared to the previous programme, whereas spending on inward investment will decline by 18 per cent.</P>

      <P>Previous national reviews of science and technology were carried out by the OECD on our behalf.  When considering the present review, different possibilities were examined, including: using the OECD again; doing it within the Department; employing outside consultants; or, establishing an independent group of experts from Irish industry, the third level and State sectors.</P>
      <P>The Government decided in October 1993 to select the last option and STIAC was established in February 1994.  Its terms of reference were to undertake a fundamental review of the policies, objectives, structures and components of the science and technology system in Ireland and to make recommendations about changes to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of the national science and technology system in contributing to national economic development.</P>
      <P>It is not unusual to appoint non-statutory groups to review policy issues, the advantage being to have independent expert input and a strategic overview of policy, detached from the day-to-day functions of statutory agencies.  Such an arrangement complements and supports the advice available from Departments and executive agencies.  The Culliton report, for example, resulted from a similar exercise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to recent disputes that arose, in the main, as a result of rationalisation/restructuring measures which were by their very nature extremely complex and sensitive.  The State's dispute-settling bodies, the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court worked well and effectively with a view to bringing about resolutions to these disputes.  The fact that it was not possible to achieve earlier settlements in these instances could not be attributed to these bodies.  Dealing with such complex issues as restructuring and change on a large scale is more difficult, if not addressed in good time by firms and their workforces and with the optimum involvement of the workforces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that, ultimately, responsibility for good industrial relations and dispute resolution in any organisation lies primarily with its management, employees and unions.  In order to improve industrial relations at the level of the workplace, the Labour Relations Commission has set up an advisory service to assist management and unions to develop good industrial relations policies, practices and procedures.The service has helped a number of public and private sector enterprises to improve the ways in which they conduct their industrial relations and I would encourage its use by management and unions.  To build on the valuable work done by the advisory service, I am in the process of allocating additional resources to it.  For its part, I understand that the Irish Congress of <Col N="447" /> Trade Unions is reviewing its procedures in the light of difficulties that arose in recent high-profile disputes.  I welcome this initiative and await its outcome with interest.</P>
    <P>The Government recognises the need for the greater involvement of, and participation by, both employers and employees in meeting the challenges faced by their enterprises due to increasing trade competition, the globalisation of trade and the accelerated pace of change.  In response to a question earlier today, I informed the House of the measures that my Department is taking to assist in achieving this greater involvement.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, with regard to industrial relations generally, it is worth mentioning that the number of strikes and days lost through strikes in 1994 was the lowest on record.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's policy agreement, <Col N="448" /><i>A Government of Renewal</i>, deals in detail with the economic and social environment for jobs.

The Government supports the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which specifically refers to amendment of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, with a view to improving its provisions concerning consultation with employee interests about collective redundancy proposals.</P>
    <P>The operational programmes for industrial development and human resources, which I recently announced, will, over the next five years, strengthen the long-term capability of Irish industry to help reduce job losses and provide a more long term employment base.

This position remains unchanged.  However, in response to representations received from a number of boards, my predecessor directed that representational activities undertaken by chairpersons or their representatives would qualify for reimbursement of travelling expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the difficulties in the cashflow, and indeed the possible survival, of businesses arising from the late payment of business debt.  These difficulties, like most other business difficulties, are most acutely experienced in the small business sector.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to legislation on this problem and I have identified it within my Department as one of my main priorities for attention. However, the simple targeting of public bodies in a piece of &ldquo;quick fix&rdquo; legislation will not resolve all of these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the evidence concerning the problem of late payment is not statistical but anecdotal.  That is not to deny the existence of a problem, but serves to <Col N="452" /> indicate that simple solutions to a complex problem could cause more harm than good.  It is significant that the Task Force on Small Business, in making detailed recommendations on this matter, admits in its report that data is scarce.  My concern, therefore, is to examine thoroughly issues such as equity between public and private sectors, Exchequer implications and the feasibility and desirability of particular types of sanctions.  Following this examination, I plan to bring forward workable legislation in the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the Exchequer allocations for Forbairt's grants to industry budget recently published in the Abridged Book of Estimates for 1995.</P>
      <P>First, I would point out that Forbairt's overall grants to industry budget is made up of two elements, Exchequer grants and own income.  The principal source of own income is European Social Fund receipts which derive from Forbairt's expenditure in the training and employment grants area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the 1995 Exchequer contribution for the grants to industry budget is down compared to 1994, the allocation reflects the following: firstly funding for the scientific research grants scheme and the basic research awards included in Forbairt's 1994 grants to industry budget has this year been transferred to the science and technology subhead of the Department's Vote.  The amount involved is £1.3 million, and second European Social Fund receipts are expected to be substantially higher this year.  Taking account of both these factors Forbairt's overall grants to <Col N="453" /> industry budget will be slightly above their 1994 outturn.  The actual position will be published in the Revised Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>In addition to its own voted funds Forbairt will also have access to other substantial funds from related EU supported measures.  Forbairt will in fact manage a number of these funds on behalf of my Department.  One such fund is a research and development initiative which will provide up to 50 per cent support to companies undertaking research and development and which will have a budget of £20 million in 1995.  Under another initiative close on £8 million will be available in 1995 to provide seed &mdash; venture capital to suitable companies on the one hand and support for companies in traditional industrial sectors to adjust to changing market forces on the other.</P>

It is directed at persons who are either 21 years of age or over and in receipt of unemployment assistance or persons of any age who are in receipt of unemployment benefit or lone parent's allowance for over one year.  In addition, persons registered with the National Rehabilitation Board are eligible to participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The lone parent category has recently been extended so that persons with children in receipt of deserted wife's benefit or survivor's contributory pension who opt for and are awarded a means tested social welfare payment are also eligible to participate in the programme. Any <Col N="454" /> person, male or female, who satisfies any of the specified eligibility criteria can participate in the programme.</P>
    <P>I have no plans to change the eligibility conditions as, with limited resources, it is not possible to provide opportunities for all unemployed persons.However, I would advise the Deputy that there are no eligibility criteria for participation in FÁS return-to-work training courses which are specifically directed at persons who have been absent from the workforce for some time or for participation on mainline FÁS training courses although priority for mainline courses is given to persons on the live register.</P>

      <P>The county enterprise boards were established as a nationwide measure to provide a new source of support for local enterprise initiatives. They were established to fill a gap in the support mechanisms for small scale indigenous business, including the services sector.  As such, the boards represent a shift away from the traditional bias towards manufacturing and internationally-traded services in favour of a multi-sectoral focus.</P>
      <P>A wide range of services are eligible for direct assistance from the county enterprise boards.  Up to the end of 1994, over half of all projects approved by the boards were in the services sector.</P>

      <P>The number of captive insurance companies approved to locate in the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, as of today's date stands at 115.  The first captive insurance company was established just five years ago.</P>
      <P>The IFSC has succeeded in attracting captive business from all over the world, particularly from the US.  Sweden and Germany.  The US market has been a particularly important source of captives recently &mdash; 14 US owned captives have been approved to establish in the centre during the last 18 months.</P>
      <P>Opportunities for further expansion in this area are being pursued by IDA Ireland in their marketing campaign which is based on quality and quantity, the success of which is already reflected in the decision by a wide range of prestigious companies establishing international financial services companies in the centre.  The centre's attractiveness as a captive domicile has resulted in 27 captives locating there during 1994 alone.  This will now be capitalised by the recent decision of the European Commission to extend &mdash; until 31 December 2000 &mdash; the time period within which IDA Ireland can continue to offer tax incentives to new companies setting up at the centre.</P>

      <P>Roscommon</P>
      <P>Sligo</P>
      <P>Westmeath</P>
      <P>The specific boundaries of the areas will be announced in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="457" /> The choice of areas to be designated was based on an assessment of the areas involving objective and measurable criteria such as indicators of disadvantage, feasible operational boundaries and viability in terms of size and economic base.  The following data were used.  (i) A study for the Combat Poverty Agency, undertaken by the ESRI and GAMMA, Geographical and MultiMedia Applications Ltd, which provided a ranking of areas in terms of their overall deprivation.  The study used the following variables: the percentage in higher and lower professional classes, the percentage leaving school at 20 years or more, the percentage leaving school at 15 years or less, the percentage in the unskilled manual class, the unemployment rate, the percentage in small scale farming, defined as 30 acres or less, the labour force participation rate and the age dependency rate; (ii) the live register age by duration analysis; (iii) applications for global grant funding received by ADM Ltd; (iv) the Department of Social Welfare's community development programme; (v) data relating to the percentage unemployed in local authority rented accommodation and (vi) the report on County Dublin Areas of Need, CODAN.</P>
    <P>The areas were designated following recommendation by the interdepartmental policy committee on local development.  The areas include the 12 pilot partnership areas, including Ballymun, which were established as part of the area based response to long term unemployment introduced under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress,</i> and where partnership companies already exist.  Deciding on the specific boundaries of the areas involved a process of local consultation undertaken by the national co-ordinating team who met a wide range of groups and organisations in the various areas.</P>
    <P>Partnership companies are companies limited by guarantee with their own articles and memorandum of association.Each partnership has a board of <Col N="458" /> directors, manager and other staff.  In general the boards are tripartite with representatives from the local community, the social partners, and the State agencies.  The social partners and State agency representatives can be nominated.  The community directors are nominees of the local communities.</P>
    <P>The task of the partnership is to prepare a local development plan and work towards having it implemented.  The plan must reflect the objectives of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development, the objective is that measures initiated by the partnerships would complement mainstream programmes.  Activities eligible for funding under the operational programme are: activities to support enterprise creation and development, environmental and infrastructural works, transport services to isolated communities, activities to support education and training, services for the unemployed and community development.</P>
    <P>The national co-ordinating team will also recommend the formal partnership structure to be put in place in the designated areas.  A partnership must have the capacity to prepare and implement, or act as the catalyst to implement, a local development plan.</P>
    <P>The operational programme involves total Structural Funding of 257 million ECU.  Of this 97.144 million ECU will be available to the sub-programme on integrated development of disadvantaged and other areas and between 75 per cent to 85 per cent of this will be available to partnerships.  The Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development was published on 2 February 1995. Copies have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

I have emphasised to the British authorities the importance of facilitating contact between prisoners and their families, and urged the need for a flexible approach in cases such as this so as to ensure that any disruption is kept to an absolute minimum.  I also arranged that the prisoner concerned should be visited by an official of the Embassy in London, and the Embassy continues to keep the situation in this case under close review. I am hopeful that it will be possible to find a resolution to the problems which have arisen, and will be monitoring progress closely in the period ahead.</P>

These services include assessment and early intervention services, pre-school, developmental day units, respite care, home support, vocational training, adult special care units and sheltered work facilities and residential services.  In addition, the Department of Education provides educational services for children with a mild or moderate <Col N="463" /> mental handicap in special schools and special classes in ordinary schools.</P>

    <P>My Department is in the process of putting in place a national database on the needs of persons with a mental handicap.The database will provide information, on an ongoing basis, on the number of people with a mental handicap in each region, the number in receipt of services and those awaiting services, their current and future needs and the level of support which is required to meet those needs.  Up-to-date information on numbers awaiting services will be available from the database later this year.</P>
    <P>The provision of additional services for persons with a mental handicap has a very high priority within my Department.Since 1990 a cumulative figure of £26.5 million revenue and £6.08 million capital in additional funding has been invested in services for people with mental handicap.  In line with the commitment contained in the policy document <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, the Government is committed to eliminating waiting lists and to maximising the quality of life and right of participation of every citizen with a mental handicap. The Deputy will be aware that an additional £12 million is being made available in 1995 for the development of new services for people with mental <Col N="464" /> handicap and to meet identified needs in existing services.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> Services for persons with autism are primarily provided through the mental handicap services. There are, however, some specific services available to persons with autism in the Eastern, Southern and Western Health Board areas.</P>
      <P>A policy document on services for persons with autism was published by my Department in September 1994. This outlines my Department's policy on the provision of services and the future planning required for these services.I have sent a copy of this document to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Expenditure on services for persons with autism is included in the overall expenditure on services for persons with a mental handicap.  Details of the overall numbers of persons with mental handicap awaiting services will be included in the information which will become available later this year from the national database on the needs of persons with a mental handicap.  In the case of persons with autism the policy document recommends that health boards should establish a separate database for this group in their area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the 1994 development of services for people with a mental handicap, a total of £225,000 was made available to the health board regions for the development of plans for services for people with autism in response to the policy document.  Each health board is currently examining the actual services in place and is actively preparing plans for the future development of services for this group.  The implementation of these plans will be considered as part of <Col N="465" /> the overall development of services for people with a mental handicap in 1995 and future years.  As the Deputy is aware an additional £10 million is being provided for the development of new services for people with mental handicap in 1995.</P>

      <P>It is not my intention to grant a general exemption from examination fees for the 1995 certificate examinations.</P>
      <P>Examination entry fees for school candidates for the certificate examinations are due in my Department on 1 February in the year of examination.</P>
      <P>My Department operates a number of measures in order to alleviate hardship arising from the payment of examination entry fees.</P>
      <P>In the case of necessitous pupils, the ordinary fee payable may be reduced at the discretion of the school principal and subject to a maximum notified to each school or vocational education committee by my Department.  My Department has made £400,000 available to schools and vocational education committees for this purpose in connection with the 1995 examinations. This amount is greater than the amount allocated in 1994 by 1.5. per cent, the estimated increase in candidature. There has been no increase in the rates of examination entry fees since 1994.</P>
      <P>The amount allocated to each school or committee in respect of 1995 fees has been based on the results of a questionnaire on hardship issued to schools in 1994.  Allocations have been increased or reduced, taking into account the particular circumstances in each school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="470" /> School authorities are advised that, for the purposes of fee alleviation, a necessitous pupil may be defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of</P>
    <P>unemployment</P>
    <P>prolonged illness of parent</P>
    <P>large family with inadequate means</P>
    <P>single parent</P>
    <P>more than one child from the same family doing the certificate examinations</P>
    <P>other circumstances that would connote a similar degree of domestic financial hardship</P>
    <P>In addition, in the case of a candidate who remains at school to repeat the leaving certificate examination and whose parent or guardian is the holder of a current medical card the course fee of £100 is waived and the examination entry fee is reduced from £120 to a maximum of £44, (the ordinary leaving certificate fee payable by first-time candidates).</P>
    <P>Finally candidates who are not attending school may enter personally for the leaving certificate examination under the provisions for admission of external candidates.  The ordinary fees payable by external candidates are reduced, where the candidate is the holder of a current medical card or is dependent on a parent or guardian who is the holder of a current medical card, as follows.  £44 to £18, for one subject; £88 to £33, for two subjects; £132 to £44, for three or more subjects.</P>
    <P>I should add that examination entry fees cover only part of the cost of running the certificate examinations.  It is expected that about £6 million in fees will be collected in respect of the 1995 examinations but the cost of running the examinations will come to about £13 million.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 58 and 59 together.  The PRSI Class J contribution (employer share of 0.5 per cent and employee share Nil) is applicable to employees in any week <Col N="472" /> that the gross earnings from all employments are less than £30.  Class J gives cover for occupational injuries benefits only &mdash; such cover is essential in the event of an accident in the workplace.</P>
      <P>In general the PRSI class is determined by the nature of a person's employment and the level of earnings involved and a person cannot opt to pay Class A.  However, people paying Class J who were formally insurable at Class A can in certain circumstances opt to pay an additional voluntary contribution directly to my Department which will give them cover for pension purposes only.</P>
      <P>In order to be insurable at Class A, a person's earnings from all employments in the week must be at or above a certain level.  This earnings threshold was £25 from April 1991 to 5 April 1994, when it was increased to the present level of £30 or more per week.</P>
      <P>However, certain categories of employees are insurable at Class J regardless of their earnings.  These include: (i) Employees over the age of 66 and people engaged in subsidiary employments, who are insured for occupational injuries benefits only; (ii) Participants in community employment and certain FÁS training schemes are also insurable for occupational injuries benefits only.  However, those who, immediately prior to commencing these schemes, were insured at Class A or in receipt of credited contributions, continue to receive credited contributions for the duration of the scheme.  These credited contributions are awarded for the purposes of maintaining the person's existing insurance record and are reckonable for all benefits and pensions, subject to the usual conditions.</P>

      <P>I understand that my predecessor received a delegation representing the organisation &mdash; Inishowen Women of the Sea &mdash; on 26 August 1994 in connection with the position of share fishermen in relation to insurability and entitlements to benefits under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the legislation concerning share fishermen, who work under a contract for service, was ruled to be <i>ultra vires</i> under a High Court judgment in February 1992 which resulted in their being considered as self-employed persons.  A special scheme for share fishermen engaged under contract for service was introduced in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1993 which allowed those persons to join an optional social insurance scheme.  The new scheme enabled them to top up self-employed contributions and provided entitlement to treatment benefits and limited disability and unemployment benefit.</P>
      <P>Optional contributions became payable from the beginning of the 1993-94 tax year which governed short term benefit entitlements from January 1995. The total number of approved contributors to the scheme is approximately 200.</P>
      <P>The details of the scheme were explained at the meeting with the Inishowen Women of the Sea.  It was also explained that the ordinary rate contributions paid immediately before 14 February 1992, the date of the judgment, would be reckoned for such claims made in the period to December 1994.</P>
      <P>Submissions were made by the delegation which the Minister undertook to note in connection with an ongoing monitoring of the new arrangements.  I propose to have a full review of this issue at an early date.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Act, 1986 provides for a range of industrial incentives including capital grants.  The normal maximum level of capital grant provided for by the Act is 45 per cent.  However, the Act also provides that in certain designated areas, the industrial development agencies may offer capital grants of up to 60 per cent.  Industries located in the designated areas may also qualify for two thirds rates remission for ten years.  The granting of such remission is at the discretion of the relevant local authority.</P>
      <P>It is important to stress, however, that location in a designated area does not automatically provide that grants of the maximum 60 per cent level will apply, nor does it guarantee rates remission.  In fact, the importance and impact of designation in industrial promotion has lessened considerably in recent years.  In order to ensure value for money for the taxpayer, and to ensure that the maximum number of projects are supported from within a limited budget, the industrial development agencies are under constant pressure to maintain strict limits on the percentage levels of grant support for individual projects.  As a result and in conjuction with overall budgetary pressures, the maximum rates of capital grants are seldom given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is widely accepted that the development of industry in Ireland involves much more than support for the acquisition of fixed assets.  As a result, far greater attention is being paid to areas <Col N="475" /> such as research and development, marketing, and skills development generally.Improved competencies in these areas are fundamental to the long term competitive advantage of our industry. In addition, the increasing use of employment grants generally and the growing importance of the services sector further reinforces the shift in focus away from capital grants.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern about unemployment.  The ultimate objective of industrial development policy is to create the conditions in which firms will grow and increase their employment. However, I do not believe that the level of unemployment which is unacceptably high throughout the country will be dealt with by increased capital grants, whether for particular parts of the country, or generally.  That approach has signally failed in the past to tackle the more fundamental problems of competitiveness in areas such as management, technology, and equity funding &mdash; problems which are now being addressed by the industrial development agencies.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, I do not feel designated area status would address the unemployment situation in Balbriggan and I have no plans to pursue it.</P>

      <P>The EU Initiative on SMEs offers a small fund of structural funding (£22.9 million over 5 years) designed to complement other <Col N="479" /> developmental activity in Ireland by means of specific actions targeted at the SME sector.</P>
      <P>The Irish operational programme responding to this initiative will specifically focus on the needs of small business in both the manufacturing and services sectors.  The draft operational programme for small business has been under negotiation with the European Commission since November last.  I am hopeful that it will be adopted shortly by the EU thereby enabling publication by my Department in early March.</P>
      <P>The pivotal basis underlying the SME operational programme was the agenda set by the task force on small business in their report of March 1994.  The task force was of course comprised of representational interests and practitioners in the small business and services domain.  It was decided to focus the Irish response in a policy driven manner towards actions which were eligible within the terms set by the EU and which dovetailed with desirable assistance to small business arising from the work of the task force.</P>
      <P>In addition, a large number of representations were received from State and private organisations, including organisations representing small business interests, seeking financial assistance for projects and programmes which could, in most instances, have fitted within the broad parameters of the EU outline for the initiative.  These ideas usefully informed the process of preparing the draft operational programmae in my Department.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the programme to be announced shortly will be seen to have its genesis in the stated needs of small business, as articulated by small business interests themselves.  Moreover, there will be scope for further input from small business organisations and a specific feedback mechanism enabling the small business community to advise me as to the programme's effectiveness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the World Economic Forum report on competitiveness suggests that the rate of increase in machinery and equipment prices is somewhat higher in Ireland than in most other European countries. However, I should point out that the report does not differentiate between new and second hand equipment.</P>
      <P>The reasons for excluding second-hand machinery and equipment generally from capital grant assistance are as follows:</P>
      <P>&mdash;New equipment helps companies to progress to World Class Manufacturing.</P>
      <P>&mdash;New equipment increases a company's efficiency by having state of the art technology and assists companies to gain ISO Certification.</P>
      <P>It eliminates the risk of companies having obsolete or poor quality equipment which will inhibit their development.</P>
      <P>It further increases the opportunities for companies based in Ireland to obtain contracts with multinational companies who may not deal with suppliers who do not have the most up to date equipment.</P>
      <P>I understand that from time to time high quality second-hand equipment may be available and in such cases assistance could be offered by the industrial development agencies under the employment grant scheme.  The agencies do not discourage the purchase of second-hand equipment by companies willing to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the specific question about whether the equipment grants in respect of only new capital equipment assists the suppliers rather than the equipment users, clearly this would depend on a whole range of factors, not least of which would be the degree of competition that exists among suppliers of the <Col N="482" /> new equipment.  The Deputy should also know that in respect of items of large equipment, a tendering process is obligatory and prices are subject to a validation process by qualified experienced engineers with a view to ensuring that value for money is obtained from the taxpayer.  In addition, in a recent survey carried out by IDA (I) of overseas companies in Ireland, the cost of machinery, either new or second-hand, did not emerge as a constraint to operating in Ireland.</P>

      <P>The county enterprise boards were established to fill a gap which had been identified in the range of support services for local enterprise.  Their role is to develop indigenous potential and to stimulate economic activity at local level, primarily through the provision of financial and technical support for the development of small enterprises.</P>
      <P>Prior to their establishment, no nationwide locally-based decision-making mechanism existed for State supports to small and micro enterprises. Most enterprise supports were restricted to those provided by the IDA, SFADCo, ABT etc., with decision-making focused at the regional and national level and assistance restricted to manufacturing and internationally traded services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The county enterprise initiative provides a mechanism by which a nationwide system of independent, locally-based, decision-making bodies can provide supports for micro-enterprise development on a multi-sectoral basis. The initiative completes the chain of <Col N="483" /> enterprise supports which have been provided under the aegis of my Department to develop industry right through from micro-enterprise to large-scale inward investment.</P>
    <P>The county enterprise initiative is one of a number of initiatives at local level which are being supported under the Community Support Framework, 1994-99.It will complement the work of other initiatives through, <i>inter alia,</i> the enterprise plans of the county enterprise boards, which will help to align the range of official supports which can directly impact upon small enterprise creation at local, sub-county and county level.  The initiative, when fully operational and availing of structural funds co-financing, will have an enhanced capacity to act as a catalyst for enterprise development in the functional areas of the county enterprise boards.</P>
    <P>There will be close and regular liaision between the various initiatives now operating at local level to ensure the most effective use of the various support mechanisms available to micro-enterprise at that level.  In addition, these initiatives will be closely monitored at national level through the Interdepartmental Committee on Local Development and the Monitoring Committees of the Community Support Framework (CSF), 1994-99, and the relevant operation programmes established under the CSF, to ensure that they continue to operate within national and EU policies and guidelines.</P>

The herdowner must also provide a tax clearance certificate to the district veterinary office as the potential grant payment could amount to more than the threshold of £5,000.  A disinfection certificate is also a requirement.</P>
      <P>The payment of income supplement does not arise in this case as depopulation grants are payable.</P>

      <P>A total of 3,547 farm plans were recieved by my Department under this scheme in 1994.  The assessment of these applications will not be completed for some time.  Assessment of the 1990-93 figures would suggest that over 90 per cent of all applications include provisions for pollution control work as part of the farm plan. <Col N="485" /> Pollution control represents about 95 per cent of the work under the plans.</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the various schemes pollution control includes: winter housing and fodder management for livestock; effluent and waste storage including pumping and spreading equipment.</P>

      <P>There is nothing to indicate that delays in the Land Registry are unduly influencing participation in the scheme in western counties.  Variables such as age profile, small farm size or possible loss of social welfare entitlements may have a bearing on participation.</P>

      <P>A properly focused research and development programme in the agriculture and food industries is essential for economic development of the sectors.  Teagasc, in consultation with my Department, is implementing a corporate plan which has a major research component.  This concentrates on cost reduction, improvement in quality, continuity of supply, food processing, environmental protection and animal and plant welfare.This programme is complemented by research undertaken by other institutions, especially the universities.</P>
      <P>In addition to Exchequer resources, moneys are provided for research through the Structural Funds in the operational programme of agriculture, rural development and forestry and in the food sub-programme of the operational programme for industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision in my Department's Vote for 1995 for Teagasc is £44.674 million for research, advisory and training activities.  There is also a separate <Col N="487" /> provision of £41 million under the Structural Funds 1994-99 for institutional research in food.  About £6.5 million of this is provided in the current year. Expenditure from this fund is decided on the basis of competition between research institutions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 to 84 together.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the Government's approval in 1988 for the setting up of ESB subsidiary companies, the consent of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and the Minister for Finance is required when the ESB wishes to dispose of the properties and liabilities of any subsidiary company.</P>
      <P>The ESB applied for approval to dispose of its four offshore farms in October 1994.  In January this year, I gave my consent to the sale and this decision was conveyed to the ESB on 17 January 1995.</P>
      <P>The sale of the farms and the smolt rearing at Lough Allen realised £4.5 million.  This price reflected the value of the stock in hand when the farms were sold and formed part of the commercial negotiations which led to the sale of the marine farms.</P>
      <P>The role of ESB in fisheries conservation will continue.  The board has a number of programmes currently under way in the Lee, Shannon, Erne, Clady/Crolly and Liffey catchments. ESB has introduced up to the minute techniques in the fishery management of migratory and non-migratory fish. This fishery conservation programme is carried out with the full involvement of the Department of the Marine, the fishery boards, the Central Fisheries Board and the Universities.</P>
      <P>There are a total of 19 ESB seconded staff in Salmara.  Staff seconded from ESB to Salmara will retain the same conditions and service terms as ESB employees.</P>
      <P>There are no plans at present to dispose of the fish hatcheries which are owned by ESB &mdash; any future plans will take account of ESB's statutory responsibility for conservation of fisheries.</P>

Discussions in relation to the salaried grade schemes are continuing and, once finalised, I expect to be able to approve them without delay.</P>
