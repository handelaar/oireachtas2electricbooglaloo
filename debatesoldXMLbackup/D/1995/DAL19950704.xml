      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The staff, permanent and temporary, of my Department increased by 28 over the period in quesion. Seventeen of these positions were approved, in terms of Estimates provision, before the Government came into office.</P>
      <P>Five extra posts were approved for the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The staffing of the Northern Ireland Division has increased by three arising from the ongoing peace process.  Fourteen people have been provided in the areas of local development, western development and rural renewal.  Three extra staff have been assigned to the European Affairs section to meet the increasing demands as we near the 1996 Presidency and the Intergovernmental Conference.  The balance of three <Col N="938" /> people work in the Government Press Secretariat and the Famine and 1798 Commemoration Office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Taoiseach has changed his views of civil servants and has substantially increased the number in his Department.  Comments have been made recently in the media about the Government's recruitment policy and the reintroduction of the embargo.  What is the Government's policy on this issue?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be more appropriate for the Deputy to address that question to the Minister for Finance. The Government has not introduced an embargo; it has introduced a planned arrangement in respect of recruitment and numbers so that it only employs the number it can prudently afford to pay.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have already allocated an adequate number of staff for all the functions we need to perform and we have a reasonable degree of flexibility to move staff from one function to another as and when required. Most of the officials in my Department are not tied to one type of work in terms of their qualifications; they can move from one area to another.  There is no difficulty, therefore, in applying an administrative budget approach in my <Col N="939" /> Department within the overall numbers restriction.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy with the way in which staff are allocated in my Department and I have no intention or plan to make any change.  If the Deputy wishes to ask questions about restrictions on recruitment generally, the general operation of the administrative budget system, strategic management or related matters he would be well advised to table separate questions which will be answered.</P>

      <i>Government Programme.</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Government parties, in framing their Policy Agreement, undertook to promote the local empowerment of people by renewing the system of local Government in order to return the greatest amounts of opportunities to an effective and accountable local Government system.</P>
    <P>A substantial programme of work is already under way on a number of fronts:</P>
    <P>&mdash;A Review Body began its work last January, to report by the end of 1996, on a modernised system of local government in towns, including those which have no separate local council at present;</P>
    <P>&mdash;Consultants have been appointed, as envisaged in <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to carry out a professional study of local finance.  It will consider the expenditure needs of local authorities in the years ahead and the development of a fair, equitable and reasonable system of local government financing.  This process will lead, after due consultation, to a Government White Paper on this subject, the first since 1972;</P>
    <P>&mdash;County Strategy Groups are being set up at county level to consolidate the activities of the various groups involved in local development.</P>
    <P>If, however, the system of local government is to be renewed as the Government propose, the work already under way must be set in a wider context and be complemented by other initiatives. In particular, as envisaged in <i>A Government of Renewal:</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;there must be a phased programme of devolution and a widening of the role of local government, with <Col N="942" /> devolved functions observing the principle of subsidiarity;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the local authorities must become the focus for working through local partnerships involving local community-based groupings, voluntary bodies, the private sector, and public agencies, with a particular focus on co-ordinating the efforts of existing groups such as County Enterprise Boards, Leader Groups and ADM Partnerships.</P>
    <P>This statement sets out the Government's approach to the implementation of these commitments.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Guiding Principles</i>
    </P>
    <P>In its approach to local government renewal, the Government will proceed on the basis of the following general principles:</P>
    <P>&mdash;subsidiarity: public services to be devolved to the level nearest those to whom the service is delivered, but with due regard to financial constraints, efficiency, and staffing implications;</P>
    <P>&mdash;accountability: clear understanding of lines of responsibility and authority for the delivery of an appropriate service, with those who are involved in service delivery being answerable to the democratically elected council;</P>
    <P>&mdash;integration: the provision of services at different levels and by different categories of public authorities to be integrated as far as possible;</P>
    <P>&mdash;effectiveness: the best possible level of service to be provided, with due emphasis on quality considerations and value for money aspects;</P>
    <P>&mdash;participation: the system of local representative democracy to be developed, as far as possible; the role of local councillors to be enhanced, thereby attracting greater interest in going forward for election; and, in parallel, vibrant <Col N="943" /> community organisations to be promoted, especially in disadvantaged communities, with appropriate links to the formal local government system.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Government Approach to Local Government Renewal</i>
    </P>
    <P>Local government as a whole is big business, accounting for expenditure in 1995 of some £1.85 billion.  The achievements of local authorities in housing, planning, infrastructural, environmental, community and amenity services are considerable and are fully acknowledged by the Government.</P>
    <P>Eight regional authorities were established, and a re-organised local government system put in place in Dublin in 1994.  There have also been significant improvements in the legal framework governing local authorities, freeing them to engage in general development activities and reducing the extent of Ministerial control on the exercise of their functions.  The fact remains, however, that local authorities in this country have a more limited range of functions than their counterparts in many other countries.</P>
    <P>The Government believes that a renewed system of local government can provide a more effective focus for the effective delivery of a wider range of public services, for the better development and well-being of local communities, and for promoting more local development and enterprise.  Partnership and participation can be fostered through local government, and local identity and local loyalities can be harnessed to foster social inclusiveness, equality of opportunity and a tangible sharing of the burdens and rewards of society.  Similarly, a local focus can facilitate integration of environmental considerations into local projects, plans and programmes.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Devolution Commission Mandate</i>
    </P>
    <P>Guided by these basic principles, a Devolution Commission is now being <Col N="944" /> established by the Government, mandated to make recommendations so that:</P>
    <P>&mdash;significant additional functions are devolved to the local government system on the basis of a phased programme;</P>
    <P>&mdash;local authorities are meaningfully involved with policy and administration regarding functions which are not devolved directly to them:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the local authorities become the focus for working through local patnerships involving local community-based groupings, voluntary bodies, the private sector, and public agencies,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the efforts of local authorities and those of existing groups such as County Enterprise Boards, Leader groups, and ADM Partnerships are coordinated.</P>
    <P>The Commission will be required to take full account of the financial and public sector staffing implications in making its recommendations and of any other costs, as well as the benefits involved.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cabinet Committee on Local Government Renewal</i>
    </P>
    <P>Reports from the Devolution Commission will be considered, and put to Government for final decision, by a Cabinet Committee consisting of the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Environment, the Minister for Finance and the Minister(s) of State at the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for the devolution programme has been placed under the aegis of the Taoiseach as Head of Government to highlight the priority attached to the task.  Each Government Department is nominating a specific senior official to liaise with the Commission and to support its work.  The devolution Commission will be invited to make a review of interim reports on a rolling basis with the first report expected by December 1995.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" />
      <i>Devolution Commission Approach and Timescale</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Devolution Commission will work closely with the Cabinet Committee to ensure that action is taken quickly and effectively on the matters referred to it.</P>
    <P>The membership of the Commission is announced separately today and reflects the different elements which have a role to play in developing that action.  Thus, there are representatives of local and community groups, representatives of local authorities, both at the political and the management level, and representatives of Government Departments.  There are also a number of independent members to ensure that a balanced approach is adopted.</P>
    <P>The Commission has been asked to determine its essential Work Programme by end September 1995 and, therefore, to develop for Government consideration and decision, in a series of phases, statements of the specific steps (including legislative provisions, financial provisions, and transitional arrangements) recommended to renew the local government system.  The first such statement is expected by the end of 1995; the time scale for subsequent statements will be agreed with the Cabinet Committee.</P>
    <P>The Commission will consult with relevant organisations, both public and private, in developing its recommendations and take specific account of the operation of the Local Development Programme, especially the work of the County Strategy Groups.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that they work in tandem with one another, the Commission contains members who are also involved in</P>
    <P>(a)  the consultancy study on Local Government Finance;</P>
    <P>(b)  the Review Body on local government in towns.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if my question was put down at the correct time or whether it had the effect of expediting the Government decision but <Col N="946" /> I am delighted the decision has been made.  Has the Government decided the functions to be devolved to local government or is it a matter on which the commission will make a recommendation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give the Deputy credit for helping the Government to take this decision.  Both her original question and this question were useful in getting the decision taken, and I will not pretend otherwise.  Effectively this is a mechanism for making decisions about what functions should be devolved.  The Government is of the view that one or two functions in the 16 Departments of State could more appropriately be carried out at local level and it will look at all Departments. It is appropriate that there should be a form of audit of Government functions with a view to identifying those functions which could more appropriately, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, be conducted at local level closer to the people.</P>
      <P>This body, which contains a wide range of expertise in different areas, will be able, by combining senior Government departmental secretaries and people with outside experience and knowledge of local government, to identify such functions across the range of Government activities.  Its recommendations will then be considered by a Cabinet sub-committee chaired by me which will include the Ministers for the Environment and Finance and the two Ministers of State at the Department of the Environment.  We will act as a clearing house for these decisions before referring them to Cabinet.  This is the most serious and comprehensive effort made since the foundation of the State to devolve functions to local authorities on a systematic basis.  There have been various moves in the area of devolution in the past but none of them has been as systematic or widespread as this one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked at the list of members and if I recall correctly <Col N="947" /> none of them was a member of the original Barrington review group.  If this is the case it is a pity.  Will this commission be required to report annually to the Oireachtas as recommended by Barrington?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The commission will report to the Government.  Its work programme will be presented in September and it will present its first report in December; thereafter it will furnish its reports on an agreed cycle.  There is no reason these statements being furnished to the Government should not also be made available to the Oireachtas.  I am sure there will be no problem in allowing for debate on these matters in the Oireachtas at the appropriate time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the commission being established, I take it that the Government is now committed to a new system of local government financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will see, when he has a chance to read the statement, three separate exercises are being conducted.  One is a consultancy study on local government financing which is being done by KPMG Management Consulting.  A study has been initiated by the previous Government on sub-county level government, in particular town government; in other words how to pay for local government and the structure of local government.  There is a third study which is designed to answer the question in relation to what local government should be doing and what extra things local government can do that it is not already doing.  There is a considerable degree of complementarity between these three studies and to ensure they do not go in separate directions we have provided for cross-representation. There will be a representative of KPMG Management Consulting and a representative of the body set up to examine sub-county level government on this devolution commission. The work of each one of the three, <Col N="948" /> which is separate work, will complement and be consistent with the others.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Government statement on local government reform, a professional study by KPMG Management Consulting, is on a financing of local authorities.  Is it envisaged that KPMG Management Consulting will specifically examine the property tax issue and its relationship with water rates and, in general, a system of raising local taxes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Any question about the consultancy study, which is being commissioned by the Minister for the Environment would be better addressed to him but I can tell the House &mdash; and the Minister who is here can confirm this &mdash; that an open remit in terms of all the issues arising in local government finance is given to the consultants who will be free to examine all options.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No option is being pointed out to them or excluded from their consideration.  They will be free to examine all those issues and to make any recommendations they wish on which the Government will then decide.</P>

      <P>My appointment as Minister of State for the IFSC coincided with the decision by the European Commission to extend the deadline for new entrants to the centre by an additional six years.

      <P>There is still a very significant flow of new projects being brought forward by IDA Ireland and I believe that the desired expansion for the centre will come naturally as the number of IFSC companies builds; as the range of products and services on offer grows; and as the experience and reputation of IFSC companies increases.</P>
      <P>I have set the following objectives in relation to the economic development of the Centre: (1) to substantially increase the level of direct employment from the current level approaching 2,500 over the next five years.  It is hoped to double or perhaps treble this number to bring the total to between 4,000 and 6,000; (2) creation of at least 1,000 jobs in related back-office activity. Between (1) and (2) 5,000 additional jobs over a five year period is a reasonable target; (3) maximising consequential employment in associated legal, accounting and general &mdash; software development and security, cleaning, catering and other &mdash; services in the domestic economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, I have set up a long term review group, under my own chairmanship and consisting of the Department <Col N="951" /> of the Taoiseach, Department of Finance, the National Treasury Management Agency and the IDA to plan in a concerted way the long term development of the centre.</P>
    <P>Recently, I visited Boston and New York and met some of the most senior figures in the financial world, many of them with interests in the IFSC or interested in locating there.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to appoint an international ministerial advisory committee to advise on realisable targets to set to ensure that the great progress made in establishing the IFSC continues to gain momentum and is maximised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The average number of persons employed during 1994 was 2,000.  In the light of the new projects which have been continuously coming on stream, the current figure is probably closer to 2,500 and I believe there is potential to double this figure over the next few years.  I am concerned about the slow pace of development in the centre but I am pleased that the pace has picked up.  I am satisfied that the targets which have been set are being met.  The physical development of the Financial Services Centre is a matter for the Custom House Docks Development Authority which reports to the Minister for the Environment.</P>

      <P>I am amused at the Minister's definition of a slow pace of development.  Funds were increased from zero billion funds in the centre to about £10 billion in the space of three years.

      <P>My reference to the slow physical development was not in relation to the funds coming into the centre but in relation to the physical development of the centre.  My concern relates to the fact that there are almost 200 companies located outside the centre. I have been trying to bring pressure to bear on those concerned to ensure that the centre is developed sufficiently to allow those companies to locate there.  I am happy that great progress is being made.  The matter is being kept under review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 12 and 27 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="954" /> The problem of sexual harassment in employment is a topic that has been receiving increasing attention in recent years.  Last year I published a code of practice on measures to protect the dignity of men and women at work also known as the code of practice on sexual harassment.  This code was prepared by the Employment Equality Agency with the full co-operation of both IBEC and the ICTU.  In accordance with a commitment in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> it is being promoted, monitored and reviewed by the agency which has already achieved considerable experience and expertise in advising workers and employers on this subject.</P>
    <P>Employers and trade unions, through their respective representative bodies of IBEC and the ICTU, have displayed a positive disposition towards combating the problem of sexual harassment in employment and towards putting in place workplace procedures to deal with it.  The code of practice will build on these efforts.  The Employment Equality Agency has spared no effort to ensure a wide distribution of the code and to date almost 30,000 copies have been distributed to employers, individuals and other interested parties.</P>
    <P>The present code of practice is not mandatory but its guidelines may be taken as an authoritative source without precluding employers and workers exercising discretion to adopt other appropriate and equivalent practices if the circumstances of their employment so warrant.  In the revised employment equality legislation proposals which I expect to publish before the end of the year, I intend to give the code of practice appropriate legal recognition.</P>
    <P>In the interim legal redress is available to victims of sexual harassment under the Employment Equality Act, 1977, notwithstanding the absence of a specific reference in the Act to sexual harassment.  In 1985 the Labour Court, in a precedent case, ruled that &ldquo;freedom from sexual harassment is a condition of work which an employee of either sex is <Col N="955" /> entitled to expect&rdquo;.  The court, accordingly, treats any denial of that freedom as discrimination within the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>That Act also prohibits any form of discrimination on the basis of gender or marital status in relation to employment, including access to jobs or promotion. Any person who feels that they have suffered unlawful discrimination under the Act has a right to have their case investigated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the problem of sexual harassment in the workplace is to a large extent misunderstood? It is particularly important, therefore, to send the clear message that it will not be tolerated.  It tends to be associated with trivial sexual acts but it is more akin to bullying and a power play where young people and women in particular are subjugated and kept down in the workplace.  Will the Minister indicate how he hopes to get that message across given that this now appears to be a widesprad practice?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. It is important that any misunderstandings are cleared up and the message is understood.  We have had reasonable success in that regard.  Almost 20,000 copies of the code were distributed by the Employment Equality Agency in 1994 while a further 10,000 copies will be distributed this year.  Another 10,000 copies are being printed and will be available to employers, individuals and other interested parties.</P>
      <P>There has been an appreciable increase in the number of cases reported to the Employment Equality Agency. This is an indication that there is now greater awareness of the rights and responsibilities of employees and employers, respectively, arising from the promotion of the code.  I agree with the Deputy that this conduct is not acceptable but there is a remedy.  The code of practice is helpful although, admittedly, it does not have legal status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="956" /> I am endeavouring to find some format to give it such status in the new employment equality legislation which is due for presentation to the House later this year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's comments and the fact that he will consider introducing legislation, if necessary, although I appreciate it may be difficult to specify where it would apply.  It is important, therefore, that we get the message across, especially to senior and middle management in industry and the public service in particular, given that sexual harassment involves choosing a victim and using one's position to exercise power over the victim.  This is not fully understood.  Will the Minister do his utmost to implement the existing code of practice and the disciplinary procedures that apply to it to ensure that the message in that code is sent out loud and clear in the public and private sectors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy. Remedies exist under the ruling of the Labour Court to which I referred in my reply.  The Employment Equality Agency does remarkable work in this field.  It will advise or assist people with queries or complaints.  Many people who have been adversely affected by sexual harassment at work have been constrained frequently not to come forward and make a complaint, but as a result of the work of the Employment Equality Agency operating under the aegis of my Department it is interesting that people are increasingly reporting incidents of harassment and it is important that they should do so. People should be aware that although the code published is not currently legally recognised <i>per se</i> remedies are available under the existing legislation. Any person who reports a concern to the Employment Equality Agency, the leading experts in this field, will receive a confidential and sympathetic hearing. It will advise people of their rights and, if necessary, represent or arrange for <Col N="957" /> them to be represented in proceedings before a tribunal.</P>
      <P>The new employment equality Bill will be published later this year.  I am working on a method to give this matter a form of recognition.  Deputy Woods is correct in saying there are difficulties associated with its structure, but I have some ideas regarding it.  We will discuss that Bill and the format I will decide in that regard when the Bill is published in due course.</P>

      <P>The House will accept that I cannot remain unduly long on any one question having regard to the rather rigid time factor involved in dealing with priority questions.  Deputy Woods may ask a brief and final question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I emphasise that sexual harassment in the workplace may also apply to men as it is essentially related to the abuse of power over officials and work mates.  The figures produced by the Employment Equality Agency &mdash; I congratulate it on its work &mdash; are effectively only the tip of the iceberg.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to concerns that, while the 3 per cent quota for the employment of people with disabilities has been met in the Civil Service as a whole, there are huge variations in the percentages employed by different sections of the Civil Service; if, in particular, his attention has been drawn to the fact that just 1.5 per cent of those employed in the health service live with a disability; the proposals, if any, he has to ensure that the quota is implemented across the board, thus affording people with disabilities a wider range of choice in their careers; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 10 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>Since my Department was established it has played an important role in seeking to improve the situation of people with disabilities in a variety of ways, including active participation in most of the official fora concerned with promoting the welfare and safeguarding the interests of people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>In that connection, an officer of the Department is a member of the following committees and groups: the physical and sensory disability review committee; the monitoring committee for the pilot supported employment programme and the advisory group on personal assistance &mdash; these three bodies operate under the aegis of the Department of Health; the monitoring committee for the employment of people with disabilities, which operates under the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>; the inter-departmental transport accessibility committee, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications; the Irish Wheelchair Association Pilot Community Development Advisory Committee and the Helios II EU Programme.</P>
      <P>In this way, I am kept apprised of developments and, on that basis, I am in a position to consider what action, in my particular area of responsibility, might be appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 6 April 1995, I formally announced the setting up of an <i>ad-hoc</i> steering group to facilitate the establishment of a permanent Council for the <Col N="959" /> Status of People with Disabilities.  The council would be a major representational innovation which would be of great benefit to people with disabilities and their parents and carers.</P>
    <P>There are ongoing contacts between my Department and IBEC aimed at exploring possibilities for improving the job prospects of people with disabilities in the private sector.  On 24 May 1995 I met with representatives of IBEC and a wide-ranging discussion took place on possible initiatives to increase job opportunities for people with disabilities. IBEC and ICTU are represented on the monitoring committee for the employment of people with disabilities where my Department is also represented. This committee is actively addressing the issue of unemployment among people with disabilities.</P>
    <P>The 3 per cent quota for the employment of people with disabilities has been achieved in the Civil Service overall.</P>
    <P>My Department is engaged in ongoing consultations regarding the achievement of the 3 per cent quota in the wider public service.  In this regard, a meeting is scheduled to take place on 6 July 1995 between officers from my Department and the Department of Health with a view to identifying opportunities for further improving the job prospects of people with disabilities in the health services.  Officers from my Department and the Department of the Environment met recently to identify measures aimed at improving the position in the local authority services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that access and mobility are of particular importance to people with disabilities and that they can do very little without them?  Will he support the proposal of the Centre for Independent Living that is &ldquo;vantastic&rdquo; scheme should be expanded and developed, at least as a pilot project, whereby a driver is provided with a van to bring a number of people with disabilities and their personal assistants where they wish to go <Col N="960" /> in the city?  Has the Minister a view on the centre's work and can he assist it in any way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Woods that access and mobility are important and I fully support anything that can be done to assist in that regard. There are two important groups working on that area of mobility, the interdepartmental transport accessibility committee operating under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, that I set up, has a transport mobility working group which is examining all aspects of mobility for people with disabilities.  I look forward to receiving its report which will be published shortly and its recommendations will be carefully examined.  The legislation I am preparing on equal status will deal with all aspects of the lives of people with disabilities.  I hope, by the time that is published the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities will be available.  Those important developments will take place within the next year or two and I hope they will produce real improvements in the lives of people with disabilities.  That is the Government's objective and it is the reason we are working on those two important Bills, the first of which will be published this year and the second next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister give his immediate support to the expansion of the scheme proposed by that centre dealing with people with disabilities, consider its advantages and discuss it with his colleagues?  I am sure his colleagues in the Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications and Health are also concerned about this matter.  It is important that this is given further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we held discussions some time ago on the 3 per cent quota in the wider public service I suggested it should be higher.  It has been exceeded in the Civil Service.  Will the Minister indicate the <Col N="961" /> take-up of that quota in other sectors? Is the figure for the health services 1.5 per cent?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have specific figures for the environment and health areas, but I know both figures are low. The figure for the health board sector was 1.08 per cent in December 1993, the most recent date for which I have information. The quota in both sectors falls well short of the 3 per cent target achieved in the Civil Service.  Since we held previous discussions on this matter we have had ongoing consultations with the Department of Health regarding employees of health boards and with the Department of the Environment regarding employees of local authorities.  An energetic programme of examination is being carried out to ascertain what can be done in both those labour-intensive areas.  Meetings have taken place and correspondence is being exchanged. Some difficulties arise, particularly in the health areas where many people with disabilities would be unable to carry out the necessary work.  However, that is only a partial excuse.  Much remains to be done in the environment and health areas in this regard and we will continue to have ongoing consultations with the Ministers involved.  The Deputy could table separate questions to those Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>It is sometimes difficult to frame a question suitable for the Minister for Equality and Law Reform because his work covers many Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not noticed the Deputy having any difficulty in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Keogh and my colleagues have managed to table a sufficient number of questions during the session.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister circulate this afternoon the breakdown of figures for health boards, the Departments of <Col N="962" /> Social Welfare, Justice and so on?  Does he agree it is a scandal that the percentage is a mere 1.08 per cent in the health area when it should be leading the way and striving to ensure that people with disabilities are appointed to positions within the health services which have a large employment potential?  Will the Minister address that problem urgently?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As the figures to which the Deputy referred come within the ambit of the Departments involved, he should obtain them by tabling a question to the appropriate Minister.  The figure of 1.08 per cent was recorded in December 1993 but the Department may have a more up to date figure.  The Departments involved are concerned about the number of people with disabilities they employ.  For example, the Department of Health is particularly concerned that the health services should be seen to observe equality principles in its employment and personnel practices and over the next few months will consolidate positive initiatives already under way in this regard in health agencies and produce a comprehensive equal opportunities policy and action plan which will take on board the principles set out in the code of practice for employment of the disabled in the Civil Service.  A similar position obtains in the Department of the Environment regarding local authorities.  These important issues are being addressed.  In the months ahead ongoing consultation will take place between my Department and the two relevant Departments.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to a resolution of the European Parliament on the functioning of the Treaty on European Union.  Among the wide range of ideas in the resolution is a proposal for the &ldquo;inclusion of an explicit reference in the Treaty to the principle of equal treatment irrespective of race, sex, age, handicap or religion&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>My Department is being kept informed of developments relating to the Intergovernmental Conference and is involved in the development of policy approaches on matters relevant to it. The Government has not yet considered proposals for the amendment of the Treaty.  When it does so I will make my views known in the light of the precise amendments proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed the Minister cannot be more explicit regarding the intention to include those references in the Treaty.  A discussion on those matters between Members of this House would be very useful.  As a great deal of disappointment has been expressed about the progress on equality policy at European level, does the Minister consider that, as proposed by Commissioner Flynn, an annual equality report should be published? Does he believe that once a decision is made on references in the treaty such an equality report would be appropriate?</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That can be considered in the course of the Intergovernmental Conference.  Members should note that we are talking about a resolution of the European Parliament and to translate that into amendment of the Treaty requires a good deal of discussion and consultation.  It requires the key involvement of the Commission and the Council of Ministers.  Many of the concepts put forward in the resolution of the Parliament conform with the objectives of the Department of Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>My Department will be very involved in discussions and regulations as they develop between now and the Intergovernmental Conference.  Monitoring is a separate issue on which there are further questions on the Order Paper.  The remarks I shall make then would apply equally here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>How much discussion has there been on the inclusion of these specific references to which the Minister has referred in the treaty?  It includes the principle of equal treatment, irrespective of race, sex, age, handicap or religion, which is pertinent to the types of issues we have been discussing in relation to the Minister's Department. Has the Minister drawn up a list of priorities he perceives as being apt for inclusion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>All of those issues are of concern and importance and will be the subject of domestic legislation being prepared by my Department.  The position within Europe covers a much broader area and much negotiation goes on there.  The question of the amendment of the treaty on these issues, as suggested by the European Parliament, has not yet reached the point at which it could be discussed by Government &mdash; it has not yet evolved to that extent &mdash; and has yet to be considered by the Council of Ministers and the Commission. Drafts may be produced and may be varied.  My Department is represented on the Interdepartmental European Co-ordination Committee <Col N="965" /> chaired by the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  In coming months the Intergovernmental Conference subgroup of that committee will be considering fundamental human rights, including amendments to the treaty.  My Department will be represented on issues of relevance to it.  A good deal of discussion and evolution is yet to take place.  These are issues which form the basis, broadly speaking, of matters being dealt with by my Department.  I will be broadly supportive of them but it is early days yet.  We must first ascertain what kinds of amendments ultimately emerge at European Union level which will then be discussed by our Government and no doubt by this House in due course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister appears to be talking in very vague terms as though this were something that would happen ten years hence whereas it is much more immediate.  Resulting from the Minister's deliberations, have his officials brought particular issues to the attention of this committee chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell? Is his Department leading the way on these issues, as is its remit in Irish legislative terms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department plays a key role on these issues and is represented on the Interdepartmental European Co-ordination Committee sub-group at which it will be making its views known.  That is one aspect of the matter, but we must remember that we are just one member state of the European Union.  No doubt there are equivalent committees in all the other member states with their input.  It is early days so far as an amendment of the treaty is concerned.  It is not like a draft directive, it is a major operation, necessitating extensive procedures and involving not merely the European Parliament, the only organ of the European Union which has addressed the matter so far, but the Commission and Council of Ministers who have yet to address it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="966" /> Much work needs to be done before it reaches that point.  A large measure of consensus must be arrived at before this can be substantially progressed.  I am broadly supportive of the objectives.</P>
    <P>These are important issues, not dissimilar from the substantive domestic legislation in course of preparation in my Department.  In a sense, therefore, our Government is giving a lead on these issues, ahead of Europe, in that we are already preparing legislation. That is not to say we do not regard these questions as of great importance within the wider European context.  Since we are giving a lead by preparing legislation and implementing matters of this nature for ourselves, it follows <i>a fortiori</i> that we would favour their implementation within the broader European context.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Equality and Law Reform</askee>
      <Quest>if he has considered the equality implications of the practice whereby employers of large numbers of predominantly female staff have introduced zero hour contracts for their employees; and the implications, if any, this may have for equal pay and equal working conditions for women workers.</Quest>
      <QRef>[12205/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that this type of employment is one of a number of forms of atypical employment involving predominantly female workers and that it has been raised as an issue in the context of working time arrangements which are primarily the concern of my colleague the Minister for Enterprise and Employment.  I am informed that legislation is currently being prepared in the Department of Enterprise and Employment which will implement the EU Directive on Working Time and that in the context of framing that legislation, detailed consideration is being given to the possible need for legal provision to cover zero hour contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also mention however, that any worker employed under this type of <Col N="967" /> contract would have access to the redress procedures of the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974 and the Employment Equality Act, 1977 in the same way as have all workers.  Case law developments, particularly those arising from judgments of the European Court of Justice have assisted atypical workers in pursuing claims of indirect discrimination.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that if difficulties relating to discrimination on equal pay or equal treatment are brought forward in respect of workers in this area the employment equality machinery as operated by the equality officers of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court will be able to deal with such problems.  In addition of course employers, workers or their unions may seek the advice of the Employment Equality Agency in respect of equality concerns which may arise in respect of any aspect of this form of employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the <i>Bilka Kaufhaus</i> case decided by the European Court of Justice in 1986, which related to part-time workers, predominantly women, and their pensions, set a precedent in this respect?  Would he agree that zero hour contracts, which relate principally to part-time workers, who are mostly women, should not be permitted to continue?  The Minister has referred to the necessity for a possible legal provision.  I had intended to ask whether he has any legislative plans to prevent this practice continuing which clearly discriminates against women. What immediate action can he take to clearly demonstrate that this is an unacceptable development in working hour arrangements?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects to this matter.  The first is that there is a European Union Directive on Working Time which will cover aspects of the practice described by Deputy Woods. That falls within the ambit of the Department of Enterprise and Employment. That Department has informed <Col N="968" /> me it is at present preparing legislation to implement that directive, which will have a major bearing on the position overall.  It may well be that indirect discrimination could arise where a preponderance of workers is of one sex.  It would be open to any worker who feels they have been a victim of indirect discrimination on those grounds &mdash; provided the relevant European Union directive on existing case law has been complied with &mdash; to ascertain whether they would have a claim based on the facts of their case.  I am sure the unions representing workers have expert advice available in that area.  The Employment Equality Agency is also available to advise workers of their rights and will investigate the circumstances of any particular case.  The equality officers of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court have jurisdiction under existing legislation to deal with indirect discrimination claims and any worker who feels aggrieved should make inquiries about the position based on the facts of their case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad legislation is being prepared in this area.  It should be brought forward as a matter of considerable urgency.  I appreciate the need for flexibility among employers &mdash; if they are to be competitive they must be flexible. The marketplace demands flexibility, which can be achieved in a variety of ways but not in a way that discriminates against women who very often need to work part-time.  Women who make that choice should receive support. Zero hour contracts affected social security up to a few years ago but that problem was solved by basing the assessment on money rather than hours. A similar problem arises in this regard and I am glad action is to be taken to overcome it.  I ask the Minister to press ahead with that action as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Enterprise and Employment is preparing the legislation and it has confirmed <Col N="969" /> the position to me.  It is well established in the European Court of Justice and national case law that less favourable treatment of atypical work such as part-time employment may constitute indirect discrimination.  According to EU law such treatment would amount of indirect discrimination if it affects a much greater proportion of persons of one sex than the other and &mdash; this is the key point &mdash; it cannot be shown to be based on objectively justified factors which are unrelated to discrimination based on sex.  Provided criteria of that type are met, the possibility of a claim exists, even under existing legislation, and may be examined in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the European Commission proposal on reversing the burden of proof in equal treatment cases be taken on board and, if so, will it be implemented through legislation or by way of an EC Directive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Sin ceist eile.  The question of implementation does not arise because such a directive has not yet been adopted.  The matter we are dealing with here relates to the EU directive on working time which comes within the ambit of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  That Department is in the course of preparing legislation to implement the directive.  Ireland supports the introduction of a directive on the subject referred to by Deputy Keogh but that has not yet been achievable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>

      <P>As child care services are not subject to statutory control there are no official procedures for the collection and assessment of data on them.  Primary responsibility for the regulation of child care resides with my colleague, the Minister for Health, under the Child Care Act, 1991.  Part VII of that Act provides for a new system of supervision and inspection by health boards of pre-school services catering for children under six years of age.  I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Health, that this part of the Act will be implemented in 1996, at which time providers of all pre-school services will be obliged to register with their local health board and to comply with statutory regulations relating to standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am a little surprised we do not seem to be making progress in this area.  The EU network was set up in 1986 for the purpose of collecting data and to make people more aware of responsibility in the child care area. Have we access to EU figures in this regard and, if so, what use is being made of them?  What practical efforts are being made to implement the findings in this area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no official data on child minding facilities because up to now no Government has seen fit to bring in official registration procedures. Such procedures are to be brought in under the Child Care Act, 1991, but the part of the Act dealing with that matter will not be implemented until next year. When that is done all facilities will be obliged to register and comply with certain standards.  Data may then be collected and assessed.  Obviously until registration takes place data will not be available.  Further questions on this matter may be addressed to the Minister for Health who is responsible for implementing the Child Care Act.</P>

      <P>Are sufficient funds, which are available through the European Union, being drawn down in this area?  I am thinking particularly of vocational training for child care workers and monitoring in this area, which is one of the objectives of the EU NOW Programme.  Some organisations in the child care area have drawn down funding under that programme.  If the matter is not monitored on a proper basis perhaps we are not drawing down funds that may be available to us and which would be of assistance in furthering this element of society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the facilities under the EU human resources programme come under the ambit of FÁS and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, while others come under the ambit of the Department of Education. These offices may have data regarding facilities that are funded through the EU programme.  If the Deputy puts down a question on those programmes he may get further information. There is no control or registration in place for such services. However, registration procedures and controls will be put in place next year and all the necessary data will then be readily obtainable.  It is important that registration procedures are introduced as quickly a possible and my colleague, the Minister for Health, intends to do that in 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister plans to conduct a campaign to make people aware of the importance of child care?  If we are to make opportunities available in the labour market, particularly for women, we must develop these services.  Is this being communicated to employers?  We must ensure that a proper range of child care facilities is provided, particularly in larger firms, because a happy worker is a more productive worker and it is vital that the importance of providing such facilities is communicated to employers through the country.  Does the Minister have any plans to do that?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kenneally. He talked about a happy worker being a productive worker but I want to make opportunities available for people who could not be in the workforce without the provision of child care facilities. That is an important aspect of the matter. In so far as the ambit of my Department is concerned, not alone have I been advocating that position but, since I took office, I have done something about it.  I secured from the Department of Finance approximately £1 million for last year and this year to grant-aid setting up créches and training people as child minders.  As a result &mdash; and I am speaking now from recollection &mdash; some 70 facilities at various locations in disadvantaged areas have been grant-aided with that sum of £1 million through my Department and ADM, which operates the scheme on my behalf.  That was a new scheme introduced by me and it is having practical effects on the ground. Child care places have become available that otherwise would not have existed. This money is quite apart from the EU draw down to which Deputy Kenneally refers.  We are all agreed on the need for this scheme, which covers various aspects, but the question of the broad generality of registration is an important matter.  We will have an overall hands-on approach to the whole situation when registration becomes compulsory and standards are set by the Department of Health.  We can then reassess the position and see what further improvements may be necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to the pilot child care scheme administered by ADM.  Towards the latter end of last year, ADM invited applications for grant aid.  Subsequently, funding was made available through the Minister's Department, which was very welcome, but that was under a child care initiative project.  Is that project and the child care scheme one and the same?  It seems that the body administering the scheme sought applications for grant aid but the money emanated from the Minister's Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The money emanated from my Department.  If the Deputy looks at the Estimates for my Department he will see the £1 million referred to there.  The <i>modus operandi</i> was that we asked ADM to administer the scheme on behalf of the Department of Equality and Law Reform for the simple reason that it had the control measures and the local bases around the country necessary for the implementation of the scheme.  ADM agreed to do that and, subsequently, there were a large number of applications.  Approximately 70 organisations were approved as meeting the requirements laid down by my Department and ADM.  I believe approximately £900,000 has already been committed in grant aid for the 70 organisations around the country.  I cannot say offhand if there are one or more such projects in the Deputy's constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister rightly said, he succeeded in acquiring £1 million for child care facilities in the past year and he referred to the requirements met by the various bodies that applied to his Department.  Were those requirements in relation to standards within a particular child care unit?  Does this link to any future proposals on foot of regulation of child care?  Have we a basis at this stage for standards within the child care sector?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the requirements was that the location of the facility in question had to be in a disadvantaged area.  In addition, ADM devised a form of application which required information regarding the nature of the facility provided, the length of time it was in existence, the number of children that would be cared for and the general standards that applied.  I believe ADM has carried out inspections of the facilities to ensure that the standards, which <Col N="974" /> it devised for this purpose as there are not yet official standards in force, were adhered to.  That was done on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by ADM but it was necessary because this was a new scheme.  The funding was voted for the first time last year and, consequently, ADM devised its necessary basis and it has people employed who understand these matters. I gather the scheme is working very well and that, with the aid of this money, these 70 facilities around the country have been enabled, in some cases, to set up a new facility or extend or improve an existing one to enable them take in additional children.  That has opened up possibilities for many mothers both for employment and for educational opportunities.  I believe it has been a very worthwhile project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a valid point.  These facilities have been very useful.  As there seems to be some method of assessment in place, will the Minister, after a period of time, publish some terms of assessment that might be used in the interim before the new registration of child care facilities come into being?  One of the major difficulties in relation to child care is that while we have many excellent facilities, others are not fit to accommodate them.  The Minister's programme has been succesful but we must have some facility for assessment on which we can build in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The only point I would make about that is that the responsibility for setting standards, dealing with the registration and so on, under the terms of the Child Care Act, 1991, falls to my colleague, the Minister for Health.  However, I am sure the expertise gained by ADM in the operation of this scheme from my Department may be helpful to the Department of Health and, of course, all that expertise will be made readily available to the Department of Health if required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the function of the European Commission itself rather than my Department to gender proof all actions and measures emanating from the European Commission.  The Government is, however, committed to gender proofing of national programmes supported by EU Structural Funds, as set out in the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>Arising from that commitment the Human Resources Operational Programme contains, for the first time, a section on promoting equal opportunities, involving the ring-fencing of funds amounting to £7.7 million during the period to 1999.  My Department is involved in monitoring the implementation of this programme and will pay particular attention to the progress of quality targets in this programme and in the Urban and Rural Development Operational Programme.  My Department also examines proposals for action in the social policy field, which relate to my area of responsibility, with a view to profiling equal opportunities issues.</P>
      <P>In the Irish Government response to the European Commission Green Paper entitled &ldquo;European Social Policy-Options for the Union&rdquo;, my Department was instrumental in raising with the Commission the desirability of all Community-funded initiatives being subjected to an equality proofing system which would encompass not only gender proofing but also disability proofing.</P>
      <P>The approach by my Department to profiling equality in respect of European Commission policy and action initiatives in the social policy area affecting my Department will continue to apply to reflect the importance given to this issue by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="976" /> As regards disability proofing there is no agreed Community policy in place to ensure that Commission initiatives contain such provisions.  My Department participate in the deliberations of the HELIOS II European Union Programme for the exchange of information between member states on various measures, including good practice, in relation to people with disabilities.  I understand that the question of disability proofing is being discussed in that forum.</P>
    <P>I understand that the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities is also considering this issue and will put forward its views on the subject, in due course, when submitting its report.</P>
    <P>In the light of the circumstances I have outlined I do not believe it would be proper for me, at this stage, to embark on unilateral action in relation to disability proofing which could preempt or prejudice developments in the other fora which are examining the question.</P>

Ministers have the opportunity at meetings of the Council of Ministers to press for policy changes and encourage other member states to agree to them.  The Minister said there is no agreed policy at European Union level.  It is time the EU agreed a policy of disability proofing to provide the support needed by people with disabilities.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the HELIOS project, and the HORIZON project has been used successfully here to introduce new and innovative training projects, but such training was always geared to the open market.  There should be a policy in the European Union to support people with disabilities, and I would like the Minister to press for an extension of the HORIZON project to sheltered work because that is often the only kind of work that can be taken on by people with disabilities.</P>

Monitoring arrangements have been included and my Department will have a role in regard to those.  In regard to the HELIOS programme, there is no question of fear of treading on anyone's toes.  Such matters have to be evolved by agreement at EU level.  Disability proofing is being discussed and it is appropriate that we await the outcome of those discussions. It is better that there be agreement between the member states on which the arrangements for disability proofing can be based.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that one of the ways in which Ministers at the Council of Ministers can promote disability proofing and support for people with disabilities is by seeking and encouraging a convergence of policies between member states, and that where one cannot have uniformity between member states one can at least have convergence?  Will the Minister press for the use of the non-Governmental organisations and their networks to provide financial support for people with disabilities because such organisations are quite extensive in Ireland and generally throughout Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The non-Governmental organisations do remarkable work and fulfil a very important role as far as disability issues are concerned.  I meet them from time to time, and they are key participants in the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. Exactly what their role would be is a matter that would have to be thought through.  They have important functions and it will be interesting to see what role is devised for them by the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities in its forthcoming report.  There will also be an important ongoing permanent role for the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> In regard to the Council of Ministers, it is not just a question of Ministers pressing for this or that.  At EU level agreement must be reached on methods of monitoring.  Discussions are taking place at ministerial level and in sub groups to try to reach consensus on what the monitoring arrangements should be and which are appropriate to any programme.  When they have been agreed upon, my Department will be very much involved in implementing them, and I am sure any Department would take the same view.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the Minister agrees with the principle of disability proofing, although I did not hear him specifically answer Deputy Wood's question which implicitly asked that.  Is the Minister aware of a recent legislative innovation in this area in the United States called the Americans with Disabilities Act which is about three years old?  Will the Minister consider introducing a similar innovation here by way of separate legislation or by incorporating it in proposals he intends to bring before the House?  Finally, is the Minister aware that there is no single coherent definition of the term &ldquo;disability&rdquo;, and would he agree that compiling statistics in relation to it can, therefore, lead to confusion?  Does he intend to incorporate a definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in forthcoming legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my intention.  It will be difficult to introduce employment equality legislation and equal status legislation without a definition of the term &ldquo;disability&rdquo;.  That is not to say that it will be easy to fix on a definition. It has proved to be quite a difficult and complex area.  However, there will be a definition of &ldquo;disability&rdquo; in both Bills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of monitoring, there should be monitoring of any policy decided upon by the EU Commission. The point is who is to do that monitoring and how is it to be done?  It is the function of the European Commission to monitor all actions and measures which it proposes.  It is not a matter for <Col N="979" /> a Department of equality or of social affairs in any country to monitor the generality of EU material coming forward. Monitoring applies at different levels in respect of different programmes. For example, the monitoring of the Human Resources Operational Programme, which for the first time contained sections on equal opportunities for Ireland and involved the ring-fencing of moneys for particular purposes, is specifically the responsibility of my Department, and we are undertaking that monitoring responsibility. Other Departments administering other funds where this applies will do likewise.  It must be carried out at different levels and we must agree on its source.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the American Act dealing with disabilities.  The Americans dealt with the position of people with disability in one Act to the exclusion of all other groups.  It dealt with employment, equal status, equal opportunity, access to services and so on.  I considered that approach but decided against it.  It would take a long time to cover all the groups I am anxious to provide protection for.  I decided to have a divide between employment-related matters and other matters, the Bill on equal status being in the latter category.  The divide would be a functional one rather than a division between categories of people.  That is the basis on which I decided to proceed and it is the correct one.</P>
    <P>The House would wish to bring in protection for people with disabilities and for those referred to by Deputy Keogh who are discriminated against on grounds of gender, religion, race, sexual orientation, age, membership of the travelling community and so on.  That is the basis on which we are proceeding.  It has not been easy because many categories of people will be included under the legislation.  I hope the House will accept the legislation when it is introduced. The first Bill will, I hope, be published later this year.</P>

      <P>I have some idea of the figures in general but can the Minister reconcile the amount given for legal aid services with the amount for mediation and counselling in light of his statement on 25 April when he said: &ldquo;Where a marriage breaks down I am concerned that immediate resort to the law can effect a prospect of reconciliation or a voluntary settlement&rdquo;.  He proposes that mediation and counselling be given priority.  Does he accept that a great effort has been made to develop a national legal aid service and that the same effort needs to be put into developing a national counselling and mediation service if his priority, as <Col N="981" /> stated in the reply, is to be given full effect?</P>

      <P>In deference to the Chair's ruling I will not deal with the figures.  It is not correct to say and I should not have said, if I did so, that free legal aid, family mediation or marriage counselling are in any order of priority.  They all have equal priority and are important matters.  If I said one had priority over the other I should not have done so.  I doubt if I did say it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>They are important factors and fulfil different functions. Many people tend to confuse mediation with counselling.  There is a nationwide marriage counselling service available which is operated by voluntary organisations. The amount given is substantial and is much in excess of what was given in previous years.  As a result, marriage counselling organisations have been able to increase the range of their services, the number of counselling hours and the level of training.  The position with mediation is not quite as satisfactory. The amount given to this service has been doubled and will enable a second family mediation service to be opened in Limerick.  Until now there was only one in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At a committee meeting recently I said that in order to supplement that position and make some form of mediation service available at other locations throughout the country, the family mediation service intends to use where possible, the services of private mediators on a contract basis.  They will operate on this basis within the ambit <Col N="982" /> of the family mediation service.  Even if funds were available it is not possible to substantially extend and provide new family mediation centres because there are insufficient personnel available with the necessary training and professionalism. This is a comparatively new profession in Ireland.  I cannot speak highly enough of the professionalism of the available personnel in the family mediation service.  Personnel are trained both abroad and in the family mediation service.  There is only a small number of trained, skilled professional mediators in the country.  We must make the best of what we have at present.  It is the profession of the future and has an important role to play.  In time it will be necessary to have formal training and certification arrangements.</P>

      <Quest>his response to the European Commission's plans to issue a code of practice on equal pay later this year; if he has similar plans to introduce such a code here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Commission's plans to issue a code of practice on equal pay for equal work.  I have no plans to introduce a national code of practice in this area at this stage.  I am concentrating on the development of revised employment equality legislation which would strengthen existing provisions in respect of equal pay.</P>
      <P>I await with interest the outcome of the Commission's work on this subject and I will give every consideration as to how the code might assist in progressing equal pay here.  I expect at that time that the Employment Equality Agency will have had an opportunity to consider the Commission's code too.  Given my intention to strengthen the provisions relating to equality codes of practice in the forthcoming employment equality legislation, it would be possible to consider the suitability of the Commission's code of practice as the basis for a separate national measure if that would be deemed useful as an additional guide in our equal pay situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate there are difficulties in achieving progress on equal pay and my consideration of the issue is being assisted by the recent ESRI report on male female wage differentials jointly commissioned by my Department and the Employment Equality Agency.  It appears to me that, while legislation can advance the cause of equal pay, other measures will be necessary.  The importance of the role of the social partners in this regard cannot be over <Col N="984" /> emphasised and I welcome the commitment given by them in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> to implement equal pay for equal value and equality rights entitlments as provided in legislation and their agreement to consider EU developments and support voluntary initiatives at enterprise level on equal pay, equal treatment and equal opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Commission issues its code of practice on equal pay for equal work obviously the Minister will examine it.  I understand its intention is to give practical guidance for the elimination of direct and indirect sex discrimination where grading, classification and job evaluation systems are used as the basis for pay structures.  That would be very helpful.</P>
      <P>There is no need to rehearse the figures but after many years of dealing with this issue, women's pay still lags far behind.  I was a little disappointed with the Minister's response to Deputy Woods on the burden of proof.  I urge him to be more positive about the code of practice.  Again, we have to consider the question of monitoring equal pay for work of equal value, otherwise there is footdragging.  This is a valid suggestion and will the Minister look at it positively and endeavour to include it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of achieving equal pay is difficult and reports show it is unlikely to be achieved by legislation alone although, of course, legislation plays a key role.  The Wren report &mdash; to which I referred &mdash; commissioned jointly by my Department and the Employment Equality Agency showed a differential of 20 per cent when all employment is taken into account &mdash; 10 per cent of which referred to factors related to gaps in the legislation and the other 10 per cent to factors related to experience, age grouping and age profile of workers at particular levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that whatever can be done by legislation should be done and employment equality legislation will seek to fill the gaps in the existing legislation.  The <Col N="985" /> legislation will be revised.  The question of a code of practice in this area would require very careful consideration.  It would be a different position from the code of practice we discussed earlier on sexual harassment.  The code of practice on sexual harassment would tie in with the broad parameters of indirect discrimination that have evolved in law. The question of equal pay is different. The body of legislation has been developed in great detail by the tribunals and by the courts and the jurisprudence has evolved.  It will be amended and revamped in the new Bill but whether it would be appropriate or helpful to put an overlay on it giving it legal status of a code of practice which might and probably would incorporate different basis of the application of the law relating to equal pay is another matter, one that would require great caution. It is my intention that codes of practice apart from the code of practice on sexual harassment will be given some form of recognition in the Bill, if that would be helpful and appropriate having regard to the material in it.  It would be impossible to give a firm decision as to whether that would be appropriate or helpful until one sees the nature of the code and whether it would slot into the jurisprudence on equal pay that has evolved over the years.</P>
    <P>When the EU code of practice issues, I will consider it very carefully and if it is helpful I will consider giving a similar form of recognition applicable to the code of practice on sexual harassment.</P>

      <P>It is my sad responsibility to say a few words in memory of a friend of every Member of this House, the late Senator Seán Fallon, Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  I remember meeting him at Áras an Uachtaráin on the day before he fell ill with what was to be his final illness.  He was a member of the presidential commission which acted for the first time in its history in appointing a Minister in the absence of the President.  He was the same then as he always was &mdash; a man of great gentleness who had a great sense of humour but whose humour was never at anybody else's expense.  He was held in deep affection by everybody who came into contact with him.  He was a loyal member of the Fianna Fáil party to which he devoted his life.  However, he never made a remark in my hearing that was anything but fair or charitable towards others of other political persuasions.</P>
      <P>Seán Fallon loved sport.  He followed football, but the sport I most identified him with was greyhound racing, a sport with which I have some association.  He had a deep interest in that sport and in the interests of the greyhound industry. I would say it came second only to his loyalty to Fianna Fáil in terms of his priorities.  He was a frequent visitor to Shelbourne Park, Harold's Cross, Mullingar and other tracks throughout the country.  He was also interested in horse racing and was regularly seen in Kilbeggan. The race meeting at Kilbeggan will be a colder and emptier event this year because of his absence.</P>
      <P>He was a serious politician as well.  He was a man of deep conviction who spoke his mind only when he had to.  He did much of his best work behind the scenes.  He did not seek notoriety for what he did and some of his most important interventions were made in the privacy of the Fianna Fáil party rooms.  Those of us who are not members of that party will be unable, therefore, to speak about his full contribution to public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is tragic that he died at such an early age.  He was only 58.  However, he <Col N="1081" /> and his friends who mourn him can look back on a full political career during that short life.  He was first elected to the Seanad in 1981.  He was a good chairman of Westmeath County Council, an effective member of the vocational education committee in Westmeath and a truly brilliant Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  The way in which he chaired debates in that Forum was exemplary.  Obviously he had a difficult task in recent times as a result of the changes there.  Senator Fallon as Cathaoirleach is an example for all his successors, an example of a man who did his job exceptionally well.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Fine Gael party and on behalf of the Government parties &mdash; although others will speak on their behalf &mdash; I extend the deepest sympathy of the House to Senator Fallon's wife, Anne, and to his children, Pádraic, Morgan, John and Niamh.</P>

      <P>Is le brón chroí a labhraim anseo inniú ar bhás an tSeanadóra Seán Ó Fallamhain, ball de Fhianna Fáil agus Cathaoirleach an tSeanaid.  It is with profound regret I speak to this House on the death of Seán Fallon, a man of humility, forbearance and great kindness.  Our sympathies go to his wife, Anne, and to his family in this time of sadness and pain.  I thank the Taoiseach for his kind remarks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seán was very special, as the Taoiseach said, in the parliamentary party. He served with us for many years.  As a councillor representing the people of Westmeath Seán was known far and wide for his devotion to the vital work that sums up the busy life of a local representative, always trying to serve the needs of the community.  As Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, where he came to the fore on the national scene in recent years, he epitomised the style and graciousness that go with that distinguished position.  It was always abundantly clear that he was a Cathaoirleach of great fairness and courtesy.  That is not an easy position to achieve and maintain over a political lifetime.  I have heard those comments from Senators on all <Col N="1082" /> sides during the recent weeks of Senator Fallon's illness.</P>
    <P>From his first election to Westmeath County Council in 1967, Seán proceeded on the road of distinguished service. He became chairman of Westmeath County Council 21 years ago and was chairman of Athlone UDC three times.  He was first elected to the Seanad in 1981 and in the intervening 14 years continued to maintain his senatorial position with great skill and expertise. The highlight of his career was his election as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad three and a half years ago, a position he held until his recent illness.</P>
    <P>He was the very essence of what one deems to be a Senator in his respect for the House and its affairs as well as serving the network of councillors, which is central to the working of the Seanad. Seán was well known for his sporting affiliations, as the Taoiseach stated, he had an interest in all sports and was always up to date with what was happening. He also worked on behalf of the Arthritis Foundation of Ireland and many other good causes whose services he helped to develop.</P>
    <P>He served with great distinction as Fianna Fáil spokesman on Health and Social Welfare in the Seanad from 1983 to 1987 and he articulated well the deep concerns of the poor and the needy in our society.  Above all, apart from his professional expertise as a public representative and an eminent Senator, Seán Fallon will be remembered for his charming personality.  He was always a pleasure to meet, to pass the time of day with and talk about whatever was in the news.  He was a man of great gentleness and courtesy.  He always displayed a great kindness and showed that to others.</P>
    <P>He leaves to his family, friends and colleagues a legacy of style, distinction and great character.  Whether as an athlete &mdash; he received national as well as regional fame of being a tremendous athlete in his younger days &mdash; a councillor, a Senator or a member of the Council of State, Seán was a quiet achiever, carrying out his work with great dignity <Col N="1083" /> and winning universal respect.  He was a family man, and we extend our sympathies to his dear wife, Anne, his daughter, Niamh, and his sons, Pádraic, Morgan and John.</P>
    <P>We have lost on this side of the House somebody who was very much part of our party for a long time.  He played his part in many ways; helping others to get elected, being elected himself, playing a full part in party organisation and getting to the senior national position of representing a House of the Oireachtas.  His passing is a big loss to us.  We thank his family for allowing him to be with us for so long and for giving us so much in building up our party. Ar dheis láimh Dé go raibh a anam uasal agus go dtuga Dia sólás dá bhean agus dá chlann.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend our condolences to the Fallon family, who have lost a father and a husband, to the Fianna Fáil Party which has lost a most respected and senior member of that parliamentary party and to this House and the people who work in it.  He had something that is frequently lost in the heat of battle.  One can be a person of conviction and have immense loyalty to the traditions of the party to which one belongs and loves and at the same time, remain courteous, affectionate and decent in the pursuit of one's ideals.  If anybody was capable of holding with passion the values of the republican ethos which Seán Fallon saw in the Fianna Fáil Party and at the same time, being open, considerate and attentive to the values with which he may not necessarily have agreed but which he respected in others, then he was the epitome of a democratic assembly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fitting that as we gather today to welcome a new entrant to this House we say farewell to an old one.  There is a kind of democratic continuity in the process.  Seán Fallon's life is an example to all Members.  I confirm our sense of loss in the Labour Party, both in the Seanad and the Dáil, and extend our <Col N="1084" /> sympathies to the Fianna Fáil Party which has lost a great member of its parliamentary party.</P>

      <P>It is sad that we are here again within a week to mark the tragic death of another Member of the Seanad.  Indeed, the words that we used to describe Gordon Wilson are appropriate to Seán Fallon.  He was kind, gentle and caring.  Although he endured a physical illness for many years, he bore it with great courage and fortitude. He was an example to us all and he had great dignity.  Although the Government was in a minority in the Seanad, nobody in the Chair would have been as fair as Senator Fallon.</P>
      <P>Seán Fallon was always anxious to ensure that every side and point of view had a fair hearing.  He brought great dignity and authority to the office of Cathaoirleach.  It is to his great credit that there was rarely an acrimonious debate in the Seanad.  He bore his illness with great courage which cannot have been easy for a man who had been a champion athlete in his earlier years.</P>
      <P>Seán Fallon always had a kind word for everybody.  Despite the adversarial nature of politics, he did not have any critics in Leinster House, that is unique, particularly when one belongs to a political party.  To his wife Anne, his four children and his colleagues in Fianna Fáil, I extend, on my own behalf and on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, my sympathy.</P>
      <P>In <i>Julius Caesar,</i> the words spoken by Mark Antony of Brutus are appropriate when describing Seán Fallon: &ldquo;His life was gentle and the elements so mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world that this indeed is a man.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>For the second time within a week, it is our sad task to mourn the death of a distinguished Member of Seanad Éireann and to offer our sympathy to his family and our colleagues in the Upper House.  The Death of Seán Fallon is a loss not just to Seanad <Col N="1085" /> Éireann but to public life in general.  He gave nearly 30 years of his life to public office and almost 15 years to the Seanad.  He was an exceptionally able Cathaoirleach of the Seanad who showed not just skill but tact and integrity in carrying out the duties of his office.</P>
      <P>Seán Fallon was, in the purest sense of the term, a gentleman.  Despite his considerable health problems, which he bore with great fortitude, his love of life, his good humour and humanity shone out like a beacon of optimism.  He had a kind word for everyone and a genuine interest in the welfare and well-being of others.  Seán Fallon was one of those rare figures around Leinster House.  He was a political activist, fiercely loyal to his party, who won high political office and yet was a man about whom his political opponents never said an unkind word.  The warmth of the cross party tributes to him in the Dáil and the Seanad this morning is a genuine measure of the respect and affection in which he was held in this House.</P>
      <P>On behalf of Democratic Left, I extend my deepest sympathy to his wife, Anne, his sons and daughter and his colleagues in the Seanad and the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

I did not know Senator Fallon well but I always found him courteous and I appreciated his style and ability in chairing the Seanad.  He was always exemplary and I never heard an unkind word said by him or against him.  To that extent, I hold his memory fondly.  Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to sympathise with the Fallon family.  Seán married Anne in Athlone in 1966.  The following year, he entered Athlone Urban District Council and Westmeath County Council.  In the <Col N="1086" /> real sense of the word, she was his partner in all the years he devoted to public service.  Within six months of his marriage, he began his local authority career.  He spent 28 years there, three of which he served as chairman of Athlone Urban District Council &mdash; I served with him on that council &mdash; and two as chairman of Westmeath County Council.</P>
      <P>Seán Fallon's door was never closed to anybody.  When anybody knocked on it, he, Anne or their children would answer and treat that person in the same way as the highest Senator or Minister of the land who may have called to his home.  It was that sort of partnership. Many of our husbands, wives or partners who bear the burden of public office will know that was the way the Fallon household ran its life and conducted its business for those 27 years. They knew no other way.  There were no early years for Seán to test the waters.  He gave 28 years unbroken service to the citizens of his town and county and later, at a national level, served the country as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.  It is a rare person who can pay attention to the lesser difficulties of life as well as the challenges.  The attention he gave to what was his greatest difficulty at that time was as acute and diligent as his attention to many of his national duties.</P>
      <P>Seán and I were born and brought up within 100 yards of each other.  We spent our childhood and early adulthood together.  There is a three months difference in our ages.  We joined Macra Fáil when we were 13 so that we could do our bit for the party.  I remember the early and later years with great affection because we were both striving for the one thing.  During those years harmony did not always exist in debates.  We went into public life together in the election to the local authority and we joined the Seanad together in 1981.  Seán got great fulfilment in the Seanad, of which he always spoke so highly, while I gained fulfilment in the Dáil.  From then on our lives converged as the tension was removed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1087" /> He was everything which Members have said.  He was a gentle person who gave sound advice during difficult times. He served his party to extraordinary lengths.  He was also a great sportsman at provincial and national level.  He was an athlete of great note and a basketball player of high repute and renown.  It must have been difficult for him, as others have said, to cope with the physical disabilities from which he suffered in later life, especially having been so fleet of foot.  However, he coped with grace, as he did with all the pressures of life. When the party met to enjoy itself, for example, after the election of a chairman, Seán would sing the Count John McCormack song, <i>The Tumble-down Shack in Athlone,</i> with a fine voice and spirit.  I know he will be remembered in his beloved town of Athlone.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGrath</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to be associated with the kind remarks made about the late Seán Fallon.  I have known Senator Fallon for many years.  I served with him on Westmeath County Council and as an Oireachtas representative.  Seán was always a warm, friendly and kind man and no matter how busy he might be, he always found time for a chat, particularly about local issues.  He was highly regarded by all who knew him.</P>
      <P>An accomplished sportsman in his youth, he maintained a keen interest in sport, particularly dog and horse racing. He enjoyed his visits to Kilbeggan racecourse where he could always be relied upon to produce a tip.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Seán Fallon was an astute politician and I must confess that I turned to him regularly for advice about local and national issues.  He will be a great loss to the Fianna Fáil party at local and national level.  Any political party would have been proud to have had Seán Fallon as one of its members.  He was one of nature's gentlemen, an honourable public representative and a fair minded man.  He was so courteous that if he was a Member of this House your job, Sir, would probably be redundant.  The Fallon family have lost a loyal husband and <Col N="1088" /> a devoted father.  Westmeath has lost an honourable public representative and our country has lost an honourable statesman.</P>
    <P>I extend my sympathy to his wife, Anne, and his family.  Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">

      <P>I want to be associated with the kind and deserved tributes paid to our colleague, Senator Seán Fallon. It was with deep regret and a huge sense of shock and loss that I heard this morning of the untimely death of our wonderful parliamentary colleague.</P>
      <P>Seán was a man of the highest integrity and dignity and he had the unusual distinction of being a politician about whom an unkind word could not be said.  He had friends across the political spectrum.  He was a great colleague and a person in whom a young politician, such as myself in the early 1980s, could confide.  His advice was sought by politicians of all affiliations, particularly at county council level.  He was an excellent member of Westmeath County Council to which he was first elected in 1967.  His impartiality and fairness was clearly demonstrated when he held the position of chairman of Westmeath County Council.</P>
      <P>Senator Fallon was a sincere friend who served his party, Fianna Fáil, all his life with great loyalty.  He was also an excellent listener to the views expressed by politicians of the other political parties. His popularity at local level was reflected in his return at each election to Westmeath County Council and Athlone Urban District Council since 1967.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was a wily campaigner on the Seanad election trail which is the toughest political campaign trail of all.  He always said his greatest honour was his unanimous election as Cathaoirleach of the Seanad which also made him a member of the Council of State.  He was an extremely able and efficient Cathaoirleach and had great respect for all the Members of the House, as they had for him.  This was eloquently expressed this morning in the tributes <Col N="1089" /> paid to him in the Seanad.  He had unending courtesy and charm.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Midland Health Board, Seán Fallon made excellent contributions to the development of the health schemes in the midland region and he subscribed to the importance of the principle that people are the most important.  He had a wonderful sense of humour and exuded great personal warmth.  As has already been stated, he was a brilliant sportsman who excelled at both athletics and Gaelic football.  Like me, he was a great follower of Gaelic games in County Westmeath and he proudly captained the Westmeath minor football team.  He was a frequent visitor to Shelbourne Park and Mullingar greyhound track.  Recently, he gave me some invaluable advice on the purchase of a greyhound pup which I was contemplating. He had a wealth of information both at political and sporting level which he frequently proffered.  As my colleagues said, we often met him at Kilbeggan races and the latest &ldquo;hot&rdquo; information would be exchanged about the likely winners. He would later tell us about the impact which the ground had on the certainty he had given us.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil has lost a great ambassador and we have lost a valuable friend. As a member of the local authorities, Seanad Éireann, the Presidential Commission and the Council of State, he made a valuable contribution to the function of our political institutions.  He was a true gentleman in every sense of the word and he carried the mantle of high office in a quiet and unassuming way.  He represented the people of Athlone fearlessly for the past 28 years and they will miss him.</P>
    <P>I extend my sincere and deepepst sympathy to his wife, Anne, his sons and daughter and his parliamentary colleagues in Fianna Fáil.</P>

As a young man Seán was a very fine athlete.  He played minor football for Westmeath and later played basketball for Ireland.  Though he excelled in sports his prowess in the political world was even greater.  On behalf of the Independent Deputies, I extend my sincere sympathy to his widow and family.

I appreciated Seán for what he was &mdash; a man of the highest integrity and honesty.  We are all the poorer for his passing.  May he rest in peace.</P>

    <P>In compliance with Standing Order 142 of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business, I have to announce that at the by-election held on 29 June 1995, consequent on the death of Deputy Johnny Fox, the following Member has been elected to the Dáil constituency of Wicklow, Mildred Fox.</P>

Obviously Members were deeply saddened at the death of her father who was recognised as someone of immense decency and conviction and who represented something very special, not just to the people of Wicklow but to the people of Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that Deputy Mildred Fox has been elected to the House on her own account and because of her campaign and the effective way she conveyed her message to the people of Wicklow.

I entered the Dáil at the same age &mdash; I am a few years older now &mdash; and I want to assure Deputy Fox that it is a nice place.  The events in Wicklow in recent weeks do not represent what happens here.  It was an outstanding achievement and I congratulate the new Deputy and her campaigners.

She had a spectacular victory and I would say that she and I were the happiest people last Friday.  I could also <Col N="1092" /> include the person who had backed her at eight to one &mdash; I do not know if it was a Member.</P>
      <P>She is the 22nd female Member of Dáil Éireann.  Everyone thought it was specatular when 20 women were elected in the last election but two more female Deputies have been elected in the meantime in by-elections.  I join the Taoiseach and Deputy Ahern in wishing her well.  Her father made a major impact during his short time in the Dáil and I am certain she is more than capable not just of following in his footsteps but of representing the voters of Wicklow.  Joining as an independent Deputy is never easy but I know she will get great co-operation from all sides if she requires it.  I wish her a long and successful career in Leinster House.</P>

This is an historic occasion in that it is only the third time in the history of this House that an Independent won a by-election &mdash; this is no reflection on the other women Deputies &mdash; but I think this is the first Independent lady to be so elected.  It is also an historic day for me in that I have had the privilege and honour of presenting to the Ceann Comhairle two of the Independent Deputies elected in by-elections.</P>
      <P>I asked the House to remember that the changes are not necessarily in the interests of our democratic process.  If they are not we Independents and those in the parties particularly need to sit up and take notice.  There is a lesson to be learnt from this because there was another independent, a very strong runner, in this election as well.  Keep it in mind and see if you can do better because the writing is on the wall.</P>

      <Col N="1093" /> During the campaign we tend to dismiss the Opposition but there can be no doubt we had a quality race in Wicklow. For that reason her victory is all the more remarkable.  Deputy Harney referred to the fact that Deputy Fox is the 22nd woman in the House.  We want more women and more young people in the House.  Deputy Fox has scored on the double on this occasion.  She has joined the club of 22 and I hope she has more luck with it than I had with mine. The role of an independent Deputy can become a lonely one.  If it becomes too troublesome or lonely she should consult her neighbour.</P>

All the Deputies representing County Wicklow worked well together in her father's time and I know we will work well together in the Deputy's time also. I am sure she will perform well but that she will find it difficult in the beginning; we all did and we all survived.  It is significant that we have an extra woman Deputy in the Dáil and that the balance is getting ever better.  Youth has as much right to be represented here as age and that is important in relation to the Deputy's victory.

In the past, the Deputies in Wicklow have co-operated constructively outside the cut and thrust of politics.  I have no doubt that co-operation will extend to Deputy Fox.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Violence in the home is an abomination. It affects the welfare and safety of adults and children and makes life a living hell for its too many victims.  People in their homes have the right to enjoy themselves without violence whether that violence is actual or threatened, physical or mental.  The problem is complex and the causes are many and varied.  The perpetrators are normally men and the victims women and children. It is a problem which transcends all classes and areas, city and provincial. The Domestic Violence Bill is about providing a proper legal framework to deal with the civil law aspects but it incorporates in addition new powers of arrest for gardaí.  It repeals and re-enacts with substantial amendments the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981.</P>
      <P>The most widely availed of remedy in the area of domestic violence is the civil law remedy of a barring order which was introduced in 1976.  Prior to that, the main civil law remedy available was an injunction in the High Court or Circuit Court.  The barring order remedy was a radical innovation at the time, although it was, and continues to be, limited to violence by a spouse against the other spouse and children.  The absence of legal aid in earlier years meant that for practical purposes recourse to the law was not available to everyone.  The introduction of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice in 1979 was, therefore, of major importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, strengthened the law on barring orders, following representations by various women's organisations.  The main changes made were the extension of the District Court's time limit from three months to 12 months, the granting of a <Col N="1099" /> statutory power of arrest without warrant to the gardaí for breaches of orders and the creation of a new type of order called a protection order.  Protection orders were designed to provide immediate protection for the applicant spouse or child pending the determination of the barring order application. They fell short of barring the offending spouse from the family home.</P>
    <P>Of relevance also as a remedy for violence against women in the home is the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989.  Among the grounds on which a decree of judicial separation may be granted are the unreasonable behaviour of one spouse towards the other.  In separation proceedings, the court may grant a barring order or a protection order and the court may confer on one spouse the right to occupy the family home subject to such conditions as it thinks proper or it may transfer ownership of the home to the other spouse in suitable cases.</P>
    <P>Facts about the operation of the barring orders procedures may also help to inform debate on the Bill.  Court statistics reveal that the average annual number of applications to the courts over the past three years was 4,365 and the number of decrees granted was 2,248.  This appears to indicate at first sight that just over one-half of applications for barring orders result in the granting of orders and that the courts show a marked reluctance to grant orders.  However, further analysis reveals that a good number of applicants withdraw their applications or fail to turn up for the court hearing.</P>
    <P>The experience of the Legal Aid Board is that 90 per cent of those who turn up in the District Court for the hearing of their applications for barring orders are successful and that the vast majority of orders granted are for the full 12 months period.  The reasons victims do not proceed with their applications vary.  It may be because of intimidation by the other spouse; it may be because of a genuine change in circumstances where the respondent <Col N="1100" /> spouse stops the violence; it may be that the applicant spouse does not want to go as far as to have the respondent barred from the home, or it may be that the victim spouse is prepared to give the respondent another chance.  We obviously need to be careful in amending the law in this area to ensure that change will be for the best in what is a very complicated area involving family and other relationships, high emotions and, most importantly, circumstances in which the protection of life itself may be at stake.</P>
    <P>In 1987 the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) (Amendment) Bill was initiated in the House.  This was intended to permit granting a long term protection order as a final remedy in appropriate cases of family violence or ill-treatment.  The Bill was eventually withdrawn because of opposition from women's organisations, based on the fear that if the Bill were enacted the courts might almost invariably take the &ldquo;soft option&rdquo; of granting a protection order instead of a barring order, thus diminishing the existing legal protection for victims of family violence.</P>
    <P>The one feature of the barring order remedy which has been most often criticised is that it is confined to inter-spousal violence.  Increasingly, over the years, patterns of social behaviour have changed &mdash; many households are established on the basis of non-marital arrangements.  It has also become clear that domestic violence is not confined in the main to spouses or indeed cohabitants; it can occur between parents and children, brothers and sisters, and other members of households.  The Government accepts that the law in this area needs to be updated in the light of these realities and, as part of its programme of family law reform, is committed to the changes now provided for in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The law in relation to the protection of victims of domestic violence has been the subject of various recommendations and submissions from, for example, the Law Reform Commission in its report on child sexual abuse, the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the <Col N="1101" /> Kilkenny incest investigation team and groups like AIM and Women's Aid.  A number of groups have sought the extension of barring orders to cohabitants. Many have advocated more widespread availability of protection orders &mdash; not as an interim measure pending the granting of a barring order as at present &mdash; but as an alternative remedy in its own right.  Other groups point to the lack of support available to victims who are faced with the trauma of having to seek protection and recommend that outside agencies should be given a role in such cases.  Women's Aid has complained of the difficulties involved in obtaining a barring order where emotional rather than physical violence is involved and it expresses concern about the restrictive nature of the powers of arrest without warrant which the Garda have in dealing with violent domestic incidents.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the result of a comprehensive review of the civil law in relation to the protection of persons from domestic violence which I have carried out in my Department.  All of the criticisms which have been levelled at the present system have been taken into account in the course of my review.  I am most grateful for the information which has been put at my disposal by the various organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>As I said the Bill is for the most part about the civil law aspects of domestic violence.  Criminal law sanctions are, of course, also available.  Despite the presence of those criminal sanctions, the practice here, as in other countries, is that spouses seek, for the most part, recourse to the civil law rather than the criminal law.  This is not difficult to understand.  The criminal law is a blunt instrument which is primarily intended to punish the offender.  Many victims of domestic violence are not interested in imprisonment as the solution &mdash; they want the violence to stop, and may even wish to continue to reside with the offender.  The primary aim of civil law legislation on the matter should be to provide protection for victims in a flexible way which takes account of their <Col N="1102" /> differing needs.  This Bill aims to do that but it strengthens the force of the law and is intended to reflect the abhorrence with which society rightly condemns violence in the home.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the details of the Bill. Section 1 defines a number of terms for the purposes of the Bill, one of which, the definition of &ldquo;welfare&rdquo;, I should like to explain further.  That definition makes clear that the word includes mental and emotional welfare in addition to physical welfare.  This will help allay a perception among some groups that actual physical violence is a necessary prerequisite to the granting of a barring order.</P>
    <P>Section 2 introduces a new type of order to be called a safety order.  It will in effect be a long term protection order.  The 1981 Act empowers the court to grant a protection order between the making of an application for a barring order and its determination. It does not bar a spouse from the family home, but prohibits that spouse from using or threatening to use violence against, molesting or putting in fear the applicant spouse or a child.  The new safety order may be granted in its own right and not as an interim measure and may, in addition, prohibit a respondent who does not actually reside with the applicant from watching or besetting the residence.  Such a remedy may prove to be sufficient protection in those cases where the victim may not want a spouse barred from the home but wishes nevertheless to have the protection of a court order.  The reports of the Second Commission on the Status of Women and the Kilkenny incest investigation team recommend that provision be made for the granting of orders of this nature.</P>
    <P>Section 2 provides that a safety order procedure will be available to persons in domestic relationships.  It will be available on the application of a spouse against the other spouse, a cohabitant against the other cohabitant, a parent against an adult child and an adult person against any other adult person who resides with him or her.  The term &ldquo;cohabitant&rdquo; is not used in the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> That class of person is referred to technically in various sections of the Bill as a person who is not the spouse of the respondent but has lived with the respondent as husband or wife.  In the case of a safety order it must be for a period of at least six months in aggregate during the period of 12 months immediately prior to the application.</P>
    <P>Violence in the home is not confined to violence by one spouse against another or children.  It transcends all relationships.  For this reason I have provided that the safety order remedy will be widely available.  An exception is made where the relationship is primarily contractual in order to ensure that the remedy is confined to what are genuine domestic disputes and does not, for example, become a feature of disputes between landlords and tenants for which there are adequate alternative legal remedies.  Of course, the nature of a relationship may change over time from being primarily contractual to primarily non-contractual.  Each case will have to be decided by the court on its merits and subsection (1) (b) sets out some factors to which the court must have regard in reaching a conclusion. These factors include, for example, the amount of rent paid and the nature of any duties performed by one person on behalf of the other.</P>
    <P>The section also contains a range of ancillary provisions in relation to safety orders.  It provides for the variation of orders on the application of any of the parties concerned.  The duration of a safety order granted by the District Court is limited to five years renewable on application for a further five years and the Circuit Court will have unlimited jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Provision is made to ensure that the type of objections which arose when attempts were made to introduce safety order type legislation in 1987 will not arise again.  Accordingly, section 2 prohibits the court from granting a safety order where the applicant applies for a barring order.  The same will also apply <Col N="1104" /> in reverse &mdash; the court will be prohibited from granting a barring order where the applicant applies for a safety order.  This will give the applicant a degree of control over the proceedings, which, according to my Department's research, victims perceive to be lacking in such cases.  The court may, of course, consider the alternatives of a safety or a barring order where the applicant chooses to apply for both remedies in the same proceedings.</P>
    <P>I am providing in section 17 that breach of a safety order will be punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to £1,500 or imprisonment for up to one year, or both.</P>
    <P>Section 3 in general re-enacts the barring order procedure while providing in addition that the remedy will be available to a wider class of persons than spouses and their children.  The effect of a barring order will remain &mdash; it will operate to bar a person from entering his or her home.</P>
    <P>The class of persons who may apply for a barring order is being extended to cohabitants one against the other and the remedy will be available also to a parent against an adult child.  In so far as cohabitants are concerned, they must, under section 3, have lived with the respondent as husband or wife for a continuous period of at least six months during the period of seven months immediately prior to the application.</P>
    <P>Subsection (4) of section 3 is intended to protect the rights of property owners which the State and its laws must respect under the Constitution.  Except where the applicant and respondent are spouses, the court will not be able to bar a respondent with an ownership interest in the property unless the applicant also has an equivalent ownership interest.  I am advised that a proposal to bar a respondent with an ownership interest on the application of a person with any lesser interest could be open to serious constitutional challenge on the basis that it may infringe that person's property rights which the State in its laws must respect under Article 40.3 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1105" /> The position is different where the parties are married &mdash; an infringement of a spouse's property rights is presumed to be justified on the basis that the rights of the family founded on marriage are protected by the Constitution and take precedence over property rights.  The difficulty was recognised in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  It is not a difficulty with which many people may be impressed and it is something which may, following further examination and debate, require attention to ensure that the interests of justice and a proper balance of interests prevails.</P>
    <P>Subsection (5) contains a general saver which protects the rights of persons other than the applicant or respondent who have a legal or beneficial interest in the dwelling.  For example, the fact that an applicant has succeeded in having a respondent barred from a property will not render him or her immune from ejectment proceedings instigated by the landlord for non-payment of rent.</P>
    <P>The maximum duration of a barring order granted by the District Court will be three years as opposed to one year at present.  Breach of a barring order will, under section 17, be an offence punishable on summary conviction by a fine of up to £1,500 or imprisonment for up to one year or both.  This is an increase on the present sanction of a fine of up to £200 or imprisonment for up to six months, or both.</P>
    <P>Section 4 empowers the court to make an interim barring order in emergency situations and on an <i>ex-parte</i> basis if necessary.  This power will significantly increase the ability of the courts to react quickly in situations of domestic violence.  The section empowers the court to grant, subject to certain conditions, an interim barring order pending the determination of an application for a barring order.  Such interim orders may be granted without notice to the respondent where the court considers it expedient in the interests of justice to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1106" /> Nevertheless, it is important to guard against the danger of a misconceived or malicious application particularly when one considers that a respondent could be barred from the home on the basis of an allegation which he or she has had no opportunity to refute.  For this reason the granting of such orders is confined to extreme cases, that is cases where there is evidence that there is an imminent risk of significant harm to an applicant or dependent person if the order is not made immediately; it is likely that any delay will cause fear or trauma which will deter the applicant from proceeding with an application; and the court is satisfied that a protection order will provide insufficient protection.</P>
    <P>Section 5 re-enacts section 3 of the 1981 Act and provides for the granting of a protection order pending the determination of an application for a barring order and is in substance the same as the protection order procedure under existing law, except that it may also be ordered pending the determination of an application for the new safety order that is provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 6 is a significant new provision which allows a health board to apply for a barring order or a safety order on behalf of a victim of domestic violence.  Such provision has been recommended by the Law Reform Commission and the Kilkenny incest investigation team.  The health board will be obliged to consult with the victim before applying for a barring or safety order.  Subsection (1) specifies the circumstances in which a health board can apply for a safety or a barring order. The section applies where a health board (a) becomes aware of an incident or incidents which in its opinion puts into doubt the safety or welfare of the victim; (b) has reasonable cause to believe that the victim has been subjected to violence or otherwise put in fear of his or her safety or welfare; (c) has reasonable grounds for believing that the victim, or parent of a child victim, would be deterred or prevented from applying for a barring or a safety order; and (d) considers it appropriate <Col N="1107" /> to apply for an order having ascertained as far as reasonably practicable the wishes of the victim or parent of the victim.</P>
    <P>An aim of the section also is to allow a child stay in its home where possible and to have the perpetrators of violence rather than the child removed from the home.  However, in making any order where children are concerned the court will have to be satisfied that there remains a parent in the home who is willing and able to provide reasonable care for the child.  This will avoid a situation where a child could be left in the home with a parent whose capacity or willingness to provide care is suspect.</P>
    <P>Section 7 empowers the court to adjourn proceedings for a barring or a safety order which affects the welfare of the child where it considers that a care order or a supervision order under the Child Care Act might provide a more appropriate remedy.  It may order a health board to investigate circumstances with a view to arriving at the best possible solution in the child's interests.  The objective here is to ensure that the barring or safety order solutions are not viewed in isolation but are considered against the backdrop of other services which can be provided by a health board.</P>
    <P>Many of the remaining provisions of the Bill are based on the provisions of the 1981 Act and mirror those provisions closely.  There are some important exceptions, however, with which I intend to deal specifically.</P>
    <P>Section 9 empowers the court to deal with maintenance, barring, family home protection and child care applications in the one set of proceedings.  This provision reflects the fact that the problem of domestic violence is often intertwined with a variety of other problems. For example, a wife who is being abused by her husband may also find herself in the position that she is unable to obtain maintenance from him for herself and her children.  The purpose of this section is to allow the court to deal with all of these matters as a package.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> Section 13 provides for the discharge of orders on the application of any of the parties concerned.  The court will not be empowered to discharge an order unless it is of the opinion that the safety and welfare of the victim is no longer at issue.  This represents a stronger test than the safety or welfare test which is currently applied.  If the courts are asked to discharge an order which was originally made on safety grounds, they must be satisfied that the mental and emotional welfare of the victim as well as his or her physical safety no longer requires it.</P>
    <P>Section 16 requires that civil proceedings under the Bill should be heard in private as is the case under the 1981 Act and under other family law legislation. This provision will not apply to proceedings for breaches of orders which will continue to be subject to the general criminal law provisions and be heard in open court.  The section also provides that civil proceedings under the Bill shall be informal as is practicable and consistent with the administration of justice and that judges and barristers in such proceedings shall not wear wigs or gowns.</P>
    <P>I have already indicated that section 17 of the Bill makes contravention of orders under the Bill a criminal offence and that the fine and term of imprisonment will be higher than under the present law in the 1981 Act.  The gardaí will continue to have a power of arrest without warrant for breaches of barring and protection orders and that power is being extended to the new safety order and interim barring order procedures.</P>
    <P>The powers of arrest without warrant of the Garda in domestic violence situations are unclear.  The Garda can arrest for breaches of barring and protection orders but where those orders do not exist and violence has occurred they are not in a position to arrest for many of the acts of violence which occur.  The difficulty arises because of the common law distinctions between felonies and misdemeanours.  Section 18 (2) makes clear that a power of arrest without warrant will exist for offences of assault <Col N="1109" /> occasioning actual bodily harm or grievous bodily harm.</P>
    <P>The Garda will have power, if need be by force, to enter any place where they suspect the perpetrator to be.  At present when the Garda are called to a scene of domestic violence they may not be able to gain entry.  The perpetrator may have forced or convinced the victim not to let the Garda in.  Scenes of domestic violence are difficult, but too often it may be said the Garda are not in a position to investigate fully the violence against the victim, be it adult or children, and this new provision in the law to enter by force, if necessary, is deemed essential by the gardaí and the victims of violence.</P>
    <P>These are the main provisions of the Bill.  Other Departments as well as my own have responsibilities in relation to the problems of domestic violence.  The Department of the Environment makes special provision for the housing of victims of domestic violence, the Department of Health provides, through health boards, financial assistance to organisations involved in providing assistance to victims, and is also responsible for reform of the law in relation to the care of children.  The Department of Justice has responsibility for the criminal law and the Garda Síochána operates special policies to deal with domestic violence.</P>
    <P>Counselling, for funding which my Department has responsibility, must continue to have a part to play.  Over the past two years I have more than doubled State funding to the many groups who are engaged in marriage counselling throughout the country.  The aim is to give a boost to these organisations with a view to enabling them, where possible, to expand and develop their services.  It is my intention to continue to address in a legislative and non-legislative manner the problem of marriage breakdown &mdash; a problem that includes domestic violence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill which is timely, if not overdue.  I am glad it has come before the House at this time and we are happy to support its passage.</P>
      <P>One of the greatest tragedies a family can face is to be caught up in a cycle of domestic violence.  The home instead of being a source of security and strength becomes a place of terror for the weaker spouse and children.  People of either gender can be violent and abusive, but we must acknowledge that the vast majority of incidents of domestic violence involve abuse being perpetrated by men on women and children.</P>
      <P>Domestic violence of any sort is unacceptable.  It is imperative that the law must act to protect the victims who suffer not only physical violence but also psychological trauma.  Last year in Dublin almost 1,000 battered women sought refuge in Eastern Health Board shelters.  They were too terrified to return home.  Women's Aid expects to receive some 10,000 calls for help and advice this year.  The attacks include blows to the head, fractures, lacerations, horrific beatings, assaults with knives and rape.</P>
      <P>Many viewers were shocked and affronted by the brutality of family life experienced by women in Dublin which was graphically illustrated in the television programme based on Roddy Doyle's story entitled &ldquo;The Family&rdquo;. However, for many women that type of domestic violence is sad reality.  Their cry for help must be heard and must be met by an urgent response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past 15 years a valuable network of women's refuges and family support centres has developed around the country.  They provide important services for women and children.  They offer a life saving service to women who are at high risk of abuse from violent partners.  It the network of refuges were developed and provided with medical, legal and child care support and facilities, women and children would not <Col N="1111" /> have to put up with assault or sexual abuse.  This Bill which extends the law on barring and protection orders and introduces safety orders greatly improves the measures at our disposal to tackle and guard against domestic violence.</P>
    <P>The Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981 marked an important step for our society in acknowledging the existence of domestic violence and in providing some protection for spouses and children.</P>
    <P>As a society we took domestic violence from behind closed doors and gave its victims the protection of the law which they previously lacked.  In its time the 1981 Act served our community well.  However, in the 15 years since its enactment the ongoing problem of domestic violence has not gone away.  The experiences gained under the operation of the 1981 Act and the changing nature of society today make this Bill timely and necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil wholeheartedly welcomes the legislation which was originally proposed by a Fianna Fáil-Labour Government to strengthen the protection available to the victims of domestic violence and to recognise the wide range of people in different domestic situations who may be subjected to it.  In particular, Fianna Fáil welcomes the introduction of the safety order.  Domestic violence is a complex social issue and while it may seem contrary to good sense, in many circumstances women feel they cannot leave abusive partners.  To walk away from an abusive partner is justifiable but it has inevitable, serious and potentially devastating consequences for all members of the family involved. Many women cannot or will not seek barring orders against their husbands as they would have the effect of breaking up their families and depriving their children of their father.  The figures outlined by the Minister highlight that reaction by women.  Many women in violent relationships want to preserve the relationship but to stop the violence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> Any legal system designed to benefit and protect the victims of domestic violence should meet the needs of those victims and provide a range of remedies so that the victim can choose the one most appropriate to her circumstances.</P>
    <P>The proposed safety order prevents the use of threat of violence against a partner or dependent child but does not have the additional effect of barring the respondent from the family home.  This is a major improvement on the 1981 Act as a woman will be no longer faced with the stark choice of barring her husband and possibly breaking up the family or continuing to endure a violent relationship. The introduction of the safety order provides a mechanism whereby the integrity and unity of a family may be preserved while allowing that family to resolve its problems in an atmosphere that does no threaten or imtimidate any member of the family.  This law provides for an immediate and effective remedy that will not devastate the household it is intended to protect.  Importantly, and correctly, the barring order has been retained as a remedy for cases where the victim of violence believes it is necessary to remove the offender from the family home to ensure the safety of her and her children.</P>
    <P>While the Bill provides this useful and worthy mechanism it fails to go further and address the root causes of domestic violence.  We have come a long way since domestic violence was suffered and endured in silence behind closed doors by women and children who were too afraid or ashamed to speak out.  As a society we must acknowledge the unacceptable incidence of domestic violence in our community.  We have, through this and previous legislation, provided some measure of redress and protection for the victims of violence. Unfortunately, this Bill has failed to go further, to look behind the awful facts of domestic violence and to address the reason for it.</P>
    <P>The abuse of alcohol is traditionally one of the main causes of domestic violence. Many a mother has endured verbal abuse and physical violence in the <Col N="1113" /> interests of the family.  She frequently did this in the belief that the drinking bouts would be eventually controlled and peace restored to the household. Unfortunately, the alcoholic will normally be the last to realise that he or she has a serious problem.  The shock of a barring order may often help in the process of facing reality and the damage and abuse being suffered by the family. The introduction of the safety order provides an earlier and less severe remedy and protection against a violent partner.  The purpose of this new measure is to provide for early and immediate action when domestic violence occurs.  It is designed to nip trouble in the bud and help to keep the family together.  Women or children should not have to endure domestic violence or abuse.  This new protection is our response and it should be used without hesitation to stop this cowardly and revolting practice.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the law provides immediate protection for the victims of violence and abuse, but we should also try to prevent that violence and abuse in the first place.  As the law stands it will perpetuate a cycle of violence followed by legal intervention.  We know from experience that women seek protection from the same men on many occasions.  We know that a man who is violent in one relationship is likely to form successive violent relationships. The intervention of the law to protect one victim may merely transfer that violence to another victim.  Protecting the victims must be our first priority but preventing the creation of new victims must follow closely.</P>
    <P>It is time society faced up to this responsibility, faced the perpetrators of domestic violence and forced them to address their behaviour in an effort to change.  We must provide treatment, counselling and therapy for them and ensure the children and adolescents do not come to regard domestic violence as a normal aspect of family life or to accept that there is a level of violence that should be tolerated within the home.  We must reach the victims of <Col N="1114" /> violence, particularly children caught up in violent and abusive families and ensure they receive the necessary support to break out of this cycle of violence.</P>
    <P>We should also recognise that in some cases the protection of the law may not be enough to ensure the safety of a woman or children and that many victims of violence live in terror that the offender will break a court order and return to attack her.  It is essential that adequate funding is available to provide refuges and shelters for the victims of violence.  There must be adequate support systems so that a victim of violence can seek help without losing dignity.</P>
    <P>Therefore, while I welcome the Bill because it strengthens the framework of legal protection available for the victims of violence, I again emphasise that providing the necessary legal structures addresses only part of the problem of domestic violence.  We must also provide educational and social structures that are adequately funded to protect, counsel and support the family to break the cycle of violence.  It is regrettable that the opportunity was not grasped in this legislation to tackle the broader issues surrounding domestic violence.</P>
    <P>Some provisions of the Bill are unnecessarily restrictive and deprive groups of people of the protection they may require.  In general I welcome the extension of the right to apply for a barring or safety order to people other than the spouse of the respondent.  For the first time this provides protection for the parents of adult children and for cohabitees.  However, I notice it is intended that a spouse, a cohabitee, or the parent of a respondent only may apply for a barring order under section 3.  This appears to mean that the father of a violent man, living in the family home, can apply to have him barred but that the sister of that man, also living in the family home, cannot.  This is unnecessarily restrictive and there does not appear to be any reasonable ground for drawing this distinction.</P>
    <P>I note also that under section 3 the court cannot make a barring order &mdash; if <Col N="1115" /> the parties are not married to each other &mdash; where the respondent owns the place in which they live or owns a greater share than the applicant.  We are aware that economic dependency often renders it very difficult for the victims of violence to escape from an abusive situation.  It seems illogical to deny someone the protection of the law because they are economically vulnerable. Surely the physical safety of the victims of violence should take priority over economic considerations?  In this respect, is the Minister constrained by constitutional guarantees relating to property?  From what he said in his introductory remarks, it appears that he is.  Perhaps this matter can be examined further before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>My party welcomes the increase in the penalties on summary conviction &ldquo;to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both&rdquo; for breaches of barring and protection orders and their extension to breaches of the new safety orders since almost every breach of a barring or safety order involves violence and threats.  Those assaults are not dealt with specifically in this Bill but fall to be dealt with under the general criminal law.  It is time we made it clear that a physical assault is a criminal act whether it occurs in the home or elsewhere.  The Bill only provides for penalties on summary conviction.  I trust this will not prevent the perpetrators of domestic assaults being prosecuted for the serious criminal offences such assaults represent.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the new powers of the Garda in cases of domestic violence &mdash; to arrest without a warrant.  This will include persons in breach of a safety or barring order, or whenever he assaults someone who would be entitled to the protection of a safety or barring order. It allows the Garda to enter, without a search warrant, the place where the perpetrator of such violence is to arrest him; they can act immediately, a very important development.  However, if <Col N="1116" /> and when a violent man is arrested when assaulting a woman, will he be turned loose from the Garda Station, free on bail, half an hour later to finish where he had left off?  The remedies, penalties and new powers of the Garda encompassed in this Bill will not be effective without implementing sensible improvements in the operation of our bail laws.  These and other issues can be discussed in detail on Committee Stage. The Minister has already voiced his concerns in this respect.</P>
    <P>We welcomed and support the introduction of this important Bill.  Domestic violence is often a hidden scourge of women and family life and its victims deserve the best protection the law can offer.  This Bill will ensure that such protection is immediate, effective and real. Domestic violence is entirely unacceptable.  This Bill, conceived by the Fianna Fáil-Labour Coalition Government should, and I believe will, have the support of every Member.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill represent an extremely significant reform, offering an enormously strengthened degree of protection to women living within violent relationships. In protecting women, they will also protect children.  For those reasons I commend the Minister on the introduction of this Bill and whole-heartedly support it on my own behalf and that of my party.  I also commend the Minister on having engaged in widespread consultation in its drafting.  Such consultation is essential, particularly in this area, when we must always listen to and deal with those people daily involved with the problem.  The Bill must be all the better for such varied thorough consultation.</P>
      <P>Violence against women is a social evil of the worst kind.  It is a violation of women's human rights, causing serious, often permanent, physical and pscyhological harm to the women and childen affected by it.  It occurs right across the social spectrum yet, because it occurs behind closed doors, is one of the most difficult crimes to detect and prevent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1117" /> There are no national statistics on the levels of domestic violence.  However, voluntary organisations working in the field are in no doubt that the levels are appalling.  Women's Aid, which operates a free-telephone line received 10,000 calls in the first half of this year. In the first year of its existence, the Garda special domestic violence and sexual assault unit in Dublin received over 5,000 calls.  Those figures are horrifying in the light of international experience showing that between 10 and 15 per cent only of women assaulted by their partner will report the offence.</P>
    <P>Over many years the social attitudes to domestic violence, including those of the police, legal profession and legislators, conspired to serve the interests of the abusing man and not those of abused women and-or their children. For years the family home was seen as the man's personal fiefdom in which his power was absolute.  Behind its doors the man of the house was perceived to have had absolute rights over his wife and children, which included the right to assault them if he wished.  Women who were assaulted by their husbands were expected to put up with it; if they left their husbands they were seen to have abandoned their marriage vows.  Indeed stories abound of women who, having been assaulted were sent back to their husbands by their own families.  Conversely, women who remained with their abusing husbands, usually out of economic necessity, were perceived by many either to have asked for it or to be a weird person who got a thrill out of being beaten up.  Those attitudes are alive and well and remain a major underlying factor in continuing problems of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>As we have already heard, as recently as 1981 the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, introduced new legal remedies, including a protection order which prohibited a man from threatening violence against his wife and a barring order excluding him from the family home.  While such remedies were welcome and necessary in so far as they went, they applied only <Col N="1118" /> to cases where the parties were married to each other; people cohabiting as husband and wife, or other persons living together in a domestic arrangement were not protected by the provisions of that Act.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it will clearly be seen that this Bill represents a highly significant, legal reform, addressing the deficiency in the 1981 Act for the first time.  For that reason alone it is a most welcome, necessary measure.  However, I want to sound a note of caution.  Domestic violence is a problem that will not, and never can, be solved by legislative action alone.  The provisions of the Bill will not prevent domestic violence in the first place, its incidence will be reduced only by attitudinal change.  Unfortunately, this Bill will do nothing to assist those thousands of women whose only means of escape from an abusive relationship is through the front door. This Bill will be of the utmost assistance to women with resources, educated women, who can afford to hire a lawyer and get an emergency court hearing, perhaps on the day following such an assault.  It will be of no pracitical assistance to women in disadvantaged economic circumstances, unable to pay legal fees.  Of course, the Minister will say that such women can avail of the services of the Legal Aid Board, some will, but there will be many others who will not have access to such an advice centre within their local area, who cannot or should not have to wait up to ten months, or whatever length, to obtain an appointment with a solicitor or other member of the legal profession.  For such women there is no practical alternative to getting out of their homes. They need a refuge, a safe place in which they and their children will be protected from their abuser and helped to rehabilitate their lives.  One of the greatest difficulties facing abused women and the voluntary bodies working in this field is not merely the lack of legal remedies &mdash; although that has been a very large problem &mdash; but the lack of refuge spaces.  Access to adequate, safe refuges is essential if the <Col N="1119" /> commitment to action on domestic violence means anything.</P>
    <P>There are currently 79 family places available for the victims of domestic violence; that level of provision is shameful.  As long ago as 1978, a report from the Home Office in the UK recommended that a minimum of 100 family spaces was required in a city of the population density of Dublin.  We now have less than that number for Ireland as a whole.  In Dublin, there are only 14 family spaces; in Belfast there are 104. That is scandalous.</P>
    <P>While I do not doubt the Minister's good intentions in bringing forward this legislation, which I welcome, the formulation of legislation is the easier part of the solution to complex social problems. It is a far more difficult and demanding task to engage in the sort of analytical study that such problems require.  If the Minister is serious about tackling the problems of domestic violence, as I am sure he is, he will have to do more than bring forward this Bill.  He must commission a survey of the levels of domestic violence.  He must also consult with interested parties, and he has done that to some extent.  He will have to introduce wide-ranging educational initiatives directed at the legal and medical professions, social workers and the gardaí.  Most importantly, he will have to ensure we have more refuge spaces. Once additional spaces are provided, the Minister will have to consider the position of women who leave refuges.  A refuge can never be more than a temporary solution.</P>
    <P>Women who leave home by reason of domestic violence need re-housing. Often, they will also need intensive counselling, training and child care facilities to enable them rebuild their lives and live independently. I ask the Minister to indicate that he will tackle the problem where it needs to be tackled and I call on him to introduce a co-ordinated national strategy for the development of a nationwide network of refuges.  I ask him also to develop a <Col N="1120" /> national strategy for dealing with the medium and long term needs of the victims of domestic violence.  Until he does this, any measures directed towards improving the lot of abused women will not be effective.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to some of the provisions of the Bill.  The Progressive Democrats welcome the Bill, as far as it goes, and we do so with few reservations. We have, however, a number of relatively minor difficulties with the Bill in relation to which I will be tabling amendments on Committee Stage.  My main difficulty with it is the fact that, where the parties are living together as husband and wife but the woman has no legal or beneficial interest in the home, she is precluded from applying for a barring order, nor can she apply for a barring order in circumstances where her interest in the property is less than that of her partner.  That creates an immediate problem.</P>
    <P>There are many cases of a woman who has moved in with a partner on a permanent basis, who may have borne his children, cleaned his house, supported him in his career and contributed directly and indirectly to the establishment of the family home.  Yet, because her name is not on the title deeds of the house or because she is not named on a lease, she does not have any rights.  Of course, it would be open to a court to find, on a preliminary basis, that the woman in question had a legal or equitable interest in the home.  This would confer jurisdiction on the court to hear the woman's application for a barring order.  However, as the Minister knows all too well, such a hearing would be lengthy, complex and costly.  It would have to take place in the Circuit Court as the District Court does not have any jurisdiction to determine issues of that kind.  That would mean additional costs, additional travel and other difficulties for parties living far from the nearest Circuit Court.  More importantly, because of the continuing appalling pressure on the Circuit Court family law lists, it would mean extremely lengthy <Col N="1121" /> delays between the issuing of proceedings and the hearing of cases.</P>
    <P>In view of these matters, the remedy of a barring order will not be a practical option for the vast majority of women cohabiting with men.  A married couple buy their house together and put both names on the title deeds as a matter of course.  Has the Minister undertaken any empirical research on the structures of property ownership among cohabiting couples?  I amagine that the number of such couples who have an equal interest in the property they live in would be very much less.  The remedy of the barring order will be of extremely limited use to this particular group of women.  The only effective remedy for them would be to continue the midnight flight to a refuge which, in all likelihood, will not have any available spaces.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister considers there would be constitutional difficulties in granting a woman an order which barred a man from a property he owned, but surely a woman's right to bodily integrity, and her right to an inviolable dwelling, are superior to his property rights.  What of the rights of the children of the relationship, if any?  Are they to be forced into homelessness in the name of their father's property rights?  Do the rights of children to a safe and secure home not count for anything?  If a man is violently abusing the children he brought into the world and whom he has an obligation to house and provide for, the law should have power to exclude him from the family home on the application of the mother, irrespective of who owns the home.  This issue will have to be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Another difficulty that arises in the Bill is in relation to the powers and responsibility of the gardaí.  Section 18 provides that, where an officer has reasonable cause for believing that an offence under the Act has taken place, he may arrest the alleged offender. Women's Aid has expressed its concern on many occasions about the lack of clarity in relation to Garda powers of arrest in domestic violence situations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1122" /> This section, therefore, does not do enough to clarify the position.  The Garda ought to be put under a positive obligation to effect an arrest where a violent incident has occurred.  I have attended Garda conferences and I know that the Garda Síochána has made great strides in learning about domestic violence and has, in some areas, adopted a major change of approach in dealing with the problem.  Some circumstances remain, however, in which gardaí will refuse to arrest the husband.  Imposing an obligation on the gardaí to arrest a violent husband would do much to improve the position.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the voluntary organisations, particularly Women's Aid, who have campaigned tirelessly over the years to assist and empower the victims of domestic violence. They are to be congratulated on the sustained way they campaigned for legislative and institutional reform. Without their efforts, I do not believe this Bill would ever have seen the light of day.  Women's Aid needs the support of the Government.  It is grateful for the introduction of this Bill but it requires much more.  It must be given the necessary resources to continue to provide refuge, support, advice and counselling for women and children.  Those resources are necessary to continue its public awareness campaigns and educational initiatives.  The efforts of Women's Aid to provide housing for women who leave refuges must be supported through State provision of housing, including sheltered housing, for women who cannot return home.</P>
    <P>We have waited a long time for the Bill, which I wholeheartedly welcome, but it is merely a step in the right direction. It is extraordinary that women and children in a crisis situation must rely on voluntary organisations to assist them. Preventative strategies must be put in place and I know the Minister welcomes the publication of &ldquo;Zero Tolerance&rdquo; by Women's Aid which is a national strategy for eliminating violence against women.  There is much we can learn <Col N="1123" /> from the voluntary organisations working on the ground.  I am aware the Minister has listened to them in relation to the Bill and, despite some disappointment, they are relatively satisfied with it.  Unfortunately, legislation does not change attitudes and we must change the attitudes that result in violence against women.  Research must be undertaken into the causes of such violence so that we can come up with solutions. Those solutions might involve the provision of adequate counselling and guidance for the perpetrator of violence. Whatever the solutions, they will have major implications for society, which is changing so slowly in Ireland. This has to do with an attitude regarding a woman's place in our society which even now, despite the happy advent of a 22nd woman Deputy in the House, is not what it should be.  There should be a much more positive and inclusive role for women in our society, and nothing will change unless we have the role models and Government initiative to support people who are working directly with this problem.</P>
    <P>Although I support this Bill and realise it is a major step towards what we are trying to achieve, we cannot deal with this just by legislation; we have to change those elements in our society that cause violence.  The Minister has a very important role to play and I commend the zero tolerance document.  The &ldquo;National Strategy on Eliminating Violence Against Women&rdquo; is practically a textbook analysis of how to do this.  In particular it is very important to co-ordinate the roles of the various bodies and, as we have a Department of Equality and Law Reform, we have a unique opportunity to do that.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the debate on Committee Stage and will be tabling some amendments to the Bill.  I hope the type of debate we have in the House on Bills like this will help to improve the situation of those people who are least empowered and most vulnerable in our society.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Domestic Violence Bill, 1995.  It has been a long slow struggle to put the issue of domestic violence on the political and social agenda.  When the first refuge was opened on 24 June, 1974 the expectation was that this problem would quickly be on the political agenda in a high profile way.  However, that has not been the case, and what we are seeing is a realisation that domestic violence and violence against women is a very complex issue.</P>
      <P>This Bill puts in place a necessary legislative framework which is extremely important.  It meets the requests of many women's organisations over a long period for a strengthening of the law to extend barring orders, to bring in a new safety order, to lengthen the period for which a barring order can be put in place, etc.  The Bill deals with all these issues in a very careful way, and women who are experiencing violence, who feel very isolated and alone should be reassured by the provisions of this Bill and should know that the law, the Garda and the health boards are now in a stronger position to intervene. The fact that people other than the person involved can apply for a barring order is very helpful.  This was suggested in the Kilkenny report, is provided for in this Bill.  Women who are vulnerable, who have experienced domestic violence, must be informed that the law will be stronger in terms of protecting them once this Bill is passed, and that they will get a better response from the law to their situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislative framework is only one aspect of tackling this very insidious problem, and it is a problem not just in Ireland and not just among any one social class.  Violence against women is a violation of women's human rights <Col N="1125" /> which occurs across all political, economic, cultural and social divides.  It causes serious physical and psychological damage to women and children.  It is a very grave social problem that threatens the safety, equality and bodily integrity of every woman.</P>
    <P>The most endemic form of violence against women globally is physical and sexual abuse by husbands and male partners, and the statistics world-wide are frightening.  Let us recapitulate on a few of them.  In the United States, for example, battering is the single biggest cause of injury to women &mdash; 4,000 women are beaten to death by their partner every year.  In Sweden a woman is battered to death by her partner every ten days.  There are 115 refuges in Sweden and they are constantly full. People might be surprised to hear that when they consider the economic and social position that women enjoy in Sweden.  It shows the complexity of the problem that, in a society where efforts have been made in relation to equality, other factors enter the equation.  For example, it may be that it is because pornography is widely available that there is this huge use of refuges.  It may also be that women are not prepared to tolerate violence and, in Sweden, interrupt the cycle of violence at an earlier stage and move out of violent situations into refuges.  This may be one of the reasons there are so many refuges that are constantly full.  In Great Britain it is said that 25 per cent of women have experienced physical abuse, and in Canada 39 per cent of women are reported as having been sexually assaulted.  It is quite an appalling world-wide litany, and certainly not unique to Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of statistical information in Ireland on the problem but it is becoming clear from the statistics we do have that we have a serious problem that needs a wider holistic approach, as mentioned by Deputies Woods and Keogh.  Let me quote some statistics in regard to what is happening here.  In the first year in which the domestic violence unit was set up, the Garda in the Dublin <Col N="1126" /> Metropolitan area monitored the handling of 6,000 cases of domestic violence. That figure becomes even more horrifying when one realises international research shows that only 10 per cent of women actually report domestic violence to the police.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the Garda have made marvellous efforts to tackle this issue more effectively.  The setting up of the special unit in Harcourt Street has been very important, and I call for the extension of that type of unit throughout the country.  I understand that at present there is an inspector in each area who is responsible for monitoring the handling of domestic violence by the gardaí in his area.  I recently heard a very interesting presentation by Detective Inspector Michael Murray and Detective Sergeant Lorraine Stack on the work being done in the special unit.  They are obtaining a great deal of specialist information on how best to help families where domestic violence is a problem, and such units should be developed all over the country by the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>The fact that women under report violence is well known.  The Minister's statistics were interesting.  They indicated that many women go as far as requesting a barring order but do not follow through in the courts, and there could be a whole range of reasons for this.  We need to give more support to women who do not follow through but who clearly need counselling and support.</P>
    <P>Another statistic relates to the Women's Aid national helpline which was set up in 1992.  To date, that has received an astonishing 14,537 calls from women.  These statistics give us a rather frightening glimpse of the reality for women in Ireland.  It is often asked why women do not leave.  Sometimes it seems obvious that if a woman has experienced that level of violence she should leave the home but women find it difficult to do so, for myriad reasons. If we want to help such women and children a wide range of issues must be tackled.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1127" /> A study of women who experienced domestic violence carried out in London showed that 27 per cent said they could not leave because of economic dependence. That is the big issue here when one considers that just over 30 per cent of women work outside the home.  Many Irish women are economically dependent on their partner and this limits their potential to take decisions about their future.  Some 27 per cent said they would not leave because of their concerns for their children and the breakup of the family home and 19 per cent would not leave because they feared further violence.  There are many complex factors which prevent women leaving the home.  We must look at the economic obstacles which women face as well as offering help to the victim and the perpetrator.  If a woman is facing a frustrating battle in the courts for maintenance, has inadequate social welfare or limited opportunity to re-enter the labour market she will find it difficult to leave.</P>
    <P>A pilot study was carried out in the accident and emergency department of St. James's Hospital.  This should be repeated in other hospitals.  The study looked at 83 women who had been admitted to the unit as a result of assault by a partner or spouse.  This resulted in 119 admissions in one year because of repeat admissions for assault and para-suicide. The injuries documented were 26 fractures, 40 cases of blows to the head, multiple brusing and attempted strangulation.  It is a horrifying list.  We need to examine how the health services can respond to this problem and how health professionals can be trained to identify women presenting in this way. We have done a good job over the years, albeit slowly, of encouraging teachers to think about how they could recognise children who have been sexually abused and encouraging communities to think about how to help families and interrupt patterns of sexual abuse. We need to think carefully about how we can alert the community at large, train personnel to recognise the patterns <Col N="1128" /> of abuse and respond in an appropriate way.</P>
    <P>This is a health issue and will have important implications for the health services.  Often it is people in the casualty department who are the first to have an opportunity to identify women who are abused.  They are often the first to whom a woman will turn and it is important that they receive the right response, help, options and information. Guidelines should be developed for medical and nursing staff.  I call on health boards to take a similar approach to that taken in St. James's Hospital, Dublin and ensure staff have the necessary training to enable them to recognise cases of abuse and create the right atmosphere of trust.</P>
    <P>There is widespread public acceptance that violence against women is an abuse but the message must go out that we have zero tolerance for violence against women.  I commend Women's Aid for their zero tolerance campaign. It is a strong message which we must ensure is heard in the community.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a complex problem which requires further research and education as well as the provision of housing and places of refuge.  I congratulate the Minister for dealing with one aspect of the problem and putting in place a strong legislative framework which will go a long way towards reassuring the victims of domestic violence.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Many of us who worked with battered women over the years have been conscious of the shortcomings of legislation.  This is a major step forward for women experiencing domestic violence.  There is no such thing as a typical victim of domestic violence.  Parents can be victims as well as children, men as well as women, cohabiting partners as well as partners. In the past, barring orders could only be granted to protect dependent children or spouses but in an age where more couples are cohabiting and where <Col N="1129" /> elderly parents are living with their adult children, neither cohabiting partners nor parents had the protection of a barring order.  This legislation recognises the change in the nature of the Irish household and in the nature of domestic violence.</P>
      <P>I welcome the protection given to elderly people.  We must protect the minority as well as the majority.  We are all aware of cases where adult children batten on their parents like leeches, subjecting them to physical, emotional and financial abuse.  The legislation is wide-ranging. The most significant point is the inclusion of cohabiting partners.  For the first time they will be under the umbrella protection of such legislation. The status of marriage in our Constitution and laws meant that those living in extra-marital relationships were often without equal protection.  This Bill is inclusive and extends protection to those who need it.</P>
      <P>I am glad the Minister has not only extended the categories of people but has also made provision for granting interim barring orders in emergencies and giving the gardaí and health boards powers in cases where the victim is not in a position to take action.</P>
      <P>We all seek refuge in our homes but that is the one place victims of domestic violence cannot seek refuge.  The Bill does not pretend to be a solution to the evil of violence in the home but it addresses some of the practical problems facing victims and will be welcomed by the victims of domestic violence and the many commendable people working on their behalf.  The legislation can only address the symptoms not the causes and the passage of the Bill will not relieve us of the onus to promote zero tolerance of violence in the home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill will change the law and help to change attitudes which make such a Bill necessary.  Domestic violence is a complex issue.  There are many other aspects which need to be addressed, in particular the provision of services for those who are battered, the causes of violence and why men behave the way <Col N="1130" /> they do.  Organisations such as MOVE which concentrate specifically on violent men address the problem in a particular way and deserve support and encouragement to continue to work with the perpetrators of violence to bring this criminal activity to an end.  I hope this feature of domestic life will end in this generation.</P>

      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this very necessary legislation which is long overdue. It is the minimum that people in threatening situations expect.  It is claimed in another jurisdiction that a man's home is his castle.  While the principle is one to which I subscribe, the language is not.  The castle cannot be the exclusive preserve of the dominant partner, traditionally the man, but must be seen as a place where all the family can be safe.  It must be the man's woman's and children's home.  Unfortunately that is not always the case and too many homes today are ridden by stress, worry and violence.</P>
      <P>While stress and worry to a large extent are outside our control, we can and must make the family home a safe haven.  What distinguishes a house from a home is the activity that goes on there, the sense of security that people feel and the right to withdraw, pull up the drawbridge and look out at the world from a place of safety and security.  If the threat comes from within the home, the home is no longer a castle and the security, love and warmth that should be present cannot exist in such conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in a violent society, perhaps not as bad as other countries but we have a legacy of violence particularly in the recent past.  The shocking revelations of what went on behind closed doors have demonstrated forcibly that a tier of families have lived silently for the <Col N="1131" /> most part with violence as an integral part of their lives.  I do not say this in the triumphalist way that many commentators have reported these atrocities. We must accept that the history of domestic violence in this country did not surface until recently.  I accept this as a fact and congratulate the courage, dedication and wisdom of those who exposed the scandal, often at great personal cost.  As legislators we must ensure that everything possible is done to remove the violence from people's lives.</P>
    <P>Women have been the main victims of domestic violence through the centuries, not alone have they suffered but traditionally they have been a buttress between a violent man and helpless children.  They were not prepared to admit the true nature of the problem lest it rebound on the children or the family as a whole.  The Irish wife suffered silently content to collect her reward in the hereafter.  This should not be the lot of anyone in Ireland today and this Bill must bring that about.  We must ensure that no one, wife, husband, child, sister or brother, will suffer in silence again and the message that must be sent out clearly is that there is no room for wife or husband beaters, tormenting or neglecting parents and child molester in our society.  That may sound unnecessarily harsh, even bordering on the uncharitable, but if we are not to protect innocent people who will?</P>
    <P>We, the legislators, can and should empower the courts to move swiftly, decisively and effectively to protect family members at risk while being cautious not to repeat the mistakes made in Cleveland and elsewhere.  Hysteria must not take the place of facts and logic and there must be a way of openly reviewing and appealing decisions.  I am glad to see provision in the Bill for the greater involvement of the health boards.  While the official agencies quite rightly have access to the process, I think it should be extended even further.  Very often the only people outside the home who know about the violence and abuse are <Col N="1132" /> the neighbours, but they are denied the chance to become involved on a confidential basis.</P>
    <P>This is a small country and people may not wish, or may not be emotionally strong enough, to become publicly involved.  We cannot let wrongs continue to be perpetrated because of that and it is imperative that the Minister finds some way of guaranteeing confidentiality to people who would come forward with such information.  Perhaps this is covered by section 6 (1) which specifies the circumstances in which the health board can become involved.</P>
    <P>I recall a case in my constituency where an official, not a health board employee, had information about a husband who was beating his wife.  He offered to give that information in court when a barring order was sought but was not allowed by his superiors.  If he formulated his information in writing the file could at a later hearing be subpoenaed and his involvement made public, with difficult consequences for him.  The wife's evidence was not accepted and through lack of independent evidence the case was thrown out and the wife was sent home to her violent husband.  She then had no choice but to leave home, the State having failed her once compounded the wrong by refusing her deserted wife's payments. The law said she had a half share in the family home but did not vindicate her right to live there in peace.  This type of wrong must be eliminated and the Minister will have to consider ways in which people may supply information in confidence which can be acted upon.  I realise this has inherent dangers and could be abused without proper safeguards.</P>
    <P>Until now, people were afraid to report violence in their homes for fear of the consequences.  I realise that they could seek a protection order and this is further extended by the safety order. While this is to be welcomed, what protection will be in place for people who are at risk while the order is being processed?  They are most vulnerable during this time and their actions will <Col N="1133" /> probably draw an even more vicious response at that stage.</P>
    <P>The question of refuges and shelters must be addressed realistically.  Greater resources are required in this area.  I pay tribute to those who have undertaken this work voluntarily &mdash; convents had to open their doors at 4 a.m. to shelter a wife and family on the run from an irate drunken husband, and the many organisations that have assisted such people in need.  I realise that State funding is given in a good number of cases but often it is pitifully small and the shelters could not survive without voluntary workers.  The Minister for Health will have to be more generous.  The organisations give value for money and without them a great many more buildings would be necessary.  My local refuge caters for many throughout the south-east region and has had to be extended by the provision of an additional house which is a further reflection on society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, broadly welcome this Bill, but as my colleagues have said the major problem in this area is the lack of facilities such as refuges for the victims of domestic violence.  The Minister will be aware that the provision of accommodation for victims in refuges and shelters is pathetic.  That is a reflection on all political parties because domestic violence did not suddenly come upon us.  It has been a reality of Irish life for some time.</P>
      <P>In dealing with the legislation only we are dealing with one aspect of the problem. The legislation is cost neutral and therefore does not require hard political decisions in the way that allocating the necessary finance to provide refuges and shelters would.  The Minister will be aware that there has been a very significant increase in public expenditure since the Minister for Finance announced his budget.  This is not a debate on finance and I do not propose to dwell on that aspect but there are many areas of less intrinsic merit where the Government overspent instead of putting a few pounds towards refuges and shelters which are evidently needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1134" /> The Bill is welcome but it deals with only one small aspect of the problem and in many respects, it gets that wrong to a degree.  The provisions of the Bill mirror to some extent proposals in the Law Reform Commission's Report on Child Sexual Abuse &mdash; LRC 32 of 1990. However, the Law Reform Commission made its proposals in that report specifically in the context of child sexual abuse.  This Bill extends barring order legislation generally to other areas, such as domestic violence, welfare and so forth.  Drafting legislation which is based on proposals that are designed to deal with a small, narrow area but which extends them to apply generally can often lead to an imbalance in the law.</P>
    <P>While I have not had time to study this Bill in great detail, a cursory glance suggests that there are serious defects. The Bill is too narrowly drawn in some areas and too broadly drawn in others. Section 3, which appears to be the main provision and is the reason the Bill is before the House, extends the categories of people who can apply for barring orders.  At present only a spouse can apply for a barring order.  Section 3 intends to extend the list of applicants to include parents and cohabitees.  The first question is obvious and has been asked by Deputy Woods: why are siblings not included?</P>
    <P>Cohabitation is a reality of modern Irish life.  For a long time it has been recommended that the right to apply for a barring order should be extended to a cohabitee.  This legislation proposes to extend this right to cohabitees &mdash; that is the main thrust of the legislation &mdash; but does so in a most begrudging and restrictive manner.  It is no exaggeration to say that the restrictions in section 3 of the legislation will exclude 80 per cent, and perhaps as many as 90 per cent, of cohabitees from the right to apply for a barring order.</P>
    <P>The restrictions are twofold.  First, in order to apply for a barring order, a cohabitee will have to prove that he or she has resided continuously with the respondent for six of the seven months immediately preceding the application.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> It is different in the case of a safety order where the aggregate of six months out of 12 months applies.  It is obvious that people can come and go from the family home.  It comes as no great surprise to anybody that, in a situation which ultimately leads to an application for a barring order, the people might not be continuously resident in the same house.  I am aware of the provision in section 3 (11), but it must be remembered that it is often the respondent who can be missing from the family home.</P>
    <P>If the respondent is missing for a few days would that preclude the right of the applicant to apply for a barring order? In other words, what does &ldquo;continuous&rdquo; mean in the context of section 3?  How can it be proved?  What is the position if the respondent simply states that he was missing for a few days or a week or for whatever period is sufficient to make cohabitation non-continuous for six out of the seven months preceding the application?  This provision will have to be closely examined.</P>
    <P>Second, and more curiously, section 3 (10) appears to run counter to the basis of the legislation.  Some couples live together having gone through a ceremony of marriage; others live together without having gone through such a ceremony.  Violence can occur in both circumstances.  It is right that the victim of that violence should have this remedy available in both circumstances.  Section 3 (10) will exclude 80 to 90 per cent of cohabitees from the right to apply for a barring order.  It will also restrict a high percentage of parents.  Where the cohabitee is precluded by the terms of section 3 (10), can the cohabitee avail of section 6 and call in a social worker to enable the health board to apply for a barring order against the other cohabitee? That will depend on the meaning of the term &ldquo;aggrieved party&rdquo; in section 6.  If the answer to that question is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, the situation is absurd.  Can the Minister clearly explain the intention behind this provision?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> I wish to refer briefly to interim <i>ex parte</i> barring orders being available on a general basis.  That was recommended, after much deliberation and with the most severe restrictions, by the Law Reform Commission in the specific context of child sexual abuse.  It is now being extended generally.  We must look carefully at the restrictions on its general application.  It is a very serious matter for somebody to be removed from their family home without having the right to speak in their own defence. Similar considerations apply in relation to the right to involve the health board in this area of what is essentially private law.</P>
    <P>Broadly, I welcome the provisions of this Bill but they will have to be teased out in great detail on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for their general welcome for the legislation and for the informed nature of their contributions.  As Deputy O'Dea has pointed out, there are many matters to be teased out on Committee Stage and I will be more than happy to do that.</P>
      <P>In recent years a picture of the extent of the problem of domestic violence has emerged through newspaper reports, television programmes and the personal testimony of many victims.  This is a limited picture which masks the harsh reality of the silent suffering of the many victims, of which we hear little. Studies have shown that there is a tendency for victims to try to conceal the problem through a feeling of power-lessness, a misguided sense of shame or fear of reprisals.  As a consequence, the extent of the problem is impossible to assess fully.  However, it is clear from the information which is available that domestic violence transcends social and cultural boundaries, not alone in Ireland but in all countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent studies also indicate that the primary causes of domestic violence are the power and control which a perpetrator needs to feel over the victim and the extent to which a perpetrator <Col N="1137" /> believes he or she can get away with such violence.  The first cause &mdash; the need for power and control &mdash; often stems from traditional social mores governing the relationships between men and women, although in some cases it may, of course, be the result of a specific psychological disorder.  Traditionally women were seen as inferior to men and, therefore, subordinate to them.  As a society we are gradually becoming more elightened in this regard and our laws more increasingly reflect and recognise women's role in society.</P>
    <P>The second identified cause of domestic violence &mdash; the extent to which a perpetrator believes he or she can get away with it &mdash; has been the focus of a number of legislative measures over recent years.  Such measures include legislation on child care, rape, indecent assault, the giving of evidence by spouses and barring and protection orders.  The Bill before the House seeks to reinforce those sanctions by amending and extending the existing law on barring and protection orders to ensure that all household members will be protected by the law in a manner appropriate to their needs.</P>
    <P>As a result of the limited time at my disposal I cannot deal with all the issues raised.  However, I wish to address a number of points.  Deputy Woods, Deputy Keogh and Deputy O'Dea referred to the difficulty of barring from the home a respondent with an ownership interest in the home.  I am advised that a proposal to bar a respondent, other than a spouse, with an ownership interest in the home on the application of a person with no such interest might not survive constitutional scrutiny, given that a barring order would constitute an infringement on that person's property rights which the State and its laws must respect under Article 40.3 of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>This difficulty in relation to cohabitants was recognised in the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  It recommended that barring order legislation should be extended to cover cohabitants but only where the <Col N="1138" /> person seeking the order is the owner or the tenant of the property.  The net effect of this is that, in order to apply for a barring order against a respondent with an ownership interest in the home, the applicant must either be the spouse of the respondent or have an interest in the home which is not less than that of the respondent.</P>
    <P>I am aware that this is a matter of concern to Deputies.  However, I should point out that household members who are precluded from applying for barring orders will not be left without protection as they will be eligible to apply for safety orders.  The full force of the criminal law will also apply in appropriate cases.</P>
    <P>Deputies Woods and Keogh raised the question as to why it is that the barring order remedy is being confined to spouses, cohabitants and adult children <i>v.</i> applicant.  In the normal course, every person has the right to seek protection through the criminal law or the inherent jurisdiction of the higher courts to grant injunctions.  The barring order remedy was introduced to help deal with the problem of violence between spouses.  It is a drastic remedy in that a person can be barred from his or her home for conduct which would not constitute a criminal offence.  This factor must be taken into account in any attempt to extend the legislation.</P>
    <P>The Bill will provide protection for all household members and former cohabitants. The first remedy provided for, the safety order, serves to regulate the behaviour of the respondent without barring him or her from the family home.  This remedy represents a vast improvement in the lot of those household members who have not heretofore been covered by this type of legislation.</P>
    <P>On top of this, there are special classes of close relationship which have been shown to be particularly prone to domestic violence to which it is proposed to extend the more drastic barring order remedy.  Experience has shown that apart from children, spouses, parents of adult children and cohabitants are the main victims of domestic <Col N="1139" /> violence.  Such persons are being afforded maximum protection as, of course, are their children.  I would not accept the suggestion that up to 90 per cent of cohabitants will be excluded by the provisions of the Bill.  I am well satisfied that an appreciable proportion of the number of cohabitants affected will be able to avail of the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The role of the Legal Aid Board in dealing with the problem of domestic violence was raised in the course of the debate by Deputy Keogh, in particular, and others.  In 1994, the Legal Aid Board gave advice concerning barring orders in 2,362 cases.  This illustrates that in many cases, the remedies provided for in the Bill are of little use to victims if they are denied access to the courts through lack of resources.  That was one of the reasons I have given such priority to the Legal Aid Board since I assumed office and I have expanded the service significantly.</P>
    <P>The Legal Aid Board has always endeavoured to give priority to cases involving domestic violence.  In areas outside Dublin, cases involving domestic violence are not put on waiting lists but are dealt with immediately.  In Dublin, while such cases were given priority, it has not always been possible up to September 1993 to deal with cases as quickly as the board would have wished.</P>
    <P>In September 1993, the private practitioners project was introduced on a pilot basis to deal specifically with barring, custody and maintenance cases in the District Court.  The specific aim of this project was to reduce the length of the waiting lists in the various law centres in general and also to ensure that barring order cases in particular could be dealt with promptly.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, the project operates from Aston House and is confined to the conduct of cases for maintenance, barring and custody orders in the District Court. An evaluation of the effectiveness of the pilot project has been undertaken and consideration is being given to the form <Col N="1140" /> that a private practitioner service might take in the future.</P>
    <P>The role of the Garda in dealing with the problem of domestic violence was also referred to in the course of the debate by Deputy Frances Fitzgerald and others.  In April 1994, the Garda Commissioner issued new directions on domestic violence which, <i>inter alia,</i> state that the power of arrest should be exercised where possible and the offender charged in cases of domestic violence. In addition, the Garda domestic violence and sexual assault unit was set up in March 1993 in the Dublin metropolitan area.  It is staffed by gardaí who are highly trained and experienced in dealing with domestic violence and sexual assaults.  The functions of the unit include overseeing the investigation of offences of domestic violence and ensuring that enforcement practices throughout the country on barring orders are carefully examined and standardised.  Outside the Dublin metropolitan area, the Garda authorities have designated an officer in each of 18 divisions to have an overall and consistent approach to domestic violence cases.</P>
    <P>There exists a problem relating to powers of arrest where there is no barring order in force, a problem which is being addressed in this Bill.  In general, the present common law powers of arrest apply only where a felony, as opposed to a misdemeanour, is being committed.  The vast majority of violent crimes in the domestic violence area are, in fact, misdemeanours.  Consequently, while gardaí are empowered to proceed by way of summons, they are not empowered to effect an arrest without a warrant.  Section 18 (2) of the Bill empowers gardaí to arrest without warrant in the case of the more serious forms of assault which are presently classified as misdemeanours, that is to say, assault occasioning actual bodily harm and assault occasioning grevious bodily harm.  It should be noted, of course, that these new powers only apply in the context of domestic violence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1141" /> In this context, it is important to note that actual bodily harm includes any hurt or injury calculated to interfere with the health or comfort of the victim. It need not be an injury of a permanent nature nor amount to what would be considered grevious bodily harm.  In this regard, it should also be noted that the courts have held that an assault causing an hysterical or nervous condition is tantamount to an assault occasioning actual bodily harm on the grounds that an injury to the state of a person's mind can constitute actual bodily harm.</P>
    <P>In general terms, gardaí may only enter a person's home to effect an arrest against the wishes of the owner in the absence of a warrant where (a) they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that he or she has committed a felony and (b) that they have specific statutory authority to enter.  In DPP <i>v.</i> Gaffney in 1987 it was stated per Henchy J. that a statutory power of arrest does not confer a right to enter a dwelling to make the arrest unless a power of entry is expressly authorised for this purpose.</P>
    <P>It is proposed, therefore, to explicitly empower the gardaí to enter any place where the member reasonably suspects the perpetrator to be in order to effect an arrest.  The place in question need not necessarily be the family home.  It could, for example, be a neighbour's or relatives' house.</P>
    <P>During the course of this debate, Deputy Keogh referred to the delay in the hearing of court applications for barring orders.  The maximum delay in the hearing of District Court applications for barring orders in the Dublin metropolitan district is six weeks. However, attempts to reduce the waiting period are made in circumstances of particular need.  The Government has also given a commitment to strengthen the family courts and in this context, the report of the Law Reform Commission on family courts is awaited.</P>
    <P>Reference was also made by Deputies Woods, Keogh Kenneally and O'Dea to the funding of women's refuges.  As Deputy O'Dea pointed out, these, and extensions of them, have been badly <Col N="1142" /> needed for a long time.  Deputy O'Dea was a Minister for some time in the Department of Health&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;through the health boards, gave more than £1 million for services for the victims of domestic violence and 90 per cent of the funding for women's refuges throughout the country now comes from the health boards.</P>
      <P>It is the Minister for Health's intention that continued progress will be made in this important area during 1995.  As a first step, he has approved the payment of grants, through the health boards, of £55,000 towards the running costs of the freephone national help line service provided by Women's Aid and £20,000 to the National Federation of Refuges for Abused Women and Children to support their co-ordinating activities.</P>
      <P>Deputies Woods and Keogh referred to the role of counselling in dealing with the problem of domestic violence.  In 1994, total funding of £750,000 was provided for marriage counselling organisations; an increase of 150 per cent on the 1993 funding and this year the funding will be of a similarly high level.  A total of 58 organisations will benefit from Exchequer funding this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> As Deputy Woods rightly mentioned, the problem of domestic violence must be dealt with in a flexible way.  We must recognise that even where the civil law offers protection at present in cases of interspousal violence, many victims do not avail of it.  They continue to suffer in silence for a variety of different reasons, including fear of the wrath of a violent partner.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keogh made the point that it should be possible for <i>ex parte</i> applications to be made in serious cases while Deputy O'Dea expressed some reservations about that.  It is important that in exceptional cases there be the power to make an <i>ex parte</i> barring order.  It has been written by many social workers that a failure to do so and a failure to give powers to the Garda Síochána to arrest without warrant will in some cases result in the loss of life of a woman or child.</P>

      <P>Thug mé dhá chuairt i mbliana ar na príosúnaigh Poblachtacha atá á gcoinneáil i bpríosúin i Sasana. Bhí mé ann i dtosach Mí Márta seo caite agus ag an am sin thug mé cuairt ar phríosúnaigh i Belmarsh in aice le Londan agus freisin ar phríosúnaigh atá á gcoinneáil i Full Sutton, in aice le York.  Caithfidh mé a rá gur chuir sé animní orm ag an am go raibh na príosúnaigh ag rá go raibh na coinníollacha faoina bhfuil siad á gcoinneáil níos measa ná mar a bhí ag an am gur tháinig an sos cogaidh i bhfeidhm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Cuid de na fadhbanna a luaigh siad liom ná: go raibh cuid acu á gcoinneáil <Col N="1146" /> faoi ghlas 23 uair a' chloig sa lá, nach raibh cead á thabhairt dóibh a gcuid éadaigh féin a chaitheamh agus nach raibh cead acu dochtúirí neamhspleácha a thabhairt isteach ón taobh amuigh. Mar dhuine a chreid i bpróiséas na síochána agus a thug creidiúint iomlán do na príosúnaigh as an bpáirt a bhí acu ann, shíl mé go mba údar mór buartha nach raibh dul chun cinn á dhéanamh le coinníollacha a dhéanamh níos fearr dóibh agus lena n-aistriú go hÉirínn agus freisin lena scaoileadh saor.</P>
    <P>Nuair a chuaigh mé ar ais ag deireadh na míosa seo caite fuair mé amach gur in olcas atá rudaí ag dul.  Níor éirigh liom na príosúnaigh i Belmarsh a fheiceáil de bharr go bhfuil réim &ldquo;cuairteanna dúnta&rdquo; á chur i bhfeidhm.  Níl na príosúnaigh sásta glacadh le cuairteanna faoi na coinníollacha seo.  Fiú domsa, ní raibh an lucht i gceannas sásta ligean dom na príosúnaigh a fheiceáil, mar a chonaic mé cheana iad Mí Márta seo caite.  Chonaic mé iad ar fad i gcuideachta Mí na Márta agus níor thug údaráis an phríosúin an cead sin dom an t-am seo.</P>
    <P>Is dul ar an gcúl é seo.  Ar ndóigh nuair a dhéantar comparáid idir an chaoi a bhfuiltear ag caitheamh leis na príosúnaigh polaitiúla ó Éirinn agus Private Lee Clegg, feictear go bhfuil anéagsulacht ann.  Beidh mé ag déanamh tagairt eile do seo ar ball, ach díreach ag an bpointe seo níl le rá agam ach go mb'fhéidir gur fíor an tseanfhocal i gcás Rialtas na Breataine: &ldquo;cuir síoda ar ghabhar ach is gabhar i gcónaí é.</P>
    <P>Is oth liom go gcaithfidh mé é seo a rá ach is léir nach bhfuil dada foghlamtha ag polaiteoirí sinsearacha Sasanacha faoi Éirinn agus go mb'fhéidir gur dóchas bréagach a bhí ann aimsir an &ldquo;joint declaration&rdquo; go raibh i gceist ag Sasana déileáil ar bhealach nua le fadhb na hÉireann.  Ní féidir le polaiteoirí, áfach, a chreideann sa daonlachas agus sa mhodh polaitíochta, misneach a cháilleadh.  Beidh orainn gach dícheall a dhéanamh le cinntiú go gcuireann muid ina luí ar Rialtas na Breataine Móire cé chomh tromchúiseach atá ceist na bpriosúnach agus freisin an gá atá ann, <Col N="1147" /> láithreach, brú ar aghaidh leis an bpróiséas síochána.</P>
    <P>Yesterday was a dark day for Ireland and for the peace process.  The worst fears of many people familiar with prisoner issues were confirmed.  There is now an urgent need for the British Government to realise the magnitute of the injustice perpetrated in the unequal treatment of Private Lee Clegg compared with the treatment of other prisoners, both loyalist and nationalist.</P>
    <P>However, it was not yesterday or in the past week that the urgency to tackle the prisoner problem in relation to the peace process arose.  As someone who has always argued in favour of a peaceful resolution to the problem of partition in Ireland, I was delighted when the ceasefire was announced last year. It gave an opportunity to all sides to bind up the wounds of the past 25 years and to start afresh.  It also gave an opportunity to all sides to look at the political causes of the conflict and to direct their attention to arriving at a long term solution to them.  As somebody who has argued for the political road and who appreciated the part played by the prisoners in bringing about the ceasefire, I felt there was an obligation to ensure that those prisoners and their families would also benefit from the peace dividend and that recognition would be given to the fact that but for the political situation in this country most, if not all, of them would never have been behind bars.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to successive Irish Government for the realistic and imaginative way they have tackled the new political situation and the way they have acted in relation to prisoner releases here.  This has played a constructive part in building the peace process and has hastened the day when we will have full peace and reconciliation on this island.  It is also a step forward that Dáil Éireann has passed the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill, 1995, which I hope will soon be passed by Seanad Éireann and signed by the President. Although this Bill covers all <Col N="1148" /> people in prison abroad, it is of particular significance at present for people in prison in connection with the troubles.</P>
    <P>On my visits to prisons in Britain, I have witnessed at first hand the conditions experienced by the prisoners.  I do not have enough time tonight to go into detail about individual cases and prison conditions.  The conditions under which prisoners are being held in Britain at present does not lead one to believe that the attitude of the British authorities has changed towards the prisoners.  Since the ceasefire, conditions have not only not improved, but have deteriorated in many cases.  For example, during last winter some prisoners experienced solitary confinement for 23 or 24 hours a day.  This arose because of a refusal by prisoners to wear prison clothes.  Anyone familiar with Irish history understands the significance of that.  There have also been serious complaints regarding refusals by prison authorities to allow independent doctors into the prison.  I can vouch for these facts because I dealt with such a case last week on my visit to Full Sutton. All the prisoners are kept in maximum security prisons and, in some cases, in special security units within those prisons. There have been instances where prisoners have not been allowed to talk Irish to their families, although it is the home language of the families.  The study of Irish has also been refused. When I visited one prison in March I was told that the prisoners were told that Irish was the language of the IRA. As an Irish speaker, I find that gratuitously insulting.  Such behaviour perpetuates bad feeling between the two countries.  Other prisoners have been refused educational facilities.  I highlighted these matters in a report I presented on my recent visits to the prisoners in March and June.</P>
    <P>On my latest visit to the prisoners in England, I did not meet the prisoners in Belmarsh because a regime of closed visits was recently introduced.  The reason given for this was that these were high risk category prisoners.  However, when I visited them in March I saw <Col N="1149" /> them collectively.  Under the closed visits regime prisoners are seen on a one to one basis and talked to through a screen.  The argument in favour of closed visits is a security one.  However, one must ask what security risk they thought was posed by a Member visiting prisoners and whether the prison authorities are alleging that he or she is a security risk.  This regime is a farce as can be seen from my visit last week to Full Sutton Prison where I had no difficulty in meeting three prisoners together.  These prisoners are due to be transferred to Whitemoor Prison where they will come under the closed visits regime.  It seems strange that what was safe and accessible last week can become highly dangerous next week or the week after.</P>
    <P>The second issue highlighted during my recent visit was the position of prisoners who have already served 20 years of a life sentence.  For example on 10 July next Brendan Dowd, Sean Kinsella, Noel Gibson, Steven Nordonne and Paul Norney will have served 20 years of their sentences.  A direct comparison of the way the British authorities have treated these prisoners with the way they have treated Private Lee Clegg is interesting.  All the above were convicted of attempted murder and related charges but none was convicted of murder while Private Lee Clegg was. Despite the fact that every court in the land upheld the conviction, he was immediately transferred to a prison near his home, subjected to a benign regime and released within four years.  Given the principle that murder is always murder and that those who have the privilege to serve in security forces have a full obligation to uphold the law one would have thought that the prison regime to which he was subjected post-the ceasefires would be an example in similar cases.</P>
    <P>The prisoners to whom I referred have already served 20 years, held in maximum security prisons and have not been granted transfers to Ireland.  When the case regarding the length of their <Col N="1150" /> sentences was taken to court the Lord Chief Justice said:</P>
    <P>I have considered the submissions made on behalf of the above named prisoners, i.e. Dowd, Kinsella, Nordonne, Norney and Gibson.  Life sentences were imposed on each for more than one attempted murder committed in the course of waging a terrorist campaign, in most instances against police officers attempting to apprehend the offenders.  I see no reason to change my view that 20 years would be appropriate for punishment and deterrent, both specific deterrence of the offenders and general deterrent of any terrorists in pursuit of whatever cause resorting to attempted murder.</P>
    <P>However, since the prisoners have served over 19 years I would not hold out rigidly for their detention during the remaining few months.</P>
    <P>Following that recommendation the case was submitted to the Home Secretary in Britain.  This happened early this year but, unlike Private Clegg, these prisoners have been given no indication to date when they will be released. Given that Paul Norney and Stephen Nordonne were 17 and 19 years, respectively, when they were convicted it is obvious that prisoners are not being treated in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>During my visit to Britain I have experienced difficulty in getting to the prisons and associated costs.  I estimate that it costs a family a minimum of £1,000 to visit a prisoner which is a huge burden on them.  Regardless of the argument by the British authorities in relation to prisoners, there can be no question but that it is grossly vindictive, unfair and unjust not to give some consideration to these families, particularly in view of the ceasefires.  The transfer of these prisoners home should be high on the agenda as their families can never be held to have been guilty of any crime. A small number of prisoners have been transferred but this was only after legal action.  Most of the prisoners transferred <Col N="1151" /> to the North were on temporary transfers which are at the discretion of the British authorities.  This means a prisoner never knows when he may be transferred back to Britain.</P>
    <P>It is fair to say that the prisoners were involved to a large extent in bringing about the ceasefire and giving politics a chance.  As a politician I believe in the political system.  However, there is a major onus on politicians who argued for years that political progress would be made if we had peace to deliver on those promises.  This is why I have shown such an interest in this problem. The prisoner issue is part of the bigger issue of peace and reconciliation in Ireland.  I fully recognise the position of victims and the need to fully support them.  However, it must not be forgotten that many prisoners come from families who had members killed and whose involvement in the troubles is directly related to those events.  To regard victims as separate from prisoners is to ignore the nature of the problem.</P>
    <P>In our efforts to break the cycle of violence we can do no better than follow the example of the late Senator Gordon Wilson who, by his tremendous courage and forgiveness, showed us that vengeance will not bring about lasting peace but that forgiveness and reconciliation will.  In this connection it is also of great significance that loyalist and republican prisoner representatives and community leaders have called for the release of prisoners.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from the submission of the former Senator John Robb to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  As a surgeon he knows more about victims and their needs than most and he originally came to prominence because of his concern for them.  In addressing the prisoner issue he said:</P>
    <P>When preparing the first draft of this paper before Christmas, it was impossible not to conclude that the prisoner represents, in part, the guilt which we feel concerning our own attitude, action or inaction, in relation <Col N="1152" /> to the past 25 years.  None of us can avoid taking a share of responsibility for failure to resolve a conflict which has taken such a heavy toll of life and limb.  Healing will be incomplete until the prisoner has been reintegrated with the rest of us.</P>
    <P>The cycle of recurring violence which has plagued us for so many centuries, will not be broken once and for all unless we are able to anticipate more than consensus seeking politics and constitutional rearrangement. Healing will not be complete without the decommissioning of all arms, the reintegration of all prisoners and the payment of what we can of the debt which we owe to so many people, on all sides, who have been hurt through injury or loss during these bitter years.</P>
    <P>A memorial for the dead is not enough.  People maimed and families bereaved must now be generously supported in an ongoing manner by the rest of us for the remainder of their lives... A ceasefire and decommissioning of arms are matters with which the average citizen has no difficulty if, for no other reason, they make little demand on us.  On the other hand, advocacy of victim support should indicate a willingness to make some sacrifice in the promotion of such support.  Amnesty, however, is quite another matter &mdash; and a very painful one at that &mdash; yet, at the end of the day it is the willingness to embrace amnesty rather than &ldquo;release&rdquo; that will finally indicate whether we too are willing to acknowledge, through forgiveness, our personal roles of inaction as well as of attitude and action in the violation of others both before and during the last 25 years.</P>
    <P>In conclusion he said:</P>
    <P>No particular section has won a victory &mdash; for which we should thank God &mdash; yet sometimes it seems that the powers that be wish to act as though they have won some victory. In a sense, we have all had a victory <Col N="1153" /> as we can now anticipate building a new society in which we will be liberated from the restrictions and fetters of the past.  In short, help the wounded, soften our hearts, get rid of the weapons, find space for the prisoners, remember the dead and look after the victims.</P>
    <P>I hope that this House will have the wisdom to accept the acts and advice of two illustrious ex-Senators in their approach to healing the wounds in our society.  I hope that in turn we will be able to persuade the British authorities and everybody else involved in the conflict over the last 25 years that the only way forward is in a spirit of forgiveness on all sides.  We must now build for the future and while not hiding the truth about the past, as it is part of forgiveness, we must not continue the cycle of violence by seeking vengeance and blaming one side or another for past events.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The release of prisoners is an essential element in the peace process and that is why we tabled this motion.  I commend the work, efforts, time and commitment put in by my colleague Deputy Ó Cuív who, by his regular reports and visits to prisons, keeps this House aware of what happens on the inside and the views of prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The urgency of the problem and the topicality of this motion tabled last Friday have been highlighted by the controversial decision of the Northern Secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, yesterday to release Private Lee Clegg without clarifying the British Government's intentions with regard to other prisoners. Our attitude is that there should be no double standards.  Equity and justice mean that people are treated alike and fairly.  Any suspicion of an intention on the British Government's part to let matters rest there causes a deep sense of anger and frustration, particularly to nationalists and republicans, but also to loyalist communities.  We do not accept that soldiers in the British Army are <Col N="1154" /> entitled to fast-track release and possible reinstatement, when they have committed murder, unless the same approach is to be extended to others. We cannot have one law for those favoured by the British establishment and another law for everybody else.  There is no valid distinction between different types of murder, depending on the category of the person who committed it. Mrs. Thatcher said &ldquo;murder is murder&rdquo;. Not all deaths caused by paramilitary organisations, as a result of bomb explosions or mistaken indentity, were intended.  Many have been deeply regretted.  On the other hand, it is difficult to accept that people shoot to kill unintentionally, even if on the spur of the moment.  I extend my party's sympathies to the family of Karen Reilly who have every right to feel deeply aggrieved that the killing of their daughter is regarded as a venial offence. My party favours an enlightened, humane and progressive approach to all prisoners and has said so on every possible occasion since last autumn.</P>
    <P>The sensitivities of the situation were pointed out to the Prime Minister by the Taoiseach at the informal European Union Summit, by the Tánaiste to the Secretary of State in the Anglo-Irish Conference and by members in more informal political and diplomatic meetings. The British Government can have been in no doubt about our views of the risks, yet chose to ignore them at a time of uncertainty and some tension.  The Secretary of State has acted in a very irresponsible manner with regard to the peace process of which he ought to be one of the principal guardians.</P>
    <P>Since his tenure as Attorney General, when he played a crucial role in the Stalker and shoot-to-kill cases and the Gibraltar Three case, in controversial and political sensitive cases he has shown very little regard for natural justice, being ever and always a protector of the British establishment from justice.</P>
    <P>The notion that this decision was taken according to approved procedures <Col N="1155" /> is completely undermined by the resignation of the head of the Northern Ireland Probation Office, Breidge Gadd.  The cause of her resignation is the major deviation in this case from normal principles and procedures.  She made a very strong and courageous statement about high-handed political decision-making.  How many members of paramilitary organisations convicted of murder, or in many cases lesser offences, have had their cases reviewed even, let alone be released, after only a few years?</P>
    <P>We are entitled to expect the British Government would place the stability of the peace process above every other political consideration.  Let spokesmen in No. 10 Downing Street be very clear. They are not dealing with Sinn Féin on this matter.  They are dealing with strong public feeling throughout the length and breadth of Ireland, with the united voice of the democratic Government and Parliament of this State.  Cardinal Daly, who has been a champion of peace for years, also spoke for many people this morning, when he described the Secretary of State's decision, taken in isolation, as a very serious blunder.  I also agree with the Cardinal's views that yesterday's street disturbances were unhelpful.</P>
    <P>The prisoners deserve recognition, having played a positive and constructive role in supporting the ceasefire on the republican and loyalist sides.  The ceasefires have been held with a discipline that has few parallels elsewhere by both sets of organisations, which is greatly to their credit.</P>
    <P>Since last August, successive Irish Governments have responded to the situation by releasing prisoners, the first batch last Christmas and New Year and a second batch around Easter.  I have consistently argued that by next Christmas the vast majority of paramilitary prisoners in our jails could be safely released.  This would also be in accordance with what happened in the past.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1156" /> Everyone should understand the reasons for this.  The offences for which the prisoners were convicted were politically motivated.  A lasting ceasefire has been called and Mitchel McLaughlin stated in the last two days that the guns will remain silent.  Loyalist spokesmen have also confirmed in strong terms their commitment to stay away from the gun.  We can be confident that in conditions of peace those released, or certainly the vast majority of them, will not reoffend in any way.  We need the prison spaces for criminals, those who are likely to reoffend.  The peace process has to be built on mutual confidence. Unless we, the previous Government and the present one, had been prepared to show some trust in those involved in both the republican and loyalist paramilitary organisations, and if they, likewise, had not been prepared to repose some trust in us, there would have been no ceasefire.</P>
    <P>Releases are, therefore, a vitally important confidence-building measure. They should extend not only to the mainstream republican and loyalist organisations.  We believe that, as they too have observed a ceasefire, republican socialist prisoners should be included in the release programme.  The German authorities accepted the same logic as the Irish Government.  While those involved may be unhappy with the verdicts of the German courts, at least they have all been released, with the judges making explicit reference to the peace process.  I thank the German authorities for moving rapidly to close the book on prisoners, arising from a campaign which ended some time earlier in Germany.  It is surely time for Britain to adopt a similar approach.</P>
    <P>There is an unanswerable political logic to restoring 50 per cent remission as a first step.  It was removed in 1989 because of actions during the paramilitary campaigns.  Now after ten months' ceasefire it ought to be restored.  That, I believe, is the view of the entire House.  It will be recalled that, when a Baptist pastor came to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation a <Col N="1157" /> few months ago, he expressed the view that the restoration of 50 per cent remission would make a big difference. We do not claim that it represents the solution to the problem, merely that it provides an obvious first step, consistent with the logic of the British Government's position to date.  As the peace holds, they will obviously have to go much further.  Its objective &mdash; and ours &mdash; should be to draw a line as soon as possible under the last 25 years, while giving all the support we can to the families of the victims of violence.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise openly and acknowledge that one of the difficulties we face is a difference between the political culture in Ireland, North and South, and in Britain, especially the England of the Home Counties.  Most English politicians sent over to govern Ireland or part of it continue the same mistakes, year after year, century after century.  They do not understand the sensitivities on which they tread.</P>
    <P>Most of those who joined paramilitary organisations, however tragically mistaken they may have been in their methods and who have engaged in violence over the years, both loyalist and republican, did so in the main for patriotic motives when they were young and on behalf of their respective communities. The civil conflict of the past 25 years was not a sudden concentrated outbreak of criminality.  Those who fought were acting in accordance with a long and honoured tradition in their respective tight-knit communities.  One would have some considerable difficulty persuading most people in Ireland that members of the Parachute Regiment or the SAS occupy any higher moral plane.</P>
    <P>At the first Brussels Summit in October 1993 and on other occasions the British and Irish Governments promised to act imaginatively when violence had stopped.  I believe the Irish Government under Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Bruton fulfilled this pledge. Many people in the North are asking where is the evidence is of this imaginativeness in the response of the British <Col N="1158" /> Government in the North.  Where indeed is the evidence of good faith?</P>
    <P>The British Government has in ten months shown no sign of acting on any of the three major promises they made prior to the ceasefire.  The first promise contained in the Downing Street Declaration and in subsequent clarifying statements that they made about it before 31 August 1994, was that if violence stopped for good, after a sufficient period to verify it was for real, parties like Sinn Féin would be admitted to participate fully in political dialogue.  The second promise was that the British Government would in effect act as persuaders for an agreement, that they would in the words of the Declaration encourage, participate and enable agreement to be reached through a process of dialogue and co-operation.  Since the Framework Document, they have done nothing to fulfil that pledge.  The dialogue is not even under way.  The third promise was that there would be an imaginative response but this has not been forthcoming.</P>
    <P>On the central issues of talks, decommissioning and prisoners, all we have had so far is a vindictive attitude. Months have been wasted in the futile pursuit of a symbolic surrender.  Loyalists and Republicans are a proud people.  Their political leaders are not going to destroy themselves and their organisations to satisfy Sir Patrick Mayhew.  If a modicum of goodwill was being generated, it might be possible to reach an understanding on the contentious issues and the timing of their resolution, which would make it easier for talks to proceed.  Gerry Adams made some helpful points in his interview with <i>The Irish Times.</i>  The British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, showed an understanding at Cannes that inclusive talks must take place until he was effectively disowned by his Secretary of State the following morning.</P>
    <P>If political progress is delayed in the short term, it is even more imperative that there be movement on the question of prisoners.  Early release and 50 per cent remission only represent a start in <Col N="1159" /> terms of what needs to be done.  The position of all long term prisoners needs to be reviewed.  I am not calling for the immediate release of prisoners who have been recently convicted of horrendous multiple murders but the transfer of prisoners from Britain to the North and the Republic needs to be expedited. The petty and vindictive treatment of prisoners in British jails and their families and visitors and the placing of impediments in the way of elected representatives and lawyers must stop. Deputy Ó Cuív dealt with that matter in detail.  Independent as well as official medical assessment should be provided. Political miscarriages of justice must be addressed.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to a number of cases on which representations have been made to me; these have been passed to the authorities here and in Britain.  The Casement Three appear to have been arbitrarily convicted to make an example of them following the horrific lynching of two soldiers outside Milltown Cemetery in 1988.  In the view of many the evidence against them is weak.  Joe Doherty was extradited from the United States after a long legal struggle.  He is now being made serve, in effect, a double sentence.  This is vindictive and wrong.</P>
    <P>The conviction earlier this year of Stephen Larkin, 24, on the basis of a hit and miss identification parade &mdash; he had no connection with the IRA and his alibi was ignored &mdash; appears to be a <i>prima facie</i> miscarriage of justice.  I have given the relevant papers to the Northern Ireland spokesperson of the British Labour Party.  There is also the case of Billy Gorman and Patrick McKinney, young men who were forced to make confessions about the shooting of a member of the RUC in the Castlereagh holding centre in 1980 and who were convicted on the basis of uncorroborated statements.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1160" /> In any case where there are serious and legitimate doubts about a conviction there is a strong argument in current circumstances for the prisoners in question to be released.  Some of the justice meted out in the past 25 years was deeply flawed, as was demonstrated conclusively in the cases of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and the Maguire family, not to mention the super-grass trials involving both Loyalists and Republicans in the North.</P>
    <P>Among Unionists the conviction of Neil Latimer, one of the UDR Four, is a matter of serious contention.  This case has been raised with me.  I do not propose to enter into the rights and wrongs of the case nor to take any position on the claim of his supporters that there was a miscarriage of justice but, if Private Lee Clegg could be released despite a clear-cut and confirmed conviction, it is difficult to see the logic behind keeping Neil Latimer in jail provided that a similar approach is adopted towards other prisoners, Republican and Loyalist, where any genuine doubt or controversy has arisen.</P>
    <P>The British Government has a moral and political obligation to show imagination, generosity and magnanimity on the question of prisoners.  It should be looking for ways to empty the prisons by every possible route as soon as reasonably feasible, recognising that there may be some cases where this would not be immediately possible or desirable.  Nothing would do more to consolidate the peace process.  Such a gesture would help to secure the necessary stability for the foreseeable future. The two Governments could do worse than adopt the vision of the prophet Isaiah &ldquo;to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to captives and the opening of the prison to them that are bound&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is a much broader political agenda which must not be lost sight of &mdash; the opening up of inclusive dialogue on the Framework Document which contains the proposals of the two Governments and on any other alternative proposals which the parties may <Col N="1161" /> wish to table.  No one should be allowed to veto that process through the setting of preconditions nor should the two Governments adopt as their own the preconditions set by any political party as the British Government has blatantly done in the case of the Ulster Unionist Party in relation to early unilateral decommissioning.  If all parties have a genuine commitment to peace, they should be prepared to enter talks now without placing further obstacles in the way, accepting that arrangements for decommissioning must be part of any talks process and of any settlement.  The two most pressing requirements are movement of prisoners and a commitment to talks based on what the British Prime Minister identified as the reality &ldquo;that the political process will have to involve all the political parties&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We decided to focus this motion on all aspects of the question of prisoners. I deeply regret that the Government, instead of adopting the motion which was designed to win all-party support, has tabled a limp and vague general amendment which has taken the bite out of the motion and addresses almost none of the agenda relating to prisoners that needs to be acted upon, such as the transfer of prisoners.  Many Nationalists and Republicans, as well as Loyalists, will be disappointed that the Government could not see its way to support our more vigourously worded motion. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and their parties should recognise that bipartisanship is a two-way process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion which contains the following important lines: &ldquo;calls on the British Government to play a positive role by addressing, without further delay, issues relating to prisoners, as a means of contributing to confidence in the peace process&rdquo;.  It is necessary to do that at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ceasefire provided hope to families in the Border region who have members in prison.  It would be regrettable if there were any unnecessary delays in releasing prisoners on a phased basis.  The ceasefire has given <Col N="1162" /> the region a new lease of life during the past ten months.</P>
    <P>The Furum for Peace and Reconciliation, of which I am a member, has heard submissions from Professor John Robb, the Committee for the Transfer of Irish Prisoners, Colm Crawford on behalf of Loyalist prisoners in Northern Ireland, the Irish Commission for Prisoners Overseas and the Committee for the Repatriation of Irish Prisoners; these submissions were the subject of lengthy debates.  Each spokesperson made emotive appeals that consideration should be given to the question of prisoners.  They also highlighted the need for prerelease programmes, family support services as well as employment, education and training programmes on the release of prisoners.</P>
    <P>In the past few days I have spoken to a father who has two sons in jail.  He feels strongly that one of them should not be in prison.  This is a source of much trauma for the family.  None of us expects the jails to be opened but the release of prisoners on a phased basis has much to offer in the continuation of the peace process.  There is no doubt that there is a genuine commitment to peace on all sides of the political and religious divide.  Everything possible that can be done in this regard should be pursued.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann fully supports the efforts of successive Governments to consolidate the peace process at every level</P>
      <P>&mdash; by seeking progress towards the overall goal of an agreed political settlement through comprehensive negotiations,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; by pursuing an even-handed and constructive handling of all aspects of prison issues, including earlier releases, bearing in mind the role which the loyalist and <Col N="1163" /> republican prisoners have played in the peace process, the reduced risk of reoffence and the positive effects of improvements in this area on the prisoners, their families and the political climate in their communities,</P>
    <P>&mdash; by recognising the sensitivities of all victims of violence,</P>
    <P>&mdash; by promoting sensitive response to security developments on the ground in Northern Ireland in view of the dramatically improved security situation and</P>
    <P>&mdash; by maximising the economic and other benefits of peace through increased North-South co-operation</P>
    <P>and calls on the British Government to continue to co-operate in the joint pursuit of these objectives building on the progress achieved in the Downing Street Declaration and the Joint Framework Document.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that political uncertainty in Britain is over.  As the House is aware, the British Prime Minister and I made considerable progress at our meeting in Cannes.  We set out a detailed agenda of work that needs to be dealt with and I am glad his mind is now free by today's result to proceed to deal with that agenda.</P>
    <P>I welcome the helpful and constructive tone of the speeches on this motion. I was particularly impressed by Deputy Ó Cuív's speech; he has obviously done much research into the position of prisoners in Britain.  I invite him to brief me and my officials in person on some of the matters he was not able to put on the record because of the restrictions on time.</P>
    <P>Representatives from the Irish Embassy in London have made regular visits to the prisons concerned.  I understand there has been increased severity in visiting arrangements, as referred to by Deputy Ó Cuív.  These are due to escapes from British prisons &mdash; there <Col N="1164" /> has been much political controversy about escapes from prisons in Britain and accountability is demanded of people involved in the management of prisons for these eventualities &mdash; that has led to the implementation of measures which cause many problems from a human point of view.  All these issues have been raised by the Tánaiste, most recently at the Anglo-Irish Conference last week.</P>
    <P>I was struck by the statistic &mdash; which, I think, is accurate &mdash; quoted by Deputy Ó Cuív of the cost to a family based in Ireland of bringing a number of members to visit a loved one in prison in Britain.  The figure he gave of £1,000 seems a lot but, on reflection, it is probably not an exaggeration.  The Government is of the view that we should revert to the 50 per cent rate of remission that applied up to 1988 rather than the 33 per cent rate being applied at present in Britain, and that will require legislation.</P>
    <P>I was also struck by the comparison made by Deputy Ó Cuív between the position of Private Clegg who was released after four years for an offence and other people who committed similar offences at the age of 18 or 19 years for which they have served up to 20 years in prison.  I believe very strongly that there should be equality before the law, all people should be treated equally &mdash; I am not sure if that is the case in regard to these examples &mdash; and that politics and politicians should stay out of decisions of a judicial character.  I have been very strong in the House in resisting attempts, for example, to make the Director of Public Prosecutions politically accountable.  If politicians should stay out of the process to avoid politicisation of it in prosecutions and cases of that kind, then there is a serious argument against a Secretary of State being in a position to make decisions in the political circumstances as was done in the case of Private Clegg.  That is a form of politicisation of what should be a judicial process and is not desirable.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with Deputy Ahern's contention that if he puts down a <Col N="1165" /> motion without consulting the Government he can expect all-party agreement on it.  I have no doubt he intended to frame the motion in the most constructive fashion possible, and I am sure in his view he did so, but if he wanted all-party agreement, the way to proceed would have been to consult the other parties about the motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>And <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>However, he made no attempt to consult the Government parties about the matter.  I am sure if we had gone through a process of consultation we could have reached agreement on the motion.  Deputy Ahern decided to act on his own, as is his right, but he must accept the consequences.  If we had a discussion about the framing of the motion I would have said I did not agree, in terms of the peace process, with singling out one item, even one as important as prisoners, and saying that we will concentrate on that item in the motion.  Issues such as prisoners, decommissioning, policing, the courts system and progress on political talks feed into and off one another and if progress is made in one area it makes progress possible in others.  One item cannot be dealt with in isolation because even if it is dealt with absolutely fairly, the fact that it was chosen rather than another issue which may be of concern to other communities creates the possibility of a potentially politically unbalanced choice being made.  It should be remembered that in dealing with Northern Ireland we are dealing with a community that is profoundly divided on grounds of allegiance, and what is seen as beneficent to one community is seen as malignant to another.  Therefore, one needs to be very careful in choosing one issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another concern that must be borne in mind &mdash; and this has been highlighted by the family of Karen Reilly &mdash; is the perspective of victims.  The perspective of victims of all offences must be taken into account.  It is for those reasons I do not favour a motion that singles out one issue.  The Government amendment <Col N="1166" /> puts the prisoners issue in context an does not deal with it exclusively fror any other issue.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the peace process in general terms.  Listening to some of the reactions from north of the Border in recent days where, for example, dire predictions have been made by one politician of a return to violence, the peace process was always going to be uncomfortable; an agreement, by definition, is going to be uncomfortable for everybody.  Everybody, including the parties in this House, will have to make concessions that are uncomfortable if we are to have an agreement.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency in political debate on Northern Ireland for people to hark back to the old certainties, just as people in the United States harked back to the old certainties of the Cold War and wished the world was simple, as it was in the 1980s before the fall of the Berlin Wall.  There is a similar tendency in some cases in Northern Ireland for people to hark back to the old certainties of 25 years of violence when you did not have to think very much before you made a comment because you knew what you were against and what you were for.</P>
    <P>The whole essence of the peace process is that people will have to change their approach to these matters.  On the comments by Mr. Ken Magennis, to whom I already referred, predictions of violence are dangerous because they infer an acceptability that if something happens it will not be so surprising because it has been predicted.  People should be very careful before making such predictions.  There is no justification for them.  The leaders of Sinn Féin, the republican movement, and the loyalists are committed to the peace path and no security information available to me suggests there is a foundation for the predictions of the kind made by Ken Magennis, a view have conveyed to him.</P>
    <P>The most difficult and important step in the peace process was achieving the ceasefires.  However, while extremely difficult, it was comparatively simple in <Col N="1167" /> the sense that it involved a focus on the republican movement and the loyalists and on what could be done by the Governments.  There were three or four parties involved and, once they made the right moves at the right time, there was the hope that the peace process would be achieved.  I am not taking away from the immense achievement involved, it was the most important step to stop the violence, but it had a certain degree of simplicity.  We are moving into a phase where progress must be made on a much wider front and a larger range of issues which are more complex through not as important individually as the decision to declare a ceasefire.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on the 14 issues &mdash; that list is far from exhaustive, I am sure other Members can add other items to it &mdash; upon which we need to make progress.  In the early stages of the peace process in getting the republicans and the loyalists to stop violence, basically four parties had to move forward, the two Governments and the two sets of paramilitaries.  Now we must get simultaneous movement by eight to ten parties, not only the two Governments and the paramilitaries, but also five or six constitutional political parties which have a legitimate and an essential role in any overall agreement.  We are trying to move not only four, but eight to ten players, in the same direction at the same time on up to 14 issues.</P>
    <P>The first issue, the one which has been mentioned most frequently, but is far from being necessarily the most important one, is that of the decommissioning of arms.  We must recognise not only the perspective of the republican movement, that its members were not asked to agree to decommissioning in explicit terms at the time of the Downing Street Declaration, but we must understand also the feelings of the Unionist community and its parties.  If we are to get them to sit down with Sinn Féin we must achieve progress on decommissioning.  The Unionists are <Col N="1168" /> going to feel a certain reserve about sitting down with Sinn Féin as long as the latter is connected with the IRA which still has arms.  The Unionists will feel that without Unionists there is not parity at the negotiating table.  That is a reality, regardless of the views of the British Government.  Even if the British Government changed its views on decommissioning in the morning, that does not guarantee that the Unionists will change their view.  In a sense the Unionists are able to hide behind the British Government on this issue as long as it holds its present line, but it is wrong to assume the converse, that if the British Government changed its view, the Unionists would change theirs. That does not necessarily follow.  That is a difficult issue.</P>
    <P>The next issue is what should be done about legal weapons.  There are many licensed weapons in Northern Ireland, mostly in the majority community which are available for use.  The justification for issuing many of them was self-protection at a time of violence, but that justification does not exist any longer.  If paramilitary arms are to be decommissioned, legitimate questions will be asked about calling in some legally issued weapons.</P>
    <P>The third issue is that of policing.  This issue feeds in directly to the issue of punishment beatings.  There is a sense in some communities that the RUC is not fully accepted and that is offered, as what I would regard, as a spurious justification for punishment beatings.  One may not agree with that &mdash; I certainly do not &mdash; but that is the explanation advanced.  It must be recognised that it is not easy to solve the policing issue. The question arises even as to what to call the constabulary.  If, for example, we were to cease to call it the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the dropping of the word &ldquo;Royal&rdquo; would have all sorts of negative implications for Unionist opinion.  Conversely, if we continue to call it the Royal Ulster Constabulary, that would have all sorts of negative implications for the Nationalist community. Perhaps, it is possible to find a <Col N="1169" /> new name for it.  The argument has also been advanced that we should localise the police service, but the political map of Northern Ireland reveals that Northern Ireland is not made up of neat parcels that could be locally and separately policed.  There are pockets of Nationalists among the Unionist community and <i>vice versa.</i> A large number of police services would be required to specifically police the religious map of Northern Ireland.  The idea of localising the police service thus is not necessarily easy, but progress must be made on this general issue.  There must be a coming together on the police issue if we are to make progress on all the other issues.  The policing issue feeds into the decommissioning issue and into the legal arms and other issues.</P>
    <P>The fourth issue, the focus of this motion, is the important issue of prisoner releases.  I strongly agree that there should be a higher rate of remission as there is less likelihood of re-offence as a result of the existence of peace.  That is an objective fact and justifies earlier release on objective grounds.  There can be no argument about that.  Why is it not happening?  One of the reasons it is not happening is that there is a fear that, as it involves introducing legislation in Westminster, difficulties may arise in getting agreement on it.  All we can do in this House is use our influence in Westminster, as I have done by talking getting agreement on it.  All we can do in this House is use our influence in Westminsters, as I have done by talking to members of the Government and Opposition, to urge them to agree to the idea of a 50 per cent remission in prison sentences.</P>
    <P>The fifth issue is that of the courts and justice system.  Emergency powers legislation, which is quite severe, is still in place in Britain.  We have got rid of our state of emergency.  The courts system is open to some question, an area where a good deal of progress could be made and many changes are needed.  If we could make progress on one of those issues, that could help solve other problems as it would create a climate of confidence.</P>
    <P>The sixth issue is that of parity of esteem, the issue of flags and emblems. <Col N="1170" /> Any time Nationalists visit an RUC station they see a Union Jack flying and emblems that represent a majority but not a minority view in Northern Ireland. It could be suggested that they should be taken down and not have any emblems but it must be recognised that emblems are part of people's lives. Unionists consider they are part of the United Kingdom and that their flag should fly, but would they accept the flying of the Union Jack and the Tri-colour? How can we resolve the problems of emblems?  We must find a solution if there is to be parity of esteem because symbols matter.  In some senses they matter more than practical realities because symbols touch people's emotions.  The symbolism of partity, of esteem is extremely important.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív correctly mentioned the issue of the Irish language and some progress has been made in that regard. The first issue I raised with the British Prime Minister when I met him last December was the position of mean scoil Báil Feiriste.  More progress needs to be made on the recognition of the Irish language in Northern Ireland.  It would do a great deal to advance the process, but one must recognise that as of now most of the majority community in Northern Ireland do not identify with the Irish language in the same way as the minority community.  That may change.</P>
    <P>A major historical review is taking place among the Unionist community. Many of them are rethinking who they are, their sense of being Irish, but also British.  That is the seventh issue, the need to change our thinking on this side of the Border.  We have worked on an assumption that there was only one type of Irish person, an Irish person who owed allegiance to a united Ireland and that was the only way of being fully Irish.  We are beginning to change that view.  The late Gordon Wilson, who was justly praised on all sides of the House, said only last week that he was proud to be British and Irish.</P>
    <P>We are beginning to recognise that there are many people living on both <Col N="1171" /> sides of the Border who are proud to be Irish, but who are also happy that they have a little bit of British heritage and do not want to reject it or bury it completely. They want to be comfortable with it while also being comfortable with their Irishness.  That type of mental and psychological change is needed here.  We need to come to terms with the complexity of our history.  It was not always simply a monochrome colour green and we need to change our view about that.  That mental change is almost or perhaps more important than changes in words in the Constitution. What is in the Constitution is one thing, but what people think in their hearts and minds and how they behave <i>vis-ávis</i> Unionists or people of a different allegiance is perhaps more important than the words in the Constitution.  That is not to diminish the need for constitutional change which I accept.</P>
    <P>The eighth issue that needs to be looked at is the question of consent. Arguments that are somewhat theological and semantic have been put forward about whether Sinn Féin has fully accepted that concept of consent.  I believe it has because its members have said they are looking for agreement and agreement must be given by consent. That argument has been clouded somewhat by the suggestion that the British should also be persuaders for agreement. The term &ldquo;persuade&rdquo; is ambigious. Does it involve more than soft words?  Would there be an element of pressure involved?  How much pressure is legitimate?  What degree of pressure makes the consent unwilling as distinct from willing?  Clearly, if there is to be agreement, there must be willing consent but, on the other hand, people need some incentive to move forward.  Perhaps that is a somewhat theological semantic argument which, at the end of the day, may not be very important if we can reach agreement on other issues. However, it will be probed a great deal.</P>
    <P>The ninth issue on which there must be movement relates to cross-Border <Col N="1172" /> institutions, and all-Ireland institutions. Unionists must recognise that if we and Nationalists accept that Northern Ireland is to remain within the United Kingdom, there must be a substantial all-Ireland dimension.  Unionists have tended to want one and not the other, but if there is not an all-Ireland dimension Nationalists will not get the reassurance and security for which Unionists are craving.  Both communities must get reassurance and security if there is to be peace and stability.  Progress also needs to be made on that issue.</P>
    <P>The tenth issue, one on which Irish Governments by a self-denying ordinance have not debated, relates to the internal governance of Northern Ireland.  What are the appropriate powers of the Assembly?  What powers should it have relative to all-Ireland institutions or Westminster?  What powers should the panel have relative to the Assembly?  Will the panel consist of a small, closed group making all the important decisions with the Assembly being basically a rubber stamp or should the Assembly be the focus of power? What implications will that have for the balance between the two communities? What will be the relationship with the existing local government system in Northern Ireland?  Will it have to cede power to the Assembly?  While we accept that there cannot be an internal settlement alone, we agree that government at the level of a sovereign state &mdash; Westminster or Dublin &mdash; would not be sufficient and would not engage the attention of people in Northern Ireland adequately.  One has only to note the low poll in North Down to recognise that people in Northern Ireland are not fully engaged by what happens in Westminster.  If they are to become engaged, power must be exercised closer to them.  If they do not become engaged the talented people needed to solve the problem will not become involved in political issues.</P>
    <P>The eleventh issue is who will negotiate? Obviously it will be the Governments and the parties, but how does one <Col N="1173" /> test the mandate of the parties?  How will new parties come into the process? In what forum should negotiation take place?  Should there be bilateral discussions between Governments and individual parties or must round table discussions take place at some stage? There should be round table discussions, but at what stage?</P>
    <P>The next issue relates in particular to Unionists who fear proposals for new constitutional arrangements.  They consider any new arrangements proposed as a stepping stone on a road to a united Ireland and nothing more than a stratagem to bring them a little further along that road.  They believe that if they agree to some new arrangement they fear Nationalists will make further demands later, and if they agree to them then even further demands will be made.  Unionists believe they are being asked to go down a road with an uncertain destination or one they do not like. How can we reassure them?  Can we tell them that if they agree to, say, something along the lines of the proposals in the framework document, that that will be all they will be asked to agree for a certain period of time or until certain demanding conditions are met?  Can we offer them a degree of permanence? People will not make a final concession unless they know that when the deal is struck further demands will not be made of them.  Unionists have I believe tended to hold back because they are not certain that what is on offer is a permanent settlement.</P>
    <P>I have outlined 13 or 14 areas in which a great deal of work must be done.  The British and Irish Governments are engaged in a process of serious discussions on all those issues and have set out in great detail our understanding of many of them in the framework document but there is, of course, room for change in that document. However, it is tragic that the parties in Northern Ireland, particularly the Unionists, are not engaged in dialogue on those issues either with their neighbours or with the two Governments. Unless they become involved in such <Col N="1174" /> dialogue, it will be difficult to move forward. It is not simply a matter of doing what is necessary to keep Sinn Féin and the loyalists on board.  The Unionist community, the Alliance Party, the SDLP and so on must also become fully engaged.  Unless they engage in dialogue it will be impossible to offer the political agreement necessary to underpin the peace process and prevent the recurrence of violence.  The concept behind Sinn Féin giving up violence was that Sinn Féin believes agreement can be reached through political methods. However, unless the talks involve everybody, including the Unionists, there cannot be such an agreement and if agreement is not reached then the basis on which the political talks on the peace process commenced will be difficult to achieve.  We must recognise the great complexity of the issue.</P>
    <P>The matter cannot be addressed solely by referring to the prisoners' issue.  That is one of a large number of issues.  If we can make progress on any of the other issues to which I referred, progress on the prisoners' issue will be easier.  If progress is made on the prisoners' issue, progress on other issues will become easier.  We need a process in which everybody can put their cards on the table, a process of comprehensive dialogue and to talk to each other in an open manner.  That is not happening in Northern Ireland at present. The Governments are talking to each other but the parties are not talking to each other.  Of course, the road block of decommissioning must be overcome to get Sinn Féin engaged in the process, but that is not an excuse for other parties not being involved in dialogue on those issues.  The aim of the Government is to have all-inclusive dialogue working towards an agreement, involving Sinn Féin, the SDLP, the Alliance Party, the Official Unionist Party, the Democratic Unionist Party and the loyalist parties, all of whom must be involved, commensurate to their electoral mandate, in comprehensive talks on the range of issues I outlined.  This is <Col N="1175" /> a complex process and will not be concluded, or even begun, overnight.  There will be discouragements, disappointments and moments when people will fear that the peace process is in danger of derailment, but I do not believe that will happen.  People are now convinced that the way of violence has been tried for 25 years and failed and that the only way forward is through peaceful means. I will share the remainder of my time with Deputy Boylan.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I compliment the Taoiseach on his broad review of the peace process and support the sentiments he expressed.</P>
      <P>I know of a person who has served 20 years of a life sentence.  If there had not been troubles in Northern Ireland this family would not have been involved in that way of life.  At the young age of 18 people were caught up in a situation in which, under similar circumstances, any of us could have been caught up.  Yet they find themselves in prison serving life sentences.  I contend that, having served 20 years of a life sentence, they have paid their debt to society and are entitled to be released.  I fully endorse what Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív said, that the costs incurred by families visiting their relatives in prison render it almost impossible for them to visit them regularly. Therefore, the first move should be their transfer to prisons here with a view to their early release.</P>

      <P>We have just heard the Taoiseach outline the complex nature of the range of issues involved in the peace process.  One must agree with his analysis but what this motion seeks to do is home in on what can be done in the <Col N="1176" /> immediate future, by way of a confidence-building measure, towards resolving the range of issues of which he spoke.</P>
      <P>As a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, having listened to the many representations made there over the past few months, it was clear from the submissions of loyalist, republican and church groups there is one issue which commands support across the board, a confidence-building issue, on which immediate action can be taken if the political bona fides and goodwill exist.</P>
      <P>We are talking about a peace process we must translate into a political process and we must apply political logic.  That also means that the release of Private Lee Clegg should not be portrayed as some quasi-judicial decision that is a political decision.  When there is a political decision of that kind, there should be political decisions taken across the board.  The one issue on which there is agreement across the board &mdash; from which both communities in Northern Ireland will benefit &mdash; is the release of republican and loyalist prisoners, after a careful examination of each individual case.  This is suggested in our motion, one component of which calls on the British Government to investigate and order judicial review as a matter of urgency of all cases where a <i>prima facie</i> miscarriage of justice may have occurred.</P>
      <P>That is for a start.  Then we must make the dramatic gesture of confidence-building incorporated in another of the recommendations which calls on the British to legislate, as a first step, to restore 50 per cent remission to prisoners in the North to come into effect before Christmas.  That should apply to both loyalist and republican prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was also quite clear from the many submissions to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation that it was from the prisoners, both loyalist and republican, that the main thrust for the peace process emerged in the first instance.  They were the leaders, the pace setters in inducing their colleagues, outside the prisons, to <Col N="1177" /> become involved in the peace process and endeavour to make progress in that way.</P>
    <P>We have had ten months of peace and, as the Taoiseach said, that is a tremendous achievement, but we must remember that that achievement will be annulled, and worse, unless that peace process is translated into a political process. Unless political progress is made within this period of peace the whole purpose of the peace process itself will become meaningless.  We must remember we are talking about establishing a permanent framework of justice in Northern Ireland, within its internal relations, its relations with the Republic and those between the Republic and Great Britain.  That is what we are talking about in the overall settlement.</P>
    <P>We must begin to take steps to contribute to the building of trust so that that eventual settlement can become a reality.  It cannot become a reality unless we start building the bricks of trust.  One resolves conflicts only when one recognises that a conflict or conflicts exist and must be resolved.  One resolves conflicts through paying great political attention to areas of agreement between the various parties to the conflict.</P>
    <P>Here is an area of agreement, on which there is no doubt both loyalists and republicans agree.  This should be the major gesture we make to rendering peace permanent and establishing a political settlement, something dramatic in the form of release of prisoners.  I mentioned that those prisoners were primarily responsible for the initiation of the peace process in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I will mention another good reason, which was the tenor of a number of submissions to the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  In every sense of the word these are political prisoners.  The application of criminal prisoner criteria to them during the period of peace is nothing short of political madness because these people are in prison for political offences.  Over the years their high degree of leadership, on release, has been well proven within the Northern community.  There is no doubt that <Col N="1178" /> these are the people who can give leadership to their communities at grassroots level.  On their release, they can provide the required leadership because they are the highly regarded political heroes of their respective communities. They are not people who will engage in crime, in drug-pushing or anything of the like, on release.  Rather they are the people to provide the requisite leadership of their respective communities which can translate the peace process into a political one.  By releasing them, not alone would one be doing something right and proper but also something that would be politically constructive for the future development of a political process within Northern Ireland.  They are prisoners who should be released and who are not criminal prisoners in any shape or form.  They are acknowledged political prisoners who command the loyalty of and can provide leadership within their respective local communities.</P>
    <P>On that analysis I rest my case and advocate concentrating on that single issue in accordance with the tenor of our motion.  I do not agree with the Taoiseach that we need to range over the whole field in this debate.  The purpose of our motion is to focus attention on something that can be done now to restore political confidence, to build a real political process, moving on to the eventual political settlement which will involve the whole range of complex issues the Taoiseach mentioned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The release of those in prison, resulting from the Northern Ireland troubles, wherever they may be, is an integral part of the peace process.  We should look back to the initiative taken by our Government prior to Christmas last in the welcome release of a number of prisoners, followed through in Germany a few days ago when they, too, <Col N="1179" /> played an important role in the peace process.</P>
    <P>Our recommendation to restore 50 per cent remission to such prisoners is a very sensible, practical one which could be implemented very quickly if the political will existed.  The British authorities should take immediate legislative action and release such prisoners.  This would signal the earnestness of the British Government in their efforts to ensure that we have a lasting peace on this island.</P>
    <P>I had a number of opportunities to visit British prisons in the past, which I hope gave me some little insight into the system there.  For example, it was not unusual for families to leave remote parts of this country to visit their relatives in British prisons only to discover, on arrival, those prisoners had been transferred to prisons, sometimes as far away as the Isle of Wight.  Their families could have been so informed in advance.  They were told that these transfers had been made for security reasons whereas it was really to inconvenience their families.  That practice continues and should be terminated by the British authorities.</P>
    <P>The release of prisoners is a key issue and must be handled very sensitively. There should be no room for the double standards we have observed this week. Equal treatment should be the guiding principle in dealing with the release of all such prisoners.  The British Government should address this issue in a clear and open manner.  It should do so urgently and arrive at a speedy resolution, because the longer it is left unresolved the more of an impediment it will be to the peace process.</P>
    <P>The decision to release Private Clegg, who was responsible for the murder of Karen Reilly and who has spent only a few years in prison, was insensitive. There was not any regard for the family of Karen Reilly or the consequences of the decision on the peace process.  It is absurd to suggest that the events in Northern Ireland yesterday were orchestrated.  They were a spontaneous <Col N="1180" /> response by many people in the North who were aghast at the decision.  The crowing of the tabloids should not deafen the British Government to the error of judgment it committed in releasing Private Clegg.  This unilateral decision, in the midst of the Conservative leadership crisis, was insensitive and unhelpful to the peace process.</P>
    <P>Equal treatment must be given priority when dealing with the release of prisoners.  If the peace process is to be a success, it is vitally important that the British Government makes a decision on the release of prisoners as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Tánaiste's response to the Fianna Fáil motion in writing to all of us today.  Fianna Fáil must be given full credit for putting down this sensible motion but it is unfortunate that the Government could not agree to accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all Members, I was delighted with the announcement of the ceasefires almost one year ago after 25 years of violence in Northern Ireland.  The release of Lee Clegg was a black day for the peace process.  It is imperative that all political prisoners, particularly those serving long sentences in the United Kingdom, be transferred to prisons in Northern Ireland, if not released, making it easier for their families and friends to visit them.</P>
      <P>Some people have served more than 20 years in British prisons and it is time for them to be released or, at the very least, transferred to prisons in Northern Ireland.  This Government must not allow anything to happen that will jeopardise the peace process which has greatly benefited Border counties and promoted the cause of peace.  The success of the peace process will also result in a great boost for our tourism industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I call on the Government to put pressure on the British Government to release all political prisoners, republican or loyalist, from British prisons.  I ask the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to ensure that all political prisoners serving <Col N="1181" /> sentences in the UK are either released or transferred to prisons in Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>All of us have listened to radio and television reports today or read newspaper articles on the violence on Northern Ireland yesterday. Throughout today, the British establishment has attempted to place the blame for the riotous behaviour throughout the North last night on various organisations and individuals.  That riotous behaviour &mdash; and once again we have seen the use of plastic bullets in the North &mdash; is not the fault of any one party or element in the North but due solely to the action the British Government has taken in releasing paratrooper Lee Clegg.  The British Government has a duty to acknowledge that its decision has been responsible for the sad developments witnessed in the North last night.</P>
      <P>We have had ten months of peace since the two ceasefires were declared. Last night was the first occasion on which violence erupted on the streets of Northern Ireland and responsibility for it can be laid at the door of the British Government.  It is disingenuous of the British Government to claim that these riots were orchestrated; I would go so far as to say that it is simply untrue. Groups within Ireland, North and South, and indeed our Government, warned the British Government that if Private Clegg were released, it would cause major problems in the North. Anyone familiar with the sensitivities of Nationalists and republicans in regard to the question of prisoners will understand the frustration and bewilderment at the British Government's decision to release Private Clegg.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government's attempt to lay the blame for last night's events on others is simply an attempt at diversionary tactics, which cannot be accepted by anyone.  It is incorrect for the members of the British Government, or indeed the British establishment, to claim, through its media or otherwise, that the decision to release <Col N="1182" /> Private Clegg was a judicial and not a political one.  Paratrooper Clegg was convicted under the British system and judgments were made on two occasions by British courts.</P>
    <P>I hope I will be excused for cynically suggesting that the decision to release Private Clegg, which was taken during a leadership crisis in the Tory party, came about because of British domestic politics. That decision cannot be claimed to be anything other than highly political. The resignation of Ms Gadd, which I believe was a principled action as she regarded the decision to release Clegg as &ldquo;a major deviation from normal procedures&rdquo;, is another demonstration of the fact that the decision was political.</P>
    <P>Prisoners must be treated fairly and equally.  I ask the House to contrast the Clegg case with the cases of two County Clare prisoners serving sentences in British prisons.  Mr. Joe O'Connell, from Querrin, in Kilkee and Mr. Harry Duggan from Feakle, have both served 20 years in prison in the UK.  Their relatives and friends have endured great hardship and incurred much expense in visiting them.  Members of families visiting their relatives in British prisons are often subjected to hostile and degrading treatment.  Prisoners are also moved without the knowledge of their families. The British Government must recognise that this action causes tremendous problems and it must, in the broader political sphere, be prepared to move forward on this issue and do so willingly.</P>
    <P>Must Ireland suffer from the interparty wrangling within the British establishment? Are we once again to be the pawn in a power play among the political parties across the Irish Sea?  Now that the British Government has decided on the leadership of the Tory party, I hope it takes the necessary steps to ensure that it does not squander the delicate and sensitive opportunity for political resolution which will lead to a lasting peace.  Mutual confidence is needed to move forward and I believe that the action taken in the Clegg case has broken that trust.  The British Government now needs to rebuild that <Col N="1183" /> trust.  This will not be done by finding excuses to stall real discussion and debate.  Inclusive talks must commence immediately.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak today on the Report of the Advisory Committee on Third Level Student Support and to indicate the steps that have been taken to date and the further steps I propose to take in the light of the findings and recommendations of the committee.</P>
      <P>On taking office as Minister for Education I was already aware there was widespread dissatisfaction with the perceived inequities in the higher education grants scheme.  Consequently, in April 1993 I set up an advisory committee to examine the third level student support schemes, under the Chairmanship of Dr. Dónal de Buitléir, to report back to me. The advisory committee operated under the following terms of reference: (a) &ldquo;To recommend appropriate criteria for assessment of eligibility on grounds of means in the third-level student support schemes with reference to equity and the financial capacity of parents and applicants to pay.  In so doing the group will examine the operation and application of the criteria for assessment of eligibility on grounds of means in the existing third level student support schemes.  (b) To examine and make recommendations as appropriate on the most effective and efficient organisational arrangements for the administration of the schemes, including rationalisation of the existing schemes.</P>
      <P>Subsequently I wrote to the committee and asked it to consider covenants and student loans and whether or not courses in private colleges should be included in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put on record my appreciation of the careful and detailed consideration which the committee gave <Col N="1184" /> under its terms of reference to the student support schemes and to thank the members of the committee for the commitment and expertise they brought to their task.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, in the policy document <i>A Government of Renewal</i> which was agreed by the Fine Gael.  Labour and Democratic Left parties, a commitment was given to improve access to third level education.  One cannot divorce access to third level education from matters relating to student support.  In the policy agreement therefore there is a commitment that there will be: &ldquo;New support mechanisms to increase participation by third level students from lowincome backgrounds including the abolition of third level fees, a comprehensive reform of the higher education grant scheme, the introduction of support for students on post-Leaving Certificate courses and an increase in the number of third level places&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I will outline to the House how the student support schemes have evolved over the years.  These schemes constitute the system of student support which had to be reviewed and examined by the committee.</P>
    <P>There are three student grant schemes.  The first of these &mdash; the higher education grants scheme was introduced in 1968 &mdash; following the enactment of the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act 1968.  The administration of the higher education grants scheme is entrusted under statute to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>My Department prepares and issues on an annual basis a specimen higher education grants scheme to the local authorities.  Moneys expended by the local authorities on grants under the scheme are also recouped by my Department to the 33 authorities currently administering the scheme.  Each local authority prepares a new scheme each year which under existing legislation is submitted to the Minister for Education for approval.  The scheme which has evolved since 1968 is now regarded as highly complex owing to developments in third level education, <Col N="1185" /> social changes and related improvements and amendments to the schemes over the years.</P>
    <P>The vocational education committee scholarships scheme was established in 1971 to provide assistance to students following courses at certificate or diploma level in the regional technical colleges. Until 1981 vocational education committee scholarships were awarded on a competitive basis and subject to meeting the requirements of the means test.  In 1981 the conditions were changed to provide that vocational education committee scholarships would be awarded to those who achieved specified minimum results in the leaving certificate, who also satisfied the requirements of the means test.</P>
    <P>Because an increasing number of scholarship holders were going on to further education beyond diploma level, the scholarship scheme was gradually expanded to cover courses in other institutions. The vocational education committee scholarships scheme now covers courses in a variety of institutions, in addition to the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    <P>The European Social Fund training grants scheme commenced in the mid 1970s.  The essential purpose of the European Social Fund is to assist in the solution of employment problems, by helping to provide skills for the benefit of those who would not otherwise be able to obtain good and stable employment.  Certain vocationally-orientated courses in the education sector qualify for assistance under the terms of the fund.</P>
    <P>The scheme covers the vast bulk of national certificate and national diploma courses in the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  For training purposes those courses are grouped into two distinct programmes.  The middle level technician programme comprises courses at national certificate level while the higher technical business skills programme comprises courses at national <Col N="1186" /> diploma level.  Since 1992 the ESF maintenance grants scheme for those pursuing national certificate and national diploma courses has been means-tested and the scheme itself administered by the vocational education committees.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the report of the advisory committee.  I was prompted to establish the advisory committee by my concern to address the shortcomings in the student support arrangements.</P>
    <P>The committee submitted its report in November 1993 and it was published in February 1995.  There has been criticism of the time lapse between the submission of the report and its publication but Deputies should understand that it was not a case of its being left on a shelf to gather dust as has been the fate of so many such reports.  There were some recommendations in the report which could be implemented immediately and others which required consultation with Cabinet colleagues before their implementation could be considered.  The advisory committee also envisaged that a number of its recommendations could only be implemented over time as resources became available.</P>
    <P>I was, however, in a position to implement a number of recommendations in the report immediately; I introduced improvements in relation to academic attainments requirements.  Up to 1994 students had been required to have obtained a minimum of two grade Cs in higher level papers in the leaving certificate in order to satisfy the academic requirements of the scheme. With effect from 1994 the academic requirements of the scheme were deemed to be met by students who secured a college place; I introduced new rules for second chance cases; to ensure that students who did not complete studies at a particular level will be eligible to apply for grants to study again at the same level after an interval of five years; I provided a discretionary budget in 1994 to set up a hardship fund with third level institutions.  An allocation of £120,000 was distributed to the colleges to assist students experiencing short term financial difficulties.  This <Col N="1187" /> provision was intended to complement the existing student support arrangements. A further allocation of £80,000 was allocated to assist students suffering from disabilities; I took steps to have the student support scheme funds issued to the local authorities-VECs at end-April-early May in 1994 and 1995.  This contrasts with the position in 1993 when the funds issued in mid-August.</P>
    <P>There were major recommendations on the other hand which required consultation with Cabinet colleagues.  One such recommendation related to the question of covenant tax relief.  The cost to the Exchequer of such tax relief increased from £3.5 million in the 1984-85 tax year to nearly £38 million in 1993-94. There was also the position whereby a parent with an income of £60,000 per annum could get tax relief five times greater than that of a parent with an income of £20,000.</P>
    <P>The committee recommended that this tax relief should be saved and used to increase direct expenditure on third level education.  The House will be aware of the provisions in sections 12 and 13 of the Finance Bill, 1995 regarding covenants and the abolition of fees. The measures being taken to abolish most tax covenant reliefs and redirect the resulting savings to fund the abolition of undergraduate fees represent a significant step forward.  We are using the savings from the termination of a fundamentally regressive tax relief to promote a policy of free access to undergraduate courses at third level which is much more rational, equitable and efficient.</P>
    <P>Further improvements are also planned to assist students to pursue third level studies.  The Minister for Finance announced in the budget that provision will be made for tax relief on fees paid to private colleges in respect of approved courses.  This relief will be introduced for the academic year 1996-97. It is also intended that maintenance grants under the higher education grants scheme will be extended to approved courses being followed by <Col N="1188" /> Irish students abroad with effect from the 1996-97 academic year.</P>
    <P>Another important recommendation in the advisory committee's report related to the public's perception of the fairness of the system of means-testing and the serious disquiet expressed about this.  In fact, the report states that &ldquo;Public confidence in the equity of the system is very low and there is serious resentment by many sections of the community about the system&rdquo;.  It goes on to point out that some students in receipt of grants are perceived not to need them compared with others who need financial assistance but do not qualify under the means test.  The point most often made in submissions to the committee was that the PAYE sector was treated harshly and that students whose parents were self-employed received a disproportionate number of grants.</P>
    <P>The committee recommended, therefore, that the means test should include a capital test on the basis that an individual's capital, or wealth is made up of all their assets, less any liabilities.  They quote the Australian grants system under which the Australian authorities take into account income and assets in deciding on the level of grant assistance to be given to the applicant.  I commend the group on having come forward with a very imaginative approach to dealing with the problem they identified. However, while I have not set the recommendation aside, I am concerned about its effectiveness in tackling the problems it was formulated to resolve. The valuation of farm land and business assets is a very difficult and subjective area.  In any event, my decision earlier this year to abolish third level tuition fees is a much bigger step forward in effectively addressing the equity problems identified by the group.</P>
    <P>Apart from perceived inequities in the system criticisms were expressed about the administration of the student support schemes.  The advisory committee found that the present system is fragmented and very confusing for grant applicants in that there are <Col N="1189" /> three separate schemes administered by 70 agencies in all.  The committee also pointed out that the three schemes have much in common &mdash; the same means test, the same rate of grant and other similar conditions of award.  In addition, both the higher education grants scheme and the vocational education committee scholarships scheme have almost all courses in common.  The committee concluded that there seemed to be no reason for having three separate schemes.  They also recommended that the processing of grant applications and payment of grants should be transferred from the local authorities and the vocational education committees to a central agency.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made to me to the effect that a central agency will be too remote from candidates applying for grants and that the present system enables the agencies at local level to assist candidates with their queries and grant applications in a personal and user-friendly way that a central agency will not be able to do.  Moreover, since the examination of this issue by the advisory committee I have published the White Paper &ldquo;Charting our Education Future&rdquo; which includes a range of measures for significant change in the education system including the creation of regional education boards.</P>
    <P>More recently the Government has decided to apply restrictions to recruitment in the public sector in the context of its review of the 1996 budget.  The proposed central agency would, of course, have required additional staff to enable it to carry out its functions.  It would be appropriate, therefore, to review the advisory committee's recommendation for a central grant processing agency in the light of the recent Government decision on public sector numbers and the changed education landscape planned for the future involving the establishment of regional education boards.</P>
    <P>In assessing in a general way the necessity and significance of the report of the advisory committeee it would be <Col N="1190" /> difficult to over-emphasise the importance of the student support schemes in the context of promoting equity of access to education This aspect is underlined in the report where it is stated that:</P>
    <P>Access to education is one of the most important factors in promoting equity in society and access to third level education in particular conveys to the individual a significant economic and social advantage.  Thus there is a very close link between access to third level education and equity in our society.</P>
    <P>On this basis the committee concluded that &ldquo;because access to higher education had important influences on life chances the State has an interest in ensuring that those who can benefit from higher education are not denied it due to lack of means&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the context it should be noted that the number of students receiving grants has steadily increased over the years. During the 1981-82 academic year 14,000 students received grant aid.  This represented 32 per cent of the total enrolment of 44,000.  By 1993-94, 60 per cent of the total enrolment of 88,000 were receiving grants.  Our membership of the EU, of course, has had a major bearing on the proportion of students receiving grant aid.  The European Social Fund training grants scheme, for example, covers the vast bulk of national certificate and national diploma courses in the regional technical colleges and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  Students attending these courses are not required to pay fees and may qualify for maintenance grants subject to their eligibility under the means test.</P>
    <P>The abolition of fees for full-time undergraduate courses must also be seen as a major advance in the area of student support.  In this context the committee noted that many west European countries operate systems within which there are no tuition fees charged for full-time undergraduate courses and the issue of means-testing relates only <Col N="1191" /> to financial support for living costs.  For example, students in the UK, have benfited from such a system since 1946 and Irish students in the UK have benefitted under the system since 1986.</P>
    <P>In relation to the abolition of undergraduate fees, I established a working group to prepare a report and recommendations on implementation of the initiative.  The working group was chaired by the chairman of the Higher Education Authority and included representatives from the universities, the regional technical colleges, the Dublin Institute of Technology, my Department and the Secretariat of the HEA. This group reported to me and I propose to issue an information leaflet on Thursday setting out the arrangements that will apply the benefit for students and their parents.</P>
    <P>I assure the House of my commitment to improving access to third level education. The establishment of the Advisory Committee on Third Level Student Support underlines my strong commitment to that objective.  The advisory committee wisely expressed the opinion that no scheme will be perfect but I am always willing to listen to views expressed and to consider points made.</P>
    <P>In the context of my initiative in abolishing undergraduate fees I would, for example, refer to my recent announcement that having reviewed the matter and taking account of recommendations made, particular courses in the Mater Dei Institute of Education, the Pontifical College, Maynooth, the Milltown Institute of Theology and Philosphy and All Hallows College, Drumcondra, are now to be included in the free fee scheme.  Similarly, in the student support area, I am aware that there are other part-time courses where grants are seen to be warranted.  I will keep this and the whole area of student support under review and make further improvements as resources become available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>While welcoming the fact that at long last we are debating the de <Col N="1192" /> Buitléir report six months after I raised the issue of its publication during Private Members' time in January 1995, I regret that such an important report on the higher education grant system should have been discarded and essentially ignored by the Minister for Education.</P>
      <P>It is important to realise that the de Buitléir report was completed in November 1993 but was published only in January 1995 and not one of its major recommendations has been implemented.  The report underlining the necessity for urgent action, particularly the need to streamline the administration of the scheme, states that &ldquo;early decisions are required if the new arrangements are to be fully or partly in place for 1994 grant applications&rdquo;.  Due to the Minister's inertia, the new arrangements are not in place for 1995 grant applicants.</P>
      <P>More fundamentally, however, the Minister in her budgetary package, particularly the free fees proposal, went totally against the thrust and fundamental principles of the de Buitléir report's recommmendations on student support systems.  The de Buitléir report argues essentially against free fees for all.  It argues that those who &ldquo;cannot afford to pay for third level education should be supported by grants while those who are better off and therefore able to pay should receive a lesser or zero grant.&rdquo;  It correctly put forward the view that, since the State's resources are inevitably limited, efficiency requires that grants should be paid only to those who need them to attend college, that it is not efficient to substitute public expenditure on higher education for existing private expenditure and that student support is only warranted where shortage of means demands it.  It put forward the concept of vertical equity which, in the context of a student support system for third level education, means that the rate of grant given should vary from full grant support for those with low means to zero support for those with means adequate to support a student at third level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1193" /> At no stage does the de Buitléir report suggest that fees should be abolished. This important advisory committee established by the Minister for Education and reporting as far back as 1993 did not suggest that fees should be abolished but it did favour the phased abolition of tax covenants in education arguing that the resources generated by this move should be reallocated to increase direct expenditure under the student support schemes.  It argued that the money yielded to the Exchequer by the abolition of tax covenants should be used, for example, to increase the means test eligibility threshold, to increase the maintenance grants rates, to introduce a system of marginal relief, to bring in specific measures to help larger families and to bring part-time students within the higher education grant scheme as well as improving the position of mature students in the student support system.</P>
    <P>The report proposed the phased abolition of tax covenants arguing that existing covenants should be allowed to run their course on the grounds that families have already planned expenditure on their children's third level education.  It felt morally that such agreements should be honoured by the State but the Minister and the Government have no such moral reservations and arbitrarily and immediately abolished these covenants for short term electoral gain.  I repeat at no stage did the de Buitléir report suggest that the revenue gained from the abolition of tax covenants should be used to abolish third level undergraduate fees to the exclusion of all other categories of students.</P>
    <P>In Private Members' motions and during the debate on the White Paper on education we outlined areas that have been starved of resources and categories of students in the third level system who are grossly underfunded and lack adequate support.  Given the constraints on public expenditure I maintain that the £38 million realised should be redistributed equitably and in a socially progressive way.</P>
    <P>Given that the main thrust of the de Buitléir report has not been adopted, <Col N="1194" /> why does the Minister bother establishing such committees and commissioning such reports if at the end of the day she will ignore its fundamental recommendations and go against its main policy thrust?  Committee members obviously realised the existing scheme was very limited, inefficient and inequitable and the extra revenue generated should be used to bring about a more socially progressive and equitable student support system.  The de Buitléir report highlighted in a succinct manner the inadequacies and inequities of the present system particularly in relation to the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>It is widely accepted that the third level grant system is totally inequitable and discriminates in an appalling manner against the PAYE sector.  Deputies have been inundated with calls of complaint from PAYE workers who have received no financial support whatever in the past because of the harsh and arbitrary nature of the schemes.  The income limits are simply too low and larger families, in particular, suffer.  In addition, the scheme is too rigid and people who are marginally over the income limits suffer unduly as a result. No marginal relief provision exists. Study after study confirms that other sectors of the economy benefit more proportionally than the PAYE sector and this needs to be addressed quickly. The de Buitléir report confirms this and argues that the major beneficiaries of the student support system are not those families in the lowest income groups and that the top 20 per cent of income earners obtain over 16 per cent of expenditure.</P>
    <P>The report in its assessment of the existing scheme highlighted the main defects with the means assessment system as the inadequate definition of means under the existing schemes, the steep reduction in grants payable to those marginally in excess of the income limits and the less favourable treatment of larger families.  It proposed an improvement in the position of larger families and the introduction of fair and acceptable provisions for withdrawal of <Col N="1195" /> grants to apply to those just over the income limit.  The report put forward the view that in any means tested scheme there must be special arrangements for dealing with cases which are marginally over the income limit.  It argued correctly that some relief is necessary under the income test to cover cases in which applicants are marginally over the threshold.</P>
    <P>In relation to large families I support the contention made in the report that the allowance in the present scheme for larger families is too low.  It is clear that some children from smaller families who receive grants are better off than children from larger families who are denied them.  I agree with the recommendation in the report that appropriate equivalent scales be used to establish the appropriate income limit for different family sizes.  Furthermore it is widely accepted that for families living distances from third level colleges the real cost is not fees but the maintenance of students at college.</P>
    <P>It is an incontrovertible fact that the maintenance grants bear no relationship to the actual cost of maintaining a student away from home.  The Union of Students of Ireland has estimated that the average cost of putting a student through college in 1994 was about £5,250.  These realistic calculations can be considered modest.  The average maintenance grant still works out at £40 per week which would hardly pay for rented accommodation.  Having listened to my colleagues it is clear that the level of maintenance grants is critical.  In her Budget Statement the Minister made no real attempt to improve maintenance grants significantly.  It is becoming very difficult for many students to survive in college due to the low level of maintenance support.  The Minister allocated the entire yield from the abolition of tax covenants to undergraduate fees alone and made no attempt to deal with the issue of maintenance.</P>
    <P>Because of this Government's mismanagement of the national finances and the cutbacks mentioned in her <Col N="1196" /> speech, the Minister's capacity in future to do anything effective on this issue is significantly reduced.  She did nothing in the recent budget to assist mature or part-time students.  She ignored, in particular, the recommendation of the de Buitléir report in relation to mature students who, if attending part-time or evening courses, are not entitled to a maintenance grant.  Those studying in full time day courses can be eligible for higher education grants.  The problem is that mature students, regardless of their age, are means tested on their parents' income if they are living at home.  Many mature students who have given up jobs to go to college move back to their parents' homes as a consequence and, because of the means test provision, are in a catch-22 situation.</P>
    <P>The de Buitléir report recommends that mature applicants over the age of 25 years should be means tested on their own income, regardless of residence. It is disappointing that this has not yet happened.  In Northern Ireland students can get additional grants for spouse and child support.  Olive Keogh, in an excellent article some time ago on the issue of mature students in the &ldquo;Education and Living&rdquo; supplement of <i>The Irish Times</i>, said: &ldquo;For people already working or recently unemployed the financial support to upgrade their qualifications is woefully inadequate&rdquo;.  She concluded the article by saying that for many mature people considering going to college to upgrade their qualifications &ldquo;the prospects are very bleak indeed&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that the student support system must be dramatically improved for postgraduate students who make incredible sacrifices to pursue further research.  The recently published report of the Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council highlighted serious under-provision in the postgraduate area.  Indeed, the report painted a damning picture of under-provision in this sector.  It recommended, for example, that basic research funding <Col N="1197" /> for higher education should be increased from £1.5 million to £6 million per annum and that a further £5 million should be made available to redress the deficiencies in research equipment.  Furthermore, it argued that each PhD scholarship should be funded at a level of not less than £3,000 per year.</P>
    <P>Any postgraduate student can tell tales of obsolete equipment, poor library facilities, overcrowded laboratories and inadequate research grants. They still have to pay their fees and the budget education package serves only to worsen their situation.  Yesterday, I received a letter from a postgraduate student who said that the abolition of undergraduate fees was a cynical political exercise to appease the floating voters in certain constituencies where the Labour Party has new TDs.  Many students from the postgraduate and PLC sectors are writing to Deputies condemning the lack of provision in their areas.  Recently I was alerted to the fact that the UCD library committee in the postgraduate scientific research area proposes to reduce the number of scientific journals from 300 to 200 per annum.</P>
    <P>There is critical and scandalous under-provision in the postgraduate sector and, despite the budgetary statement and the de Buitléir report, there has been no response from the Minister or the Government in terms of increasing subsistence and financial support for the students concerned.  Parents who are covenanting to postgraduate children, for example, will lose their covenant savings as a result of the budget and will gain nothing since those fees have not been abolished.  It is regrettable that the Minister did not give priority to the plight of postgraduate students in the context of the student support system.</P>
    <P>Their plight is set to worsen with colleges about to announce savage increases in postgraduate fees.  In May it was revealed that UCD is proposing a general increase of 12 per cent in post-graduate fees and a savage 40 per cent increase for PhD students.  The latest indication is that the general fee <Col N="1198" /> increase will now be about 10.8 per cent in UCD and 8 per cent in Maynooth for postgraduate students.  That is intolerable and unacceptable and well above the rate of inflation.  It is inexcusable and absurd, given all the hullabaloo about free fees for undergraduate students, that fees for postgraduate students should be increased to such an extent.  These increases represent a damning indictment of Government policy on postgraduate education.  In any reform of the higher education grants scheme, special measures must be introduced to improve the provisions for postgraduate students.  The research capacity of the higher education system is an important national resource.  It is important that society acknowledges this and gives this sector the priority it deserves.</P>
    <P>The most controversial proposal in the report is the proposal to introduce a capital test, in addition to the existing income test, to qualify for a third level grant.  I have no desire to engage in a witch-hunt of those who currently qualify for grants.  However, in the context of improving the student support system I am specifically interested in broadening the scope of the existing scheme to embrace students and families from the PAYE sector who up to now have been the clear losers.  The report engages in considerable ideological debate to justify the introduction of a capital test as well as an incomes test.  We must remember, however, that assets in many cases are required fundamentally to produce income.  Their dilution or sale inevitably will reduce the capacity of asset holders, particularly farmers, to generate sufficient income.  Such proposals must be discussed in the public arena.  The interests involved have a right to make submissions and to have an input into these proposals.  Has the Minister invited submissions on the recommendations of this report from the interested bodies concerned?</P>
    <P>The implications of such a test are obviously serious for a farm family that depends on assets to generate income, and in some cases we are talking about <Col N="1199" /> very moderate levels of income.  A farm family with four children, two of whom are already in college, on an income just over the average industrial wage would satisfy the means test but would fail the capital assets test applied in the manner and at the thresholds proposed in the report.  The situation could be worse for farm families involved in dry stock production because of the lower profitability of the dry stock enterprises compared with dairying and the larger amount of land and stock required to generate an equivalent level of income. We must be extremely careful in considering this proposal.  The Minister should clarify her position on the matter during this debate.  We were given minor clarification this evening although the Minister said that she has not put the proposal aside.</P>
    <P>The preferable course of action is to continue to use a proper incomes or means test mechanism operated by the Revenue Commissioners, who have been particularly successful in recent years in ensuring greater tax compliance. I understand the frustration felt by many on hearing about and seeing the appalling anomalies of people with expensive lifestyles who somehow qualify for grants.  That is unacceptable and it is important to introduce proper mechanisms to prevent such anomalies. The involvement of the Revenue Commissioners in assessing and overseeing applications should help enormously in this regard.</P>
    <P>One recommendation of the report with which I strongly disagree deals with post leaving certificate students.  It recommended that the scheme should not be extended to include PLC students.  Perhaps at the time of the committee's deliberations the impact of the PLC phenomenon had not manifested itself clearly to the members.  I have argued on more than one occasion that the forgotten people of our education system, in so far as the present Minister for Education is concerned, are the post leaving certificate students. This sector has been the most exciting <Col N="1200" /> and radical development in education for decades.  There are approximately 17,500 students attending post leaving certificate courses this year.  These students receive no maintenance grants and the Minister refused in her budgetary strategy to use some of the resources realised by the abolition of tax covenants to provide maintenance support for them.</P>
    <P>Students in further education courses in Northern Ireland, who are doing the same courses as students in the South, receive such maintenance support.  In the budget the Minister allocated £2 million towards the abolition of fees in the PLC courses.  This proposal caused considerable confusion and is leading to administrative chaos in the colleges concerned. They simply do not know what they can put in their promotional brochures.</P>
    <P>The Department is currently surveying the colleges to find out the levels of fees charged and the charges levied by professional bodies involved in the certification of these courses.  Why did the Minister not do her homework in advance?  Why announce the proposals without dotting the i's and crossing the t's?  The Minister is prone to making popular announcements without proper research and preparation, resulting in confusion and chaos.  Many of the people involved in these courses would normally have brochures ready in May or early June for the following autumn and would include information concerning fees and so forth.  I have heard considerable criticism from staff in the colleges concerned about the present position.  It would have been far easier and simplier if the Minister had provided some level of maintenance support to students attending PLC courses instead of eroding a useful revenue basis for the PLC colleges themselves.</P>
    <P>The treatment of PLC students has been inequitable and unjust.  It is absurd that it is now cheaper for some students to go to university than to a PLC college. That is the Labour Party's concept of fair play and social justice.</P>
    <P>On the administration side, the de <Col N="1201" /> Buitléir report makes far reaching and laudable recommendations which I endorse and fully support.  What is inexplicable is the Minister's failure to implement many of them.  Its most important proposal is the creation of a centralised single agency supported by an information system provided through schools, local authorities or vocational education committees, supplemented by free telephone information lines at appropriate times to operate the schemes.  It argued that the most appropriate agency to carry out the routine administration of the scheme is the Central Applications Office.  Indeed, the de Buitléir committee discussed the issue with the CAO and came up with a feasible timetable in the report.  This would mean, for example, that the CAO would be able to advise students whether they would be eligible or not by July of every year.  It also recommended the payment of monthly instalments of the grant from October onwards, ending the enduring saga of late payment of grants.</P>
    <P>All of this was proposed as far back as 1993 and there has been no action since.  The Minister gave the lame excuse that action could not be taken on this matter because of the White Paper on education, the new regional education boards and the public sector embargo announced recently by the Minister for Finance.  This is an appalling situation.  No one can deny that having 70 agencies involved in the administration of the grants schemes with three separate grant forms to fill up is ludicrous.  We all accept the concept of retaining local advisory bodies.  The new REBs, when they are formed, or the existing vocational education committees, could provide such local advice and help in filling in these forms.</P>
    <P>The de Buitléir report called for a simplification of the higher education grant forms.  The forms have not been simplified.  Only last week I had to help parents to fill in a number of these forms.  They are appallingly complicated and are intimidating to many parents.  It is scandalous that even on that basic issue we have not had a simplification, <Col N="1202" /> despite the fact that the de Buitléir report was completed in November 1993.</P>
    <P>As the report points out, there are three separate schemes administered by over 70 agencies.  There is no reason for the continuation of three separate schemes.  I support the recommendation that the requirement for grant recipients to pay a deposit to reserve a college place and subsequently to pay their fees at registration should be dispensed with. According to the de Buitléir report, a certificate of qualification should be issued to the student in advance.</P>
    <P>I also strongly support the recommendation that the maintenance grant should be paid in equal monthly instalments in advance into an account of the financial institution of the student's choice.  This would allow the student some degree of financial certainty and alleviate the type of budgetary problems which the present system creates for many students.</P>
    <P>An independent appeals procedure is urgently required.  Again I am at a loss as to why the Minister has not introduced such a procedure &mdash; there is no reference to it in the Minister's speech. Under the existing system, the Department and the Minister for Education effectively exercise a decision making as well as an appeals function.  This is clearly unsatisfactory and I support the recommendations in the report that the appeal commissioners appointed under tax law be given to the power to decide all appeals on grant eligibility and that appeals should be decided within two months from the date of the appeal.</P>
    <P>Some colleges already had hardship funds or fee concession schemes in place when the de Buitléir report was finalised.  There has been a fee concession scheme in operation in UCC for many years.  However, it is difficult to see how the colleges can supplement these funds on an ongoing basis without assistance from the Minister who seems intent on eroding the revenue base that colleges currently have through fees.</P>
    <P>On that point, it would be useful if the Minister would clarify &mdash; I welcome <Col N="1203" /> the announcement that there will be some clarification on Thursday &mdash; whether colleges will be charging registration, capitation and library fees this autumn and whether, despite the free fees proposals, students will still be paying fees of a sort while attending university and will not have the benefit of the students support scheme to avoid paying these charges.  Essentially, new charges will be introduced.  They will be called registration or library charges, but they are new charges and they will form a revenue base for the college which, as day follows night, will inevitably mean that they will become the new fees in the years to come.  It may also involve a recognition by the Minister that one of the most critical problems facing colleges is their revenue base for future capital development and it is important that such a revenue base is retained.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the work of the de Buitléir committee.  By and large, its recommendations are simple, straightforward and progressive and I support the majority of them.  It is totally unsatisfactory, however, that the Minister has failed to implement most of its proposals and has in fact implemented policies that run counter to the fundamentally egalitarian principles of the report.  The de Buitléir committee genuinely sought equality of opportunity for students.  The Minister has ignored that route and has pursued a different one in the false hope of electoral gain.  However, the pursuit of electoral gain on its own is no basis for a sound and socially progressive education policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish I could say that I welcomed the opportunity to speak on the Report of the Advisory Committee on Third Level Student Support.  That is what I had hoped to do months and even years ago because I believed that it was the basis for the restructing of our third level maintenance and grants system. Initially, the administrative or housekeeping bits and pieces of the <Col N="1204" /> report were published and the Minister said at that stage that she was taking them on board.  Unfortunately, we are still awaiting the results of much of that and there has not been the implementation we were promised when we debated that part of the report.  I found it remarkable that the rest of the report was not published when we debated a portion of it.  It is a little disingenuous of my Fianna Fáil colleagues to disclaim all the blame for that.  Notwithstanding that, however, the Minister should have taken the lead.  She did not and therefore she has to take the blame.</P>
      <P>The background against which this committee was established is one where there is grave discontent with the grants and maintenance system.  People, especially those in the PAYE sector, believed they were being discriminated against.  There was much concern that sons and daughters of big farmers received grant maintenance while the sons and daughters of those in the PAYE sector, such as teachers or gardaí, did not receive what they believed was their just desserts and would find themselves over the margins as far as grant limits were concerned.  It was a limited public scandal in the sense that it was referred to every year at the time when students had aspirations to go to college.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also the continuing difficulty about the maintenance grants allocations. The administration section of the report purported to deal with that problem.  While there are still some difficulties, it has improved thanks to some extent to the recommendations of the report, even though many of these recommendations were not taken on board.  At least it focused the mind on the difficulties the students faced.  They would be in college for many months and there would be no sign of their maintenance grants, which had enormous knock on effects in terms of hardship for those children.  They had to borrow and soon found themselves at a disadvantage at an early stage of their academic careers.  While the situation has improved, much more needs to be <Col N="1205" /> done.  However, we all accepted, when we debated that aspect of the report, that this was not the crux of the matter. The nuts and bolts could and should be dealt with since we were dealing with equity in the system.</P>
    <P>The Minister said she wanted to put on record her appreciation of the careful and detailed consideration which the de Buitléir committee gave, under its terms of reference, to the student support schemes.  She thanked the members for their commitment and expertise in producing a good report.  She also said the committee submitted its report in November 1993 and that it was published in February 1995.  I was and am critical of the time lapse between the submission of the report and its publication. However, the Minister asked Deputies to understand that it was not a case of leaving it on a shelf to gather dust, which was the fate of many such reports.  There were many layers of dust on that report when one considers what the report states and what subsequently happened.</P>
    <P>The overview of the report states:</P>
    <P>Participation rates in higher education differ among socio-economic groups.  Equal access to higher education is important.  Those who complete third-level education have higher earnings, experience less unemployment and exercise more power and influence in society than those who do not.</P>
    <P>We were talking about a just society and equity in the system.  The approach of the committee, therefore, was to devise a system which was fair, economically efficient and simple.  The Minister congratulated it on its approach.</P>
    <P>As regards student support systems, the report states:</P>
    <P>To deny large segments of the population access to third-level education because they have inadequate means to finance the costs of such education which must be borne by the family, is to deny the opportunity to <Col N="1206" /> many to realise the significant financial benefits of this education ... However, since many of the gains arising from third-level education are captured by private individuals, in terms of improved employment opportunities, higher earnings and greater job satisfaction, student support is only warranted where shortage of means demand it.</P>
    <P>That is the crux of the issue as far as I am concerned.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>Because access to higher education has important influences on life chances, we conclude that the State has an interest in ensuring that those who can benefit from higher education are not denied it due to lack of means.  We also conclude that those who have the means to do so should contribute towards the cost of their higher education.</P>
    <P>However, the direct opposite happened. The Minister announced the free fees scheme for third level education, which showed political expediency, rather than equity.  This flies in the face of the report's recommendations.  The issue of debating the report never arose.  When the scheme was announced by the Minister I endeavoured to contact the Department, but I was told it knew nothing about it.  I contacted the Department of Finance, but it also knew nothing about it.  I was then directed to the Minister's private office where her officials knew something, but not much about the scheme.  No one could have known much about it because it was not thought through nor was it the result of deliberations on this report.  It was a politically expedient move which was directed towards the middle class voters which the Labour Party wanted to attract.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows from the long debates we have had since the announcement of the scheme that this has nothing to do with equity.  Educationalists &mdash; who should know what they are talking about &mdash; and anyone who knows anything about deprivation <Col N="1207" /> have stated that this was not the right thing to do.  If spare money is available or if the Minister takes resources from the education system through abolishing tax relief on covenants, etc., she should use it to educate children at primary school level where our system is not good enough.  Many primary schools are being supported by cake sales.</P>
    <P>I assume my children will be the lucky beneficiaries of this scheme.  During this debate I listened to the cogent argument made by Deputy Dukes that someone on an income such as his should be able to afford to put his children through third level education.  I am delighted, as any parent would be, that I do not have to pay university fees if my children are lucky enough to go there.  It is natural to be thankful for not having to provide for that, but it is not right and nobody I have spoken to says it is.  We will all accept it, but we know it is not right.</P>
    <P>By having statements on this report, we are operating in a never never land. What recommendations will the Minister implement?  The Minister will choose small sections from this report so that she will be able to say she took on board what the report said about third level student support.  It means nothing.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Martin said, there is total confusion about post leaving certificate courses.  For example, in Dún Laohgaire, which is the Minister's and my constituency, the vocational education committee post leaving certificate courses are excellent.  As the Minister knows, the fee for such courses is only £25.  However, there is a charge which can amount to several hundred pounds depending on the course.  There is total confusion about what will happen in this regard.  Students are under the impression that they will have free fees and they will assume that charges will also be free.  They have not been given any guidelines from the Department on this.  These charges will be difficult to <Col N="1208" /> collect because parents who contribute to them will assume that the charges are free.  This will result in confusion in Dún Laoghaire.  Students taking post leaving certificate courses in a few months' time will not know where they stand and that is unfair.  This system is supposed to be based on fairness and equity, but it is a joke.</P>
    <P>We are all singing from the same hymn sheet here because we are aware of the problems.  For example, there are problem with regard to what charges the universities will impose.  They will have registration charges which have been likened to the road tax which is a creeping charge.  Will they also charge exam fees?  On the question of post-graduate fees I wish to quote from one of many letters I received.  It states:</P>
    <P>I am writing to you in reference to the proposed fee increase for post-graduate students at University College Dublin.  The levels of the increase are in some cases up to 12 times the current rate of inflation. This will result in hardship for postgraduates who are already struggling financially.</P>
    <P>It goes on to make a very important point:</P>
    <P>Moreover these increases will make it even more difficult for students to enter and pursue post-graduate studies in Ireland.  This is a serious threat to the future of all research in this country.</P>
    <P>Much critical research which should be carried out by post-graduate students and others will be neglected as a result of the increases.  Everyone knows that research is essential for development and this area will &mdash; at the very least be diminished and &mdash; at the worst &mdash; lost. The universities will have no option but to follow the course because they do not know where they stand.  We are talking here about the people who at a certain level should be the intellectual leaders <Col N="1209" /> in society and who should be challenging us during the next century.</P>
    <P>The report concludes that public confidence in the equity of the system is very low and that there is serious resentment among many sections of the community about it.  It goes on to say that the administration of the system needs substantial improvement, it is complicated and confusing for the applicant and the quality of service is unacceptably low in terms of timing of the notification of grant eligibility and payment of the grant.  There is no renewed confidence in the equity of the system; rather there is more dissatisfaction with it.</P>
    <P>We are debating the report in a vacuum and I wonder how meaningful these statements can be.  The report recommends that means testing for third level grants should be based on an income and capital test and sets out how this could operate in practice.  Much of what is contained in the report is valid and I take on board Deputy Martin's arguments about assets etc.  However, there should be a degree of flexibility in regard to the grants and the level of income.  Far from ensuring that we have an equitable system we are perpetuating the inequities in society.</P>
    <P>Most of us are middle class and, like our parents, want to give our children the best education possible.  I am very surprised at the Minister who knows more about disadvantage than I do although I have worked in disadvantaged areas and in schools which suffer enormous disadvantage.  I know that people working in deprived inner city areas will ask why, if we did not find favour with the solutions we did not debate them and come up with a balanced solution.  This has not happened and this expensive publication might as well have been left on the shelf for all the attention that has been given to it. It is a joke to be discussing it tonight because the goalposts have been moved and a totally different element has been <Col N="1210" /> thrust on top of it.  As I said, maintenance grants are essential for students living away from home and if we worked within the broad framework in the report there would be greater equity for them.</P>

      <P>This debate has been deferred so often that I have had to constantly check my script to see if it is up to date.  In terms of access to third level education and funding, this excellent report should be the blueprint for the future.  However, we are debating it in a vacuum as the way forward for third level education has already been decided.  Nonetheless it is a good report and it will be as relevant to the future of education in five or ten years' time as it is today.</P>
      <P>The majority of Members do not have the same attitude to education as I do. I regard education as the only means by which people living in areas which are socially, environmentally, economically and educationally disadvantaged can get true representation and can be in a position to say &ldquo;this type of representation is not good enough for me and something must be done about the area in which I live and about unemployment&rdquo;. Until we get to the point where people have access we will never have equality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened with interest to the previous speakers and I am sure they believe passionately in everything they said. They are as much to blame as anyone else for the neglect, the deprivation and the lack of access.  For over ten years I have been speaking about areas where children who do not even finish secondary school, let alone think about third level, and have been totally ignored. Why should people think they would listen if they were in power?  To give people power, information, the right to govern themselves, to stand up and to assert their right to be heard and the type of representation they need would be a frightening prospect for politicians. Politicians might think they would not <Col N="1211" /> be needed if the voiceless had a voice. Politicians can pretend to be the voice of the voiceless when it suits, but when in office they do not give to people the power to order their own lives.</P>
    <P>I take with a grain of salt these grandiose speeches I hear from people who could have put in place the mechanism to begin to deal with the problem which comes from generations of neglect.  I am not foolish enough to believe that one, two or three terms in Government would rectify the neglect of these people.  It was perpetrated neglect, for which we are beginning to pay the price in terms of the breakdown of society in certain areas.  The fabric of society is breaking down in areas where people do not go to third level or have difficulty in remaining to the end of second level.  It is not breaking down in areas such as Dun Laoghaire or Foxrock.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is interested in power, not policy.  The de Buitléir report still holds out enormous hope for the people for whom it was meant to give hope.  It can be implemented on a phased basis.  There are huge problems associated with getting people from second level into third level.  The people we need to get to third level, in order to have a balanced society which looks after all its children, need to be supported financially, not only in relation to fees but in relation to maintenance, the home liaison scheme and attitudinal changes.  We need to examine the whole area of third level education, including the post leaving certificate courses, before September.</P>
      <P>It would not have been my choice to give fees to third level students.  On the other hand I have been approached by many people who have told me they are delighted with the move and that they will benefit.  These are not the multi-rich but hardpressed PAYE earners, as I was until recently.  They will benefit enormously. There is a section of society which will insist on their children going to third level education.  In the past they had to pay through the nose, as well as paying heavy taxes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The eligibility threshold should have been raised but I am not the Minister for Education and I do not claim to be an expert in all fields.  The de Buitléir report, if implemented, will lead the way forward to third level but other things need to be done.  We need to start with pre-school, secondary school, home liasion schemes, encouragement, <Col N="1213" /> structures, being determined and choosing people whom we know have ability to go forward.</P>
    <P>I may appear to be opposed to everything tonight but I do not believe in gender quotas.  They are necessary for a short period.  When it comes to bringing people from certain areas and certain backgrounds through to third level we need to take positive action and there needs to be positive discrimination.  If that means hand picking people in order to give example I do not have a problem with it because it would only be necessary for a short period.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;she has a more difficult job than I thought.  I am pleased we have had the opportunity, late as it is, to debate the Buitléir report.  Unfortunately it has taken several months to get it on the floor of the House but better late then never.  I did not expect to hear so much criticism of the report.  It is a report that needs careful scrutiny. The decisions on many of the recommendations should not be politically expedient but correct decisions for the future educational needs of our young people, our young adults and the economic development of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk during the years about the need for a well educated workforce.  We are proud that we have such a workforce.  Unfortunately, we have been rapped on the knuckles in the recent OECD report with regard to many of our so-called well educated graduates.  In meeting the needs of <Col N="1214" /> economic development it is vitally important that there be easier access to third level education, particularly if we support the concept of an increase in participation rates to which the Minister adverted in the White Paper, from 90,000 to 120,000.</P>
    <P>We are not here to make grandiose speeches; everyone is concerned about what may happen in the future.  While we will make political points, much of what we say comes from the heart and from our experience as members of vocational education committees, education boards and teachers etc.  The bottom line is how best the scarce resources, despite the fact that the Education budget is £2 billion, can be spent to ensure equity and efficiency.</P>
    <P>On the question of access, many people believe there is discrimination against the average student.  There is limited access to third level education due to the policy on admissions; in other words, the points race.  We will have to wait and see what transpires but many leaving certificate students this year will be disappointed that they will not get what they want and some of them will have to travel to Northern Ireland and England.</P>
    <P>The points system places enormous pressure on students and limits access. While there is a need to set standards, many students with high points are disappointed when they try to gain entry to particular subject areas.  It is not that long ago since I was a student at UCD; I would not now gain entry to the course I entered as the number of points required has increased.  We all aspire to a balanced and varied education system. The current system of which we are proud and from which we have benefited will be eroded if the points rat race continues.  Access to third level education will be most important in the next few years.</P>
    <P>On the question of the grants system, we have higher education grants, <Col N="1215" /> vocational education committee scholarships and ESF grants.  Overall, there are 70 bodies which deal with grant applications.  That does not lead to efficiency.  Unlike the Minister, I have not supported the concept of centralisation. The Minister in his speech put forward the public service embargo as one of the reasons for centralisation but that was a cop out.  There is a need for efficiency in providing a service to parents and students who will apply for third-level grants.  In this regard the Minister mentioned that responsibility is to be given to the RECs.  That responsibility should be county based.  I know there was a proposal to give advice, but having access to applications in the event of a mistake being made and the ability to give proper advice to parents with regard to financial assessments is important.  It would be better to have one body responsible in every county, be it the vocational education committee or county council.</P>
    <P>If the Minister continued with centralisation, she would have had a huge increase in funding, resources and staffing. It is clear that she will not now be able to do this.</P>
    <P>There has been some movement on the recommendation on application forms.  While some progress has been made in simplifying the forms, they still run to 12-14 pages and could be further simplified.  Many people find them off-putting.</P>
    <P>The report refers to the late payment of maintenance grants on which we have received numerous representations.  I support the proposal in the report that these grants should be paid in equal monthly instalments in advance.  This would alleviate some of the hardship endured by students who have to wait until Christmas to receive the first instalment.  If the grant was paid in advance, paltry though it is, students, particularly those who are totally reliant <Col N="1216" /> on it, would be allowed to start in September with a few pounds in the bank to meet expenses such as rent, etc.</P>
    <P>The notion that students should have to pay a £100 deposit to reserve a place, especially those in receipt of grant-aid, is ludicrous.  While I accept there is a need to reserve places in university and other third level institutions to avoid mayhem, the earlier payment of grants would eliminate the need to pay a £100 deposit which could be used by students as a deposit on a flat or to buy books etc.  This is a major item for many people.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion about third level fees.  Removing tax relief on covenants, with which Members on this side of the House did not agree, made £35 million available to invest in the third level sector.  I have my own opinions in this regard but the decision has been made and we will have to live with it.  The report suggested abolishing tax relief on covenants but it also suggested funding should be used to increase direct expenditure under the student support scheme.  That recommendation was not accepted.  The Minister decided instead to abolish third level fees.  As well as increasing expenditure under the student support scheme the eligibility thresholds for the free fees should have been raised.</P>
    <P>There are people who can well afford to pay third level fees and I am not referring to PAYE workers, workers in the Civil Service or professional staff in the public service such as gardaí and teachers.  That they will not pay the fees contributes to a loss in third level institutions.</P>
    <P>Other consequential matters need to be addressed.  Two weeks ago when I prepared this speech I forecast that colleges and universities would have separate registration fees, capitation fees for the students' union and examination fees etc.</P>
    <P>I had a suspicion, as I think had everybody, that this would happen.  The <Col N="1217" /> cost this year will be £100 or £150.  I agree with what was said in the House today, that it could be £500 next year or in three years time.  There is no such thing as free education and it is a fallacy to say there is.  It is wrong of people to say there will be no fees while students will end up having to pay a registration fee or some other such fee.</P>
    <P>Third level education is very expensive, but the benefits to the country as a consequence of investing in it are such that people should not be prevented from having access to third level institutions. I am concerned about the proposal by universities to introduce a registration fee for students.  That may be extended at a later stage to examination fees and so on.  I do not know if we have control over these matters. Universities were not particularly enthusiastic about the idea of abolishing third level fees because they believe they are starved of investment and capital. I regret that has happened, and the Minister should ensure the proposed charges are not proceeded with.</P>
    <P>On the fees issue I am very concerned about the independent mature students. They have been put on the adjacent rate for maintenance which means in net terms they will lose £1,000 per year, which is unfair.  We are paying pious platitudes to further education and encouraging people to return to education, yet many mature students have to work during the day to save a few pounds to attend classes at night.  Full time day students have had to make many sacrifices over the years to save money for their education, only to discover they will receive very little help by way of maintenance.  It is a harsh decision to apply the adjacent rate of grant to these people.  It is discrimination against rural independent mature students, a devastating act given that we are talking about investing in education and making available proper skills and qualifications to young adults.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> There was much discussion in the House today on post leaving certificate &mdash; PLC &mdash; courses.  Unfortunately these courses are not regarded as third level courses.  Colleges of further education in Northern Ireland fund similar courses to the detriment of schools and colleges, particularly along the Border.  The Border areas are unfairly disadvantaged in regard to PLC courses.  Students travel from Donegal to colleges in Derry, Omagh and Enniskillen where recognised courses are provided.  Those courses should be provided in County Donegal.  There is need to consider the status of PLC courses.  There is total confusion as to which courses will proceed. If fees are not charged for these courses will the Department guarantee the necessary funding will be made available?  For example, a very good courses in recreation and leisure, leading to diplomas, is provided at a cost of about £270 per person.  If no fees are charged &mdash; some of the fees were token fees &mdash; what courses will be funded?  It is important to have a variety of courses, particularly PLC courses.</P>
    <P>The means issue has always been a touchy one.  The report states, at the conclusion of the chapter on evaluation of the third level grants scheme, that public confidence in the equity of the system is very low and there is serious resentment by many sections of the community about the system.  It states that a student support system must be equitable and it must be clear to the public at large that it is so.  It also refers to equity and efficiency.  I empathise, particularly with PAYE workers, many of whom do not have confidence in the present system.  The proposal to introduce a capital test, with which the Minister does not agree, will be a devisive one.  This may not be Labour Party policy, and it is certainly not Democratic Left policy but the big farmers in Fine Gael must have been able to persuade the rainbow coalition in this regard.</P>

      <P>I am sure Fine Gael will take all the credit for reversal of the proposal on the capital test.  The Progressive Democrats Party does not agree with that decision but I agree with it.  The problem in terms of perception and reality has not been tackled.  As regards the capital test the Minister stated: &ldquo;while I have not set the recommendation aside, I am concerned about its effectiveness in dealing with the problems it was formulated to deal with.&rdquo;  That means she is unable to deal with the matter.  We do not know what will be done in this regard.  The matter has not been addressed and problems will remain in terms of perception and reality not only of the system but of what real income is.</P>
      <P>Over the years the self-employed, the people who have kept the country going for years, have been harassed.  It is nonsense that, for example, a house worth £80,000 may have to be sold to send one's children to college.  If it created an an income of £2,000 per year I would have no problem with taking it into consideration. The same applies to farmers, should they have to sell every cow in order to send their children to university? That is ridiculous.</P>

      <P>Standing aside has been the practice in this House for the last number of years.  The Minister stood back from making a difficult decision when a proper one could have been made.  The Government's approach to a divisive issue is similar to what Peig Sayers said: &ldquo;cos amháin, san uaigh agus an chos eile ar an mbrú&rdquo;. Third level education cannot be dealt with by people running a country and a Department on auto-pilot.  Important decisions could have been made and the good recommendations of this report could have been accepted, but others <Col N="1221" /> should have been buried.  I am disappointed the Government was unable to deal with this issue.  We regret that a proper decision was not made by the Minister on this issue.</P>
      <P>Many good ideas have been put forward in this House regarding practical issues concerning the provision of third level grant schemes.  We need to eliminate the confusion.  Grant applications must be submitted by 15 July and parents need to understand the system and know what is happening.  The system should be simplified, there should be equity and our young people should have proper access to third level education so that they can give back to the State what it invested in them over the last number of years.  I hope we will not rue the recent decisions regarding third level education, which were detrimental to it instead of allowing it to develop and flourish.</P>

We are discussing the de Buitléir report, not the Minister's work.  I do not know how assets can be regarded as income.  I firmly believe that third level grants should be based on net income and disagree with the recommendation in the report that it should be based on gross income.  A person earning a gross income of £24,000 will pay approximately £1,500 PRSI, £4,500 tax and will have a disposable income of approximately £18,000.</P>

The committee funked on this issue and decided the means test should be based on gross income as it would be easier to operate on a gross basis in respect of medical cards and other benefits, but account is not taken of a person's disposable income.  I am aware we cannot always consider net income in terms of grants as many people would borrow money to install jucuzzis and other facilities.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> A person should not be regarded as having a certain income if a large proportion of it is taken in tax, PRSI and other deductions.  Net income is not considered for VHI payments or mortgage repayments.  I am not sure that people should be punished for helping the State by paying VHI.  If everybody depended on public health care, many would die before they received treatment.  We should not discourage building private houses although, to a certain extent, it is being discouraged now as tax relief on mortgage payments is being reduced.  I am not sure that is a good idea.  During its seven years in office, Fianna Fáil did not specialise in the provision of public housing and as a result there is a long waiting list for local authority housing.

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> It is unfair to students to take gross income into account.  If we want to provide proper opportunities for them we must ensure they get cothrom na Féinne.  A student in my constituency attained four A's in his leaving certificate but his parents' income was £55 over the eligibility limit for a third level grant.  At that time I was innocent enough to table a motion seeking to give a grant automatically to a person who attains four A's <Col N="1226" /> in the leaving certificate.  People of that calibre should not have to go abroad to find work.  That person got a very good job with an insurance company but it is unfair that he was unable to receive a third level education because his parents could not afford to pay for it.</P>
      <P>This scheme contrasts with the earlier one where those who could afford to do so sent their children to university. Some of them lived the life of a student prince spending years repeating exams, were great drinkers and some even escaped into politics.  It is disgraceful that some children do not get a chance to attain a third level education.  I know of a family whose second child did not receive a third level education, the first and the third child did.  I wonder how that person feels now.  However, in fairness there is a limit to what parents can do if they do not have the necessary finance, especially if gross earnings are taken into account.  I disagree with the committee that gross income should be taken into account as it would be simplier to operate the system.  That is a cop out.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Such a proposal does not do justice to the calibre of the members of the committee. It might be easy to operate but it would be unfair.  I am sure the Minister will adopt a sensible approach on these matters.</P>
      <P>In regard to capital, I fail to understand how anybody can derive an income from a large house.  The rates system was abolished because people were paying high rates on houses that were of no benefit to them.  People living in such houses are frequently unable to heat them.  A large house may be valuable, but what good is that if parents cannot afford to pay for a third level education for their children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee suggests a 50 per cent reduction in land values, but has not <Col N="1227" /> provided for a reduction in the valuation of business properties.  Some business properties may appear to be valuable assets.  Many large shops that once had a monopoly are now empty because urban renewal policies recommended the building of large shopping centres at the other end of the town.  Such shops, potentially worth £200,000, may not even bring in enough money to pay stamp duty.  At what stage does one force people to sell property?  If people sell property on what will they live? Assets should not be taken into account for grant purposes, unless it can be proved people are making money from them.  The provision of grants should be based on income but, of course, we must ensure that people do not defraud the system.</P>
    <P>I compliment the committee for highlighting a flaw in the existing scheme in that directors of family companies have the option of paying a small salary to qualify for a grant.  I know of one business person who did that and almost caused a civil war in the town.  I once said that if ever there was civil unrest here again on a non-political issue, it would be on third level grants.  People who are paying fees are perturbed that others are not.  At one time I had to hide behind headstones when I attended funerals in my area to avoid a person asking me what was being done about third level grants.  He believed I could do something about the matter.  He is a PAYE taxpayer and knew of people who received grants to send their children to third level institutions.  Perhaps they were not as well off as we believed they were.</P>
    <P>I disagree with the assertion in the report that business tax and PAYE are similar.  People running their own businesses can claim expenses which a PAYE taxpayer can not.  The report suggests there should not be deductions for losses in business.  If, having paid staff and other expenses, a company <Col N="1228" /> incurs a loss at the end of the year, how can it be claimed the owner of that company has an income over the limit to qualify for third level grants?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter this evening because the draft regulations, as they stand, have very serious implications for the welfare of psychiatric patients and for the future of public and private psychiatric services. The draft regulations include one providing a minimum cover of 40 days psychiatric in-patient treatment per year be provided by any health insurer wishing to operate here.</P>
      <P>There are considerable worries among the public and in the institutions involved in the provision of psychiatric care that this minimum will become the norm.  I understand that preliminary discussions between many of these institutions and the Voluntary Health Insurance Board suggest that is likely to be the case.  For example, the present cover provided for psychiatric in-patient treatment is 180 days per year, no different from that provided for physical in-patient treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If one looks at the recommendations concerning patients suffering from substance abuse, like alcohol, drugs and so on, the position is even worse.  At present the VHI cover is 90 days every five years but the draft regulations propose 40 days only within a lifetime.  As we are all aware &mdash; and here I am sure the Minister of State will agree with me <Col N="1230" />&mdash; neither alcohol dependence nor substance abuse is reducing here, if anything, the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a 40 day minimum limit constitutes a most serious discrimination against psychiatrically ill patients, no other type of patient is singled out for such a limit.  It will result in approximately 30 per cent of patients currently being treated within the private psychiatric sector having to seek care from the already over-stretched and seriously strained public psychiatric services.  The patients who will be most affected by these changes will include those who suffer from serious psychiatric illness, such as manic depression, schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa, psychiatric disorders associated with physical disease and with ageing, for example, Alzheimer's Disease.</P>
    <P>In relation to those people suffering from substance abuse and alcohol dependence, these regulations will reduce the role of the psychiatric services from that of providing what they do at present, which is a valuable, professional, in-patient treatment and after care, to a very short term system of detoxification programmes and crisis management.  In an era in which both alcohol and substance abuse are on the increase that is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>The real impact of these changes in the draft regulations will be borne by the patients most seriously affected by psychiatric illness and, of course, by their families who are extremely worried. I understand that representatives of St. Patrick's Hospital and St. John of God's Hospital sought a direct meeting with the Minister because of their huge concerns but were informed that he was too busy to meet them.  I appreciate that the Minister has a very busy schedule.  I understand those hospital representatives met his departmental officials but, because of the level of care they provide, they feel they deserve a meeting with the Minister and I ask the Minister <Col N="1231" /> of State to bring that request to the Minister's attention.</P>
    <P>I ask that the psychiatrically ill be treated no differently from patients suffering from physical illnesses.  I also request that the present levels of VHI cover for psychiatric in-patient treatment should be the recommended minimum level for inclusion in the new regulations about to be signed by the Minister.  If those regulations are implemented, as drafted, they will have far reaching, serious, negative effects for patients and psychiatric care generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn for having raised this issue.  I welcome the opportunity to explain to the House the background to the proposed psychiatric cover in the minimum benefit regulations pursuant to the Health Insurance Act, 1994.</P>
      <P>The acceptance by the EU Commission that our legislation is valid is dependent on them being satisfied that we are genuinely creating an open market in health insurance.  The proposed arrangements for psychiatric cover must reflect this.</P>
      <P>The minimum benefit regulations require insurers to provide minimum benefit in respect of in-patient psychiatric treatment for a period of 40 days in any one year.  In addition, the regulations originally provided that insurers may require treatment plans to be submitted for approval prior to admission, other than in an emergency.</P>
      <P>The prescribed minimum payments set out in the regulations for prescribed health services &mdash; which are in-patient services provided by a private psychiatric hospital &mdash; is £35 per each in-patient day.</P>
      <P>The prescribed minimum payments for prescribed health services which are day-patient services provided by a private psychiatric hospital is £15 for each day-patient day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> Departmental officials have consulted widely a range of interest groups, including public and private service providers, and a number of meetings have taken place.  Private psychiatric service providers have raised issues of concern specifically to their services and the implications of these issues for the public sector.  I would like to take this opportunity to clarify these issues.</P>
    <P>First, concern has been expressed at the provision allowing insurers to seek prior approval for admissions to non-emergency psychiatric in-patient treatment. After careful consideration of the submissions made by the providers this provision was withdrawn.</P>
    <P>Second, certain private hospital providers have submitted that 40 days' minimum cover is insufficient to meet patients' requirements.  The minimum benefit regulations provide that insurers must provide a minimum of 40 days in any one year.  This is the first time that psychiatric cover will be on a statutory basis and the 40 days will ensure that some level of such cover is available to members of insurance schemes.  This will prevent a situation developing whereby, as in many schemes abroad, insurers refuse to offer benefit for psychiatric care or offer it at a level below 30 days.  I again emphasise that this is the minimum benefit and that insurers will be free to offer any higher level they wish.</P>
    <P>A number of private psychiatric hospitals have also expressed concern at what they see as very low levels of benefit payable to them for in-patient treatment. The hospitals in question have argued that they should be treated differently on the grounds of offering a more comprehensive service.  In particular they regard payment of £15 for day-patients as being too low.  The minimum benefit levels are necessary to underpin community-rating and to provide a degree of consumer protection.  They have been set at the lowest possible market price to avoid being inherently <Col N="1233" /> inflationary.  If they were set any higher a situation could arise whereby a hospital which charges rates lower than the minimum benefit would be paid at the higher rate.  To treat the hospitals in question in a different manner from other psychiatric hospitals would have a knock-on effect in the general acute area where the major high-tech hospitals would then require that they be treated differently and the payment of benefits under minimum benefit would then become unmanageable.</P>
    <P>With regard to the specific issue of day-care cover the Department of Health is currently examining the components of day-care in psychiatric hospitals.  However, the area is ill-defined at present.  The Department is currently examining the possibility of dropping the requirement for day-care cover in the regulations and examining it in the review of the minimum benefit regulations which will be undertaken by an assessor.</P>
    <P>Finally, a number of private psychiatric hospitals have indicated concern at the arrival of for-profit insurers to this country on the grounds that these insurers will put profits before patients' welfare and will lead to spiralling costs. However, in reality competition must be accepted as an inevitable consequence of the requirements of the single market and the Government's objective, which has been achieved, is that competition takes place on terms which ensure the greatest possible equity for all patients concerned.  Where possible, the Government has taken account of the concerns of the private hospitals but the fundamental part of the Government's strategy is to clearly demonstrate to Brussels that we are genuinely creating an open market in health insurance.</P>
    <P>The Health Insurance Act provides for the appointment of an assessor whose role it will be to review the minimum benefit regulations.  He or she will review the regulations to take account of developments in the market, <Col N="1234" /> new technology and procedures and inflation.  The regulations will be changed to incorporate the recommendations made by the assessor to the Minister for Health and it is intended that the assessor will be appointed in the autumn.</P>

Is mór an trua orm an rún seo a chur os comhair na Dála, cé go gcaithfidh mé a rá go raibh sé ar an gclár le tamall fada.  Beidh fhios ag an Aire agus go deimhin ag an Teach féin go bhfuil scéal Choláiste Móibhí i mbéal an phobail de bharr ócáid dhúnadh an choláiste breis is seachtain ó shin.  Bhí mé i láthair agus bhí an séipéal a bhíodh ag Coláiste Móibhí in aice le Coláiste Oideachais Eaglais na hÉireann plódaithe le scoláirí ó na fichidí ar aghaidh go dtí an lá inniú.  Ócáid an-bhrónach a bhí ann agus dúradh roinnt rudaí ar an ócaid sin.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept a number of the statements that were made on that occasion and that is why it is important for me to air what was said and the decisions that were taken which I believe will have a negative impact on our education system in general.</P>
      <P>It was stated that part of the reason for closing Coláiste Móibhí was that the standard of Irish in Church of Ireland secondary schools was improving.  I do not have evidence of that and I would like the Minister to tell me if she has such evidence.  It was also said that the qualifications attained, particularly in Irish, by students at Coláiste Móibhí were perhaps too high and that, because of our points system, students were deciding to take other courses in universities rather than taking up the teaching profession.  It was felt, therefore, that the purposes behind the setting up of Coláiste Móibhí was not being served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1235" /> It is regrettable that the achievement of high results is considered a penalty. It was stated also that an additional lecturer would be provided for the Church of Ireland college of education which would, in some way, constitute a replacement for the closure of a college. That defies belief entirely.</P>
    <P>I expect this decision by the Department of Education was financially motivated, although I understand ways are sought to save money wherever possible.  I am concerned, however, that a similar argument would be put forward for the closure of a minority institution and I am sure many others throughout the country fear similar treatment from the Department.  I would like the Minister to give some assurance that this policy will not be continued.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister four questions arising out of this decision.  First, is the Minister amenable to the general provision of Irish medium education outside the majority Roman Catholic management system?  Second, will she measure the trends in the standard of Irish teaching in primary schools under Church of Ireland management so as to assess whether her decision has had no effect, a negative effect or an effect which I would find difficult to understand, a positive one?  Third, what are the circumstances in which Coláiste Móibhí could reopen or a similar institution that would serve the needs previously served by Coláiste Móibhí? Fourth, has the Minister taken note of how this decision is perceived in Northern Ireland where the issue of minority rights is important and which gave rise to heated argument and, quite often, tragic consequences in the past?</P>
    <P>If this decision had been taken north of the Border there would have been an outcry.  I am saddened that this closure occurred at a time when, for example, Meanscoil Béal Feiriste enjoyed the support of all parties in this House.  Such <Col N="1236" /> was that support that a train was organised to travel to Belfast prior to the Northern Ireland Department of Education giving the go ahead for funding to maintain that minority school.  The decision to close Coláiste Móibhí would not have been taken if the school was located in the North.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to speak on this matter as it affords me the opportunity to explain both the reason for the decision to close the juniorate and the special arrangements which my Department has put in place to strengthen the teaching of Irish in the Church of Ireland College of Education.</P>
      <P>The original Coláiste Móibhí was one of six all-Irish preparatory colleges, established in 1926, for the purpose of preparing candidates for admission to the teacher training colleges.  In 1968, Coláiste Móibhí was discontinued as a preparatory college and a junior section was established in the new Church of Ireland College of Education in Rathmines.  This juniorate took in students, after intermediate certificate, who followed the leaving certificate course, largely through Irish.  This was in order to assist in the recruitment of appropriately-qualified Protestant candidates for the Church of Ireland college. It was not compulsory for those students to proceed to the college of education on completion of their course in the juniorate but, of course, the majority of them did so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first proposal for closure came in 1981, from the Church of Ireland authorities. At the time, however, the Department of Education asked for the juniorate to remain in operation so as to ensure an adequate standard of Irish among Protestant candidates for primary teacher training.  A review of the operation of the juniorate was initiated by the Department in the early 1990s. The outcome of that review was that the Department accepted the need to phase <Col N="1237" /> out the juniorate as its continuation could not be justified on either financial or educational grounds.</P>
    <P>Following negotiations with the college authorities, it was decided not to approve an intake to the juniorate in 1993 and to phase out its operation culminating in closure in the summer of 1995.  A severance package was approved for all staff in the juniorate.</P>
    <P>The negotiations between the Department and the College authorities also focused on provision to strengthen appropriately the Irish language programme in the Church of Ireland College of Education following the closure of the juniorate.  I am happy to inform the House that, following the successful completion of those negotiations, an agreed Irish language enrichment programme is being put in place and resourced by the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>The programme has the following elements: an additional lecturer in Irish is being employed to implement the programme and first year students in the 1995-96 academic year, and thereafter, will have (a) a two week intensive course in Irish at the college; (b) a one week observation period in a Scoil Lán Ghaeilge, or in a Gaeltacht school; (c) a three week period in the Gaeltacht; (d) in addition to the existing Irish course in the college, extra tuition in Irish throughout the three academic years of the BEd., course.  The new programme will be subject to existing assessment procedures and will be monitored by the Department's inspectorate, and its operation will be fully reviewed at the end of each year to ensure that its aims and objectives are being achieved.</P>

      <P>I thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this important issue on the Adjournment.  I am glad the Minister is in attendance to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> Cavan vocational school was built in 1974 with classroom accommodation for 560 pupils.  In the meantime, there has been a considerable increase in the school's enrolment, and the expected enrolment in September will be 713; that is the number of pupils who have accepted places in the school for the coming school year which is just two months away.  From the figures quoted it is obvious that there is an urgent need to provide additional accommodation at this school.</P>
    <P>As part of a construction studies project, four additional rooms were built at this school in 1984.  In the meantime two of these rooms have been in use as classrooms with partial services only. The other two rooms need electrical and heating services and some refurbishment, such as, the provision of ceiling tiles.  This work needs to be undertaken to enable these rooms to be ready for classroom use in September.</P>
    <P>This accommodation did not cost the Department from its capital funds as all the costs were met from the school's current expenditure.  Great credit is due to the teaching staff who undertook that project with their students, a project that will have lasting benefits from a learning and accommodation point of view.  The rooms were built to proper specifications, and I understand that all the technical queries raised recently by the Department have been responded to satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>To meet the classroom accommodation needs of the student population of this school in September, there is an urgent need to have these four rooms fitted out properly as classrooms.  As well as upgrading those rooms, the school needs two prefabricated buildings.</P>
    <P>I raised this issue by way of parliamentary question recently, and the Minister replied that the accommodation requirements at Cavan vocational school were still being considered by her Department.  I am sure she will agree that a decision on the vocational education committee application is urgently needed and I hope she can give me positive news.  The school <Col N="1239" /> is not looking for accommodation above and beyond its needs.  The vocational education committee, the chief executive officer of the vocational education committee, the principal and staff of the school are anxious that this application be finalised without further delay.  The school has a very committed and hard working staff.  The vocational education committee, the chief executive officer, the staff and the parents wish to see the appropriate classrooms provided for the commencement of the 1995-96 school year, and I hope this will be achievable.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for giving me this opportunity to clarify the position concerning the provision of additional accommodation at Cavan vocational school.  Initially I would like to give some details regarding the background to this case.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the school erected a four classroom extension in conjunction with FÁS without any reference to my Department.  However, because of a lack of local finance it was not possible for the school authorities to complete the extension.  It is understood that two of the rooms remain unoccupied because the vocational education committee was unable to provide heating, furniture or equipment.  The vocational education committee applied for grant aid to complete the four classroom extension and my Department's planning and building unit which examined this application would have no objection in principle to the provision of grant aid to complete the project in question.</P>
      <P>The vocational education committee has since submitted various reports to my Department including an architect's report and mechanical and electrical engineers report concerning the extension. However, despite a number of requests for a structural engineer's report, the vocational education committee failed to submit it and the matter could not be progressed further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subsequently, the vocational education committee applied for funding <Col N="1240" /> for temporary accommodation on 8 May 1995.  As a result of this application the Department has examined the school's accommodation needs and has established that two additional teaching spaces would meet its current requirements. As this need could be met by the two unoccupied classrooms built by the school, the Department again raised the question of completing these rooms with the vocational education committee. Following this the vocational education committee submitted a structural engineer's report on the building and my Department is now examining the extent of the works needed to finish it. If this is economically and architecturally feasible there will be no need to provide temporary classrooms.</P>
    <P>As of now a decision has not yet been reached on whether to complete the unfinished building or to provide temporary classrooms as requested by the vocational education committee. However, I fully appreciate the school's difficulties and accordingly every effort will be made to finalise the matter as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset let me say that the wording is probably wrong.  I accept that the responsibility for carrying out of post-mortems is that of pathologists and not coroners.</P>
      <P>The sudden death of a person causes great grief and suffering for family and friends, and one of the first functions any family will carry out following a death is the making of funeral arrangements. However, where a post-mortem is necessary, these arrangements may be delayed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of a situation where a man was pronounced dead at 10 o'clock on a Friday night and, despite the best efforts of the coroner, a pathologist could not be found to carry out the post-mortem until the following Monday.  This meant that the family could not bury the body <Col N="1241" /> until Wednesday.  This situation cannot continue.  Delays of this kind only add to the grief and suffering of a family and we need not prolong the agony.  A retired pathologist has provided the service on many occasions in the past but he was not available on this occasion. That is understandable.  It must be obvious that other arrangements will have to be made.  If there are not enough pathologists on the panel the answer is to increase the number.  I am not here to make a political issue of this or to lay blame on anybody.  I am convinced that the coroner was doing his best but, having to work within the system, the post-mortem could not be carried out any earlier.  I know that adherents to some religions bury their dead the day after they die.  In Great Britain burials often taken place a week after the death.  In Ireland funerals usually take place within two days of a death.  In all cases the wishes of the family are respected, and any system that creates unnecessary delays in allowing the funeral to take place must be wrong. The system must be changed to ensure that post mortems will not be unnecessarily delayed because of the non-availability of pathologists at weekends.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Power for raising this important issue.  I am aware of the background to the recent case outlined by Deputy Power.  I wish to express my sympathy to the family of the deceased man who lost his life in tragic circumstances.  I do not, however, wish to dwell unnecessarily on the particular circumstances of the individual case and my reply is intended to respond to the general issue which the Deputy has raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary legislation in relation to coroners is the Coroners Act, 1962, for which the Minister for Justice has responsibility.  The Act contains detailed provisions regarding the office of coroner, coroners' districts, salaries and so on as <Col N="1242" /> well as provisions governing the holding of inquests, carrying out postmortems etc.</P>
    <P>Each coroner is empowered under section 13 of the Act to appoint as his or her deputy a person approved of for the purpose by the local authority in question.  Such appointee is referred to as the deputy coroner.  Thus there is a mechanism in place to ensure that a coroner is available to the public, the gardaí, etc. where the services of a coroner need to be called on even if the coroner is absent.  I mention this because of the wording in the Deputy's question, although he clarified that point in his contribution.</P>
    <P>In addition to responsibilities set out in the Act which devolve on the Minister for Justice, local authorities have a role in relation to coroners as also do certain hospitals in each coroner's district. Specifically, the local authorities employ and pay the salaries of coroners and they provide them with supplies of stationery and prescribed forms as they may reasonably require in the discharge of their duties.</P>
    <P>Coroners do not carry out post-mortem examinations themselves; they engage medical pathologists for that purpose.  The pathologists whose services the coroner must avail of to conduct post-mortem examinations are, for the most part, in the employment of the various health boards.  These pathologists avail of the facilities of the hospitals at which they are employed in order to conduct the post-mortems in those cases in which the coroner has jurisdiction.  The health boards do not, however, have any responsibility for ensuring the availability of a pathologist to conduct post-mortems for the coroner. This responsibility rests with the coroner on each such occasion.  No difficulty arises where a coroner needs to secure the services of a pathologist during the working week since pathologists are on call to the health boards on a Monday to Friday basis.  However, at weekends the coroner is obliged to secure a pathologist directly.</P>
    <P>From time to time, a coroner may, <Col N="1243" /> despite his or her best endeavours, fail to secure the services of a pathologist and the coroner is obliged to postpone the conduct of the post-mortem over the weekend until the following Monday.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the hospital to which the Deputy referred there is a standing arrangement whereby, when pathology facilities are required at weekends, the services of a retired pathologist are availed of.  That person is, I am informed, almost invariably available at weekends and is willing to conduct a post-mortem at a weekend if the occasion arises.  The person, however, was not available on the recent weekend when the death referred to occurred. Despite contacting a number of other <Col N="1244" /> pathologists, the coroner failed to secure the services of any other pathologist. At all times, the coroner was available to explain to the family members the exceptional circumstances regarding the non-availability of a pathologist.</P>
    <P>The points raised by the Deputy will be brought to the attention of the Minister for Justice with a view to ensuring that the procedures for securing the services of a pathologist at weekends, as well as the steps to be taken for the conduct of post-mortems, should not occasion any undue distress for the relatives of the deceased person.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 11.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 5 July 1995.</P>

      <P>Through the Council of Ministers for Social Affairs, I maintain regular contact with the European Commission, and I have made clear Ireland's support for the draft directives on the burden of proof and parental leave.  These draft directives had important equality dimensions.</P>
      <P>At official level, Ireland has a permanent social affairs representative to the European Community who maintains a permanent link between the European Community and Irish Government interests.  This representative's brief includes quality matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has regular contacts with the European Commission on the review and development of equality policy and action programmes.  In addition, my Department has an input to EU social policy in general via the Department of Enterprise and Employments <Col N="988" /> which is the lead Department for this area.</P>
    <P>My Department's participation in the production of the National Development Plan has ensured the inclusion of equality related projects for funding under the EU Community Support Framework.  The Department also participates on the monitoring committee required by the European Community to oversee activity and spending on the Human Resources Operational Programme. This monitoring committee also has a function in overseeing the gender proofing aspects and activities funded under the European Social Fund.</P>
    <P>My Department co-operates with the Commission through its active involvement on the selection committee for projects to be funded by the EU under the Employment NOW &mdash; New Opportunities for Women &mdash; initiative.  This initiative's objective is to increase the participation in integration of women in the labour market through the development of transitional and innovative pilot projects.</P>
    <P>The strong partnership approach with the Commission on equality matters is also evident in the ongoing operations of the Employment Equality Agency, which is under the aegis of my Department. The agency is represented on the Commission's advisory committee on equal opportunities for women and men and the agency's chief executive currently holds the position of vice president of the committee.  Also, in cooperation with the Commission, the agency is conducting two national projects related to equality which are financed on a co-funding basis between the agency and the Commission.  The quality through equality project aims at the development of models of good practice of gender equality in both the public and private sectors.  Under the other joint Commission/Agency project a national animation strategy is being developed through individual projects designed to assist with the implementation of European equality law and the <Col N="989" /> integration of women into the labour market.</P>
    <P>I record my appreciation for the support and assistance regularly afforded by the Commission in the work of promoting and progressing equality objectives. I look forward to continued cooperation and partnership with the Commission in this work.</P>

      <P>Among the recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission report on the Civil Law of Defamation is that a new cause of action should be instituted in respect of defamatory statements made about a person who is dead at the time of publication of those statements.  That recommendation contained a number of elements:</P>
      <P>(i)  the right to institute defamation proceedings in such a case should be vested solely in the personal representative of the deceased who would be under a statutory obligation to consult the immediate family of the deceased;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in my reply to an earlier question from Deputy Kenneally, primary responsibility for the regulation of child care resides with my collegue the Minister for Health under the Child Care Act, 1991 and a statutory system of supervision and inspection by health boards of pre-school services catering for children under six years of age will be implemented in 1996.  This accords with two of the group's recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My principal function in the area of child care facilities is the encouragement of the provision of child care services in the interests of enabling job seeking parents gain access to employment opportunities which might otherwise be denied to them and as a support to working parents in employment.  As I stated previously to the Deputy on 30 May 1995, the primary attention of my <Col N="995" /> Department in the child care area has been directed towards ensuring the inclusion of a child care element in the National Development Plan and the introduction of an initiative taken to develop pilot child care projects in disadvantaged areas.  Funding of £1 million has been approved for such projects this year.</P>
    <P>In initially focusing its attention on these matters, my Department was seeking to prime-start a number of activities recommended by the working group for implementation.  In particular the child care pilot projects support local child care initiatives by employers, public authorities and voluntary organisations and will increase the availability of child care places in areas of social disadvantage. County enterprise boards which operate under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise and Employment are also aware of my Department's pilot programme which can grand-aid certain child care start-up costs promoted in conjunction with these bodies.</P>
    <P>In consultation with the Minister for Enterprise and Employment I have sought to ensure a specific share of resources for child care under the Community Support Framework funding under the human resources operative programme.  In all, a total of £7.7 million of this programme has been directed to equal opportunities matters by FÁS and this will include child care measures.</P>
    <P>I understand that FÁS proposes to further develop its child care training activities to meet an increased demand for child care workers, to provide higher level skills training in child care services and to provide training for existing child care workers to upgrade their skills. Where projects have been funded under my Department's pilot child care initiative, FÁS will support them through providing or facilitating the provision of child care training for existing or new child care workers as well as through additional supports by way of community employment and community <Col N="996" /> training measures to assist with construction and renovation of buildings. Also in accordance with the working group's recommendations, the job potential of child care is currently being examined by the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i>  The National Economic and Social Forum has also examined this issue recently.</P>
    <P>The social partners have been made aware of the benefits of the availability of child care facilities.  The inclusion of a provision for such facilities, beyond workplace nurseries, in future collective agreements, as recommended by the working group, is a matter for negotiation by the parties concluding such agreements.</P>
    <P>The question of making mandatory the inclusion in planning permission requests, of plans for child care facilities in shopping and housing developments is a matter for the individual planning authorities, but the Department of the Environment has advised local authorities that official development plans may incorporate such a stipulation.</P>
    <P>The report of the working group on child care facilities for working parents contains a wide-ranging series of recommendations addressed to many different bodies in society.  Since its establishment, my Department has taken a proactive role in promoting the development of child care services.  A major impetus has been achieved and I will ensure that every possible effort is made to maintain that momentum.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 77, 78 and 79 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Details of what legislative provisions would be in place to deal with the various aspects of divorce, including maintenance of spouses and children, orders in relation to the family home and other property including pensions and orders concerning custody of and access to children will be set out in the draft Bill which will accompany publication of the Amendment of the Constitution Bill. The House will be aware that those legislative provisions will in substance be the same as those in the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989 and the Family Law Bill, 1994.  The Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill 1995, recently initiated, deals with the social welfare aspects of marriage breakdown, including divorce.  The major development programmes which are being implemented in relation to legal aid, mediation and counselling are a matter <Col N="999" /> of record in the House.  Those programmes, together with the legislative provisions I have mentioned, implement in large measure an infrastructure to tackle the many aspects of the problem of marriage breakdown.</P>
    <P>I have made clear to the House on several occasions also that the sum of £500,000 provided in the Estimates of my Department for a programme of information on the Government's divorce proposals is for heads of expenditure on lines similar to those used in previous referenda and that as part of that programme a company will be engaged to assist in the public relations and advertising aspects.  A number of companies have been considered for the job and details will be announced shortly when the process of selection has been completed.</P>
    <P>The position regarding development of mediation is that in 1994 I managed to more than double the financing which the State allocates to the Family Mediation Service.  The increased figure of £300,000 which was provided for the service in 1994 has been repeated this year.  In order better to assist those who are seeking mediation, a second mediation centre, in addition to the one already operating in Dublin, will soon be opening in Limerick.  There are proposals, in addition, to ensure that the services of the Dublin and Limerick centres can be used to link up with the services of private mediators so that mediation skills can be more widely availed of by those couples who are in need of mediation.</P>
    <P>Our separation laws require the legal representatives of the applicant and respondent in separation proceedings to inform them of the possibility of resolving their difficulties by mediation. Experience here and in other countries indicates that voluntary rather than compulsory mediation is preferable and I am disposed to agree with the voluntary approach.</P>
    <P>I am glad to be able to inform the House that the consultations on divorce <Col N="1000" /> between representatives of the Government and opposition parties have been ongoing.  It is my hope that the process can continue and that by the time of formal debate in the House a good deal of consensus will have been achieved on the way ahead.</P>

      <P>The Government has not been involved in any way, as an intermediary or otherwise, in the provision of military equipment, training or maintenance of such equipment for use in conflicts in Rwanda, Zaire and neighbouring countries.  The Government has been greatly concerned at the reported use of refugee camps in eastern Zaire for the arming and training of soldiers of the former Rwandan army and at reports that members of the international community have provided them with armaments and training.</P>
      <P>Ireland fully supports the imposition of the UN arms embargo on Rwanda which has been in force since May 1994. It also supports the recent strengthening of that embargo by the UN Security Council in Resolution 997 of 9 June which has extended its scope to &ldquo;persons in the states neighbouring Rwanda&rdquo; if such arms are for use in Rwanda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resolution 997 calls on states neighbouring Rwanda to take steps to ensure that such arms are not transferred to Rwanda camps within their territories. It requests the Secretary General of the <Col N="1003" /> United Nations to consult the governments of neighbouring countries on the possibility of deploying UN military observers.  It also asks him to consult, as a matter of priority, the Government of Zaire on the deployment of observers, including in the airfields located in eastern Zaire, to monitor the sale or supply of arms covered by the embargo.  The UN Security Council has requested the UN Secretary General to report to it on this matter within one month.</P>

      <Quest>the reason an application from a person (details supplied) in County Sligo for reinstatement to the Civil Service was unsuccessful; in the interest of openness and transparency, the income limits that apply under section 11 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, as amended; the income limit in respect of this person while recognising that the income limits must be applied consistently in all cases; and the amount of means in excess of the income limit which was assessed against this person.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The only basis in law for reinstatement is contained in section 11 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956, as amended by the Civil Service (Employment of Married Women) Act, 1973.  That section permits the reinstatement of a woman who resigned from the Civil Service for the purposes of, on or following marriage and &ldquo;is for the time being a widow or a woman who did not get married or in respect of whom it is established to the satisfaction of the Minister for Finance that she is not being supported by her husband&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In interpreting these statutory requirements, it has been the practice to regard a married woman as not being supported by her husband if he provides no support &mdash; as, for example, in a case of desertion &mdash; or where his means are inadequate to provide for her support. Social welfare payments are generally considered adequate to enable a husband to support his wife.  However, no applicant is automatically refused because her husband is in receipt of social welfare payments as there may be family or other circumstances which would permit her reinstatement within the terms of the statutory provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reinstatements scheme was challenged some time ago under the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977, and the Labour Court determined that the scheme was discriminatory and contrary to the principle of equal treatment.  The court recommended that the relevant statutory provision should be repealed.  The complainant in that case has referred the determination to the High Court and the case has not yet been heard.  Pending the outcome to that case and the taking of any necessary consequential action, no new applications for reinstatement are being accepted. However, applications submitted before the Labour Court determination issued are being processed to finality and any <Col N="1005" /> applicant who satisfies the statutory criteria as of the date of the determination is being offered reinstatement.</P>
    <P>The person to whom the question relates applied before the determination issued and, accordingly her application has been processed.  However, she did not meet the statutory criteria on the date on which the determination issued and, accordingly, her application was rejected.  In assessing whether she was being supported by her husband, the approach outlined above was applied to her case, on the basis of information supplied by her, in precisely the same way as it is applied to all applications.  I am not prepared to divulge any of the information on which her application was based as this was supplied in confidence.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, which are being taken to combat smuggling and illegal sales of cigarettes in Ireland and the European Union in view of the estimated 280 billion cigarettes which disappear world-wide each year and in view of the fact that in 1993, 53 billion American cigarettes alone disappeared and ended up in Europe.</Quest>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they are fully alert to the situation regarding the smuggling and illegal sale of cigarettes and other tobacco products without payment of the appropriate taxes in Ireland.  They are also aware of the fraudulent diversion of cigarettes onto the EU market which gives rise to similar problems in member states generally.</P>
      <P>In Ireland, at enforcement level, the gathering of intelligence on this illegal trade has resulted in significant seizures of tobacco products at import points and from illegal distributors and street traders.  Customs have, since 1 January 1994, seized nearly 28 million cigarettes and 4,000 kilograms of tobacco.  At the EU level, a cigarette smuggling task group has been set up to deal with this problem on the operational, administrative and legal levels.</P>
      <P>On the legislation front, tax stamps on cigarette packs will be required here with effect from September 1995 in accordance with the relevant provision of the Finance Act, 1994.  This legal requirement will greatly assist the Revenue in its efforts to counteract illegal trading in cigarettes and will facilitate prosecution of offenders by their staff. In addition, section 77 of the Finance Act, 1995, provides for the extension of tax stamps to other tobacco products.  It is intended that tax stamps for roll-your-own tobacco will be introduced in 1996 following discussions with the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that, in the present circumstances, the commissioners by use of such techniques as risk analysis, intelligence gathering and profiling with a view to identifying import routes and illegal distributors and by liaising with the Garda in relation to illegal street <Col N="1008" /> trading, are making every effort to combat this fraudulent activity.  Furthermore, I am satisfied that the introduction of tax stamps for cigarettes and tobacco will greatly strengthen the power of Revenue staff in the detection and prosecution of offenders.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to cohabiting unmarried couples is that there are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, I would point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage.  The basis on which the married person's tax free allowance, and double rate bands, is given derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v.</i> the Attorney General, 1980, which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer is being correctly assessed to tax as a single person and is in receipt of all the tax-free allowances to which he is entitled, based on the most recent information available to them.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the difficulties which can arise for cohabiting couples in certain circumstances, in particular those who are not in a position to enter into legal marriages within the State.  An Expert Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems has been established and this group will, <i>inter alia,</i> be looking at the treatment of cohabiting couples.  I will consider the recommendations of the group in this area carefully.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer is in receipt of income from the letting of land.  Under the self-assessment system the taxpayer was obliged to make payments and submit returns by specified dates.  Returns were not made until 12 June 1995 covering the years 1990-91, 1991-92, 1992-93.  On the basis of these returns the taxpayer was assessed for tax as follows: 1990-91, £2,438.11; 1991-92, £2,444.97; 1992-93, £2,123.37.</P>
      <P>The assessment gave rise to a total liability of £7,006.45.  Only one payment amounting to £250 has been made leaving a balance of £6,756.45.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the year 1993-94, the taxpayer made a preliminary tax payment of £780 <Col N="1011" /> on 19 November 1993.  Her actual liability for that year can only be determined when she submits to the inspector of taxes her return of income for the year.  This is overdue since 31 January 1995.</P>
    <P>Preliminary tax of £480 has been paid by her for the year 1994-95.  As her return for this year is not due to be submitted before 31 January 1996 her actual liability will only be determined after that date.</P>
    <P>The Office of the Collector-General would be prepared to discuss the situation if the taxpayer contacts the Instalment Section, Sarsfield House, Limerick, telephone 061-310310.</P>

The guidelines are designed to implement the provisions, on family planning, of the policy agreement for Government and of the strategy for effective healthcare.  The objective of my family planning policy is to ensure the provisions of comprehensive family planning services to all persons who need such services on a basis which is equitable and accessible and part of these services is the provision of both male and female sterilisation.</P>
      <P>Sterilisation for family planning purposes will be provided at Sligo General Hospital as provided for in the national policy on the same basis as for all other surgical procedures in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general practitioner of the person concerned has been informed that the consultant will reconsider the referral in <Col N="1015" /> the light of the provisions of my family planning policy.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> On 20 June 1995 I published a scheme to compensate certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C from the use of human immunoglobulin &mdash; Anti-D, which has been approved by Government.  This scheme delivered on the commitment contained in the policy document &mdash;<i>A Government of Renewal</i>&mdash; to fair compensation for women infected with the hepatitis C virus from Anti-D.</P>
      <P>The tribunal is non-statutory and amongst the many aspects of the scheme are that proceedings before the tribunal will be informal and private, negligence need not be proved, the burden of proof will be on the balance of probabilities and there is preservation of a right of action should a claimant decide not to accept an award.  The scheme is designed specifically to provide compensation at the earliest possible date for those who contracted hepatitis C from the use of human immunoglobulin &mdash; Anti-D, whilst retaining an informal and flexible approach to do justice to the great variety of circumstances and conditions of claimants.  A copy of the scheme has been sent to persons who have tested hepatitis C antibody positive or hapatitis C virus positive arising from the national blood screening programme.</P>

      <P>&mdash;The board has only one application on file for a person of that name and address in County Westmeath. The person in question was issued with a medical card on 4 May 1995 which also covers his spouse.</P>
      <P>&mdash;The person in County Offaly applied for a medical card in November 1993 and was refused on the grounds that her income was considerably in excess of the income guidelines laid down for medical card eligibility.  Medical evidence in support of the application was also taken into consideration by the board at the time.</P>
      <P>If the person's circumstances have changed since her last application, she should reapply to the Midland Health Board.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 57 and 70 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has supported a major mammographic screening programme at the Mater Foundation over the last two years.  This programme, the Eccles breast screening programme, is part of a network of pilot schemes being carried out within the European Union. The Eccles programme covered a defined catchment area of North Dublin and Cavan-Monaghan and is the first study of its kind undertaken in this country.</P>
      <P>It is generally accepted that the essential factor in the success of a national breast screening programme is a high and consistent participation rate among the population to be screened.  Accordingly, my Department is at present, examining in detail the scope for developing a comprehensive population register so that women may be specifically targeted for the programme.</P>
      <P>The Government of Renewal Programme contains an undertaking to expand the Eccles breast screening programme on a phased basis to cover those women in the high risk category nationwide.  The second round of screening by the Eccles breast screening programme has been completed and a report on its findings has been submitted to the Department.  This report has been independently assessed and subjected to detailed evaluation on behalf of the Department.  I will be announcing proposals for the phased expansion of the programme in the coming weeks.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Community welfare officers and superintendent community welfare officers in the Eastern Health Board are mainly engaged in the administration of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.

      <P>The staffing complement in the Eastern Health Board is as follows: SCWOs, 19; CWOs 181.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to measure the workload of community welfare officers and superintendent community welfare officers.

      <P>In 1994, the caseload was as follows: Cases paid, 87,465; Payments made, 684,241; Weekly average, 13,158.</P>
      <P>This issue is currently being addressed within the Eastern Health Board: a joint union-management working party will start work on 5 July 1995 and is scheduled to report by 31 October 1995.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 61 and 75 together.</P>
      <P>The subvention scheme introduced by the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, was implemented on 1 September 1993 and ensures that those most in need of care in a nursing home, and without the means to pay for it, receive assistance towards the cost.</P>
      <P>With regard to the assessment of adult children of an applicant for subvention. I wish to point out that a health board may only assess the ability of a son or daughter to contribute towards the cost of the nursing home fees of a parent if the son or daughter is aged 21 years and over, residing in the jurisdiction and possesses sufficient personal income to contribute towards the cost of a parent's nursing home fees as assessed under the procedures in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993.</P>
      <P>Of the 5,806 subventions approved to the end of May 1995, health boards had made a reduction as a result of the ability of the son or daughter to pay in 950 cases or one in six of the subventions approved.</P>
      <P>I believe that sons and daughters who are in a position to contribute towards the cost of a parent's nursing home fees should do so.  The State recognises this contribution in the tax relief it gives on such payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current levels of subvention and the position of those dependent elderly who have no funds other than the noncontributory pensions are among the various aspects of the scheme currently being examined by a working group, <Col N="1021" /> comprised of officials of my Department and the health boards, which is reviewing the operation of the Nursing Homes Act.  It is hoped that the group's report will be completed in the near future.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Review Group on Services for people with Physical or Sensory Disabilities was established in June 1992 to review and make recommendations on health services for people with physical disabilities.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The group held its 16th meeting in May 1994.  Following this meeting, the progress of the work of the group was interrupted by a reorganisation within my Department of senior staff as well as an increase in workload in the Physical Disability Section.  Accordingly, a member of the group was engaged on a contract basis earlier this year to finalise the existing draft report.  The Review Group will be reconvened in the near future to discuss the draft report which has taken into account points raised by the 53 organisations which made submission to the group.  It is intended to consult interested organisations before the publication of the report to take <Col N="1022" /> account of changes since the group was established.  My Department will contact the relevant organisations regarding the details of this consultation process when the draft report is available.</P>
    <P>I expect to receive the final report of the Review Group on Physical and Sensory Disability within the next few months.  I hope to be in a position to publish the report shortly thereafter following which it will become available to Members of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 64, 65, 66 and 67 together. Health boards, in conjunction with the National Council for the Blind and the National Association for the Deaf, provide a broad range of technical aids and appliances to people with visual and hearing impairments.  I have allocated an additional £2 million revenue funding this year for the development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities and it is expected that health boards will use part of this funding for the improved provision of aids and appliances.  In addition, I hope to be in a position to make additional funding available on a once-off basis this year towards the provision of aids and appliances.</P>
      <P>The National Rehabilitation Board provides a national audiology service. This service provides hearing tests, hearing aid supply and fittings and hearing aid repairs for all children up to school leaving age regardless of parental income and for all adult medical card holders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The National Council for the Blind provides a low vision aids service at its premises in Drumcondra.  The cost of low vision aids recommended for those attending at the NCBI clinic and other low visual clinics throughout the country is generally met in full by the relevant health board in the case of medical card holders.  In the case of non-medical card holders, assistance towards the cost of the appliance is given where <Col N="1025" /> the applicant's circumstances merit assistance.</P>
    <P>Fire safety in the home is primarily a matter for the householder.  Last year the National Safety Council administered a special scheme whereby smoke alarms were installed in the homes of 4,000 elderly people and people with disabilities, with a view to promoting the installation of smoke alarms as an aid to fire safety.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The long term illness scheme entitles persons who suffer from certain specified conditions to free drugs and medicines prescribed in respect of the particular conditions. There are no plans to extend the number of illnesses covered by the scheme.</P>
      <P>The long term illness scheme, however, is only one of a number of schemes in operation which provide assistance towards the cost of prescribed drugs and medicines for persons with continuous medical conditions.</P>
      <P>Where an individual or a family is subjected to a significant level of continuous expenditure on medical expenses &mdash; general practitioner fees, prescribed drugs etc. &mdash; because of a long term medical condition, these expenses may be reckoned in determining eligibility for a medical card.  In some cases a medical card may be issued to a family member on a personal basis. Eligibility for a medical card is a matter solely for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who suffer from a condition such as chronic eye disease can avail of the drug cost subsidisation scheme <Col N="1026" /> which caters for people who do not have a medical card or long term illness book and are certified as having a long term medical condition with a regular continuous requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines in excess of an amount per month, currently £32.</P>
    <P>Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme will not have to spend more than £32 in any month on prescribed medication.</P>
    <P>Under the drug refund scheme, which covers expenditure by the whole family, any expenditure on prescribed medication above £90 in a calendar quarter is refunded by the health board.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that appropriate and comprehensive support is being provided by the State through the existing range of drug schemes to those in the community with long term medical conditions.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I have a strong appreciation of the importance of the role of the Irish Countrywomen's Association in advocating women's health.  As the Deputy will be aware, I recently published a discussion document &ldquo;Developing a Policy for Women's Health&rdquo; which is the forerunner to a wide-ranging consultative process, now under way, on women's health issues.  This consultative process is being carried out in co-operation with the Council for the Status of Women.  Within this framework, I have invited the Irish Countrywomen's Association to make an input to planning a series of regional seminars to ensure that as many women as possible have an opportunity to comment on the <Col N="1027" /> discussion document and contribute to the proposed plan for women's health.</P>
      <P>In relation to the appointment of ICA members to health boards, I can assure the Deputy that I will give full consideration to this when making appointments to fill vacancies as they arise.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the skills and attributes of candidates, in the context of the particular requirements of boards, must be taken into account when making appointments to ensure that boards have among their members the range of skills necessary to function effectively.</P>

I consider that further progress in securing an increase in the number of persons with disability employed may be best addressed in the context of an effective equal opportunities policy.  With a view to ensuring that due regard is had in the health service to the principles underlying an effective equal opportunities in employment policy, health agencies are currently reviewing their employment practices. Once the review by agencies has been completed, my Department, in consultation with representatives of management in the various agencies, will consider the overall position to ascertain what further action may be required to complement measures already adopted by employers.</P>

In his question the Deputy refers to Article 6 of the recommendation which proposes the encouragement, with due regard for freedom of the individual, of increased participation of men in the sharing of parental responsibilities.</P>
      <P>In my response to this recommendation I have concentrated on generating greater development of child care facilities as supports for parents of either gender.  In the circumstances I have no specific data on the application of child-care measures exclusively for male workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1994 my Department established a scheme of funding to support the initiation of a number of pilot child care projects in disadvantaged areas for working parents and those wishing to pursue education and training.  The scheme is administered by Area Development Management Ltd. (ADM).  Under the pilot scheme, ADM invited proposals for grant assistance for new and innovative child care projects. Grants are payable in respect of capital outlay and start-up costs such as adaptation of premises, equipment purchase, <Col N="1031" /> essential staff training, etc. to enable local residents to undertake education, training, retraining and employment opportunities to which they would be otherwise unable to aspire in the absence of a child care facility.  Funding of £1 million has been provided for 1995 and £951,000 has been allocated to 72 projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 81 together.  In order to qualify for assistance under the scheme of civil legal aid and advice an applicant must satisfy two basic eligibility tests.  The first of these is a means test, and the other is a merits test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An applicant is eligible on financial grounds if his or her &ldquo;disposable income&rdquo; and &ldquo;disposable capital&rdquo; are within certain limits specified in the scheme.  &ldquo;Disposable income&rdquo; is the income which remains when various deductions are made from gross income &mdash;&ldquo;gross income&rdquo; being defined as total income received from all sources.  The deductions to be made from gross income, which are referred to as allowances, include for example, income tax, mortgage repayments, rent, social insurance, VHI contributions, expenses in travelling to and from work together with various allowances in respect of the applicant's spouse and dependent children. &ldquo;Capital&rdquo; includes, for example, money in the applicant's bank, credit union, building society or post office accounts, or the applicant's house, property or land and the aim under that <Col N="1032" /> heading is to find the value of the applicant's disposable capital which is its gross value, less for example, the cost of realising assets, outstanding loans, etc. Since in the vast majority of cases, applicants do not have significant capital resources, by and large, eligibility is determined by reference to income alone.  While the income of a husband and wife are normally aggregated, they are treated separately when the parties are in conflict with each other, or where they are living separately and apart.  The effect of this rule is that in a very high proportion of matrimonial cases, a wife will qualify for legal services, even if her husband is financially secure.</P>
    <P>The merits test operates on the basis that legal aid may be granted only where the applicant has, as a matter of law, reasonable grounds for taking, defending or being a party to legal proceedings, and is reasonably likely to be successful in those proceedings.</P>
    <P>In considering applications for legal aid in general, it is also necessary for the Legal Aid Board to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the probable cost of taking or defending the proceedings, measured against the likely benefit to the applicant.  In effect, the purpose of the scheme is not to put the person of limited means in the position of the person for whom &ldquo;money is no object&rdquo; but in the position of the person whose means, while not over-abundant, are sufficient to cover essential legal services.</P>
    <P>The various income eligibility limits are reviewed from time to time on the basis generally of increases in the consumer price index.  The Civil Legal Aid Bill, 1995, which has been referred to the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, provides a statutory framework for the scheme.  In the Second Stage debate I informed the House that I am increasing the various income limits.  Details will be announced very shortly.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides for the refusal of legal aid and advice where the application is made by, or on behalf of, a person in connection with proceedings in <Col N="1033" /> which numerous persons have the same interest.  It may also be refused where the board is of the opinion that the application is not being made in the sole interests of the applicant or a member of his or her family or other person for whom the applicant has special responsibility but is of a kind commonly described as a test case.</P>

      <P>Under section 20 of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 1992, liability for licensing and paying vehicle excise duty &mdash; motor tax &mdash; in respect of a vehicle, which it is intended to use in a public place, arose from the date of registration of the vehicle in the State.  The person first licensing the vehicle is liable for the motor tax regardless of the ownership situation prior to first licensing. It would be a matter for that person, when acquiring the vehicle or otherwise, to come to an arrangement with the previous owners regarding the amount due in tax.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead&rdquo; exhorts local authorities to provide a comprehensive and cohesive housing service to persons in need of housing. This would, of course, include people with disabilities.  Since the publication of the document on 2 May, officials of my Department have held a series of regional seminars for local authority housing personnel to discuss the implementation of the proposals in the document, including the delivery of a good housing advice and information service. For the same purpose, a national conference has been arranged for elected councillors on 5 July.  While I am not aware of what specific actions have, as yet, been taken by local authorities in the matter, I will avail of every opportunity that presents itself to remind them of the special need to cater for people with disabilities in developing all aspects of their housing service.</P>

      <P>Work is in hands on the drafting of regulations under section 35 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, for the general regulation and control of traffic, including the parking of vehicles in public places.  Controls, which will apply nationally, on the parking of vehicles in disabled drivers' parking bays will be included in the regulations and I intend that the &ldquo;on the spot fine&rdquo; system will apply to offences involving illegal parking in such bays.</P>
      <P>Pending the commencement of section 35 and the implementing regulations, the making of traffic and parking by-laws or temporary rules in relation to particular areas is a matter for the Garda Commissioner under sections 89 and 90 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961.  I understand that the Commissioner has made temporary rules under those provisions in respect of certain counties which prohibit the parking of vehicles, other than vehicles displaying a disabled driver's permit, in a disabled driver's parking bay.  The offence of contravening such a prohibition is subject to the &ldquo;on the spot fine&rdquo; system.  The making of further temporary rules to extend the prohibition to additional areas is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.</P>

A maintenance grant could not, therefore, be paid in respect of attendance at a third level college outside Ireland for the 1995-96 academic year to the person in question.</P>
      <P>Neither could the person be allowed to continue on the vocational training opportunities scheme as that scheme is specifically for programmes below third level being pursued within the State and is supported by the European Social Fund on that basis.  Moreover, participation in VTOS is intended to be for two years only.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance in his Budget Statement announced that it is intended that maintenance grants under the higher education grants scheme will be extended to certain courses to be specified being followed by Irish students abroad with effect from the 1996-97 academic year.

      <P>The daily average number of prisoners who were on temporary release during June 1995 and the six month period ending 30 June 1995 was 493 and 518 respectively.</P>
      <P>For some years now decisions to grant compassionate releases from prison have been influenced by pressure on accommodation.  The overriding concern, however, when decisions are being made in individual cases is the safety of the public.  Early releases are largely granted to offenders serving relatively short sentences, or who are near the end of longer sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prisoners are in many cases granted <Col N="1056" /> temporary release for positive humanitarian reasons.  These include such occasions as illnesses of near relatives and bereavements, christenings and first communions of children, employment interviews, or to help with the resocialisation programmes in the case of longer-term offenders.</P>
    <P>Daily release to employment is frequently allowed for an offender towards the end of his-her sentence.  There must be reasonable grounds for expecting that the offender will be well conducted and the availability of suitable employment is an important factor.  Full temporary release whereby the offender lives outside the prison at home, in a hostel or in lodgings is a further phase to which a prisoner on day to day release for employment may progress.</P>
    <P>Temporary release may be granted for different periods of time, as appropriate ranging from a few hours to weekly renewable temporary release.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware from the Government statement issued on 8 June 1995 that the Government is determined to ensure a strategic approach to the allocation of available resources in 1996. This will involve all Ministers, including the Minister for Justice, in a review of existing policies and expenditures with a view to maximising benefits within the Government's spending target for 1996. It was in this context that the Government found it necessary to defer the Castlerea prison project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following this decision, and as I informed the House in the debate on the Private Members' motion on Castlerea prison on 27 June 1995, I <Col N="1057" /> decided to establish immediately an inter-departmental committee to review all aspects of the prison project for Castlerea, taking into account the social and economic impact on Castlerea and the surrounding area and the need to identify and initiate measures to address such impact.  The committee, will be chaired by an assistant secretary in my Department and will have senior representatives from the other Departments. A formal input will be sought from the Castlerea Development CoOperative Society Ltd., to ensure that the measures identified to address the impact of the deferral are informed not only by broad criminal justice and related considerations, but also by local concerns and insights.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, as I informed the House in course of the above mentioned debate, the Government in deciding to defer the Castlerea prison project, recognised the need, at this time, to examine the State's overall offender management structures and capacity against the background of developments taking place in relation to juvenile justice and the impact of the peace process.  The Government also decided to conduct a full-scale review of offender treatment options generally, including the wider use of community sanctions and measures as recommended by the 1985 Whitaker report <Col N="1058" /> and more recently in the prisons five year plan.</P>
    <P>I have arranged that the committee will hold its first meeting within the next week and report by the end of December this year.  The recommendations of the committee will then be brought to Government without delay.</P>
    <P>A contract for the provision of the prison perimeter wall and associated works was placed in May 1994.  Works under this contract are virtually complete. I am informed by the Office of Public Works that the estimated total costs arising from this contract for my Department will be £1,300,000 and that, to date, expenditure in the amount of £1,120,613 has been incurred.</P>

    <P>In my Department's policy document The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan published last June, it was acknowledged that there was not enough prison places to hold all offenders in custody for the full length of sentence without overcrowding.  The plan put forward a three-pronged strategy to enable the prison system to achieve: (a) the provision of additional prison places; (b) a change over to a system of planned and programmed early releases under the supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service and (c) greater reliance on community sanctions and other non-custodial measures imposed at the court stage to ensure that prison places are reserved for offenders for whom no other option is feasible.</P>
    <P>A programme of refurbishment and upgrading of existing accommodation is also being undertaken.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that the additional prison places envisaged will not, now, be available as soon as it was intended.  This matter is, however, still under review.</P>

      <P>A community garda is also assigned to the James's Street area and he performs frequent foot patrols as well as liaising with the local community.  The sergeant in charge of community policing for the area and the community garda are, at present, in the process of setting up a residents block committee in the St. James's Street flats complex.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the present policing arrangements are adequate to meet the needs of the James's Street area but the position will be kept under review and any adjustments considered necessary will be made.</P>

      <P>Late last year, a review of the person's non-contributory widow's pension took place.  During the review, it came to light that her family had transferred all intestate interests in the family farm to the person concerned. She was assessed with weekly means of £101.92 from the farm which exceeded the means limit of £64 per week for entitlement to pension.  Her widow's non-contributory pension was stopped from 24 February 1995.</P>
      <P>The person concerned subsequently supplied additional information regarding her farming income and expenditure which would affect her farm means assessment.</P>
      <P>All the necessary information has now been collected by a local officer from my Department including details supplied by the district veterinary office as late as last Friday evening.  Her entitlement to pension will be decided by a deciding officer this week and she will be notified of the outcome without delay.</P>
      <P>If the person concerned is not satisfied with the decision given by the deciding officer she may appeal for a review of that decision by the independent Social Welfare Appeals Office.</P>

      <P>About 70,000 married women will receive a payment on account by August 1995 and the necessary preparations for this are ongoing.  These payments will consist of the adult dependant allowance for the period December 1984 to May 1986; payments in respect of child dependant allowances for the period December 1984 to November 1986 and compensation based on inflation on the payment on account and on amounts already paid under the 1992 retrospective legislation.  Any remaining entitlements in respect of the adult dependant allowance, child dependant allowances or unemployment assistance will be paid from September 1995 to September 1996.  Entitlement in respect of transitional payments will be processed immediately thereafter.</P>
      <P>The overall cost of giving full effect to the decision of the High Court is estimated at £260 million of which £200 million will be paid by the end of this year.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to an anomaly in the system whereby when a carer's allowance is being paid the old age pension continues to be paid for six weeks after death while when a prescribed relative's allowance is being paid it ceases immediately; and if he would consider changing the regulations to enable the old age pension to be paid also for a further six weeks in cases where prescribed relative's allowances are in operation.</Quest>

      <P>Current legislation provides for payment of certain pensions to be continued for six weeks after the death of the recipient provided the pension includes an increase in respect of an adult dependant.  In the case of a pensioner who was being cared for by his or her spouse who was getting the carer's allowance and but for receipt of the carer's allowance would have been entitled to an adult dependant allowance, the position is that payment of the carer's allowance is terminated while payment of the pension, including the adult dependant allowance, continues for six weeks after the death of the pensioner. Where the recipient of the carer's allowance was not the pensioner's spouse, then payment of the carer's allowance continues for six weeks following the death of the pensioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prescribed relative allowance was originally paid as an addition to the pension of the person being cared for and it could not be claimed in respect of a spouse.  The scheme was changed in 1989 to enable the allowance to be paid direct to the carer.  When the carer's allowance was introduced in 1990, it was envisaged that the prescribed relative allowance would be subsumed by it and consequently, no provision was made for after death payments in respect of <Col N="1068" /> those getting the prescribed relative's allowance.  However, about 300 people continue to receive the prescribed relative allowance.  The question of providing those people with after death payments similar to the carer's allowance will be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 144, 145 and 146 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative, which is due to be published in the near future, the costs, in 1993 prices, of implementing light rail lines to Tallaght and Cabinteely are estimated at £79.2 million and £70.1 million respectively.  The recommended route of the Cabinteely line follows the old Harcourt Street railway alignment.  These figures represent estimated costs in respect of route related light rail system items such as trackwork, signalling, power supply, utility diversions, stations, bridge and other construction works, etc.  Allowance has also been made in the final report for non-route related network costs of £93.6 million, in 1993 prices, in respect of the basic three light rail links recommended by the DTI.  This figure relates to the cost of rolling stock, depot facilities, land acquisition and safety-security measures over the three links. The estimated cost of land acquisition is small and is included in total non-route related network costs; this means that land acquisition is not included in the route related costs of £79.2 million and <Col N="1074" /> £70.1 million in respect of the Tallaght and Cabinteely light rail lines.</P>
    <P>The objective is to have two priority phases of the light rail network constructed in the period up to 1999.  In this context my Department in conjunction with a high level project team in CIE has for some time been engaged in detailed planning and preparatory work to advise on the optimum combination of light rail links recommended by the DTI to be constructed by 1999 on the basis of a number of criteria, including financial performance, congestion alleviation, environmental impact and ease of construction. All the bodies involved in the planning and provision of transportation in the Dublin area are cooperating in this work which embraces all aspects of the light rail network.  The provisional finding arising from this work, which is subject to more detailed examination in a number of respects, including detailed route alignment, is that links to Tallaght and Dundrum should be constructed by 1999 and this position was noted and approved by the Government in October 1994.</P>

      <P>At present satellite services provided within the State are within the exclusive privilege of Telecom Éireann under section 87 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, while international services have as a matter of policy been reserved to Telecom Éireann.  Such services can, therefore, be carried out by operators other than Telecom Éireann only under a licence granted by me under section 111 or, in some circumstances by Telecom Éireann under section 89 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> I have licensed several ship earth stations for satellite services and granted a large number of temporary authorisations to operate land mobile earth stations.  I understand that a number of temporary authorisations have also been granted by Telecom Éireann. In general my Department is favourably disposed towards considering applications for the temporary use of land-mobile earth stations or land based ship earth stations for use for satellite news gathering; test and demonstration purposes; educational purposes.</P>
    <P>If, however, the Deputy can provide details of any company which has encountered difficulties with the authorisation process, I would be glad to investigate the matter.</P>
    <P>The European Commission Directive 94/46/EEC amending Directive 88/301/EEC and Directive 90/388/EEC with regard to satellite communications provides for the liberalisation of the satellite communications sector.</P>
    <P>This Directive is at present being examined with a view to early transposition into Irish law.  The implementing statutory instrument will provide for a licensing process for satellite services.</P>
