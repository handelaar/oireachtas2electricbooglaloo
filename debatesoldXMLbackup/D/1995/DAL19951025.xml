      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 3 and 4.  It is also proposed, not-withstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1)  the proceedings on No. 1, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 1 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the opening speech of a Minister or Minister or State and of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; (ii) the speech of each other Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) a Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a speech in reply not later than 12.55 p.m. (2) Private Members' Business shall be No. 12 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m. tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the creation of 49,000 net new jobs up to April 1995 underpins the <Col N="1242" /> economic policies of recent years and beats all records?  The net number of new jobs created between April 1987 and April this year is 140,000&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect an endeavour to be made to conform to procedures.  The matter referred to by the Deputy is not relevant to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the second part of the question will be relevant. Does the Taoiseach agree that there has been a disturbing trend in the numbers on the live register since April, with a steady decline in employment and a corresponding increase in the number of long-term unemployed?  I note that the Minister has a proposal on long-term unemployment which perhaps he will outline to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is making a statement on unemployment and that is not in order now.  There are many other ways of dealing with that matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>If the unemployment level is only 190,000 perhaps the Taoiseach will say why we are paying benefits to 300,000 people.  Has the commitment in the Programme for Government to extend the remit of the Ombudsman's office been considered by the Government and will legislation be introduced in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ombudsman amendment Bill to extend the remit and powers of the Ombudsman is at a very early stage of preparation.  I am unable to give the Deputy any indication as to when it will be drafted and ready for publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I take it that legislation will be introduced?  Is there an agreement in principle to extend the remit of the Ombudsman's office?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has made a commitment in that regard but the legislation is at a very early stage of preparation.  I do not wish to give the Deputy a date for its introduction because I am not in a position to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>On the privilege and compellability Bill, which we were told would be published this week, Fianna Fáil asked that there be a two week gap between publishing and taking the Bill. Is that still the intention and will the Bill be published this week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House will obviously endeavour to facilitate the Opposition in studying that legislation and will give whatever time possible to allow for such study to take place.  The legislation will be published very soon; I can be no more precise than that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little or no legislation before the House.  There is a long list of proposed legislation but if it is not published this week we will have practically no legislation before the House over the next week or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of items of legislation are approaching publication point and will be available.  We are anxious to take the privilege and compellability Bill as soon a possible after it is published but we also understand the concerns of the Opposition in seeking a delay after publication for study of the Bill.  I suggest that discussion take place between the Whips on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the way in which the committee was forced not to allow an investigation into the Horgan's Quay site yesterday, will the Chair convene a meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges immediately to discuss the allegations made here and outside the House by the Minister?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>When the long promised Freedom of Information Bill is passed will the Taoiseach see to it that the Department of Finance will give me information on the costings of the White Paper on Education?  I am at a loss as to why those costings have been suppressed for so long, given the Taoiseach's reputed interest in taxpayers' money.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>There appears to be a problem regarding the lack of legislation before the House.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry informed me that legislation governing the control of horses will compete with other Government business and, accordingly, one cannot be certain when it will be introduced.  What business will it compete with given that the Government does not have much legislation prepared for presentation?</P>

      <P>A draftsperson can only work on one Bill at a time.  There is a question of prioritisation as to which Bill should be dealt with first.  There are problems of the type mentioned by the Deputy which I am sure he appreciates, but we are anxious to bring forward this legislation soon.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate if legislation governing the insurance industry will be introduced shortly?  The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment promised a review of the serious problems posed by the high cost of premiums for public liability, motor insurance and a range of other premiums in that sector.  There were indications that legislation would be introduced to deal with the matter. Will the Taoiseach indicate when it will be introduced?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for correcting what he said yesterday about the fisheries amendment Bill. This legislation which has been challenged in the courts and which has created the difficulty regarding the issuance of licences is responsible for the loss of several hundred jobs in the west. It should be given priority as the business people involved have made considerable investments in the project and the longer the matter is delayed the greater will be the number of jobs lost in the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said to the Deputy yesterday, at his request I am attaching priority to that legislation.  I will endeavour to ensure that it is available before the end of the year.

      <P>In an effort to be helpful to the House and to you, a Cheann Comhairle, will the Taoiseach tell us what legislation, if any, the Government intends to publish this week, next week and the week after, because it seems to be a moveable feast?

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That, with effect from 1st November, 1995, until further notice in <Col N="1251" /> the 27th Dáil, the following be adopted in substitution for Standing Order 33 of the Standing Orders of Dáil Éireann relative to Public Business:&mdash;</P>
    <P>`33.  The Ceann Comhairle shall examine every Question in order to ensure that its purpose is to elicit information upon or to elucidate matters of fact or of policy, that it is as brief as possible, that it does not seek information provided within the preceding four months in the case of Questions for oral reply or provided within the preceding two weeks in the case of Questions for written reply, and that it contains no argument or personal imputation.  The Ceann Comhairle, or the Clerk under his authority, may amend any Question, after consultation with the member responsible for the Question, to secure its compliance with Standing Orders.'.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This motion proposes, in effect, that the repeat rule for written parliamentary questions should be reduced from the present four months to two weeks, for a trial period.  No change is proposed in respect of oral questions.</P>
    <P>All Members will readily agree that parliamentary questions are an essential element of democracy.  Members can ensure that members of the Government are accountable to the Dáil for their actions.  It is worth reminding Members that, in 1992, it was calculated to cost approximately £64 to provide the answer to each parliamentary question. Obviously that cost is higher at today's salary levels.  Just out of curiosity, I examined yesterday's Order Paper. There were 56 oral questions and 160 written questions, a total of 216 questions. Taking the 1992 costing per question, that gives a total of £13,824 as the cost of answering the parliamentary questions just for one day.  I leave it to the mathematicians to calculate the annual cost.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> Members, therefore, have a responsibility not to abuse the system of parliamentary questions.  For example, repetitious or mischievous questions that could be easily answered by a telephone call to the relevant Minister's office or Government Department, should be avoided.</P>
    <P>The Government's policy document &mdash;<i>A Government of Renewal</i>&mdash; states. among other things, that the Government will make the Dáil more efficient, businesslike and provide accountability and transparency.  Members will recall that most of the Government's proposals relating to Oireachtas Reform as set out in its policy documents were approved by the House in March. Relaxing the repeat rule for written questions is another tangible example of the Government's commitment to its policy of accountability and transparency. Members will know the Government will very shortly propose a comprehensive package of measures to implement the stated policy to improve the proceedings of this House.  This package will be the result of intensive consultation.  In that context, I pay a particular tribute to the Fianna Fáil Party which published its Dáil reform proposals in June.  I assure Deputies that the Government is actively considering those and other proposals and the resultant package will reflect that consideration.</P>
    <P>It is crucial to the effective functioning of a democracy that the rules and procedures of the Houses of Parliament must facilitate the constructive input by each and every Member of the House.  Members must feel that they have rightful and meaningful participation in the parliamentary process.  The committee system, whereby we now have legislation committees of the Dáil, have enhanced that input.  The committee rooms are less intimidating.  They promote exchange and dialogue rather than the expected inevitable conflict. Even though a Deputy may not be a member of a particular committee, there is nothing to prevent him or her <Col N="1253" /> attending the committee and participating in the debate on a Bill.  The development of the committees mean that the time constraints of the past whereby the guillotine was frequently employed to bulldoze legislation through, is now, happily a thing of the past.</P>
    <P>The committees, while they have certainly created more work for the individual Members, have undoubtedly also more than compensated by way of a feeling of fulfilment and participation. The arrival of the TV camera to the Chamber and to the committee rooms has given rise to the need for other procedural developments or modifications.</P>
    <P>Certainly Parliament has shown a capacity and a willingness to adapt and accommodate.  It is an evolutionary process, however, that must be helped along.  That is the reason I look forward to the publication of the Government's proposals, which as the Taoiseach said in the House yesterday, and again today will be available in the very near future.</P>
    <P>As the motion says this proposal to amend Standing Order No. 33 is for a trial period.  During that time I, as Government Chief Whip, the Government and you, a Cheann Comhairle, will be reviewing its operation to see if it is producing efficiency in the running of the House and to ensure it is not being abused by Members.</P>
    <P>Members should be aware that if this relaxation is abused by continually putting down the same question or asking other Members to do so, it may be ruled out of order, at the discretion of the Ceann Comhairle.  There may also be an element of misusing public funds considering the stated costs of parliamentary questions.  If any abuse becomes obvious the Government will, reluctantly, propose revoking this amendment.  Hopefully, that will not arise and Members will use the relaxation in the spirit of openness and transparency in which it is intended.</P>
    <P>There have also been representations to extend the relaxation rule to oral questions.  That is the subject matter of an amendment from Fianna Fáil. <Col N="1254" /> However, we cannot accept this because answering oral questions is substantially different from answering written questions. For example, oral questions involve Dáil time, which is scarce and expensive and requires a great deal of briefing and preparing replies for members of the Government compared with written questions.</P>
    <P>We might await the outcome of experience with the relaxation of the rule relating to written questions and we will take matters from there.  This matter has been referred by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to one of its subcommittees and it would be prudent to leave further discussions on it to the subcommittee.</P>
    <P>The adoption of this amendment will dramatically reduce the administative burden on the officials dealing with parliamentary questions in the Houses of the Oireachtas and Government Departments.  The time involved in checking and cross-checking whether a parliamentary question is a repeat is incalculable.  Considering the number of questions put down each week the Dáil sits, it is obvious that such checking requires a high number of man hours which could be used more productively.</P>
    <P>I am assured by the officials of the Houses of the Oireachtas that the passing of this motion and the consequent reduction of the administrative burden will result in decisions being made earlier on other questions.  I am sure that will be generally welcomed, particularly in relation to whether these questions are relevant.  This will result in a significant net gain for all Members and Government Departments.  For all the reasons stated, I commend this motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>(1)  To delete all words from and including &ldquo;that it does not seek&rdquo; down to an including &ldquo;written reply&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;that, in the case of Questions to the Taoiseach for oral reply, it does <Col N="1255" /> not seek information provided within the preceding six weeks&rdquo;; and</P>
    <P>(2)  to add the following to the proposed new Standing Order:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;: provided that no Question shall be ruled out of order on the grounds of being anticipatory of debate.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for putting down this motion.  At recent meetings the Opposition Whips have been requesting that measures be brought forward to address this problem.  Unfortunately, this side of the House cannot support the motion because it is a minimalist approach and does not go far enough.  It is indicative of the way in which this House is ensnared by its rules, procedures and precedents that I had to spend a great deal of time formulating an amendment to this motion.  Unfortunately the Ceann Comhairle, in his wisdom, saw fit to emasculate much of it.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle's staff for the assistance they gave me in relation to the amendment.</P>
    <P>The amendment I have put down on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party will, in effect, abolish the repeat rule for all questions, oral and written, except in the case of questions to the Taoiseach who answers oral questions every week in this House on Tuesdays and Wednesdays &mdash; there is a repeat rule in regard to oral questions to the Taoiseach. There is, in effect, an inbuilt repeat rule in relation to oral questions to Ministers on the basis that they answer questions only every five or six weeks.  In these days of computerisation, it is the height of nonsense that officials in this House spend endless hours trawling through the Official Report to see whether a question tabled is a repeat of a previous question.  The Minister knows that much departmental time is also taken up in that regard.</P>
    <P>This amendment will help to alleviate some of the difficulties referred to and will ensure that Members will be given <Col N="1256" /> earlier notice when questions are disallowed by the Ceann Comhairle, through his staff.  The Ceann Comhairle has also seen fit to deem in order another suggestion by the Members on this side of the House that a question will not be ruled out of order on the basis that it is anticipatory of debate. That is to be welcomed because I could never understand that rule, even when I was in Government.</P>
    <P>The following lofty words are contained in the second paragraph of <i>A Government of Renewal</i> which, as Deputy O'Rourke often says, is the glue keeping this Government together:</P>
    <P>But the relationship between Government and the people it serves has been damaged by a lack of openness. That relationship must be renewed, so that the people of Ireland have total confidence in Government and in a political system which is fully inclusive.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael, Labour and Democratic Left came into Government on a wave of openness, transparency, accountability and freedom of information, but what has happened since then?  The political correspondent, Geraldine Kennedy, said some months ago that this is one of the most secretive Governments in the history of the State.  Indeed, in today's <i>Irish Independent</i> there is an article about transparency at the end of a tunnel. Those remarks by outside commentators indicate that it is not just Opposition Members who believe that this Government's lack of transparency is unique in the history of the State.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go over the whole débácle of the Lowry affair but some commentators said it was an unseemly debate which achieved little.  This side of the House wanted the matter to be discussed in committee where it could have been investigated in the reasonable way the Minister suggested. However, at his &mdash; and the Government's &mdash; insistence, he came into this House.  He stated on television that he would stay here until midnight answering questions yet, as my fellow Whip in <Col N="1257" /> the Progressive Democrats knows, a cat and mouse game was played with us in relation to the number of questions ultimately allowed by the Government.  The Minister also hid behind the <i>sub judice</i> rule.</P>
    <P>This attitude to parliamentary democracy is held by there parties who profess to be trail blazers in regard to Dáil reform.  Over the years, the Taoiseach has made himself out to be one of the key people seeking Dáil reform.  In November last year, when the Taoiseach was in Opposition, he stated:</P>
    <P>We need a new Government that will reform the institutions of this State to make every Member of this House who holds office duly accountable. We need reform to ensure that when answers to questions asked in the House are not adequate, the Ceann Comhairle can demand that a further answer be given.</P>
    <P>Where does the Taoiseach stand in that regard now in relation to the débâcle in the Lowry affair, when the Minister came into this House and gave answers to five questions that were totally different from the questions asked?  The Tánaiste also does not go unscathed in this regard.  When he was in Opposition he stated:</P>
    <P>If this House were to accept that a Minister would never be accountable to the Dáil without direct culpability on his or her part, the principle of accountability would wither away. Without accountability the value of a parliamentary democracy would be fatally undermined.</P>
    <P>These were lofty sentiments from the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste when they were in Opposition but they seem to have forgotten about them in Government.</P>
    <P>In reply to a number of questions in the House yesterday, the Taoiseach was disingenuous when he said his Department was informed at the same time as the Opposition when questions were disallowed.  He hid the fact, in effect, that there is substantial contact between <Col N="1258" /> his or the Minister's Department and the General Office as to whether a question is allowable.  With all due respect to the officials in the House who are totally overworked in relation to the number of questions put down &mdash; I know that the deletion of the repeat rule will be of some benefit in this regard &mdash; they must rely to a large extent on the advice they are given by the Departments.  Where is the separation of powers in that respect?  If contact is made between Departments and the officials in this House in regard to whether a question is allowable, it puts into question the separation of power between this House, as a Parliament, and Government and the accountability of Government to this Parliament.  I believed, even while in Government, that this should be examined and changed to ensure this House is totally separate when dealing with questions.</P>
    <P>We also have the ludicrous position in relation to the transfer of questions.  It is fitting that the Taoiseach has been very vigilant in relation to the questions addressed to him.  I would like to quote the following from a Fine Gael policy document on law reform:</P>
    <P>There is considerable dissatisfaction amongst members at their lack of ability to adequately scrutinise the activities of Government by means of Parliamentary Questions. There is a feeling that Ministers have the capacity to avoid answering Questions, and to use the understandable anxiety of the Ceann Comhairle to move on to the next Question to evade appropriate answers.  Where there are a number of parties in Opposition, this problem is accentuated by the anxiety of each party to put in a questioner on each Question.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael went on to say that proper rules&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Much of what we are doing today had its genesis in the remarks of the chairman of the beef tribunal. He said that if a more open policy had been adopted to the answering of questions through the years, leaving politics aside, perhaps we might not have had a beef tribunal.  That is why we, on this side of the House, make no bones about the fact that we want this system changed in such a way that the Ministers and institutions of our State will be far more accountable to this Parliament.</P>
      <P>I, perhaps unfairly, mentioned statements made in the past by the Taoiseach's party.  I also have a document containing Democratic Left's proposals for Dáil reform which makes intriguing reading.  If I had more time, I would quote what it says, and I agree with much of it.  The document states:</P>
      <P>It comes as a great shock to most newly elected Deputies to discover just how restricted they are in their efforts to represent their constituents by Standing Orders and by obscure often unwritten rules of precedent and tradition &mdash; precedent and tradition seem to be used primarily to restrict rather than to enhance the role of the Deputy.</P>
      <P>Vocal proponents of Dáil reform in Opposition too often become unquestioning defenders of precedent and tradition when elected to Government.</P>
      <P>I wish Minister De Rossa was here to hear what I am saying.</P>
      <P>The document continued:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present, Ministers regularly provide vague and partial or overlong answers in reply to oral questions. <Col N="1260" /> The Ceann Comhairle should have the power to request the Minister to respond to a question or to state why he cannot.</P>
    <P>That is from the party of a Minister who is the subject of a complaint to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges having walked out of this House and refused to answer direct questions put by our spokesperson on Social Welfare. He had the audacity to say, &ldquo;I am not answering that question.&rdquo;  Those in Government should put their money where their mouths are and introduce more than a minimalist change to Dáil procedure.  I spent some time over the weekend working on this issue.  I thank the Minister for at least complimenting us for taking the time to put our Dáil reform proposal before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and this House.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Ceann Comhairle saw fit to rule our proposal out of order but perhaps the Minister will accept it. The proposal is not an exhaustive list because many of the issues I wanted to include would have been ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  One of the suggestions was that there be a priority time for the Taoiseach's questions for half an hour on a Tuesday and a Wednesday in addition to oral questions to the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>There is another problem which I accept also occurred when we were in Government.  Last Wednesday while the Taoiseach was answering oral questions, the Tánaiste was waiting to answer a myriad of questions on important subjects such as Bosnia and Northern Ireland.  Unfortunately, there were only 20 minutes in which the Tánaiste could answer questions.  We propose that, irrespective of the number of Taoiseach's questions, there should always be at least one hour set aside for ordinary oral questions to Ministers.</P>
    <P>The remit of questions and answers should be widened.  There is a problem as a result of the setting up &mdash; and we were party to it when we were in Government &mdash; of bodies outside this <Col N="1261" /> House, such as, for example, the National Roads Authority.  I cannot ask a question in this House about one of the major roads going through my constituency.</P>
    <P>That, unfortunately, is one of the downsides to establishing these separate bodies which, in effect, are not answerable to the Dáil.  I propose that a change be made to Standing Orders to make Ministers answerable not only in relation to his or her Departments but also local authorities and other State bodies such as the National Roads Authority and the IDA.</P>
    <P>I was very careful when drafting the proposal&mdash;I thank the officials for their help &mdash; and I did not suggest that we should be entitled to ask questions about the day-to-day running of Departments or local authorities.  Questions should relate to the general administration and policies of these bodies.  It is only fair and proper.  In view of the fact that Exchequer funding comes from this House to those bodies, it is only right they should be answerable to it.</P>
    <P>The other suggestion we made relates to priority questions.  We suggested that there should be priority questions to the Taoiseach and that in addition, the leader of each Opposition party should be permitted to table a Private Notice Question every day under the same rules.  I accept it would have to relate to a matter of urgency but party leaders should have that facility.  It may be said that it exists but it should be designated specifically so party leaders would have an opportunity to raise issues which are being discussed in Molesworth Street but not here.</P>
    <P>One of the other important proposals made on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party is that written questions be answered during Dáil recess.  The Dáil rose on 20 July this year and returned on 20 September and we had the ludicrous situation that we were not permitted to table questions during that period nor were we entitled to seek written replies to questions from 20 September onwards. Either the House is sitting or it is not.  I was told that the committees do not <Col N="1262" /> count and that the Dáil was in recess. As far as I am concerned, if the committees of this House are sitting, we should be allowed ask questions.  What else can Opposition Deputies do but table questions to elicit information from Government Departments?  The Dáil in effect now sits for 11 months, rising for August and over Christmas, and I suggest that Deputies should be able to seek written replies to questions during the Dáil recess.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, refused to answer questions by relying on the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  I was party to the changing of that rule when I was a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Unfortunately the <i>sub judice</i> rule has been abused by people inside and outside the House. Up to approximately two years ago once someone had paid £50 to issue a plenary, High Court or a Circuit Court summons the matter could not be raised by way of question or motion in the House.  That rule was relaxed by the Dáil under a Fianna Fáil Administration so as to ensure full accountability.  In spite of this the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications recently hid behind the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  I do not understand his reasons for doing this as it is only when the notice of trial, the final document in an action, has been lodged in court that the <i>sub judice</i> rule comes into operation.  Given the delays in courts, it would not be possible for the notice of trial to have been issued in the cases which the Minister pleaded were subject to the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  It should have been possible, therefore, for him to answer our questions.</P>
    <P>I am perhaps straying somewhat from the motion but I feel very strongly about this matter.  There were approximately 40 items on the agenda for the last meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and there will probably be another 40 items on the agenda for its next meeting.  There are some very serious issues to be addressed in relation to the alleged abuse of privilege. When the motion recently came <Col N="1263" /> before the Dáil my party supported the change on the basis that people outside the House should have an opportunity to put their positions on the record. From my recollection, my party has never abused the privilege of the House even during difficult times.  Members of the Government abused the privilege of the House when they were in Opposition and unfortunately they appear to be abusing it again.  A meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should be convened to discuss the alleged abuse of this privilege so that the matter does not go on for ever and people outside the House are given an opportunity to put their positions on the record.  This is the first time this rule will be looked at and I ask the Ceann Comhairle to convene an urgent meeting to discuss the matter.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister to change his minimalist approach to questions.  I do not understand why he cannot devise a system whereby there is an inbuilt repeal rule for oral questions so that the questions cannot be answered in any event for five weeks.  It would make the House more accountable and allow for more scrutiny.</P>
    <P>In the case of questions which are repeated every second week it is in order for the Department to say &ldquo;this question was asked a fortnight ago and there has been no change in the position since then&rdquo;.  The problem in the case of the beef tribunal was that when questions were asked the information was not available and when it was available questions could not be asked.  When it was in Government with us the Labour Party was adamant that these rules should be changed so that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party has been extremely active in regard to Dáil reform.  This is the first time I have been in Opposition since I came into the <Col N="1264" /> House and I now understand the difficulties of Opposition parties.  Over the years Governments have given in to pressure.  It would be much better for elected parliamentarians, who have nothing to hide, to lay the facts before the Dáil.  Instead of adopting a minimalist approach I implore the Government which came into office on a wave of openness, transparency and accountability, to accept my proposal.  If necessary, the Minister could introduce an amendment incorporating my proposed changes to the Standing Orders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot over emphasise the importance of our deliberations. The issue of the questioning of the Executive by the Opposition is of fundamental importance in our democracy and just as important as, for example, the legislation on freedom of information which is due to come before the House.  I understand there is a difficulty in getting it through the Department of Justice, something which does not surprise me.</P>
      <P>The Government's proposal is a half baked minimalist response to the very serious need to review the way in which we deal with parliamentary questions in the House.  It arises from a proposal I put to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to abolish the repeat rule applicable to parliamentary questions. This rule is one of the many means used by this and previous Governments to avoid answering questions.  To put it simply, if a similar question has been tabled and answered within the past four months the repeat rule provides a way out for the Minister.  It gives him an opportunity to flee from accountability in the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From time to time there is a certain amount of melodramatic apoplexy and outrage when it is alleged that Ministers have misled the House, an offence which is meant to carry the ultimate sanction of resignation.  When such a charge is made the Chair asks for it to be withdrawn as it is deemed to be an offence against the Parliament.  These occasional melodramatic occurrences <Col N="1265" /> are disingenous given that the House is misled on a daily basis as a result of the way in which parliamentary questions are replied to by Ministers.  I find it disheartening that a Government which owes its existence to the failure of the previous Administration to be open and accountable to the Dáil has failed to learn any of the lessons which flowed from the beef tribunal inquiry and then the Brendan Smyth affair.  The Government appears to have the memory of a goldfish and an indecent capacity for hypocrisy when it comes to openness, transparency and accountability.  It constantly states that it is committed to open government.  Yet on a daily basis Opposition Deputies are thwarted and there is much ducking and diving by the Ministers in an effort to avoid answering questions.  The Government has failed to translate its commitment to openness into parliamentary practice.</P>
    <P>Despite a change in composition, it was clear from the Brendan Smyth &ldquo;part two&rdquo; affair earlier this year that the Executive leopard had not changed its spots when the new Administration headed up by Deputy John Bruton failed its first test of accountability. Who can forget that frozen moment of radio shock when the Taoiseach, of all people, said: &ldquo;The Deputy (me) did not ask the right question&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>What was different about the Brendan Smyth part II affair was that it was not confusion, tiredness or the fast unfolding of events, as claimed by the previous Administration when it fell from parliamentary grace, that led to the Dáil being misled; information was withheld from the Dáil on independent legal advice given to the Taoiseach to the effect that if he answered the question posed by me relating to unanswered correspondence in the Attorney General's Office it would prejudice a civil servant's right to due process.  That set a dangerous precedent.</P>
    <P>The supreme right of the Dáil to receive information requested was sub-jugated by a civil servant's right to due process and the potential threat which <Col N="1266" /> this posed to the State in terms of a possible claim by that civil servant for unlawful dismissal.  Is it now acceptable for Ministers to suspend the right of the Dáil to receive information on the grounds that if a question is replied to properly a third party's legal rights might be infringed, leading to a claim against the State?  This is no academic doodle for leisurely consideration in the House.</P>
    <P>Would it have been possible, for example, to get straight answers about the Blood Bank-hepatitis C scandal by way of Dáil questions?  Will we ever see the unabridged version of the report of the investigation into the events at Madonna House or the health board inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of Kelly Fitzgerald?  If those reports were published, the legal rights of third parties might well be infringed.</P>
    <P>In a parliamentary democracy the only way an under-resourced Opposition Deputy can hold the Government or Executive to account is by way of questions to the Taoiseach and Ministers. As in cricket, there are rules to play by &mdash; Standing Orders and rulings of the Chair for the orderly conduct of business.  When the integrity of parliament starts to slip in terms of the quality of replies to questions the core value system which underpins our activities is endangered.  This has happened, it is an appalling vista and one which must be addressed if this and subsequent Governments are not to fall and confidence in the political system is not to be undermined.</P>
    <P>The Government has done nothing to enhance the primacy of the Dáil and strengthen its role as an inquiring body. It has been diminished as the Government has become a big spending Government which spends much money in spinning the truth.  Thousands of pounds are spent in each Government Department on spin doctors and public relations consultants.  Will we ever be given the exact figure?</P>
    <P>The Government Chief Whip told us how much it costs to respond to a Dáil <Col N="1267" /> question &mdash; £64.  That was hilarious.  Are we supposed to feel guilty when this is the only way we can hold the Executive to account?  I find it extraordinary when the Government spends so much in spinning its own version of events&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I often use the image of David and Goliath to highlight the differences between the Opposition and this big spending Government.</P>
      <P>Against this background the parliamentary question is even more important since it is a plain instrument which should endure and suit its purpose, but only if the rules are honoured. Any Deputy will testify that the practices exposed in the beef tribunal inquiry in relation to the failure to answer Dáil questions are still being engaged in.</P>
      <P>One of the most frustrating experiences and aspects of my job as an Opposition Deputy is that I am thwarted on a daily basis as questions are blocked by a range of obstacles, one of which is the repeat rule which is blatantly abused by Ministers to avoid answering controversial questions.  When presented with an awkward question officials in Ministers' offices will claim that it is a repeat and the General Office has little clout to dispute this.  It is also easy for a Government Deputy, by arrangement or innocently, to raise a matter on the Adjournment or table a question for a written reply which has the effect of preventing the Opposition from raising if for four months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1268" /> In office, Ministers tend to see the Dáil as an irritant and a tedious brush with accountability which they must physically endure for one day every six weeks.  For the remainder of the time they leave it to their officials or advisers to box cleverly in fielding and transferring questions.  Depending on their stamina and forensic skills the inquiring Opposition Deputy is worn down after a number of attempts to elicit a reply.</P>
    <P>My files tell a sad tale of parliamentary obstruction whereby questions have been ruled out of order, transferred to other Ministers to buy time, blocked by the repeat rule and minimally answered in outrageously deceptive terms with a view to throwing me off the scent.  It should be remembered that the evidence in the beef tribunal revealed the boast by a civil servant that his crookedly drafted reply would &ldquo;confuse the Deputy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Although this is a major issue few people understand or care about it.  We are very much involved in a housekeeping exercise today.  Many of us have become parliamentary pests because we refuse to be thwarted by this device which is used to duck questions.  There is a need for radical reform.  This motion, the purpose of which to dilute the repeat rule, is a miserable response to a request for reform from the Opposition parties which was supported at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges by all Members, not just Opposition Deputies.</P>
    <P>In May 1989 former Deputy Pat O'Malley sought information by way of parliamentary question to explain the major discrepancy between the beef export figures to Iraq for the two year period 1987-88 and the figure for export credit insurance provided for these exports in the same period, but this question was disallowed on the grounds that it was a repeat of previous questions. The question was then filleted &mdash; this is another aspect of the repeat rule whereby certain parts of questions can be filleted by the Administration or the Ceann Comhairle's office &mdash; deleting <Col N="1269" /> the portion which sought a clear explanation for the discrepancy.  The Minister was then free to report only on the state of the departmental investigation into the matter in a written reply which was a masterpiece of distraction and Civil Service verbiage.</P>
    <P>There is a need for <i>glasnost</i> in relation to our procedures in this House.  Without such major reform we are only whistling in the wind in introducing a freedom of information Bill.</P>
    <P>On a daily basis, I believe this House is misled by the use of procedures, such as this repeat rule, which deny information requested legitimately by Members in their efforts to hold this Government to account.</P>
    <P>I support what is left of the Fianna Fáil motion, which has been filleted in the usual way.  We will continue to press for radical reform in this area.</P>

      <P>It is fascinating to note that Deputies O'Donnell and Dermot Ahern whose parties were in power were able to tolerate this awful system which Minister Jim Higgins is making an effort to correct. We have had to listen to this codswallop.  At least, St. Paul, who travelled on horseback to Damascus, saw a flash of light and was converted.  The distance across the Chamber is but four or five yards and, lo and behold, there is a light flashing non-stop over the Opposition benches.

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny</i>): Yes, and to know what information to seek. I will not read out some of the questions on the Order Paper as I was once pilloried by a stupid journalist in an article on questions.  The journalist decided my question on school furniture was a waste of money.  I would like to break his back a little for him because I was trying to help children whose back formation was being seriously damaged and I had the support of the physiotherapists of Ireland and a surgeon in Finland.  If I read out questions some Members might think I was making light of their questions.  Most of the questions on the Order Paper have as much reason for not being answered as one could find anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk about openness.  Deputy Dermot Ahern said Geraldine Kennedy was scathing in her comments about this Government not being open.  I am sure it must be an awful disappointment to journalists to find they get no inside stories about what was said by the Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare, or the Taoiseach. The days are gone when such <Col N="1271" /> stories were all over the place and when journalists had scoops.  A Government should do its job, make decisions and cut out the background information as to who said what and whether somebody smiled, frowned or coughed.</P>
    <P>We heard about trailblazers and lofty thoughts when in Opposition.  Deputy Ahern mentioned that Deputy John Bruton and Fine Gael had lofty thoughts when in Opposition.  They were not nearly as lofty as those which Deputy Ahern has at present.  He seems to have awakened from a dream, a vision or, perhaps, a nightmare now that he is in Opposition.</P>
    <P>When Fine Gael was in Opposition, there was always a row about the transfer of questions and they were transferred by the Taoiseach.  The Ceann Comhairle could not do anything about it.  I do not think Fianna Fáil did anything about it either.  The terms of the motion will be for a trial period and the repeat rule for written questions has been changed to two weeks.  Things happen quickly in Ireland but a period of two weeks is fair enough for major changes.  One might say a week is a long time in politics but a fortnight is not too long for written questions.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  A Minister who is being taken to court in a personal capacity is different from one making statements on a semi-State body, a flooding, a road accident or a train accident which may result in a court case.  If I was being sued in my personal capacity I would be very careful about any information I would give to the Dáil.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, is being blamed wrongly for his stance on the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  He is not avoiding answering questions about some company or body.  He will be in court and that is a personal matter. Those on the Opposition benches who have legal training should see the difference. While it may be great fun attacking a Minister, fairness should prevail.</P>
    <P>The phrase &ldquo;whiter than white&rdquo; was used.  I do not understand this kind of <Col N="1272" /> language which is emanating from the Opposition.  The Government has not been in power for 12 months yet and the Opposition is making efforts to change things which have been left by Fianna Fáil for seven years, and that is only the minimum amount of time for which I can blame them.  All of this was handed over to this Government and yet we have heard claims that something was rotten in the state of Denmark.  There is something rotten in the Dáil, obviously, if Fianna Fáil, now it is in Opposition, thinks the whole place is collapsing around its ears and the Government is doing nothing about openness and giving answers.</P>
    <P>Ms Geraldine Kennedy's condemnation was mentioned.  As a former member of the Progressive Democrats and a former Member of the Dáil, she may not be a friend of the Government; I do not know.  While she is a very good journalist she is not one I would like quoted as having the final word on any particular issue.  She is entitled to express her views.  The Progressive Democrats when formed were lucky they had glowing tributes paid to them in the newspapers and on radio.  Three or four journalists suddenly became members of the party having done all the praising in their writings.  Was that fair play?</P>
    <P>I have not heard anything from Deputy O'Donnell about what efforts her party made to change anything when they were in power.  She spoke about misleading the House.  I thought the phrase was deliberately misleading the House.  Any Member could mislead the House.  A member could say something which is not factually correct as long as he or she did not deliberately set out to do so.  It is the phrase that counts.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell referred to this Government as having an indecent capacity for hypocrisy.  Some people would think there is a great deal of hypocrisy in the Progressive Democrats's high moral stand on so many issues and there is also a lot of drama, to which the Deputy also referred.  We <Col N="1273" /> have courtroom scenes here at times.  It is very dramatic.</P>
    <P>The Government is to be complimented on bringing in this change which will over the next two years, and in the next Dáil, make this a fit place in which to work.  The Government will change all the things which have been wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>As the practical aspects of the differences between the proposal in the name of the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, and the Fianna Fáil proposal have been well articulated by my colleague, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and indeed, Deputy O'Donnell of the Progressive Democrats I do not propose to go back over that ground again.</P>
      <P>This debate is essentially about accountability; the accountability of the Executive to Parliament and, though Parliament to the people, whom we are all, ultimately, here to serve.  The chairman of the beef tribunal opined that the tribunal might have been unnecessary if the Executive had been more accountable to, and open with, this House.  He was not alone in that view.  Hardly a day passed in the last year of the previous Administration without some Member of the Opposition, especially Deputy Bruton, loudly lamenting the lack of Government accountability to Parliament and trumpeting the need for radical and fundamental transformation. This proposal is an example of what he means by that.  As I understand the proposal, the position will be that instead of getting written replies to written questions on the same topic every four months we can get them every two weeks.  Is this the accountability &ldquo;godot&rdquo; we have been waiting for?  To describe this change as minimalist, as the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip did, is going too far.  If a change is described as minimalist it means some change occurred in the first place.  The reality is there was not any change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal will not lead to increased accountability.  It is a mirage. It is the merest and meanest gesture to tokenism I have encountered in my 14 years in Parliament.  Although the <Col N="1274" /> Government has resolutely refused to change the rules regarding oral questions a Deputy can look a Minister in the eye, ask a few supplementary questions and might get answers if he or she asks the right questions.  My only objective in tabling written questions is to help a constituent.  It is not something I do lightly.  The Minister of State is right when he says the device of written questions should not be used when a simple telephone call to a Department would elicit the necessary information.  I abide by that and only use the device when information is not forthcoming.  The device is also of use in getting statistical information but one cannot be sure that one will receive the information one requires.</P>
    <P>For the most part and especially in cases where a full and comprehensive reply would embarrass the Government the written reply is carefully crafted, designed more to obfuscate and conceal rather than reveal.  The best definition of the inadequacy of written replies was given by Deputy Gay Mitchell who is a member of this Administration that seeks to increase accountability by giving even more written replies.  As reported in Volume 447 at column 426 at the Official Report he stated that written replies were usually designed to mislead the House and he was so incensed that he wanted a contempt of parliament Act to deal with Ministers who seek to mislead the House by using the device of written reply.</P>
    <P>The token cosmetic proposal before us which is the Government's contribution to accountability contrasts fundamentally with what the Taoiseach and his colleagues said on this subject when in Opposition.  As reported at column 344 of the Official Report the Taoiseach stated:</P>
    <P>We need a new Government that will reform the institutions of this State to make every Member of this House who holds office truly accountable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1275" /> He wanted to:</P>
    <P>... devolve power in our society and remove the centralisation of power in the hands of a small group of people in Merrion Street,...</P>
    <P>We are doomed to disappointment if this proposal is the Taoiseach's engine of devolution.  As reported at column 1159 of the Official Report he stated:</P>
    <P>The Government must go about its work... as transparently as if it were working behind a pane of glass.</P>
    <P>He stated, as reported at column 1180 of the Official Report:</P>
    <P>Every voter is entitled to expect a Government... to be answerable for every action it takes and to be open.</P>
    <P>He committed himself to &ldquo;a demonstrably different way of working&rdquo;.  What is demonstrable about the Government's way of working is that it is worse than the previous Administration's way of working.</P>
    <P>This exquisite minuet of hypocrisy cannot fall into the Programme for Government where the three parties promised, under the heading of Oireachtas Reform, to make the Dáil more efficient and businesslike; enhance the role of Members as legislators; ensure that the various organs of State and holders of high office in the State are more answerable and accountable to the legislature and make the Executive more accountable to the legislature.  Not a day passes when each of those pious platitudes is trampled on by the Government.</P>
    <P>There are eerie similarities between the Taoiseach and the late unlamented Oliver Cromwell on this matter.  Both came to office on the basis that there was too much power centralised in the Executive and parliament would have to have its say.  On assuming office both of them decided that parliament was an irritant, an irksome nuisance to be ignored.  In fairness to the great Lord Protector it took him much longer to <Col N="1276" /> come to that conclusion than it did the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The Irish body politic is infected with a culture of secrecy which is reflected for instance in outdated and draconian official secrets legislation, a bizarre extended interpretation of the doctrine of cabinet confidentiality; abuse of the <i>sub judice</i> rule &mdash; a text book example of which we had recently in the House &mdash; and a policy of failing, to provide information to the House in a full, frank and open manner even when we ask the right questions.  This culture must be abandoned.  A society that promotes such a culture offers unique advantages to the Executive and the bureaucracy as against parliament and the individual because it is the Executive and bureaucracy that presides over the host of national secrets.  As our former imperial masters operated one of the most secretive systems of government in the free world, it was more or less inevitable that the founding fathers of this State would not only endorse but enhance the culture they inherited.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that we are living in the 1990s and information that we seek in the House is not a perk to be granted or withheld at the whim of some Minister or bureaucrat.  It is something to which we are entitled in our capacity as public representatives.  My colleague, Deputy Ahern the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip, will not fall out with me if I say the Fianna Fáil proposal, including the part which has been omitted, is not radical or earth-shattering, neither will it effect a fundamental transformation in our democracy but it is a solid foundation on which we can build for the future.  The need for the Executive to be properly accountable is beyond dispute.  That has been publicly acknowledged and articulated by the Taoiseach and is the cornerstone of the Programme for Government.  If the Government's commitment in this vital area is more than merely verbal, then a good first step would be to accept the Fianna Fáil proposal.  It would go some way towards narrowing the yawning <Col N="1277" /> chasm between the rhetoric of the Programme for Government and the reality of what we see here every day.  If our proposal is not accepted and the Government proceed with this so called change, nothing will change and the secrecy, obfuscation, lack of accountability and evasiveness which characterise proceedings in this House will continue to be the order of the day.  The gulf between this House and those whom we represent will continue to grow and, as the Minister knows, it is already dangerously wide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I dispute the figure of £64 given by the Government in 1992 as the cost of a Dáil question.  The Government of the day likes to give the impression that there is a major cost involved but I believe the figures are totally exaggerated.  Take two questions on today's Order Paper.  Who works out the averages and does the calculations? The figures of £64 or £100 are picked out of the air.  One is to ask the Minister for Education the current position regarding an application for approval for a general purposes room at a school, details supplied, in County Galway.  It does not cost £64 to answer that question. One just looks at the file.  The other is to ask the Minister for Justice the progress, if any, her Department has made regarding the provision of a new purpose built courthouse in Navan, County Meath and it does not cost £64 to answer that question either.</P>
      <P>I have tabled an important question to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht asking what he will do to prevent satellite television organisations gaining monopoly coverage of major sports events which, while important, should not cost £64 to answer.  If it costs, say, £64 for 60 words from the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, replies would become exorbitantly expensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister of State said, parliamentary questions from an extremely important, essential element of our democracy, so that Members can ensure <Col N="1278" /> that the Government of the day is made accountable for its actions.  Despite the occasional abuse of parliamentary procedures, occasioned by totally inadequate replies being given at times, the parliamentary questions system has served us very well over many years.</P>
    <P>The improvement proposed today merely tinkers around at the edges of the general, major issue of Dáil reform. Generally speaking, the manner in which we conduct our business is something of a farce.  One need only look to the Order of Business any day and ask, according to the rules of the House, what can Members deal with?  The answer is &ldquo;with promised legislation only&rdquo;, which leads to the farcical position in which Opposition parties find themselves endeavouring to raise major topical issues, matters this House should discuss, but can discuss only under the guise of &ldquo;promised legislation&rdquo;.  The trouble is the rules of the House do not permit Members to deal with important or urgent issues of the day.  Therefore, I was glad to hear the Minister say major reform of our procedures will be introduced.</P>

      <P>It is my firm belief such reforming proposals will be implemented, that the Taoiseach is very committed and will deliver on them. Nonetheless we need to devise some method of getting such important issues onto the floor of the House rapidly, otherwise we are merely rendering ourselves irrelevant.</P>
      <P>Significant improvement has been wrought through the increased number of committees of the House, constituting a much more satisfactory manner of dealing with Committee Stage of Bills and testing out their provisions, rather than adhering to a confrontational system across the floor of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though we have 166 Members for our relatively small population, Members are unable to adequately serve on these committees because we <Col N="1279" /> must spend some 60 to 80 per cent of our time on constituency work.  Otherwise we will not be re-elected to the Dáil although, perhaps with a bit of luck, may be elected to the Seanad. Generally speaking, unless we can have a constructive input into the deliberations of those committees, we will not be re-elected.  We must devote our attention to that prospect.  We should take courage and give Members the proper services and research facilities they deserve, like those afforded to say, constituency and Dáil secretaries.  Always we have backed away from this through sheer cowardice, for fear of the electorate objecting to the provision of the relatively decent facilities necessary to enable us carry out the job for which we were elected.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State has told us that the Government is bringing forward proposals for long overdue, necessary reforms.  The sooner they are implemented the better.  No doubt we shall have plenty of opportunity to give them ample consideration.  Nonetheless I am somewhat disappointed they were not inaugurated by Members of the Dáil and Seanad, the practitioners mainly affected by such reform.  Rather than such proposals having been handed down to us in draft in the form of an Executive decision, Members of both Houses should first have had them submitted for their scrutiny, thus ensuring a bottoms-up approach, affording us an opportunity to make an adequate input so that the ultimate result would lead to a better set of reforming measures. While we shall have ample opportunity of discussing them, my approach would have been preferable.</P>
    <P>The key element in parliamentary questions is Members' confidence that they will receive full, frank and absolutely accurate replies.  Over the past ten years or so the approach adopted in replying to parliamentary questions has changed to the extent that cleverness has become the essential element.  That is a very serious development.  Heretofore, because there had been enormous <Col N="1280" /> respect for parliamentary questions, at times perhaps somewhat greater than was deserved, confidence had been maintained.  Frank, accurate comprehensive replies were given without recourse to economy of truth.  Ultimately replies are the responsibility of the relevant Ministers who give them, but it would appear that cleverness is now regarded as a virtue in replying to questions.  It should not be, because it dilutes a major arm of our democracy. It is a very disappointing development. I look forward to the major Dáil reform promised.</P>
    <P>At some stage, we must approach the matter of electoral reform because, however much we try under the present system, we are forced to spend somewhere between 60 per cent and 80 per cent of our time on constituency work. While recognising that the electorate loves the proportional representation system perhaps some system could be devised comprised of a combination of the PR and list systems, something broadly along the lines of that obtaining in Germany, so that half of the membership of this House would be elected solely as legislators.  I recognise that would give a great deal of power to the party leadership&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Nealon in his denigration of the figure that has emerged from the system, of a cost of £64 to answer a parliamentary question. Ministers always should be careful whenever they receive such information, and ask a few questions themselves, before allowing it into the public domain.  The Minister of State in his opening remarks seemed to remind members of the cost involved, thereby perhaps suggesting that fewer parliamentary questions should be tabled for that reason.</P>
      <P>It ill behoves the system to advance that argument, when we know how much the taxpayer will have to pay resulting from the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry which could have been avoided had there been greater frankness and openness on the part of various Ministers in replying to questions tabled to them.  Indeed it is as a result of the recommendations of that report these issues are being addressed today and I hope more of them will be addressed in the future.  As politicians, we do ourselves a disservice in succumbing to the argument that because of some unstated, prohibitive cost involved, we should constrain ourselves in seeking valid information from the Government and various Departments.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to focus so much on what additional changes we should engage in, in terms of our procedures but rather on the fact that existing procedures are not being adhered to, which does not bring any sanction on those Members who fail to meet their responsibilities, as Members or as Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My particular bone of contention relates to recent events.  Members are aware how difficult it is to engage in a structured debate during plenary session where information &mdash; which has been properly sought and is of public importance &mdash; might be obtained.  On a <Col N="1282" /> number of recent occasions it has emerged that, because of the heat generated by force of numbers and the partisan nature of debate during a plenary session in this Parliament, it is not the best way to make people truly accountable. There has been a great loss of focus as to what is the function of the Executive when its members enter this House.  It is not simply for the purpose of defending Government policy, it is for the purpose of being accountable to Members of this House.</P>
    <P>The Chair must always be mindful that his duties are not simply for the purposes of maintaining good order within the House.  There are times when, because of the failure of Ministers to meet their own responsibilities, good order might not be maintained in this House, because it would conflict with the rights of individual Members to impinge upon the stand taken by Ministers seeking to obfuscate and deflect attention from the core issues under discussion. That has happened in this House in recent times.  I ask Members, who value the standing of this House in the public mind, what action should be taken in relation to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications who entered this House and sat silently, refusing to answering a properly constructed question &mdash; which the Chair ruled to be in order &mdash; on seven separate occasions during Question Time last week.</P>
    <P>What sanction is this House prepared to impose on a Minister who refuses, by his silence, to be accountable to properly constructed and well-ordered questions? The Minister is impinging upon my rights as a Member of this House by his non-compliance with that position.  It is important that all Members enjoy equal rights.  Those who assume the responsibility of high office and enjoy its privileges should be prepared to meet the obligations of that office in terms of respecting my rights as an individual Member.</P>
    <P>While we are discussing Dáil reform, and before any further changes are made to the procedures of this House. <Col N="1283" /> how can we insist on adherence to existing procedures and practices?  What action will be taken in relation to Members, particularly Government Ministers, who refuse to answer questions and leave the Chamber saying &ldquo;That was another difficult day but we will forget about it and move on to some other issue next week.&rdquo;?  The public standing of this House is brought into disrepute by the implicit collusion of all Members in permitting that behaviour to stand and be deemed acceptable in terms of an individual's accountability to Parliament.  That, above anything else, is what will bring disrepute on this House.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the last Government and I say to the Chief Whip, and the Government, that there is always an inclination within Government to have the easiest possible time <i>vis-á-vis</i> the workings of Parliament because the Executive is busy carrying out its duties. If the Executive is to be perceived as strong in the public mind it is clear, from examples in other jurisdictions, that strong parliamentary procedures enhance not just the Parliament but the Executive in terms of its interaction with Parliament.  That interaction does not exist in this Parliament.  This is not because we do not have more flexible procedures but because we do not insist on imposing sanctions on those Members who do not adhere to existing procedures.  The Chair, for example, in respect of any Member who is out of order can ask that that Member be named.  The sanction for refusing to leave the House under the Chair's instruction is that the individual is suspended from this House.  I agree with that because it is a proper procedure in terms of the good order of this Parliament.</P>
    <P>Why are our procedures silent in the case of a Government Minister who refuses to answer questions which are in order?  What sanction should be imposed on such a Minister?  If the sanction for being out of order is a temporary suspension from the proceedings of <Col N="1284" /> this Parliament, a refusal to answer well-ordered questions &mdash; and failing the litmus test of accountability &mdash; should involve a Minister being informed that he should not return to the Parliament until he is prepared to face up to his responsibilities?  That situation should not exist.  In our duty as an Opposition, for the purposes of extracting the truth, we will continue to table questions which are in order until such time as the Minister answers them. What Government with any semblance of credibility will allow that issue to continue? It will reflect, not on the bad name of Parliament, but on the bad name of the Minister and the Government that is prepared to prop him up.</P>
    <P>We are putting people on notice that in the interests of true accountability, not the rhetoric of accountability, those questions which are deemed in order will be continually put to that Minister until he answers them.  I am sure there are many honourable colleagues on the Government benches who are dismayed by the refusal of any Minister to answer questions which are deemed to be in order.  It is stated in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> that committees shall investigate unethical behaviour in respect of semi-State companies.  However, Members from the Government side of the House voted down the proposal to enable that to happen at yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies. That brings Parliament into disrepute.</P>

      <P>I am very dubious with regard to discussions about reform which has supposedly taken place and is due to take place in the future.  I have been a Member of this House for the past 20 years.  When I first entered the Dáil in the 1970s less time was provided for Question Time and there were very few Oireachtas committees.  However, if a Member asked a straight question they received a straight answer.  At present there seems to be more evasion than anything else.  The system has been diluted to such an extent that the issue of parliamentary democracy is not often addressed.  I say this in honesty because it has been my experience.  People can engage in window-dressing but that does not mean that the system is being improved.</P>
      <P>I welcome the measure whereby a Member can ask to have a question answered in written form following a period of two weeks, despite the fact that it may already have been addressed.  Question Time in this House leaves much to be desired.  I am surprised that no other speakers have alluded to the need for something like &ldquo;Prime Minister's Question Time&rdquo; at Westminster where urgent issues can be addressed on the day they are raised. That is the essence of democracy and it has been avoided in this debate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The rota system for Question Time has only been in existence for five to six years.  In days gone by the Minister had to answer all questions to him on the Order Paper and that might have taken two or three days.  The figures being bandied about today do not give the true picture and I can give a graphic illustration as to why the average of £64 per question is ridiculous although it <Col N="1286" /> may be statistically correct.  On today's Order Paper there are 52 questions down to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, but on pages 1816-17 a question on thatched houses is repeated 12 times, one Irish question is repeated six times and another three times.  In reality there are only 34 questions to be answered.  You can blind people with statistics but they do not tell the full story.  The average cost per question is £64 but some questions would not cost 10p to answer.  However, it poses the question of how much it costs to send a letter from a Government Department.  Perhaps it costs £94 at the end of the day to respond to a letter because initially an acknowledgment is sent out and a few weeks later, if you are lucky&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister outlined how setting up committees has eliminated a great deal of the drudgery in the Dáil and how things are being done in a much more streamlined fashion.  I am not convinced that is true.  If we want to calculate the cost of answering a question we might also calculate the cost of the committees as many of the 21 committees are superfluous to the needs of the House and the public.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dermot Ahern is nodding because he was in the gods at one time, just as I am in the gods, because he probably told the truth to the party leader of the day.  When you tell the truth you do not get on committees, you do not get a place at Cabinet or in the second tier of Ministers but are sent to Coventry which, in Ireland, is the Government backbenches.  No side can throw stones because it applies to all but it is unfortunate.  It is a real erosion of parliamentary democracy and the right to free speech.  Members may speak freely but are sidelined as a result and that is undesirable.  It is politically negative but it is happening on all sides and the more goodies there are to go around the more it is happening.</P>
      <P>If we want to look at costs we should take account of the cost of committees and junkets, which are not too well publicised but are hogged by certain Members, principally the chairperson and his or her lackeys or friends.</P>

      <P>The system which operated 20 years ago was preferable &mdash; then there was transparency and accountability and if the Minister did not like a question on the Order Paper it did not mean that he could spend two hours waffling and reading reams of statistics to avoid answering it.  The rota system has been a failure.  If we need to spend three or four hours on Question Time or we need to come back on Fridays to get all the questions answered, so be it. Nobody should be let off the hook and everyone should have his say.  We should have written answers throughout the recess, particularly during the summer recess&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We have been talking about Dáil reform for many years.  Regardless of who has been in power what has taken place is really leading to abuse rather than reform of the Dáil.  I would like an honest and more transparent &mdash; that word is so misused it is becoming like a swear word and should not be used &mdash; approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with a great many of Deputy Deasy's points.  Our Whip also put forward the suggestion of Taoiseach's Question Time.  The suggestion has been around for a long time but it is a necessary reform.  When we were in Government the then Taoiseach accepted the idea of Taoiseach's Question Time but the Labour members of Government argued against it and they held sway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Among my papers on Dáil Reform I found a letter from a Minister of State who was pursuing matters on behalf of the Tánaiste when we were in Government urging the importance of changing the rules of the House along the lines <Col N="1289" /> we are now proposing to deal with situations where questions are not answered in substance because the information is not available.  It seems the Labour Party has changed its mind in that regard.</P>
    <P>If all of us remembered that our primary job is to represent the people, the procedures and practices in this House would be very different.  The House would be much more efficient and effective and would enjoy much more public confidence.  Confidence in this House and in politicians generally is something we spend much time discussing.</P>
    <P>Our role is to act as legislators and policy makers and, particularly in the context of today's debate, to scrutinise the actions of the Executive on behalf of the public.  I regret that the rules, procedures and precedents of this House prevent rather than help us to do that. Over the last few weeks we have seen a prime example of how ineffective our parliamentary system is when a Government effectively decides it will brazen something out.  We have seen how ineffective the system is in tackling a Minister who misleads the House when the Government decides to protect him. I suppose one should not be that surprised at the contempt which has been shown by this Government in the last few weeks, given the example of the Taoiseach earlier in the year when he misled the House and sent a Minister in to apologise for his misleading of the House, when the normal procedure is for the Member who misled the House to explain and apologise.  I said at the time that it showed contempt for this House but the matter has still not been rectified.</P>
    <P>A Minister has been allowed by this House, with the connivance of the Government, to tell the House when he should be answerable to it.  He has been allowed to decide, again with the connivance of this Government, whether he will attend a committee of the House and when.  That is lowering the standard of accountability in this House.  It is unacceptable to me not just as a member of the Opposition but as a Member of this House.  It is treating this House <Col N="1290" /> with contempt, and we will regret it if we do not do something about it.</P>
    <P>Today's motion deals specifically with the area of parliamentary questions, another area in which Members of this House should be able to make Ministers and Government accountable.  In theory, Ministers are accountable in the House through Question Time.  In practice it is different.  I welcome the proposed change as a step in the right direction, but it is only a tiny step.  In this age of computerisation there should be no earthly reason to have a repeat rule regarding oral or written questions.  As things have evolved, it is hardly worth our while tabling questions at Question Time.  Instead of providing at maximum information as it should, there is now evasion, the opposite of what was intended.  Deputy Deasy's suggestion that Question Time should continue until all the questions have been dealt with might overcome the difficulty.</P>
    <P>I am not saying this problem began last December.  It has been the trend for the last ten or 15 years, and it is time Members of this House called a halt to it.  I listened to many fine words and much empty rhetoric from this side of the House when I was in Government, but things have not improved.  Despite the many promises made by this Government on openness, transparency and accountability, words nobody likes to hear now, we have a Government that is paranoid about dispensing information, which has turned out to be more secretive than any of its predecessors and which has spent more time and money on investigating leaks of what, in many cases, was harmless or innocuous information than in investigating matters of serious public concern.</P>
    <P>In the fast few years we have heard much about the introduction of an information Act which has been touted as another giant leap forward for this House and the public.  It will be as ineffectual as many other measures introduced here unless it is accompanied by a change of culture within Government and within the Civil Service.  Legislation <Col N="1291" /> alone will not be sufficient to ensure a free flow of information if a Minister or a civil servant decides he does not want to let that information out.  It will require a complete change of attitude on the part of members of this Government, of civil servants and Members of this House.</P>
    <P>I neglected to say that I wish to share my remaining few minutes with Deputy Cullen.  First, however, I wish to make one final point regarding Question Time.  Over the last nine months questions on the environment happened to fall on Wednesdays.  We have only had the opportunity to ask priority questions on three occasions.  It is time we had a fixed time for questions on Wednesdays, as we have on Tuesdays.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>From what the Minister said, one would think this was the most open Government ever.  He said that he wanted the Dáil to be more businesslike and to be accountable and transparent, and touts this minuscule move on written questions as a major breakthrough. I do not know how he has the gall to put forward the notion that this is an accountable and open Government, given what we have witnessed in the last few weeks, particularly yesterday at the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies where we were voted down by the Government on a motion to allow natural justice to take place regarding people who had been abused under Dáil privilege by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry.  That Minister's use of Dáil privilege has been the greatest abuse ever perpetrated in this House by any Minister since the Dáil first sat. The Government parties in a Government that points to white collar crime and cosy cartels, combined to prevent a committee which is supposed to have new powers, from investigating these issues.  I have to take with a grain of salt the aspirations put forward in this document. The Government is very good at putting words on paper, but it is sadly <Col N="1292" /> lacking when it comes to real efficiency and accountability.</P>

      <P>As I have been a Dáil Member for only a short time, I cannot draw on great experience in this matter, but I bow to Deputy Cowen's considerable experience regarding the skill of Ministers in avoiding answering questions.  It is a little rich for Members to complain about what has taken place in the past few weeks when one considers the cost of the beef tribunal.  If questions had been answered at that time, the beef tribunal would not have been necessary.</P>
      <P>The motion deals with parliamentary questions, but there are many broader issues that need to be addressed and the sooner they are the better for everyone. While it is often suggested that more women should be encouraged to enter politics, the hours politicians work and the system that operates here would not even encourage female Members to remain in politics.  Also, we should not allow the media to dictate the way we carry out our business.</P>
      <P>There are many areas in need of examination.  For example, the voting system should be altered.  It is ridiculous that Members should have to leave committee meetings to vote in the House.  The system should be structured in a way that would allow votes to be taken at a particular time.  Also, if there is a quorum on the Order of Business, Members should not be allowed to call one during the remainder of the day.  In the run-up to a recent by-election ten quorums were called during one day's business.  Nobody gains from that.</P>

      <P>In regard to disorderly conduct, it is ridiculous that the Ceann Comhairle must call the Taoiseach or a Minister to name the disorderly Member following which a vote must be taken on whether he or she should be removed from the House.  Effectively we are asking for a vote of confidence in the Ceann Comhairle. If a Member is disorderly and refuses to leave the House when asked to do so by the Ceann Comhairle, the House should be suspended to allow the Member to be removed.  The present carry-on in that regard is nonsensical.</P>
      <P>Why is it necessary to hold Adjournment Debates at 12 midnight?  This has happened even in my short time as a Members and it certainly does not encourage women to enter politics.  I have heard female Ministers answering questions from female Members on the Adjournment at 12 midnight.  That should not happen.  Why is Private Members' Time taken so late in the evening?  Why can we not take busines then that would require fewer Members to be present?  Many reports are awaiting debate here, but they will have lost their relevance by the time they are debated.  An electronic display system should be introduced so that the public and Members know what is taking place in the House.  It is up to us to address all those issues and I will co-operate with the other Whips in the next year or two to improve the position.</P>

I tabled a simple <Col N="1294" /> question to the Minister for Justice last week asking if the sergeant in Bangor Erris would be replaced.

The cost to the State of maintaining the public service is enormous, but its officials do not respond to queries from the public or public representatives.  That is why tax-payers are annoyed with politicians.</P>
      <P>All Governments defer power to outside authorities.  This is the national Parliament, the institution to which we were elected to answer to the people. When parties get into Government they defer powers to authorities, such as the National Roads Authority, which is not answerable to anybody.  A few weeks ago I asked a Minister how many votes the National Roads Authority got in the last election or in what constituency its members stood.  That authority is not answerable to anybody.  While Deputy Cowen and the Minister of State, Deputy Higgins, may not agree, when Members become Ministers they go to Bunny Carr or Terry Prone to learn how not to answer questions.</P>

      <P>As a new Member I am disappointed with the way the Dáil operates.  I call for the introduction of legislation to bring back power to the House and to Ministers and to make those elected accountable. Setting up bodies, such as the National Roads Authority, merely takes powers from Members and if that is the hidden agenda perhaps the public should seek another form of democracy.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Government's move to introduce this motion. Having listened to the comments from Opposition Members, one would not believe they were ever in Government. They have all the answers when they are on that side of the House but none when they were on this side.  Perhaps they are now aware of the frustration felt by backbenchers.  Some of the Members on the Front Bench opposite will probably be Ministers at some future date, but having regard to the performance of the Government they will not see that day for a long time.</P>

      <P>I suspect it was when the shovel of a county council was <Col N="1296" /> stolen that the phrase &ldquo;what's everyone's business is nobody's business&rdquo; was coined.  It would appear that is certainly the case here.  Nothing illustrates this better than that every one of the 17 questions I put down to the Taoiseach yesterday on the role of the Attorney General's office in indemnifying the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications against any award of damages and costs arising out of allegations he made regarding cosy cartels in the semi-State sector and surveillance of him was disallowed.  Some of the typical reasons were: &ldquo;The Taoiseach is not officially responsible to the Dáil for legal advice sought or received from the Attorney General&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Taoiseach has no official responsibility to the Dáil in relation to this matter&rdquo;, &ldquo;The question contains argument&rdquo; and so on.  I suspect that if I had put down a question to the Taoiseach asking him how many frogs were in Ballymagash last spring the question would have been allowed and I would have been given an answer.  It appears that the more difficult the question, the less likelihood of a reply.</P>
      <P>In a rather remarkable exchange in the House yesterday the Taoiseach said that he engages in consultations with the Ceann Comhairle's office regarding questions.  When pressed on this matter he confirmed that he might even make &ldquo;representations&rdquo; to the Ceann Comhairle's office regarding questions.  It is quite improper of the Taoiseach's office to do that.  The only conclusion I can come to arising from the disgraceful scenario which I have graphically outlined is that the Government that promised transparency is the Government with an iron curtain locked and clamped down over it.  It would be laughable if it were not so serious.  It appears that rules made in this House and agreed by everybody are ignored when it is convenient for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The previous Government changed the <i>sub judice</i> rule, specifically providing that if High Court proceedings were initiated in an action, a Government Minister could still answer questions relating to that subject matter provided <Col N="1297" /> a notice of trial had not been served. However, because it did not suit the Minister, Deputy Lowry, to answer direct questions in the House he simply said that senior counsel advised him that since there were proceedings against him he should not answer at all.  It appears that the Taoiseach and Ministers make up the rules for themselves as they go along and ignore rules which are made by this House to ensure accountability.</P>
    <P>I strongly suggest that accountability, certainly in terms of the office of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, are not realistic options in this House.  One cannot hope to expect straight replies to direct questions. If a question is embarrassing or difficult or if it does not suit the Minister or the Taoiseach, they will say that the question does not apply to them, they do not have to answer it or they are not accountable for it, and they hope that ultimately it will go away.  In the final analysis it is left to the Fourth Estate to investigate whether a question unanswered deserved to be answered. The only people left to explain to the public precisely what happened are investigative journalists, and that is a sad indictment of democracy.</P>

      <P>I thank all the Members who contributed.  That many Members could not be accommodated indicates that examination of this subject is long overdue.  It is a matter that will be fundamentally and comprehensively addressed.  This is a narrow motion that afforded an opportunity to people to range across the entire area of parliamentary reform.  As the Taoiseach said, we will bring a document before the House shortly which will afford Members a very comprehensive input into what will eventually emerge as substantial reform of the structures of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject absolutely and utterly the condemnation of the motion as minimalist. I explained at the Whips' meeting and <Col N="1298" /> the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that it is only one narrow element of a very comprehensive document. Because a request was made by the Whips and by individual members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to bring in this motion as a stand-alone issue, we introduced it before introducing the document.</P>
    <P>I reject the allegation that the Government is secretive or tries to conceal matters.  In terms of openness and telling it how it is, on the Order of Business it has been generally recognised, particularly by people in the gallery, that the Taoiseach tells it exactly how it is.  If the Taoiseach is not in a position to answer a question he will not bluff or bluster; he will come back with the information the following day.</P>
    <P>On the Lowry affair and the fact that an allegation has been again hurled across this House, the Minister, Deputy Lowry was frank in regard to this matter. We had a long and rigorous session on a Tuesday when, from the Order of Business at 4.20 p.m. until 7 p.m., there was detailed cross-examination on the matter.</P>

      <P>It amuses me that three speakers on the other side of the House acknowledged that the genesis of this measure is the beef tribunal.  Wisdom in hindsight is great.  Had questions been answered on the day, the taxing <Col N="1299" /> master would not have to determine whether the £35 million in legal costs can be reduced so that the taxpayer will be saved that expense.  It is in that context this measure was introduced.</P>
      <P>The allegations by Deputy O'Donnell that this is a minimalist approach is rich coming from the great crusaders, the champions of change and reform, the people who will utterly change the system. The Progressive Democrats were in Government as well as in opposition but it changed absolutely nothing. Today we heard not a single example from Deputy O'Donnell of her allegations of lack of accountibility in this House.  The Deputy's performance is particularly difficult to take in view of the fact that I cannot recall a single suggestion from the Progressive Democrats on Dáil reform other than that we relax the rule governing oral parliamentary questions.</P>
      <P>It is obvious the Progressive Democrats have lost a considerable number of their original heroes and that with depleted resources the collective brains of the party have been badly diminished &mdash; they recently lost Pat Cox MEP, Deputy Cullen and Stephen O'Byrnes. However, that does not afford them the opportunity of ducking their responsibility to put forward constructive ideas on Dáil reform.  They have done absolutely nothing in this regard.  They seem to be seeking spontaneity in the House &mdash; many of us would like that &mdash; but considering the performance of some members of the Progressive Democratsl, what they would like to do is turn the House into a parliamentary version of the Muppet Show.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Deputy O'Dea's point that answers to questions are carefully crafted pieces of misinformation or evasion &mdash; this has been referred to time <Col N="1300" /> and again by the other side of the House &mdash; the whole purpose of a question is to elicit information and find out the truth, and there is no compulsion whatever by the Chair to try to protect any Member who is less than truthful.  It is up to each Deputy to find out the truth and to pursue a matter until such time as he gets the truth.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that the system is perfect, but we are committed to Dáil reform and we will deliver on that.  In the short-term we should not disparage the work of the House.  We have the Order of Business &mdash; the Ceann Comhairle is liberal in that regard &mdash; and Standing Order 30. We have Private Notice Questions, Private Members' time and an Adjournment debate during which four matters may be raised.  A breakdown of Dáil time yesterday reveals that the Government had two hours 40 minutes and the Opposition four hours.  There is a fairly definite balance in favour of making the Opposition relevant by giving it an input into parliamentary procedure and ensuring there is balance in the implementation of the procedures of the House.</P>
      <P>What I am proposing today is not purported to be a fundamental reform of Dáil procedures, it is a minor stand alone issue which Opposition Whips want addressed.  I compliment Fianna Fáil for introducing its reform document and certain elements of it will be reflected in the document I will produce.  This is not the end, it is the beginning.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage a new section, section 92, was inserted in the Bill providing for the preservation and availability for public inspection of harbour records and archives.  Section 92 (9) provides that a person shall not conceal, damage or destroy archives held in accordance with the section and shall not remove, publish or reproduce the whole or any part of such archives without the written consent of the company or harbour authority concerned.  Subsection (10) of the same section states that anyone who contravenes the provisions of subsection (9) will be guilty of an offence.  This means that section 6 must now be amended by the inclusion therein of a reference to this new section.  The amendment, therefore, is consequential to the insertion of section 92 on Committee Stage.  The amendment provides that a person guilty of an offence under section 92 (10) shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £1,500 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or both.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage Deputy Michael Smith tabled similar amendments.  The reference to the heritage of a harbour has been inserted at the request of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. On Committee Stage it was agreed that Deputy Smith's amendments would be considered for Report Stage.  I am happy I am now in a position to put forward amendments on similar lines to those proposed by Deputy Smith and which also take on board the wishes of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that the promotion of leisure activities and the protection of the environment and heritage are enshrined in the objectives and general duties of the new harbour companies.  Amendment No. 4 creates the freedom for ports to develop recreational facilities if they so desire.  It is my policy, and that of the Department, to encourage such development.  The purpose of amendment No. 6 is to require the port companies to have due regard to the amenity, environmental and heritage consequences of their operations.</P>

        <i>(Wexford)</i>
        <b>:</b> I thank the Minister for accepting the suggestions made by Deputy Smith on Committee Stage.  It is important that ports have an <Col N="1305" /> opportunity of developing in the area of marine leisure activities, particularly with respect to tourism development.  It is appropriate that environmental and amenity operations are protected and enhanced.  I also welcome the suggestion by the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht that heritage is included.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister was wise to include these activities in the Bill.  As we all know, the activities in many estuaries have broadened substantially in the past few years.  The areas of leisure, heritage and tourism offer much potential and should be developed, particularly in small communities where the possibility for the creation of jobs exists along river shores with increased activity in the tourism and leisure area.</P>
      <P>This raises another question concerning the volume of activity on many of our rivers and estuaries including bulk, cargo and container shipping as well as general fishing activities by small trawlers and individuals and the growth in leisure activities.  While it is important that these areas are covered in the Bill, it is important also that the question of safety on our rivers and estuaries is addressed.  There is little point in including these activities in legislation if we do not ensure they occur in an orderly manner.  I am thinking in particular of the accident involving a tug recently on the River Suir which highlighted the volume of activities on the river and the lack of rescue services on many rivers throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Discussions with many people from varied interest groups revealed the large number of activities on our rivers and the fact that we do not have sufficient rescue services on rivers and estuaries. We must ensure those services are put in place because life is precious and trying to provide a river rescue service from, say, the main lifeboat facilities is not sufficient because they have a particular job to do.  I raise the matter in the context of this amendment because the Minister should be alerted to this problem.  The question of river rescue <Col N="1306" /> services must be addressed and funding must be made available so that at least skeleton services are provided on many of our rivers and estuaries.</P>

      <P>In page 16, line 14, after &ldquo;ship&rdquo; to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;, unless the vessel makes any use of the facilities including navigational, buoys and lights or any service available in the other harbour; and in such instances the rates chargeable for the use of such facilities or services shall be those being charged immediately before the enactment of the Harbours Act, 1995 in respect of vessels so passing through such limits, or such rates as may be determined by the port company from time to time&rdquo;. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1307" /> This amendment arose from suggestions to the effect that in Waterford, for example, the port authorities were not in a position to levy charges on vessels passing through the port on their way to New Ross.  That was ludicrous because certain facilities are provided by Waterford Port which are availed of by vessels passing through the port on their way to New Ross.  The intention of the Bill as originally drafted was to replicate that contained in the 1946 Harbours Act but, unfortunately, it did not do that.</P>
    <P>Significant funds are expended on, for instance, the provision of local lights, buoys, etc.  I do not know the exact figures but large amounts of money are expended and it is right that if someone is availing of those facilities, they should pay for them.  The argument that these vessels are only passing through the port and not using the facilities is similar to my saying I should not have to pay the toll going across a motorway on the outskirts of Dublin on my way from Waterford to Belfast because I am only passing through Dublin.  I note the Minister tabled a somewhat similar amendment but I hope he will be in a position to accept my amendment.</P>

      <P>Following the Committee Stage debate, I am glad the Minister of State has moved to clarify the position. Much discussion took place on this matter and the Minister recognised that the original amendment was lacking in clarity and required further amending.  I am glad the Minister's amendment addresses the questions raised at that time.  The reality is that commercial <Col N="1308" /> operations must live in a commercial world.  Charges must be imposed to support the commerciality of businesses operating in all sectors, not least those involved in shipping and activities that occur on rivers.</P>
      <P>Traffic traversing the port of Waterford on its way to the port of New Ross does not negate the fact that these facilities must be provided by the port of Waterford in the Suir Estuary.  It is only right, therefore, that ships plying their trade through those areas are entitled to use those facilities but, equally, the port authority is entitled to charge for those facilities, otherwise we would negate the meaning of commercial operation.  The Minister in his amendment has accepted that reality bearing in mind the discussion we had on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment tabled by Deputy Kenneally and I congratulate the Minister on his amendment. Amendment No. 8 refers to the Shannon and Foynes port companies so I think we are entitled to refer to the New Ross and Waterford port companies. If boats are proceeding to New Ross through an area administered by the Waterford Port Company, they should have to pay for the services provided. That is the objective of these two amendments which are perfectly logical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole question of pilotage on that stretch of water must be clarified and it must be made clear that any boat proceeding up the River Suir, whether to Waterford or New Ross harbours, must have a pilot on board.  We have reason to believe that boats proceeding through the Waterford Harbour area to the port of New Ross are attempting to avoid paying pilotage dues.  I would like the Minister of State to clarify the position in that regard because a major problem arose on 16 October when the ship <i>Marwan</i> went aground at Cheekpoint, primarily because there was no pilot aboard.  Ships travelling to New Ross are taking a chance by going from Dunmore East or from the Hook as far as Cheekpoint without a pilot.  That is a serious contravention of the laws of the <Col N="1309" /> sea.  There has already been an accident but more serious incidents could occur in future if the legislation is not clarified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government believes it is vital to the ultimate success of the peace process that we be seen to act in a way which includes, and is based on parity between, all the Northern Ireland parties that we need to have at round table talks.  Consistent with this inclusive approach, the Government has pursued a general policy of holding bilateral meetings with each of the individual parties.  The problem with meetings to which some parties have been invited but not others is that misunderstandings, suspicion, and a sense of exclusion have arisen among the parties not invited to such meetings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's approach of favouring bilateral meetings at this stage in the process, for the reasons I have just outlined, has been successful, in that we have now been able to arrange discussions with a number of Northern parties who had not previously been willing to formally meet any Irish Government. This is very important in that it is now fully accepted that the agreement of the people represented by all these parties <Col N="1310" /> is essential to any lasting settlement.  It was in this context that we made our decision on John Hume's recent request, received at short notice, for a meeting between the Government, the SDLP and Sinn Féin.  Both parties were offered individual meetings on the same day.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise, further, that the Government is continuing to work very closely on an almost daily basis with both those parties, and with others as well, towards our ultimate objective of political agreement, achieved through negotiation and underpinned by consent. Meetings with two or more selected parties can take place in the future if the timing and circumstances are judged by the Government to be right, and if clear reasons have been adduced in advance as to why a particular matter cannot be effectively handled bilaterally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept that it was the meeting between his predecessor, John Hume and Gerry Adams on 6 September, 1994 that sealed the peace and helped to underpin the IRA ceasefire at the time?  Is the Taoiseach aware there is great anger within the SDLP at this refusal of a meeting and that it has shaken the confidence of Northern Nationalists in the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Anglo-Irish agreement this Government has a particular responsibility to concern itself with the interests of Northern Nationalists. It is important from the point of view of Nationalists that we get all-inclusive talks started on a round table basis at an early date.  It is very important that all of the parties are willing to come to those talks.  There are considerable difficulties in terms of trust, to be overcome in ensuring that all of the parties come.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1311" /> It is particularly important from the point of view of Nationalists in Northern Ireland that an agreement can be reached with Unionists about a fair system of Government which recognises parity of esteem between the two communities. That can only happen if the Unionists as well as the Nationalists are willing to come to the same table to reach an agreement.  My concern in arranging meetings has been to ensure that both communities in Northern Ireland are confident in the Government, that they feel it is fair to them and that there is no sense that one group of parties can get privileges that another group of parties cannot get.</P>
    <P>We know from experience that there is a danger of grave misunderstanding when people are not involved in a meeting to which others have been invited. Anybody who thinks about his own daily life knows if invitations are issued to some people and not others there is liable to be considerable and disproportionate misunderstanding on the part of those who are not invited. However, if I am satisfied that the circumstances are right and an adequate reason is indicated why a particular matter needs to be dealt with, not on a bilateral basis but by two parties meeting together with me, I will consider such a request.</P>
    <P>In this instance the request for this meeting was only brought to my attention 24 hours before the proposed time of the meeting.  Given the responsibilities a Government has and the fact that we must be concerned about the impact of such meetings on others who would not be represented at them, we need a little more time and preparation to consider requests of that nature and avoid the sort of misunderstanding that occurred the last time such a meeting was held.  I can quote some of the comments made on that occasion and they cannot be dismissed.  The leader of the Alliance Party was very concerned about a meeting which took place on this basis to which he was not invited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has overall responsibility for many matters but he is leader of nationalist Ireland and that does not mean closing his door to leaders of parties in Northern Ireland who democratically represent nationalist Ireland, particularly John Hume.  I am sure the Taoiseach is aware of the great disquiet caused by his attitude which he is now attempting to explain. It is reflected today in a critical editorial in the <i>Irish News.</i> It describes the loose nationalist consensus as the greatest protection unionism has against a return to violence.  That is a fair point.  Some people try to use the pan-nationalist front to be critical.  Surely the other point of view is that what we have achieved in the last two years is the success of a united nationalist grouping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that violence can come from either quarter.  It is very important that we are seen to be fair.  Of course I have a very important concern to ensure that what would be described as broadly nationalist parties in Northern Ireland are given access all the time.  Discussions take place between my Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Sinn Féin on an ongoing basis, even this very day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the difficulty with meetings to which certain parties have been invited is that the parties which have not been invited believe there is something going on about which they have not been told and that there is some reason for excluding them.  For example, three of the parties in the Forum which are active in Northern Ireland are not represented by either Sinn Féin or the SDLP, that is the Alliance Party, Democratic Left and The Workers' Party who have representatives in Northern Ireland.  The Alliance Party and The Workers' Party have a reasonable case for saying they have taken a decision to come to the Forum and asking why they should be excluded from meetings in which other parties have been included. They may not have many substantial bases for their concerns but as we know <Col N="1313" /> there is a serious risk of misunderstanding. My concern is to ensure that we have all-inclusive talks with everybody at the table.  The Government must, therefore, be able to make judgments as to what is best at a particular time.  In the past &mdash; I expect this will also be the case in the future &mdash; I have had joint meetings with John Hume and Gerry Adams.  In looking at the overall situation in consultation with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Social Welfare, I, as Taoiseach, will have to decide whether particular meetings at particular times are helpful.</P>

      <P>What were the reasons advanced by the two leaders for a joint meeting with the Government?  Did they reject the idea of separate meetings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that any reasons were advanced at the time of the request as to why a joint rather than a bilateral meeting was necessary. It was subsequently suggested to me after the decision had been taken and the time for the meeting had passed that it was intended to convey a proposal to me.  I understand that that proposal had previously been conveyed to us through official channels.  We offered a meeting to the SDLP at 8.30 a.m. that morning and one to Sinn Féin at 10 a.m. However, they chose for whatever reasons not to take up those invitations even though I was available to meet them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Government pursuing a different strategy from the one being pursued by John Hume and Gerry Adams?  Is this not the reason they wanted a meeting with the Taoiseach?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is pursuing a strategy of seeking agreement based on dealing with the principal obstacles to all-inclusive talks, one of which is the decommissioning of arms.  There is concern about the need to reach a formula which will deal with <Col N="1314" /> that matter.  The Deputy will not be surprised to learn that my position and that of any elected Government on para-military arms is not the same as that of Sinn Féin.  The Government believes &mdash; I think the previous Government shared our view &mdash; that the only proper authority for the holding of arms in this State is the Government.  Obviously our position on this issue is not identical to that of Sinn Féin.  However, this is not to say that we are not seeking to take into account the very real concerns of the Nationalist community in regard to their defence in extreme situations and their anxiety to be reassured that other aspects in regard to demilitarisation of the situation in Northern Ireland are being dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there a difference between John Hume's strategy in regard to this matter and the Irish Government's strategy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is appropriate to set out the Government's strategy on this matter, which I do regularly in the House and will continue to do.  I believe that, like the Irish Government, John Hume is trying to find a solution to the present difficulties, particularly in regard to the issue of arms.  He has sought to put forward various formulae which would be acceptable to Sinn Féin, the British Government and, in the long run, the Unionist community in Northern Ireland who also need to be at the table.  This is not an easy task and no one party or individual in the process has it in their gift to solve the problem. Everybody must be willing to give some ground if we are to solve the problem. For example, if an international body dealing with the decommissioning of arms is to have a useful function then the people associated with organisations which hold arms must be able to put forward their views to it, speak on their behalf and give undertakings on their behalf.  If the ability to enter into engagements is not present there is a risk that the body will engage only in a <Col N="1315" /> paper exercise which will not deal with the substance of the fears which exist.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that John Hume and Gerry Adams wanted a joint meeting because they had worked on joint proposals, as they have done over the past few years?  If he is concerned about adverse reaction from the Alliance Party and Unionist parties, will the Taoiseach make arrangements to brief these parties either before or after a meeting?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that in the case of joint meetings of this nature it is important to talk in advance with those parties which are excluded and which have a legitimate interest in what is being discussed.  However, it is difficult to do that if one gets only 24 hour's notice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows well that is too late afterwards given that in the present situation people react immediately to what they hear on the media and there is little point in ringing them up the following day if they have issued a statement based on misunderstanding. One of my concerns is to ensure that everyone understands what is going on before they read about it in the papers.  If some parties are invited to a meeting while others are not it is <Col N="1316" /> reasonable to have an adequate opportunity to say what will be discussed.  To do this one must know what will be discussed and to be in a position in advance to tell them there is nothing about which they should be concerned in that context.  Given the timing of this request and the fact that the meeting was specified for a particular day, unfortunately it was not possible for the sort of prudent preparation of the other parties which would not be invited, as suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach reconsider his use of the word &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; when describing access by the leader of Nationalist thinking in Northern Ireland, John Hume &mdash; he has had access to successive Governments over the past 25 years &mdash; to him and the Government?  Does he agree that a joint meeting was requested because the Government has been drifting along for the past two months since the failed summit and is waiting for President Clinton's visit in the hope that something will turn up on the day?  It is fundamental to the peace process and moving forward that the Government gives clear signals and not one from Merrion Street, another one from Iveagh House and a different one from Democratic Left.  The Taoiseach said he would agree to a joint meeting if clear reasons could be given for it.  There is no clear reason for agreeing to a joint meeting at this time than the delay in the peace process. I ask the Taoiseach&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I offered to meet Mr. John Hume on the day specified by him and I was available to meet him in my office at the time.  However, he was unable to come because of illness.  I used the term &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; solely to describe the idea that one set of parties would be allowed to participate in joint meetings while others would not.  I have no problem with the idea that it would be normal for parties to come to joint meetings in twos and threes, but we have not yet reached that stage.  It would be better to work on a bilateral basis initially. I used the term &ldquo;privilege&rdquo; in that limited sense only.  If there is a general view that we should have joint meetings with all the parties, that is fine.  After all, we meet all the parties together at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is related to the same subject matter.  We are trying to reach the position where a twin track approach is adopted whereby a body will be set up to deal with the arms issue and, in parallel with this, the process of preparatory discussions is intensified with a target date being set for all-party talks.  It is important that all-party talks on an inclusive basis are held at the earliest possible moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was concerned not to do anything that would reduce the likelihood, for example, of the Unionists coming to round table talks at the outset.  It is important that we do everything possible to get them there as one will only be able to give Nationalists the assurance they need if the Unionists are present.  At the end of the day the people who can best assure Nationalists of their rights and security are the Unionists in Northern Ireland and the people who can best assure Unionists of <Col N="1319" /> their rights and security are the Nationalists in Northern Ireland, not the British Government.  We, therefore, have to do everything possible to get those two groups together around the same table.</P>
    <P>As leader of the Irish Government, I will do everything possible in an even-handed way to ensure that all the parties have the necessary confidence to be at all-party talks on day one.  I have to have the right to be able to say that I do not think a meeting in a particular format would be helpful on a particular day in particular circumstances. Equally, I will not rule out the possibility of holding such meetings.  As Deputy Ahern indicated, in the past a joint meeting of that nature was necessary and important, but it was not evident to me that, on balance, such a meeting would have been helpful at the particular time it was sought on this occasion.  This does not mean that in a few weeks' time a joint meeting might not serve a useful purpose.  That is something we will judge pragmatically in the light of circumstances prevailing at the time&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Significant progress was made, but there is always the problem in presenting the contents of a particular meeting at a press conference immediately afterwards that tonal factors can be given greater prominence than substantial matters.  A very good meeting took place between the Tánaiste and the Secretary of State at which substantial progress was made.  A meeting is also taking place today between officials of the two Administrations to advance matters further.  I <Col N="1321" /> expect that this will build on the work done by the Tánaiste at his meeting with the Secretary of State.</P>
      <P>On the question of an elected assembly, this proposal has been made by the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party in different forms.  There has not been any substantial discussion of the proposal by either of those two parties with the Irish Government at this juncture.  I am aware that serious reservations have been expressed on the Nationalist side in Northern Ireland.  That is, obviously, an important concern in regard to the proposal.  I have, however, suggested that parties should look as constructively as they can at all proposals put forward by all other parties rather than adopt a negative approach.</P>
      <P>I know there have been very successful and useful discussions between the SDLP and the Unionists on economic matters, but these have not extended to political issues, such as the one referred to in the Deputy's question.  It would be useful if that important political channel for discussion was opened between the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists.  It would put another link in place to get us to the all-inclusive round table discussions at which we are aiming.</P>

      <P>I put it to the Taoiseach that if for no other reason than that someone of the stature of Mr. John Hume asked for a joint meeting, the Taoiseach should have had a joint meeting. Mr. Hume has achieved so much since 1988 in relation to the peace process that the Taoiseach should have trusted Mr. Hume's judgment on it.</P>

      <P>This Government has a responsibility to the entire community in Northern Ireland to ensure everything is done to get us to all-party round table talks.  We have to make an independent judgment as to the format or arrangement for particular meetings and how those meetings might be construed. This Government, as did its predecessors from time to time, has to <Col N="1322" /> make an independent judgment on matters of this nature.  We will continue to do so.  That is not to say we do not place a very high value on any advice proffered by Mr. John Hume nor that we are not very conscious of the huge debt owed to him for the work he has done to date.</P>
      <P>I am happy to be able to tell the House that I will visit Mr. Hume in Derry later this week with a view to having further discussions with him.</P>

      <P>There is almost daily contact between the Irish Government and the Nationalist parties in Northern Ireland.  There were meetings today involving Sinn Féin.  I believe there were discussions yesterday, the day before and the day before that too.  That will continue to be the case.  We have had a 25 year gap between a meeting between a Taoiseach and a leader of the Ulster Unionist Party.  I am proud to be the first Taoiseach in 25 years who was able to meet the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, something which I am sure my predecessors would have wished to have done but were unable to do, perhaps, due to various circumstances beyond <Col N="1323" /> their control.  I am happy to have achieved it.  It is very important that we should continue to build on that growing understanding with both communities in Northern Ireland.  A settlement can only be reached if both communities trust the Irish Government.  That is important.  Obviously, much work has to be done in respect of both communities in terms of building trust.  I would like to see more intense contact on an official level between Unionist parties and the Irish Government.  The ice has now been broken by the meetings with three of the four Unionist parties which is a major step forward.  I hope I will be able to report to the Deputy the next time he tables a question on this matter, that there has been intensified discussion.</P>
      <P>I recognise that we have an important responsibility under the Anglo-Irish Agreement to have a special concern for the interests of Nationalist parties in Northern Ireland and Nationalist people there.  That is a responsibility which we take very seriously but we must make an independent judgment as a Government as to the best way to give expression to that.  That is a responsibility which rests on the shoulders of Government, which cannot be delegated to any other parties outside this House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of issues which would need to be looked <Col N="1324" /> at in regard to any approach to finding a solution.  There has to be clarity.  Those meeting with the international body who have associations with people who hold arms are able to speak about arms in a meaningful way.  It is also important that we have an understanding about the terms of reference of the body.</P>
      <P>It is also very important that we have a basis established in terms of trust to ensure all the people will turn up if a date for talks is set.  There is a risk that there could be quite a substantial setback if talks are called for a particular day and, for whatever reason, an important segment of public opinion in Northern Ireland is not represented on that day.  It is very important in formulating any proposal for a date that it is likely &mdash; one may not necessarily have absolute guarantees but one must be satisfied &mdash; that all the relevant people will turn up.  Everything that can be done by the Irish Government and, indeed, other parties in this House should be done to ensure all the parties feel sufficiently secure in regard to this Government's commitment to parity of esteem, <i>vis-á-vis</i> both communities in Northern Ireland, that they will feel confident to turn up at talks of which the Irish Government may be a joint sponsor.</P>

We are not talking about invitations here, we are talking about a request from the leader of the nationalist party, Mr. John Hume, and from Mr. Gerry Adams to come to see the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach referred to the particular responsibility the Government has under the Anglo-Irish Agreement. Does the Taoiseach realise the risk he is running of alienating the Nationalists in the North in refusing to meet Mr. Hume, when he requested it &mdash; something which has not happened in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is he aware of the concern of many <Col N="1325" /> Nationalists that the Government may sell them out, in the light of statements made by the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, which are at variance with other statements coming from the Government?</P>

There was also concern expressed among the Unionist community who felt that because a meeting was being arranged on this basis, there was something happening which they were not being told about.

      <P>The Deputy referred to the emotive phrase &ldquo;dividing the Nationalists&rdquo; which no doubt has a certain appeal to many people.  I wish to make my objective clear: it is to unite sufficiently the Unionists and Nationalists so that they all come to the same talks in the same room at the same time. If there is to be that degree of unity between Nationalists and Unionists in Northern Ireland both must feel that the Irish Government has a concern for their interests.  They must not feel that one group is in a position where its concerns are of lesser importance.  If you invite some people and do not invite others there is a risk of misunderstandings. I do not mean to use a banal example but if social invitations are issued to a particular category of people and half the people in the category are invited those who are not invited will feel there is a reason for excluding them.</P>

      <P>I do not believe there is any confusion of the kind the Deputy seeks to portray.  Progress in reaching an accommodation on this issue is slow but steady.  It is important to recognise that <Col N="1328" /> the distrust in regard to arms goes very deep in Northern Ireland.  The distrust in the Unionist community, which has been the victim of IRA arms, is extremely deep.  Equally, the distrust in the Nationalist community remembering what happened in 1969 and on previous occasions in the history of Ulster is very deep.  Anyone who tries to pretend that getting over that level of distrust and getting people around the same table will be easy is not living in the real world.  It is extremely difficult to overcome the legacy of violence and get people to sit down together.  We are seeking a formula to deal with the arms question that will be fair and acceptable to all and, while it may not solve all the problems relating to arms, at least it may get them into the process of discussion. Anyone who suggests it can be solved by a simple act of political will or by setting a date&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I understand our GDP is 73 per cent of the EU average and is catching up quickly.  This has clear implications for our eligibility for structural funding and EU resource transfers in the future.  Will the Minister state if the economic accounts currently under review and which will be prepared by the ERSI will establish regional imbalances in GDP for that or any other purpose that might be required by the Government?</P>

      <P>Deputy Killeen is quite right to question the impact of regional accounts on overall national figures.  No doubt he has in mind the next tranche of Structural Funds to be allocated on a regional basis.  In the last round of negotiations Structural Funds were allocated to regions whose GDP <i>per capita</i> was less than 75 per cent of the Community average.  As a whole, Ireland qualified under that criterion and was considered as one region for Structural Funds allocation purposes. Our GDP <i>per capita</i> is now approximately 81 per cent of the Community average so that, if the 75 per cent criterion were to be applied at the next round, Ireland as a whole would not qualify, hence the need to develop regional GDPs.  The ESRI is developing a system of compiling regional accounts for the eight regional authority areas nationwide.  Of course the 75 per cent criterion may be renegotiated upwards in the course of the next round of Structural Funds allocations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no such plans.  I do not believe it would serve any useful purpose to proceed as suggested by the Deputy in his question, as the Government's Famine commemoration programme I launched earlier this year is the most appropriate way of commemorating the greatest tragedy of modern Irish history.  As Members will be aware, we had a full day's discussion on the Government's programme on Thursday week.  I should like to thank Deputy Ahern for his kind remarks on that occasion and the House generally.  It was a most interesting, fulfilling debate all round, of which we should have more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I might restate those sentiments in that the strong support from this side of the House was for the work undertaken initially by Deputy Tom Kitt and carried through successfully by the Minister of State, Deputy Avril Doyle, on the Government's Famine commemoration programme in which the nation overall is participating. There has been some criticism since I made those remarks in the debate, to the effect that nobody who had lived through that horrific period would still be living.  While being aware that the Queen's apology to the Maoris, in her capacity as monarch of that country, will be given on the advice of the New Zealand Government, will the Minister of State agree that a little humility on the part of the British Administration in their attitude to this country &mdash; not very evident over recent months &mdash; would greatly assist the present process of reconciliation?  As the Minister will be aware from what I said in our earlier debate on the Great Famine, I was thinking more along the lines of the British expressing their sympathy.  Since the Maoris will receive the Queen's sympathy, in her capacity as monarch of that country, would the Minister of State consider such would not appear to be beyond the bounds of the British Administration in our case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1334" />
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Even though I am not sure what relevance it has to our position in commemorating the Great Famine, I should point out that neither the Queen, Crown nor British Government is apologising to the Maoris.  I have a note from the Deputy High Commissioner for New Zealand in London before me confirming that the relevant New Zealand Act of Parliament, which awaits the signature of the Crown, will restore some land to the Maoris and deals with this issue.  The New Zealand Government is apologising to the Maoris, not the Crown or the British Administration.  That is really an extraneous issue which I should place on the record.</P>
      <P>Frankly, as a nation, I consider we have too much self-respect and dignity to demand an apology, or an expression of sympathy or regret; to do so would merely devalue the issue.  The greatest way we can commemorate the lost generation of the Famine is not by proceeeding, as Deputy Ahern suggests, but rather to ensure that full reconciliation, between both traditions, is achieved within all parts of this island. After all, we are an independent, sovereign State.</P>
      <P>Ironically, the great tragedy of the Famine has speeded up our separateness from Britain and our continued, firm commitment to self-determination. We have taken our place among the nations of the world, we sit around the European table, as full and equal members with the other 14 members states.  I do not consider the dignity of this nation should be put into question by asking or demanding any such apology or expression of sympathy.  The facts speak for themselves.  We will commemorate the horrors of our Famine, remember the tragedy of those who died, and those who had to leave our shores, in a dignified manner.  We will tell the story as it was without any sanitisation; the facts will speak for themselves.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State will be aware that the Irish community <Col N="1335" /> in the United States of America, in great numbers, are also commemorating the Famine and taking an extraordinary interest in our commemorations.  I am very interested in the debate there.  I assume the Minister saw the headlines on this issue in American papers &mdash; it received a fair amount of coverage here, not always agreeing with what was stated in this House.  If the Minister of State has not seen them, I can furnish her with cuttings of such articles.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a criticism of the overall debate rather than anything I or any other Member said.  Would the Minister of State consider it fitting, during this commemorative period, to speak on behalf of Irish people at home and abroad, who seek some recognition of what they believe to have been a grave historical wrong, which is the point being put forward across the United States and in Australia on the part of the Irish communities there joining us in commemorating those events? Will she agree that is not an unreasonable request?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a slightly different point, although I am at one with what the Deputy said.  As chairperson of the Government's Great Famine commemorative committee, I will speak out quite clearly about the great historic wrong, about the hopelessly inadequate response of the alien Administration of the time to the failure of the potato crop which resulted in starvation in the midst of plenty.  There need have been no famine, it was not the lack of potatoes but rather the lack of substitute food and of an adequate response on the part of the alien authorities at the time which resulted in the starvation, famine, destitution and emigration.  I have no difficulty in stating that as it was.  Neither have a I any difficulty in stating that the alien Administration at the time was <Col N="1336" /> physically and psychologically removed from our people and did not respond &mdash; with the wisdom of hindsight 150 years later &mdash; as we would have wished today. That will be stated; the Taoiseach has said it.  I have said it, Members on all sides of this House have made that fact quite clear but that is not quite what Deputy Ahern is asking today.  I will not go down the road, cap in hand, representing this nation, with any lack of respect, demanding an apology from anyone.  The facts will speak for themselves. As chairperson of the Government's Famine commemoration committee, I will be delighted to represent the views of the overall global Irishness which resulted in large measure from the emigration that began and continued post-Famine.  I will express their views, concerns, regret, anger and resentment but, as a sovereign nation with self respect, we will not go cap in hand requesting any such apology.</P>

There have also been talks of a visit to the US but nothing specific has been organised.</P>
      <P>The Government's programme continues officially until the middle of 1997. I expect to have many opportunities, other than those mentioned, to state the view of Irish people at home and abroad on this issue.  It can be an extremely healing and helpful part of the present reconciliation process to clearly state the facts.  It is only by stating those facts that we can move forward, that the healing process can begin and that we can begin to recognise the sins of commission and omission of decades and centuries of injustice.  That is the way we should best commemorate the lost generations of the Famine and I have no difficulty in doing so on behalf of the Irish people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 11, 14 and 31 together.  Deputy Woods's Question refers to the establishment of a commissioner for children in advance of the forthcoming referendum.  I presume he is talking specifically about the proposal contained in the Fianna Fáil policy document on children which envisages that a commissioner for children would be attached to the courts who would be responsible for highlighting to parents the needs of children in marriage breakdown/divorce situations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Deputy appreciates that the welfare of children is a matter of supreme importance for this Government. That is one of the reasons we have set up a commission on the family <Col N="1339" /> to make recommendations on how families can best be facilitated in the support and development of their individual members.  It is also the reason the constitutional amendment is framed precisely in the way it is.</P>
    <P>When the Deputy's party published its policy document I welcomed it and indicated that the recommendations it contained would be examined carefully and in detail in my Department.  That remains the position and I am happy to repeat the undertaking in that matter which I have given.</P>
    <P>However, we must remember that there is already in existence a comprehensive charter of rights and protections for children consisting of the legal and administrative measures which have been put in place over the years.  Furthermore, the consultation paper on family courts, published by the Law Reform Commission, puts particular emphasis on the need to give priority to the interests of dependent children and on the importance of avoiding any damage or distress to them.  When the final report becomes available, it will be considered by the Government and the appropriate decisions will be taken on foot of it.  While a commissioner on children does not feature specifically as one of those recommendations, it is a proposal which could be considered in that context.</P>
    <P>On the question of pre-nuptial agreements, existing separation legislation provides that, in relation to property adjustment orders, a court may vary for the benefit of either spouse or for a dependent family member any ante-nuptial or post-nuptial settlement made on the spouses.  It is my intention that equivalent provision would apply in the context of divorce.</P>
    <P>Turning to those Questions tabled by Deputy Callely, the number of times which a person might be able to remarry if the divorce referendum is successful is an issue which has been raised in the context of the recent debate on the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution (No. 2) Bill, 1995.  That issue was <Col N="1340" /> also considered in the context of the preparation of the White Paper on Marital Breakdown where the view was taken that any attempt to restrict the right to remarry might run counter to the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>In so far as outstanding issues in relation to divorce are concerned, I would point out that the Government only brought forward its proposal to amend the Constitution to allow for a divorce jurisdiction here because it was confident that the necessary legislative and administrative measures were already in place to ensure that such a jurisdiction could be operated efficiently and in a way that was likely to be fair to all parties.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will know, over the past decade there has been a large volume of legislation in the family law area which is designed to support the family, both materially and otherwise.  In September, I published the draft Family Law (Divorce) Bill which clearly spells out the detailed provisions which would apply if divorce is introduced here. Counselling and mediation services are in place which will assist couples who wish to obtain guidance in resolving differences in their marriages or who are willing to enter into negotiations on separation agreements.  Legal aid will be available to individuals seeking a divorce in the same way as it is now available to persons seeking a judicial separation. The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1995 ensures that a divorced person will not be at a loss in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements.  Detailed taxation provisions have been devised which, in essence, will mean that divorced couples will be treated the same way for income tax purposes as separated couples.  Similarly, property transfers between former spouses on foot of a court order governing a divorce settlement will be exempted from all capital taxes.</P>
    <P>Taken together, we have in place a comprehensive package which will assist those seeking a divorce, should the referendum be carried.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand.  People are asking whether the integrity of a farm, for example, can be protected in a pre-nuptial agreement.  I have my own views on what the situation might be. However, the Minister can supply the definitive answer to that question.  He stated in the course of his reply that the court may vary any settlement.  A person who owns some asset &mdash; a farm or pub, for example &mdash; may wish to ensure that, in the event of a marital breakdown, adequate maintenance exists.  I am aware that the Maintenance Act, 1976 applies in that regard.  While people may wish to ensure maintenance is adequate the question of maintaining the integrity of an asset is something about which questions are being asked. Can this be done?  To what extent can it be done under pre-nuptial agreements?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>This question has been raised on a number of occasions at meetings on the divorce issue.  It is not an easy question to answer.  When one talks about a pre-marriage agreement, one has to ask to what is one agreeing, as pre-marriage agreements could cover a multitude.  One would have to be specific as to the terms of the agreement, the transfer of property and the basis on which it was transferred and, for example, life estates, discretionary trusts and the multitude of legal situations that could be involved.  To deal with the different types of categories that come under the broad term of a pre-nuptial agreement would take a long time.  I could do it but not in the short time available.</P>
      <P>The short answer would be to refer Deputies to section 15 (c) of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which is repeated in the Family Law Act, 1995, and is also in the draft divorce Bill.  It gives the court jurisdiction to make:</P>
      <P>An order varying for the benefit of the spouses and of any dependent child of the family or any or all of those persons any ante-nuptial or post-nuptial settlement (including such a settlement made by will or codicil) made on the spouses;</P>
      <P>In the short time available I will confine myself to one example.  If under the terms of a pre-nuptial agreement an arrangement was made that a payment of an annual sum of money was to be made to one of the spouses the court would have authority to vary that condition attaching to one of the spouses to deal with a division of income.  On the question of property, it would depend on the basis and structure of the pre-nuptial agreement and whether it was a direct trust, a life interest or a discretionary trust and there is a multitude of types of cases.</P>

      <P>There were two Priority Questions included in this reply.  The Minister mentioned the Commissioner for Children and said while he welcomed the document we produced emphasising the needs of children and the importance of making proper provision for them he would in a future context look at the possibility of a Commissioner for Children.  Was that in the context of the Commission on the Family? I would prefer the Minister to give a positive commitment before the referendum to set up a Commissioner for Children on the lines which he set out, of ensuring that in the course of marriage breakdown and the court cases arising from marriage breakdown the children's interests are fully protected and there is somebody to look after them specifically.  Will the Minister not give a commitment in advance of the referendum to appoint a Commissioner for Children?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Before making a commitment one has to examine it with a great deal of care.  There is already in place a large raft of legislation directed towards <Col N="1344" /> protecting the interests and needs of children and a clause to that effect is specifically being included in the constitutional amendment providing that the court may not grant a divorce unless proper provision is made for children and there are many other pieces of legislation which deal with the protection of children.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's suggestion is interesting but we have to examine carefully how a Commissioner for Children would operate, the basis for the post and the role of the person.  I agree to examine the issue with great care.  The Commission on the Family has been set up and this too will have a role in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 10, 13 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>I am committed to taking initiatives to end discrimination against people with disabilities and to ensure that they are provided with opportunities for equal participation in all aspects of Irish society.</P>
      <P>The legal drafting of the Employment Equality and the Equal Status Bills is proceeding.  I envisage that, when it has been approved by the Government, the Employment Equality Bill will be published towards the end of this year.  The drafting of the Equal Status Bill, which contains some inter-related provisions, would then be completed and, following Government approval, would be published some time later.  The proposed legislation for employment equality will give protection to employees generally against discrimination, including discrimination on grounds of disability.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, which I established in December 1993, proposes to submit its report to the Government in the first half of 1996.</P>
      <P>To inform its examination of the issues affecting people with disabilities, the commission undertook one of the biggest ever consultation exercises in the history of the State, holding 23 public &ldquo;Listening Meetings&rdquo; in various locations throughut the State and sending representatives to as many meetings of organisations of and for people with disabilities as possible.  In addition, it sought submissions from people with disabilities, their families, parents and carers, service providers and other interested parties.  To date, approximately 600 submissions, in various media, including large print and audio tapes, have been received.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1346" /> The commission is now beginning its &ldquo;Communications Strategy&rdquo; which is geared towards raising awareness of the situation of people with disabilities and this strategy will culminate in the launching of its report.</P>
    <P>I understand that, among the many matters being considered by the commission, the issues of client rights, person-centred service delivery approaches and the integration of people with disabilities into every aspect of life in Ireland are being given special attention.  In addition, the commission has set up a working group on employment and training to examine the position of people with disabilities and to develop draft recommendations in this regard.</P>
    <P>My Department is engaged in ongoing consultations with IBEC and ICTU geared towards improving the employment position of people with disabilities and an officer from my Department is a member of the Monitoring Committee for the Employment of People with Disabilities which operates under the terms of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>I understand that, as part of its deliberations on the employment and training of people with disabilities, the commission is examining the question of the pay levels applying to people with disabilities in sheltered employment.  I look forward to receiving the commission's recommendations in this regard, when I will consider what further initiatives, legislative or otherwise, are required in this area.</P>
    <P>The Government regards the work of the commission as fundamentally important and will take specific action to end discrimination and to ensure equal opportunity for participation by all our people in Irish life.  When the commission has reported, we will examine its recommendations and any legislation required to set out the rights of persons with a disability, together with means of redress for those whose rights are denied will be prepared.  In line with <Col N="1347" /> the recommendations of the commission, we will put in place mechanisms for full and equal participation by every citizen with a disability in all aspects of our economic and social life.</P>
    <P>On 6 April 1995, on the recommendation of the commission on the Status of People with Disabilities, I announced the appointment of an <i>ad hoc</i> steering group to facilitate the establishment of a council for the status of people with disabilities.  Its terms of reference are as follows: to identify the actions needed to facilitate the development of a constituent base from which a provisional council, which would act in a caretaker capacity pending the formal establishment of a representative council, could emerge; to draw up a draft provisional constitution, which would serve as a mandate for the provisional council, pending the adoption of a formally agreed constitution in conjunction with the setting up of a properly constituted council; and to make the necessary arrangements for the holding of a national convention of relevant interests at which the membership of the provisional council could be agreed.</P>
    <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> group is examining the various issues associated with the establishment of a provisional council which, I understand, they hope to launch shortly after the commission reports. The establishment of a council will be an important step in seeking to ensure greater participation by people with disabilities in all facets of Irish life.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the fact that people with disabilities feel excluded, stigmatised, set apart and undervalued is a damning indictment of Government policy?  Will he bring forward immediate practical proposals? For example, what steps has the Minister taken to ensure that all polling stations will be accessible to disabled people during the forthcoming referendum, and will he take up that issue immediately with the Minister for the Environment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister also take action <Col N="1348" /> aimed at encouraging the employment of people with disabilities, particularly in the Dublin area?  Coca-Cola and Custom Foods are very good examples of private companies which employ people with disabilities.  Thirteen per cent of the workforce in Custom Foods are people with disabilities.  Will the Minister bring this to the attention of other companies and try to get them to provide opportunities for people with disabilities?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will bring to the attention of the Minister for the Environment the point regarding accessibility of polling stations.</P>
      <P>A number of things are being done regarding the employment of people with disabilities.  The Employment Equality Bill will deal specifically with anti-discrimination in this field.  It is due for publication before the end of this year.  The Deputy is familiar with it, having been involved with me during the term of office of the last Government in approving its key principles. People with disabilities will be one of the protected categories.  The work of the commission will be extremely important.  It has examined the matter in great detail at the listening exercises and their suggestions will have to be given careful and sympathetic attention. There are ongoing meetings under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> with IBEC and ICTU.  The Deputy may also be aware of the setting up of the equality awards scheme which aroused huge interest and intense competition. There was great participation and many firms gave remarkable examples of the work they are doing to provide employment for people with disabilities.  There was also a series of programmes on RTE which highlighted what can be done by firms.  I appeal to all firms to remember the tremendous contribution which can be made by people with disabilities when they are given the opportunity to work.  These are just some of the things that are under way in the Department in this regard.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider, even in the short-term, introducing a quota system such as exists in many EU countries for the employment of people with disabilities?  Does he feel that a system such as we have in the Civil Service would be beneficial, and would he consider introducing a penalty, usually a fine, for firms that do not comply with a quota, in an effort to ensure that people with a disability get some chance within the workforce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <P>A mandatory quota system of the type referred to by Deputy Keogh would have major implications and would have to be the subject of discussions between IBEC and ICTU in the context of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> There is a quota system in operation in a number of countries, notably France and Germany. It seems to have mixed results.  I would not necessarily rule it out, but a measure of agreement would have to be reached between both sides of industry before introducing it and much consideration would have to be given to its base.  It does not arise at this time, but it is something I will keep in mind.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;, unless the vessel makes any use of the facilities including navigational, buoys and lights or any service available in the other harbour; and in such instances the rates chargeable for the use of such facilities or services shall be those being charged immediately before the enactment of the Harbours Act, 1995 in respect of vessels so passing through such limits, or such rates as may be determined by the port company from time to time&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> When debating this amendment before lunch I was amazed at the unanimity Waterford Deputies displayed about what is best for Waterford, and what they proposed would be detrimental to New Ross Port. The ability of a port company to levy charges on vessels traversing its harbour en route to another port places the latter port at a competitive disadvantage. It is obvious the amendments stem from the current practice by Waterford Harbour of levying local light dues on all traffic using the Waterford Estuary.  The <Col N="1424" /> imposition of such a charge is inequitable as New Ross ships, which leave Waterford jurisdiction at Cheekpoint, are charged the same rate as vessels that go all the way to Waterford Port and use a larger number of lights and buoys. As the lower reaches of the Suir Estuary provide access to both New Ross and Waterford ports, they should have joint jurisdiction over the area between the sea and Cheekpoint.  If those charges were levied in full on New Ross Port it would go on a long way towards putting it out of business.  The Minister's amendment gives an unfair advantage to Waterford Port because it takes into account the practice of imposing a levy for local lights.  Even at this late stage, the Minister should consider carrying out an independent investigation into how such a practice is advantageous to Waterford and adversely affects New Ross.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage the section dealing with harbour charges was amended by the insertion of subsection (8) which provides that a ship bound for its port of destination is not liable for harbour charges if it must traverse or anchor in the harbour of another port company. This amendment was tabled to cater for harbours such as Foynes and New Ross, whose ships must traverse the waters of Limerick and Waterford harbours, respectively, to reach their destinations. It will ensure that ships travelling to, say, Foynes and New Ross will be exempt only from harbour dues.  If another port company provides a service or facility for a ship traversing its waters, on the basis of this amendment, it will be entitled to charge for such service or facility which could include, for example, lights and moorings. Obviously, services provided by a port company must be paid for by the body using them.  My amendment covers what Deputy Kenneally's amendment proposes and, consequently, I request that he withdraw his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 102 (6) of the Harbours Act, <Col N="1425" /> 1946 provides that harbour rates shall not be chargeable in respect of a vessel passing through the limits of another port to reach its port of destination unless the vessel makes use of the facilities available in the other harbour.  The purpose of my amendment is to retain the <i>status quo</i> in this regard and is not to give advantage to one port over another.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimKemmy" hpid="Mr. Kemmy Mr. Kemmy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kemmy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very familiar with the position at Foynes and Limerick harbours.  The Minister could have taken another route in respect of those harbours and I have spoken to him in private on this issue.  If one authority had jurisdiction over the estuary, the Minister's amendment would not be necessary.  While it is a delicate matter, I cannot allow the Minister's amendments pass without putting matters in context.  It would be much better if one authority was established to deal with the Department and multinational and domestic firms wishing to locate in the Shannon Estuary.  It is not acceptable that two authorities should have responsibility for the estuary as that will merely encourage smaller ports, such as Kilrush or Tarbert, to set up port authorities. Such fragmentation is not good for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Finucane misled the Minister when he claimed there are 400 dockers in Foynes.  If that was true Foynes Port would be one of the largest in the world, similar to Melbourne or Sydney.  The reality is that there are approximately 60 full-time dockers and a number of others who work on a casual or occasional basis.  The Limerick Harbour Commissioners have agreed to try to sort out the difficulties in respect of Foynes on the basis of negotiations.  The Minister mentioned the referral to an arbitrator of the matter relating to the enlargement of Foynes Harbour.  That is a civilised way of dealing with the matter but I would like the arbitrator to take a further step and bring unity to the Shannon Estuary authorities.  As large firms, such as Aughinish Alumina and the ESB, operate in the estuary, it <Col N="1426" /> is important that professional shipping services are available there.</P>
    <P>While I support the Minister's amendment, he should use his good offices to unite the various estuarial authorities.  In a country with a population of approximately 3.5 million it is nonsensical that they are so fragmented. Our waterways are a valuable resource. As a former trade union official, the Minister has experience in this area, but perhaps his hands are tied by political pressures.  However, it does not make sense to have two authorities operating in the same estuary.  It would be far better for everyone if they worked in unison.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome Deputy Kemmy to the debate.  I did not hear him contribute on Committee Stage.  If he had attended the Committee Stage debate he would know I did not say there were 400 full-time dockers in Foynes.  I said that at times there could be as many as 400, depending on the amount of shipping in the port.</P>
      <P>To resurrect the issue of a Shannon estuarial authority at this late stage is to whistle in the dark.  We are discussing the Harbours Bill and Foynes and Limerick harbours will become the Shannon harbour authority.  I do not wish to go down a <i>cul de sac</i> in discussing issues that are not relevant to the debate.</P>

However, he stated that if such ports use the services or facilities of Limerick or Waterford harbours it may be necessary to charge them.  While I know what the Minister is getting at, when the Bill is enacted what redress will ports such as Foynes and New Ross have if they consider the fees charged by Limerick and Waterford harbours excessive?  Can we ensure fair play in this matter?</P>

      <P>This section was dealt with at length on Committee Stage.  While I appreciate the difficulties that exist between Foynes and Limerick, a great deal of time was spent debating that matter on Committee Stage and I thought there was general agreement on how it should be resolved.  While I appreciate the difficulties to which both Deputies referred, other ports experience similar difficulties.  As Drogheda Port cannot facilitate ships over a certain tonnage a portion of some ships' cargo must be offloaded at other ports. It seems logical that since part of the cargo would be unloaded at another port, Drogheda could not claim payment for the total cargo.  Payment would have to be made on a shared basis, and the Minister's amendment adequately provides for that.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 12 in the name of the Minister. Amendments Nos. 15, 16 and 30 are related, Nos. 13 and 14 are consequential on No. 12, No. 17 is consequential on No. 16 and No. 29 is consequential on No. 30.  It is suggested therefore, that amendments Nos. 12 to 17, inclusive, and 29 and 30 be debated together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 12:</P>
      <P>In page 19, to delete lines 12 to 37 and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;15.&mdash;(1) A decision by a company to acquire any land or to dispose of any of its land (whether by sale or the <Col N="1429" /> grant of a lease) shall only be made by the directors of the company.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We will deal with the points raised by Deputy Molloy at a later stage and I will be happy to address them then.  There was strong opposition from all Deputies in the select committee to the provisions of section 15 (1) of the Harbours Bill which requires port companies to give the Minister two months' prior notice of all proposed sales and leases of lands. The general view was that this requirement was at variance with the principal aims and intentions of the new legislation to give the port companies commercial freedom and flexibility.  I advised the select committee that I would consider the concerns raised by Members and that I would consider amendments to this section for Report Stage.</P>
    <P>This matter has been further considered and I am pleased to advise Deputies that I am proposing the deletion of section 15 (1) from the Bill and its replacement with a number of new provisions which I wish to detail for the House, first, that a new subsection (1) be inserted in section 15.  The new subsection &mdash; amendment No. 12 &mdash; provides that decisions on sales, leases and acquisitions will be a reserved function of the boards of directors of the new companies.  Second, that new provisions be inserted in section 28 requiring the chairperson to furnish in his or her annual report to the Minister details of all sales, leases and acquisitions of land envisaged over the coming 12 months and details of any transactions of this nature that had taken place over the previous 12 months and which had not appeared in the previous annual report &mdash; amendments Nos. 15 and 16 refer.  Third, that a new paragraph be inserted in section 44 (1) which will empower the Minister to issue directions to port companies requiring them to comply with policy decisions of a general kind in regard to the sale, leasing and acquisition of land &mdash; amendment No. 30 refers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1430" /> To summarise, decisions in regard to the sale, leasing and acquistion of land will be a matter for the board of directors of each of the companies.  The directors, in arriving at such decisions, will be required to comply with policy decisions of a general kind issued by the Minister in this regard and the chairperson, in his or her annual report, will be required to furnish details of all such transactions envisaged over the coming 12 months, with a description of all such transactions that had taken place over the previous 12 months.</P>
    <P>The original intention of section 15 was to ensure full accountability by the new companies in regard to the sale and leasing of property and in particular to prevent any possible indiscriminate sale or long-term leasing of State property which is in the care of the company concerned. The form in which the original section 15 (1) sought to achieve these objectives was considered by Members of the select committee to be too restrictive. The new measures which I propose will achieve the same objective of ensuring accountability and protecting State-owned property by providing for a regular system of reporting of the company's activities in terms of its property portfolio, by providing a means by which the Minister can give a general policy direction to a company in terms of property acquisitions, leases and disposals and by providing for decisions in regard to property matters to be reserved to the board of directors who, in the final analysis, are accountable to the Minister.  I am satisfied that this approach will ensure accountability by the boards and protect State-owned property while at the same time allowing the boards of the companies the freedom to make decisions on property matters having regard to the commercial requirements of the company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this amendment.  In recent months a very worrying trend has developed whereby, not only in this but in other areas, we <Col N="1431" /> have vested greater power in the Minister and, by implication, in civil servants. Harbour companies were established which would operate on a commercial basis but we are tying their hands behind their backs.  We must trust these companies to do what is right and proper in their areas.  The change proposed by the Minister to give the boards power to do what is necessary regarding land acquisitions and so on is very welcome and will be welcomed by the various companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a long discussion in the select committee on the proposed controls under which the new companies would operate.  Some of the provisions, this one in particular, directly contradict the declared objective of freeing up the harbour boards to become commercial enterprises in every sense of the word.  The level of control the Department sought to impose went against that declared objective.  There were indications that legal challenges might be brought against the Bill if it passed through the House in its present form.  That view was expressed by a Price Waterhouse consultant at a seminar on the Bill about which the Minister is probably aware.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kenneally that there has been a trend recently, particularly since the rainbow Government came into office, for Departments to seek increasing control over affairs when legislation is being introduced. The power of the semi-State sector to operate in the commercial market is being restricted by new provisions proposed under different legislation, not only in this Bill.  Senior executives of the ESB have screamed in the public media about the Department seeking to take control.  I might have other views on that matter, but it is interesting to hear the complaints and objections from that source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Government accepted the arguments we made on Committee Stage and agreed to make these amendments which will go some <Col N="1432" /> way towards alleviating fears that, rather than creating harbour companies with freedom to operate in the commercial arena without restriction, we were setting up new State companies which would come more firmly under the control of the Minister, the Department and its officials.  This House must guard against that.  It is not in the interest of the country that semi-State structures should be controlled in that way.  It is in the interests of the economy and achieving our objectives for full employment that we should privatise many semi-State companies.  If we did that we would get much better value and service, but that is an argument for another day.  This legislation is probably a step down that road and the next one may be full privatisation.  The objective of the Bill was being contravened in the requirement that permission would have had to be sought from the Department before property was leased, bought or sold.  That requirement would interfere with the commercial operations of the executives and the board. The Minister accepted that the weight of the argument in the House was against that provision and in so far as it goes I welcome the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's decision in this regard.  The matter was well debated and teased out on Committee Stage.  I am pleased the Minister has taken on board the comments in this regard from all sides of the House.  The main complaint by harbour authorities concerned the lack of flexibility within the existing regulations which tie them to seeking a ministerial decision in respect of virtually everything they seek to do.  Flexibility in that regard will be welcome at local level.  However, to ensure that this section is not abused &mdash; there will be some monitoring as the boards will have to report back to the Minister on all transactions &mdash; some criteria should be laid down.  Much controversy has surrounded the sale of public lands and buildings in recent years, and that issue has been raised in recent weeks.  Some guidelines should be given <Col N="1433" /> to boards to ensure flexibility is not abused and that there will be uniformity of action nationally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I breathe a sigh of relief at the way in which the Minister has dealt with this section.  I argued strongly on Committee Stage that section 15 as it then stood would strangle the commerciality of the Harbours Bill at birth. It was against everything one would interpret as being commercial.  The Minister has taken a major step forward by removing lines 12 to 37 and allowing companies make commercial decisions. However, as on Committee Stage I sound a note of warning.  The Minister's amendments have the effect of requesting companies to forward in their statement of accounts details of sales of lands or assets, leasing or other transactions over a 12-month period. Commercial decisions cannot be based on pounds, shillings and pence.  Life is not like that.  Such decisions involve a large number of factors of which the financial implications are important but they are not the only criteria.  If someone checks the accounts of a harbour company in two or three years time and notes the proceeds from the sale or leasing of land and takes that bald figure, politicians will be running out of this House talking about abuse, cosy cartels and all sorts of nonsense on the basis of a figure appearing in a book.  The background to that figure may have involved lateral thinking on the part of a port company which may have considered the whole commercial operation in terms of seeking to attract a commercial company that would have boosted the sustainability of the port and would have been an asset in terms of the company being able to access European markets.  Ireland more than any other country is dependent on access to Europe as it is an island nation on the western periphery of Europe.  We must think of the broader picture of what commerciality means.  It does not mean the simplistic State view of the figure at the bottom of the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1434" /> The Minister has taken this step forward and it leads to the area of commerciality. We should not kid ourselves.  If we think we are seriously making the semi-State sector commercial by introducing the type of legislation that has passed through this House recently, we should think again.  The semi-State sectors of other EU member states reveal &mdash; I am not talking about privatisation &mdash; that political involvement in commercial companies is being removed and that is only right.  It is a contradiction to talk about real commerciality while the long arm of politicians and Government Departments interferes.</P>
    <P>I reject the notion I constantly hear in the House, one to which Deputy Bell referred, that we must keep an eye on these people, as if everybody involved in semi-State companies is abusing the system.  The reality is that they are not. Excluding the odd questionable deal that has occurred, those people, from the top to the bottom, are honest and hard working.  I reject the notion emerging in the House that we great politicians must keep an eye on those people, as if they were all up to skulduggery. Speaking on behalf of those involved in business, although I have no involvement in business, I reject that view.  The notion of such abuse is nonsense. It is time we stopped the insidious reference to it as if everybody would abuse the system if we did not police matters.  That is not the case.  These people have served us extremely well. The Minister's amendment, in the context of commerciality, is a step in the right direction but it will not be sufficient.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for ministerial involvement at all levels as if some controlling measure had to be there.  I reject that notion because companies are competing for business on a European and world market not on a domestic market. They will not be able to meet competitors on a true commercial basis if there is continued involvement and questioning by politicians in this area.  I have much more confidence in the semi-State companies than many Members seem to <Col N="1435" /> have.  It is deplorable that lack of confidence in the semi-State sector is being used as some kind of political platform. It contributes nothing to good public debate or to the development of our semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>I hope, in the context of this amendment, we will see a more enlightened approach not only from the Minister's Department but from the Government and that other Ministers dealing with legislation on the semi-State sector will realise that we have to trust the people who run the companies to make commercial decisions at the right time in the interest of their employees, and the tax-payers whom they represent.  Following the Committee Stage debate I welcome the fact that the Minister has brought forward this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to make a long speech on the merits of all the semi-State companies.  It is obvious the Minister has recognised the genuine concerns expressed on Committee Stage regarding the controls and restrictions on the sale or lease of lands in the past. I compliment the Minister on reacting so positively to the suggestions.  It is a positive amendment and a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Minister's change of heart.  It is obvious he was listening to the debate on Committee Stage.  Many contributors spoke against the involvement of the Department and the Minister in the day to day affairs of the companies.  In the short time I spent in the Department I realised that civil servants and the Department like to keep power at the centre.  I am pleased the Minister did not go along with that and has decided to bring in this amendment.  I hope this will release companies to do what they have been set up to do &mdash; to be commercially viable, to make a success of the job on hand, to represent the areas in which they are involved and to create jobs without being hamstrung by the <Col N="1436" /> day to day involvement of Departments or the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I too commend the Minister on his acceptance of the recommendations on Committee Stage. He has gone a long way to meet our requests.  Ministerial intervention should be limited.  One of the main reasons we sought to change the Minister's mind was on the basis of practicality. If a simple lease was required in a hurry we considered that going to the Minister's office might delay things.  The Minister as well as everyone else in this House knows that immediacy in ministerial offices is not always interpreted as we would interpret it.  I commend the Minister on introducing the amendment which will improve the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who have contributed so positively to this amendment.  A number of issues have been raised in the course of the discussion.  I do not propose to deal with them all, however, I would like to respond to a number of points specifically. Deputy Molloy seems to offer privatisation almost with the same monotony that many people of my political persuasion used to offer nationalisation as a panacea for every economic problem.  The issue of privatisation was addressed and rejected as an option by the Murphy report.</P>
      <P>There are good reasons that the ports should remain in public ownership. They were underlined in the Murphy recommendations and are the basis for the format being put forward in this Bill. The main ports should be established as commercial semi-State companies.  In the vast majority of economies, the ports are publicly owned facilities.  If we look at those ports in private ownership, we would not necessarily want to repeat some of the experiences.  Deputy Bell raised the question of protection for the companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the companies will have to report to the Minister, through the chairperson's report, on their plans for property acquisition and property disposal.  During the course of a year they will also have to report to the Minister, through the chairperson's report, on the disposals and acquisitions during the year in question.  Obviously that is in the interests of the ports being accountable to the Minister for the general transaction of their property portfolio.  In addition, one of the amendments I am proposing here provides that the Minister may give general policy directions to port companies on the issue of disposal and acquisition of property.</P>
      <P>Deputies Cullen and Browne raised the issue of some hidden wish of the Minister or the officials of the Department of the Marine to be involved in every detail of port activity and commercial decision-making in the ports. That is not the intention in this Bill. Deputies will recall that on Committee Stage I proposed an amendment to section 44 that specifically provided that the directions to be given by a Minister on the conduct of a port's business was not to include the day to day decision-making but was to refer to matters of general policy.  A distinction has to be made between the management of a company's management portfolio and the conduct of its general commercial activities.  There is a difference.</P>
      <P>We are not seeking day to day involvement of Ministers or of the Department of the Marine in conducting the affairs of the port companies. They are being established to do a particular job but it is right that these port companies, as they are responsible for publicly owned facilities, are accountable to the Minister and report to the Minister on a regular basis on what they are doing and that directions of a general policy kind may be given by the Minister.  It is a question of striking the balance between the commercial freedom&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We want companies to keep in mind that their area of operation and expertise can be as wide as possible.  There are obvious opportunities for spending on maintenance of recreational and amenity facilities, not that I expect all new harbour authorities to spend scarce resources in areas where they might lose money or may not have much of a return.  We are simply saying that should be taken into account because harbour authorities engaged in some specific development might see a recreational or amenity opportunity emerging that could be availed of while some other substantial development was taking place.  We should recognise that such circumstances could occur, that they could be taken into account when examining the figures in a performance audit and that it would not negate the efforts made in the core facility.  It would merely recognise that recreational and amenity facilities are important and should be nurtured.</P>

As Deputy Browne knows, I moved amendments to that effect earlier in this debate and they were accepted by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with this amendment because I do not believe it is necessary. What Deputy Browne is seeking is an issue that will be taken into consideration in the context of performance audits. Many ports incur expenditure on the maintenance of recreational and amenity facilities and that can vary from port <Col N="1441" /> to port.  It is an area of expenditure that can be outlined in the chairperson's annual report to the Minister if so desired by the company.  It is not necessary, therefore, to include it in the legislation.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(7) The Minister shall appoint two persons nominated in a prescribed manner by a prescribed Chamber of Commerce to be each a Director of a Company.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent years we have come to realise the value of chambers of commerce. They take a leading role in business and community involvement and have their finger on the pulse of many of the happenings around the country.  They have proven their commitment to local communities time and again and it is important they have a role to play in the new boards.  In the past, there were representatives of chambers of commerce on harbour boards and I do not see why that should not continue.  I realise this matter was argued trenchantly on Committee Stage but the Minister was reluctant to accept amendments.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter because chambers of commerce are very much part and parcel of business development in our towns and cities.  I ask the Minister to consider allowing <Col N="1442" /> members of chambers of commerce serve on the harbour boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter was considered in detail on Committee Stage when the Minister clearly indicated in his reply that he would welcome nominations from chambers of commerce or other organisations associated with business, commerce and maritime activity in local communities.  If this amendment is accepted it is possible there might be more than one or two members of chambers of commerce nominated to these boards.  There would be more flexibility, however, if the current position obtained.  The chambers of commerce will be the nominating bodies. They should identify people with business interests who might be considered for nomination to these boards and their names should be forwarded to the Department for consideration when the new boards are being set up.  In that way there may be four or five members of chambers of commerce on these boards rather than only one or two.  I served with many fine people on harbour boards down through the years.  I am sure that any Minister will have to consider seriously the list supplied by a body such as a chamber of commerce operating within the port authority area. It cannot be compared with the nomination of, for example, a worker-director who will have to be elected and re-elected. There is a different procedure in chambers of commerce where people can be nominated by the chamber.  A worker-director will have to stand before the people and be elected in the normal democratic way.  There is no comparison between those two procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my area three local authorities straddle the River Boyne, namely, Meath County Council, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation. The only way in which that could be dealt with on a fair and equitable basis would be to make provision for representation in the legislation and the regulations.  I am confident that the balance of members will come from the <Col N="1443" /> business community and I believe the Minister's line on this issue is correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments. This issue was debated on Committee Stage.  I particularly support the amendment on the chambers of commerce and I accept in good faith Deputy Bell's statement that it is likely many people from the business community will be on the boards but that is not the point.  Over the last few years, the chambers of commerce have become more professional bodies in communities and I welcome that.  They are moving much closer to their European counterparts &mdash; perhaps because of our involvement in the EU &mdash; and have a much more co-ordinated and professional approach to business.  They are a key element and vibrant part of most communities and a very dynamic force in Waterford.</P>
      <P>My colleague is not necessarily saying there must be two representatives.  We are trying to achieve recognition of the chambers of commerce as a body. Recently, the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland made a welcome, enlightening and far-seeing pre-budget submission.  The chambers of commerce are playing an increasingly important role and we must encourage them to continue in their current direction.  They are directly involved and should have at least one seat on the board.  I would not agree with any further increase in board membership because I do not want the harbour boards becoming so big that we have a committee of 30 or 40 people trying to make decisions and getting nothing done.  The boards should be focused and capable of getting on with their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the trade union movements in local areas, chambers of commerce have been involved in much worth-while activity and the development of the commercial life of communities.  A port, such as that in Waterford, is a central force for the development of many industries.  It is not isolated but has a big impact on companies that will come into the area and enhances our colleges and <Col N="1444" /> infrastructural developments.  Chambers of commerce are representatives of business in its widest sense and include small as well as large companies.  I put it to Deputy Bell that small companies and small businesses will not be directly represented on such a board but, as members of a chamber of commerce, will elect their representative from among the greater body.  Then they will have a role and make a contribution.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister recognises the legitimate case for having one representative from chambers of commerce.  They have contributed in the past and have been central to decisions over the last number of years relating to the manner in which ports have expanded.  Guaranteed representation should be maintained.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Browne's amendment.  I was chairman of the board in New Ross but I was fired since the Committee Stage debate, although not by the Minister.  However, the Minister's suggestion that we should no longer be members may have contributed to the decision.</P>

      <P>I am certain the new chairman will do an excellent job.  There is a representative from the chamber of commerce on New Ross harbour commissioners, Mark Moynihan, who has been vice-chairman for the past two years.  He has done an exceptional job and is available to our chief executive at any time.  There is a person like Mark Moynihan in every town and their interest and expertise should be used. Mr. Moynihan is on our board as a member of the chamber of commerce and, from my experience, the board would not function as well without him. I ask the Minister to take that into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The chambers of commerce have a tremendous overview of commercial activity in any town, particularly port towns.  I suspect the Minister is afraid <Col N="1445" /> that, as with other organisations, including political organisations, the job will be dished out to somebody who did not get any job to date.  Chambers of commerce are a responsible group of people and are careful in their selection of a person to serve on a board.  They select the proper person for a given job.  They have been successful and know the business very well.  For those reasons I ask the Minister to specifically allow for membership of representatives from chambers of commerce.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bell has a tremendous knowledge of harbour boards and ports.  He mentioned that worker-directors must stand before their own people.  The same can be said of chambers of commerce representatives.  I do not know the size of the chamber of commerce in the Deputy's town but in mine it is quite large.  The appointment is not just given to a person on the basis of the colour of their hair, they have to go through the same process the following year to be reappointed.  The selection process is basically the same.  The Minister has already accepted amendments and suggestions from this side of the House on this Bill and it is progressing well.  I ask him to reconsider this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the big disappointments on Committee Stage was the Minister's refusal to accept the amendments from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats to give representation to the chambers of commerce on the new harbour companies.  The Minister, in seeking to justify his decision, said that in the interests of commerciality it was decided to move away from the representational boards of the past which were comprised of representatives of the trade unions, nominees of the Minister, local authority nominees, the chamber of commerce nominees and the port users' nominees.  The port users held an election to decide on their representative.  The chambers of commerce and local authorities decided at their AGMs and the trade unions submitted the names of their nominees to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1446" /> It was recommended in the Murphy report that representational nominees on the new harbour companies should be done away with.  The Minister did not accept that recommendation and decided instead to allow trade union and local authority representation and to refuse the chambers of commerce any representation.  Yet during the course of the discussion he said: &ldquo;It is probable that I will invite recognised bodies such as the chambers of commerce to recommend persons for consideration for appointment as directors&rdquo;. In seeking to appoint people who have a strong commercial background the Minister recognises that he will have to go back to the chambers of commerce to get nominees with the necessary expertise and knowledge who are willing to work long hours.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the reasoning behind the Minister's decision.  I cannot think of any organisation more representative of all aspects of trade and commerce in a region than the chamber of commerce movement whose membership is open, which is supported by research and permanent staff and is operated on a strictly democratic basis.  It is only proper that they should be granted the right to make a nomination from within their membership. Those of us who were members of harbour boards in the past are very conscious that some of the best contributions were made by the chambers of commerce nominees.  The new boards will be weak without this input.</P>
    <P>The chambers of commerce will probably be consulted but they will not have a statutory role on these boards.  There is no justification for this decision given that the Minister has accepted the other recommendations in the Murphy report. Having cherry picked certain recommendations in the report, he proposes to make the boards part representational and has reserved unto himself the right to nominate 50 per cent or more of the representatives.  We know from experience &mdash; recent events confirm this &mdash; that many appointments by <Col N="1447" /> Ministers of all parties are made on the basis of political considerations.  My party could make a case for exclusion from that group given that we attempted to move away from that position. Whoever happens to be in office when the new boards are being appointed will load them up with his or her appointees.  There is no evidence to show that anything other than that will happen.  The Labour, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil parties did this extensively when they were in office and they will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that the Minister has decided not to concede statutory representational rights to the chambers of commerce because the Bill will give the Government of the day the opportunity to appoint their political friends to the boards of these new companies. The Minister may expound high principles and aspirations about the need to appoint the best commercially qualified people but the Government's actions since it came into office will not back that up.  In the case of the chambers of commerce politics does not enter into their discussions or considerations at any level.  They are strictly non-political and great credit is due to them for that.  The Minister does not propose to avail of the expertise of the qualified, committed and interested people in the chambers of commerce.  Rather he proposes to exclude them from participation in the new boards.  This is a sad day for politics.  The Minister may give other reasons for his decision but I think I have put my finger on the heart of the matter.</P>
    <P>This provision will not ensure the type of commerciality in the operation of the new boards which we would like to see.  Despite the serious financial restraints under which they had to operate the boards made great progress in the past.  We are moving into an era where very substantial funding will be available from the EU.  This funding was not available in the past and the harbours were built up by the boards which <Col N="1448" /> struggled to maintain adequate facilities with some assistance from the State.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not accept our amendments on Committee Stage.  We have put them down again on Report Stage in the hope that he will concede the point.  If he agrees to give further consideration to them between now and the debate in the Seanad it will offer us some hope but if he does not do so we will have no option but to put them to a vote.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily support the points made by my colleagues in support of Deputy Browne's amendment. When one looks at the history of harbour authorities one will see that over the years there has been great interaction between the commercial interests on the boards, trade unions etc.  In many cases they supported one another when vacancies arose for the post of chairman or vice chairman and they always acted in the best interests of the authority.  I am afraid that the Minister's proposal will do away with this and that the expertise built up over many years will be lost to the harbour boards.</P>
      <P>Chambers of commerce and other bodies only selected those with an interest in the operations of harbour authorities, who knew how they functioned and would work in their best interests.  They never abused this privilege.</P>
      <P>In this section the right of local authorities and workers to be represented on the boards of port companies is being copperfastened.  I have a difficulty, however, with the proposal contained in subsection (1) (c) that in a company with fewer than 30 employees the Minister will appoint someone to represent their interests.  This may be a member of the local branch of Democratic Left rather than an employee of the company. That is a source of concern as many of the new port companies will have fewer than 30 employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chambers of commerce were supportive of this legislation when first introduced, but little did they know that they would be excluded.  As Deputy <Col N="1449" /> Molloy said, the Government is moving away from the thrust of the Murphy report presented in 1992.  That is regrettable. Historically, chambers of commerce had the right to be represented on harbour authorities.  It is a pity the Minister cannot see his way to allowing them retain this right in the future.  I ask him to accede to the request made in these amendments.</P>

I was a member of a harbour authority on which there was no chamber of commerce representative as there was no chamber of commerce in the area.  Despite this it was a successful commercial entity.  People are inclined, therefore, to labour the point.  I am confident that the Minister will appoint people with an interest in the commercial development of ports.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Similar amendments to these were discussed at length on Committee Stage and finally defeated by a vote.  In considering these amendments we first need to look at the composition of the existing harbour boards.  Harbour authorities range in size from nine to 29 members and comprise representatives from local authorities, chamber of commerce, IBEC, councils of trade unions, the livestock trade, shipping interests and ministerial nominees.  We should pay tribute to successive members of harbour boards for the work done during the years without remuneration in the management of their respective harbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commercial harbours review group which looked at the structure of administration in our courts was of the opinion that these representational type boards were no longer attuned to the competitive requirements of a modern port and were not the most efficient way <Col N="1450" /> of managing ports.  Following publication of its report, there were numerous requests for the continuation of existing representation.  Having considered the matter, the Government decided that the number of directors in each company should not be more than 12 and that three local authority directors should be appointed to each port company.</P>
    <P>To some extent, Deputy Molloy in particular, is attempting to rewrite history. The Government has not departed from the thrust of the Murphy report which specifically recommended that there should be employee representation. This is provided for in the Bill. In addition, the Government decided to provide for local authority representation. This is consistent with the important role it attributes to local government.  Is Deputy Molloy, or any of the other Members who have raised this point, saying we should not provide for local authority representation on the boards of port companies?</P>
    <P>On the question of ships agents and chambers of commerce representation, the subject matter of these amendments, the review group was strongly of the view that persons with a vested business interest in the affairs of a port should not be granted board representation. Some ports are clearly dominated by user interests and one view is that the continuation of such representation could have an inhibiting effect on the commercial effectiveness of the new port companies.</P>
    <P>I have received representations from many bodies, including the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland, the Irish Ships Agents Association, individual chambers of commerce and other bodies seeking representation on the boards of the new port companies.  In the interests of commerciality, it was decided to move away from the representational boards of the past.  Deputies will appreciate that to provide for statutory representation for one body would open up the gates for others who also seek statutory representation on the new port companies.  Only today I received a <Col N="1451" /> submission in which a return to the old style representational boards was sought.</P>
    <P>It is my intention that ministerial directors will, in general, be drawn from the professional and business community. In appointing such directors I will be anxious to select persons with the appropriate business acumen.  For this reason it is probable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In page 32, line 1, after &ldquo;harbour master,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;who shall have the right to attend board meetings and take part in discussions,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the proposed legislation two positions must be filled in each port company, that of chief executive and harbour master.  The role of the chief executive is enshrined in law but not that of the harbour master.  The harbour master is one of the most important people in the harbour and is in charge of ships entering and leaving the port. He has responsibility for safety, unloading ships and environmental matters. He has a mix of statutory and commercial obligations.  I am not asking that the harbour master be a member of the board but he should have a statutory right to attend meetings.  On Committee Stage the Minister was reluctant to accept proposals put forward but I ask him to reconsider his decision in this matter and give the harbour master a right to attend board meetings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with Deputy Browne in asking that this be allowed. We discussed it on Committee Stage and made a strong case for it.  The harbour master is involved in every activity at the port.  If a decision is taken at a <Col N="1456" /> board meeting it affects the harbour master.  As almost every motion put down at a board meeting will be on his desk, why not have the harbour master attend such meetings?  For instance, if a harbour master contended a motion passed at a meeting he had not attended could not be put into operation, a special meeting would have to be convened requesting his attendance.  Therefore, this amendment is simply a commonsense proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Having, as chairman, been unable to contribute to our Committee Stage deliberations, but having listened to our many discussions and spoken to the Minister before and after Committee Stage, I sympathise with the objectives of the movers of this amendment. In the case of larger ports, there may be heads of divisions, somebody in charge of finance, somebody else in charge of shipping and yet another in charge of other functions of the board, who would be requested to attend board meetings whenever the subject matter pertaining to their divisions arose for discussion.</P>
      <P>I am particularly concerned about secondary ports in respect of which, in some cases, the harbour master will be the chief executive officer whereas, in the case of larger ports, the chief executive officer and harbour master will each have two distinct functions.  In the case of secondary ports, clearly harbour masters will be held responsible for almost all of the activity within their harbours. That is why I draw the distinction.</P>
      <P>In the case of my local harbour authority, the harbour master once attended a meeting, by invitation.  That may very well be the exception to the rule.  I do not know how other smaller, secondary ports operate.  Perhaps traditionally harbour masters attend such meetings.  I am informed by my colleagues that is the case in some ports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There should be uniformity to ensure that no harbour master attends a meeting at which a subject matter falling beyond his remit is discussed.  Nonetheless he should have the right to attend <Col N="1457" /> any meeting considering a subject matter directly within his sphere of responsibility.  We must remember that harbour masters have enormous statutory responsibilities under the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been very generous in responding to proposed amendments evidenced by the substantial number of amendments he tabled.  Nonethless, at this stage, if these amendments are not acceptable, perhaps the matter could be dealt with under some other headings, enshrined in the regulations to be drawn up under the relevant section, or reconsidered when the Bill goes to the Seanad.</P>
    <P>In the case of the two ports in my constituency, those with which I am most familiar, it is absolutely essential that the harbour master has the right to attend company meetings, as a non-voting board member.  I made it clear to representatives of harbour masters that I would not support any right of harbour masters to vote as it would compromise their position and place them in very difficult circumstances if and whenever policy matters beyond their realm of control had to be decided.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the objective of these amendments.  Following the Committee Stage debate, I am surprised the Minister has not moved to rectify what is a glaring omission.  It is not that we are carrying a flag for every harbour master but, because of the technical nature and complexity of shipping, with its daily involvement of harbour masters it is wise that they should have a right to attend company meetings.  If it is correct that there be three politicians appointed to the board, can anybody persuade me their attendance is more important than that of a harbour master?  The reality is that a harbour master works full-time within the port for which he is responsible. It would be foolish to allow for the possibility that a harbour board could take a decision without having had the proper technical information made available.  The obvious question would then arise as to why the harbour master was not present since he has onerous <Col N="1458" /> responsibilities and should be statutorily accountable at board level.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister will say that a board can invite a harbour master to attend any or all of its meetings if it deems his attendance is necessary but we should not allow such a grey area to remain because, if at any time a harbour master does not attend and something goes wrong, we will question that absence in the first place.  Because a harbour master is so directly involved in the running and operations of the port, albeit one specific aspect, he should be entitled to attend the new harbour company meetings.  I am not hung up on his having voting rights but, given the nature of his full-time job, it would be wise to avoid confusion.  Some boards might request harbour masters to attend all their board meetings and others might not request his attendance at all.</P>
      <P>His statutory right to attend should be provided for and I appeal to the Minister to change his mind on the matter.</P>

      <P>I am absolutely amazed the Minister has not tabled an amendment on Report Stage to give effect to the arguments advanced by Members on Committee Stage, that henceforth all harbour masters should have a statutory right to attend harbour company meetings, without having the right to vote. During our Committee Stage discussion three of the parties represented here spoke in favour of this amendment; Fianna Fáil have tabled an amendment, as have the Progressive Democrats. Deputy Finucane of the Fine Gael Party, somebody with great knowledge and experience of having worked on harbour boards supported the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Today we have the unique circumstances in which the chairman of that committee &mdash; who was not in a position to offer comment while chairing our deliberations on Committee Stage &mdash; has made it clear that from his experience, as a member of the Labour Party, he too supports the granting of a statutory right of a harbour master to attend <Col N="1459" /> harbour company meetings in the future.</P>
    <P>All parties who have addressed the issue are in agreement with the proposal that harbour masters should have a statutory right to attend harbour company meetings without having a right to vote, apparently the only party holding out against this proposal being Democratic Left, in the presence of the Minister of State who represents that party. I do not know what experience he has had or whether he was ever a member of a harbour board nor do I know what has been the experience of his senior Minister with whom I presume he will have discussed its detailed provisions and who will have given the Bill his <i>imprimatur.</i>  The record of the Committee Stage debate clearly demonstrates that all Members who have had the benefit of having served on harbour boards strongly believe this to be an absolutely essential provision.  If this is not conceded, it will mean a serious imposition on the effectiveness of harbour boards to carry out their duties in future.  The reasons for this have been placed on the record.  I was optimistic that the Minister would do something in view of his following statement on Committee Stage on 14 September 1995:</P>
    <P>I came into this session believing that it was not necessary to include that in the legislation.  However, a strong case has been made....  I am prepared to give further consideration to what has been said.  I ask the Members to withdraw the amendments to enable me to reflect further on the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith responded to the Minister's request as follows:</P>
    <P>I am happy to do that but I am not too sure that I can be too optimistic on the basis of the rather neat twist the Minister gave in his earlier reply saying: &ldquo;One would think there was a provision to exclude harbour masters&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1460" /> After Deputy Smith had spoken, I stated I would not press the amendment on that occasion.  I said I thought it was the first indication on Committee Stage that the Minister was listening to the experienced members of the committee.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not come forward with any relevant amendment.  I stated, on Committee Stage, that I took a more optimistic view of the Minister's intention than Deputy Smith.  However, our views are being ignored and we cannot do much except to call a vote on the issue.  It is sad because there is a misunderstanding of how the harbour board operation works is displayed.  If the harbour master does not have the right to attend meetings, major difficulties will be experienced in carrying out the business of the harbour companies in a smooth fashion.  Many matters will need to be referred to the harbour master for an opinion who, when present at meetings, provided explanations on a wide variety of matters to the members enabling them to make decisions.</P>
    <P>We are trying to help the new harbour companies to be commercially oriented, operate efficiently and arrive at conclusions quickly, based on knowledge and information.  One of the primary individuals in the structure and operation of a harbour company is the harbour master, who has to be aware of all operational aspects of the work of a harbour master, who has to be aware of executive will be inhibited by the absence of the harbour master at meetings. The work of the harbour master will also be inhibited because he will have to spend much of this time writing answers to questions raised at board meetings.  These questions could be dealt with at such meetings if the harbour master was permitted to attend.</P>
    <P>There is no intent in either of the two amendments to give the harbour master the right to become a director or full voting member.  That is clearly not being proposed.  I offered the example of Deputy Rabbitte who attends Government meetings.  He is not a member of the Cabinet but attends Cabinet meetings. I thought that by giving that <Col N="1461" /> example the Minister might see, from experience, that the proposal was practical. However, what is good for Deputy Rabbitte is not good for the harbour masters.  They will not be permitted to attend the meetings of harbour boards where they have a vital role to play.  The board can decide to invite them to attend and this has been done in the past.</P>
    <P>We are not often afforded the opportunity to deal with harbour legislation and it is incumbent on us to draw on personal experience in putting forward proposals for the modern legislation being introduced.  This is a serious omission as all contributions on Committee Stage and during this debate, apart from those made by the members of the Minister's party, propose that it is important to provide harbour masters with a statutory right to attend meetings. This has already been established in practice and has become valuable to the workings of the harbours boards. The time has arrived to give statutory effect to it under this legislation.</P>
    <P>I have come to the conclusion that, because he has not tabled amendments, the Minister considered this issue and rejected it.  That is a very sad decision and the wrong one.  We have not heard the Minister's reasons and we will not have an opportunity to respond to what he has to say on the matter.  It is a retrograde step.</P>

      <P>I will be brief as I already made my contribution on Committee Stage.  The reason I expressed my views at that time was because I had been a member of a harbour board for almost ten years.  A natural feature of those meetings was the attendance of the harbour master.  I found this a very effective system.  The Harbours Act, 1946, does not contain a formal mechanism for this but it was accepted, by natural policy, that the harbour master would attend our meetings.  It was in this context that, on Committee Stage, I stated that I could see the merits of the proposal.</P>

      <P>I am amazed that the Minister is not prepared to accept these amendments.  In one of my earlier contributions I mentioned expertise and I could use the same word in this instance.  The expertise of the harbour masters is being lost by preventing their attendance at harbour authority meetings which is a retrograde step.</P>
      <P>In the past I served on Waterford Corporation.  The Roads Committee of that body always invited attendance by a Garda inspector in charge of traffic. His attendance was vital when the committee discussed road traffic regulations because, with his knowledge and hands-on experience, we could make sensible decisions on the spot.  Without his attendance there was no point in even discussing such matters.  He was not a voting member of the committee but he attended and discussed those matters with us.</P>
      <P>That is not being done in this instance.  If a matter is raised at a meeting of the harbours boards which requires the assistance of the harbour master, he will not be present to offer advice.  It must be put on the back burner and a report sought from the harbour master.  The decision making process is delayed by doing this.  During my time in this House proposals have been put forward on many subjects. Some of them were unworkable but others had great merit.  Common sense is not used often enough in this House. This is a common-sense proposal and I urge the Minister to accept it.</P>

      <P>In reply to the minor part of Deputy Molloy's contribution &mdash; which was not framed in the form of tedious political rhetoric &mdash; and the statement that on Committee Stage I undertook to give further consideration to the points raised.  I did indeed give such a commitment and have given considerable consideration to this issue.  I have come to the conclusion that it is not necessary to amend the Bill, as it stands, to permit harbour masters to attend meetings of the port companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1463" /> The present position, under the Harbours Act, 1946, is that harbour masters do not have a statutory right to attend harbour authority meetings. However, as Deputy Finucane stated, they do attend such meetings in practice. There is no provision in the Bill which will prevent harbour masters attending board meetings of their port companies.</P>
    <P>One would think from some of the contributions to the debate that there is a provision in the Bill stating that harbour masters cannot attend meetings of the boards of the port companies.  There is no such provision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with &ldquo;may&rdquo; and &ldquo;shall&rdquo; in a moment.  Deputy Kenneally give an example of a road traffic committee of a local authority inviting the garda superintendent concerned to attend such a meeting.  There is no statutory provision requiring that should be the case but it is the case in practice.  It is perfectly reasonable and sensible that the garda superintendent should attend meetings which are discussing road traffic matters.  Similarly it is perfectly sensible and reasonable that the harbour master should attend the board meetings of a port company when matters which relate to his functions are being considered but it does not follow from that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that there has to be an automatic statutory right to do so.  I recognise the important role of the harbour master in safety matters in his jurisdiction and the technical knowledge and expertise he has in all aspects of <Col N="1464" /> port operations.  However, I cannot accede to the request that section 37 be amended to provide that harbour masters shall have the right to attend board meetings and take part in discussions.  It would be a matter for the new board of directors to decide whether the harbour master should be invited to attend all board meetings, some board meetings, full board meetings or certain parts of board meetings for the purpose of giving their advice.  I would expect the new boards to act responsibly in this regard and take due account of any advice, technical or otherwise, given by the harbour masters as part of their normal deliberations in board meeting agenda items.  I have no reason to believe that the position in practice of harbour masters attending meetings of the port companies would be different from what pertains.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hugh Byrne said there should be &ldquo;pure common sense&rdquo; but if it is a matter of pure common sense surely we can allow the boards of the port companies to use their common sense to ensure that harbour masters attend board meetings of the port companies as appropriate.  After all if we are charging them with the very considerable responsibility of the management and custody of the ports, surely we could at least trust them to decide on the appropriate officers to attend meetings of the port companies.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that the port companies will as a matter of course have their harbour masters present at board meetings.  The amendment states that the harbour masters shall have the right to attend board meetings and take part in discussions.  In that event it would be a matter for the harbour master to decide whether to attend meetings of the port company.  If the scenario that has been painted were to arise where an issue is decided at a meeting of the port company at which the harbour master had not been present the onus would be on the harbour master, who might have <Col N="1465" /> absented himself from attending that meeting.  It may be an unintended consequence of the amendment before us that a responsibility is being placed on harbour masters which is probably not the intention of the proposers but that would be the effect if the amendment is passed.  On the other hand there could be a formula where there would be a requirement that boards of port companies would have to have the harbour master present at every meeting.  There may well be situations where board meetings might be convened to address issues where it would not be appropriate or necessary for the harbour master to be present.  We have to allow for that degree of flexibility in the operation of the port company.</P>
      <P>For example, if a port company decides to exclude harbour masters from their meetings &mdash; Deputy Bell referred to this and clearly that should not happen &mdash; there is a mechanism to address that issue.  That section permits the Minister to give directions of a policy nature to port companies on the attendance of harbour masters.  It is clear that harbour masters should be present at board meetings where matters which relate to the harbour master's duties are being discussed.</P>

It is not necessary to have it in the legislation but clearly it is a matter of policy.

We have the support of all sides for this amendment but the Minister seems to have a monopoly of wisdom on whether a harbour master should be on the new authority.  The experienced voices say differently.  The Minister should reconsider his position and if he cannot do so today he should tell us that he will look at it again when it goes to the Seanad.  There is a serious problem. The harbour masters are responsible for practically all the operations in a port and we are saying that they are not entitled on a statutory basis to attend meetings.  We are not asking for voting rights of for full membership of the board but the statutory right to attend meetings.  The Minister spoke for five minutes but he did not sound convincing. He said that if the harbour master was excluded he could then appeal to the Minister and the Minister could direct the new port authority.  I do not think that is good enough and the Minister should seize the opportunity and support the amendment from this side of the House.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 33, line 40, to delete &ldquo;A company&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;Subject to subsection (8), a company&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 40 requires new port companies to prepare and submit to the Minister for approval superannuation schemes for members of their staff.  Section 41 (1) provides that some approved schemes already in existence may continue in operation after vesting day of the new port companies.  Such approved schemes are mainly in operation at the ports of Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford.  This, in effect, means that most of the other port companies will be statutorily required to submit superannuation schemes for approval and to establish superannuation funds from which benefits will be payable. However, a number of ports, for example, Galway, Foynes, New Ross and Drogheda operate insurance-type pension schemes under which annual premia are paid to insurance companies to ensure that employees, on retirement, receive the normal retirement benefits, lump sums and pensions.  To require such port authorities to abandon their insurance-type schemes and introduce superannuation schemes under section 40 would be unreasonable.</P>
      <P>The amendment before the House empowers the Minister for the Marine by order to exempt companies with 30 or fewer employees from the requirements of section 41.  In the event that companies are so exempted it would of course be necessary to ensure that insurance-type schemes that provide for benefits in line with public sector norms are in place and continue in place.  This is also provided for in the new subsection. As amendment No. 24 is consequential, I recommend the two amendments to the House.</P>

While they are few in number, it should be noted that we recognise the effort made by them.  The system of funding superannuation from current revenue will pose a problem, but the Minister will have to deal with that matter at a later stage.  Drogheda Port has a unique record in this regard.  It operates a superannuation scheme that is not only adequately funded but is operated by the dockers trade union in the port.  Port users make a contribution on behalf of each worker they employ and the scheme is operated, funded, insured and controlled by a committee of trustees consisting mainly of dockers and port workers.  I am pleased that matter has been noted.</P>

      <Col N="1472" /> (a) a fund established by a company under paragraph (a) or (c) of subsection (3) or continued in existence in relation to it by virtue of subsection (1) (c) (ii) does not comprise sufficient moneys as will enable the payment from that fund of superannuation benefits under the scheme or schemes concerned as and when those benefits fall due for payment, and</P>
    <P>(b)  the said company does not have resources from which there could be paid the said benefits as and when they fall due for payment, </P>
    <P>then the Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, pay to the trustees concerned such amount in respect of liabilities of the said scheme or schemes that have arisen prior to the relevant vesting day as he or she may determine.&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>Amendment No. 26 provides that the Minister for the Marine may, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, pay to the trustees of certain pension schemes moneys in respect of certain liabilities that have arisen prior to the relevant vesting day.  This provision applies only to port companies to be established under the Harbours Bill.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that at Select Committee I touched briefly on the pension liabilities of harbour authorities. Historically harbour authorities operated a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; system for pensions rather than having a specific pensions fund.  This system is no longer in accord with acceptable standards. Under the Pensions Act, 1990, and under the provisions of this Bill, harbours must build up pension funds.  The building up of pension funds is a costly process and while some harbour authorities are in the process of building up a fund others are only beginning to do so now and it will take some time for them to put fully funded schemes in place.  In particular both Dublin Port and Waterford Harbour have serious shortfalls in their pension funds.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> The Government is taking action to secure pensions and to ensure that the harbour authorities build up the necessary funds.  Consultants have been employed to do a comprehensive study of the financial status of harbour authorities, including the long-term funding requirements of the ports and how these are to be achieved, taking due account of measures to meet the appropriate funding standards for pension schemes under the Pensions Act.  I expect that this study will be available very shortly.</P>
    <P>If it is found that some harbour authorities cannot build up the required funds within the timescale set out in the Pensions Act it will be necessary to remove from the scope of Part IV of the Pensions Act those pension schemes or parts thereof which do not meet the required funding standard, and the purpose of amendment No. 26 is to allow for this.  The effect of removing pension schemes from the scope of the Pensions Act is that such schemes will avail of Exchequer cover; in the unlikely event that port companies cannot meet their pension obligations the State will undertake to do so.</P>
    <P>This provision will also allow for the payment of moneys by the Exchequer into a pension fund to build up that fund.  The provision is enabling only and will only be invoked in the direst of circumstances where the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Finance are satisfied that an Exchequer contribution towards a pension fund at a port company is absolutely necessary.  Any such contribution will only be made on foot of a plan agreed by the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Finance with the company and the trustees of the pension scheme which provides for building up the pension fund over a specified period.</P>
    <P>Policy will be to minimise the Exchequer exposure in this regard through ensuring that every effort is made by the harbour authorities/port companies to provide for the funding of pre-vesting day pension liabilities themselves. I want to state clearly and strongly that: (i) the purpose of the <Col N="1474" /> amendment is only to provide a back-stop guarantee against the eventuality that certain harbours may be unable, through trading performance, or closure, from meeting pensions liabilities; I also want to make it quite clear that Exchequer intervention will only occur in the direst of circumstances; (ii) harbours will be expected to make every effort to fund all pensions liabilities through improved trading, asset sales etc.; the strategic plans of the boards will be required to provide for a mechanism by which funds are brought up to the funding standard requirements of the Pensions Act; the Exchequer's back-stop guarantee will only operate until such time as the boards can reasonably attain that status; (iii) there will be a stringent case by case approach for example, notwithstanding the text of the amendment there will be no question that certain categories of liabilities, such as pre-vesting day, will be automatically Exchequer funded for all bodies; (iv) the intention is that when the study, which has been commissioned into the current and prospective viability of the harbour authorities is completed, I will consider further in conjunction with the Minister for Finance and the harbour authorities how best to put the necessary measures in place to enable the pension schemes to meet the funding standards of the Pensions Act.  The DKM study is now almost completed and the consultant's report and recommendations should be available within the next two weeks or so.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 27 provides that moneys required by the Minister for the Marine or the Minister for Finance under this section shall be advanced out of the central fund or the growing produce thereof.  In this regard moneys will be required by the Minister for Finance to enable him to meet his obligations under subsection (5) which relate to transfer of staff from the Department of the Marine to the new Dún Laoghaire harbour company and moneys may be required by the Minister for the Marine in accordance with the new subsection <Col N="1475" /> (9) which arises from amendment No. 26.</P>
    <P>The purpose of amendment No. 62 is to provide that in respect of harbour authorities which remain under the Harbours Act, 1946, moneys may be made available, by way of grants or loans, to cover pension liabilities, in respect of pension schemes made in accordance with section 151 of the 1946 Act, where the harbour authorities do not have the resources to cover such payments.  The Harbours Act, 1946, does not make provision for the payment of State grant assistance to harbour authorities towards pension costs.  This provision will provide emergency cover for pensioners in the event that the harbour authority cannot pay pensions out of its own resources.  The harbour authorities covered by this provision are the small harbours where one or two persons only are employed.  The intention is that the section will remain in force for a period of not more than five years after the commencement date of the section and that moneys, if any, made available will be in respect of a period of 12 months only, after which time the matter will be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The ultimate aim of these amendments is to ensure that existing harbour pensioners and the employees of harbour companies and harbour commissioners will have their pension entitlements honoured in full and, if necessary, the Exchequer will provide the necessary finance to achieve this. However I stress again that the primary responsibility for ensuring that pension funds are adequate for this purpose will continue to rest with the individual harbour companies and harbour commissioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed contribution on this very complicated issue.  The question of pension status has been very high on the agenda of many employees of the new companies.  As I understand it, all employees who have provided long service can be assured that irrespective of <Col N="1476" /> what happens in the development of these companies their pension position is ultimately guaranteed by the State.  I concur with the Minister that responsibility to build up the pension fund and generate good and proper practice should rest with the new companies.  It is right that employees should make provision for their own future.</P>
      <P>If we look at the figures provided by the Minister on Committee Stage, there is a substantial shortfall.  For example, there is no provision for Dublin Port where the requirement is about £50 million.  In Waterford, my own area, there is an immediate requirement of £4 million.  It is likely that it will not be possible for companies to build up pension funds in the timeframe outlined; it will take a substantial time to do so.  I think the Minister will agree that we are shooting in the dark in this regard.  The Minister has not yet received the DKM report.  The implications of its recommendations on how this matter should be dealt with will be of interest.  I concur with the Minister's views on the genuine burden borne by many families.  There was deep concern in that regard in the portal area of Waterford.</P>
      <P>In my harbour authority area harbour pilots were to some degree self-employed although effectively they were employed by the harbour authority. The way their employment is structured they could be seen as being self-employed.  The reality is that their job is part and parcel of the work of the harbour authority.  In terms of figures the Minister might supply on pension funds and the requirements of a harbour authority area, the interests of pilots are as important as that of other employees in the harbour authority area.  Will the Minister clarify if the overall figures he gave for harbour authority areas included pilots as this issue is of deep concern to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the general direction of the amendments and some of the Minister's statements that if we want companies to operate commercially the same commercial criteria must apply to them from management down to <Col N="1477" /> employees, and they must provide for their future.  Companies and their employees have a responsibility to ensure that henceforth proper schemes are put in place so that staff can be assured of their entitlements when they reach retirement age.  As the Minister is aware the State can no longer fund so many different areas of pension requirements out of current expenditure.  We will be faced with a bill of approximately £850 million per annum and it will increase in the next few years.  The message emanating from this aspect of the Bill will have to be taken up on a broader base within the State sector.  I am happy that the bottom line is that pensions and people's entitlements will be protected.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister indicate if pilots have been included in the figures?  Will he lay the DKM report before the House and place it in the Dáil Library so that we may have access to it? Members from constituencies in which there are ports are interested in this live issue.  It would be appreciated if the Minister made that report available.  It should not be kept within the confines of his office or the Department as we have the right to know its recommendations which may seriously affect people's lives.  That would encourage a proper and healthy debate on what the final position may be.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>All members welcome the provision which seeks to ensure proper statutory provision for superannuation schemes that must operate under the new structures proposed.  The Bill highlights the differences between the existing arrangements harbour authorities have made in relation to pension payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand the Dublin Port authorities pay out £3 million annually from their current revenue to meet their pension liabilities.  This is approximately one-third of their receipts from harbour charges.  The Minister carefully worded his contribution regarding the conditions that will apply and he indicated <Col N="1478" /> on Committee Stage that harbour authorities should not view the provisions of the Bill as a bonanza to make up for their lack of investment in superannuation funds.  However, the figures are enormous.  The sum of £50 million that would be required in a pension fund to make adequate provision for the future pension commitments of the Dublin Port is enormous.  The Minister referred to disposals to build up that fund quickly.  In practical terms how realistic is it to expect that a port like Dublin will succeed in building up a £50 million fund during the short period to which the Minister referred?</P>
    <P>Figures indicate that in Limerick port there is a need to increase the fund from £1.3 million to £2 million and, as we have been told, Waterford port which did not make provision for a fund will require £3.9 million.  Waterford, like other ports along the east coast, is developing and has ongoing investment in increasing and improving its infrastructure and substantial grants are being made available from the European Union to assist in that type of development.  The Minister has not explained how he expects such large sums to be built up in a short period.  Is he telling the House that the Exchequer will have to provide those funds?  What mechanism does the Minister have to ensure the achievement of the objective he outlined, whereby every effort, encouragement and pressure will be kept on companies to ensure that they build up those funds as quickly as possible. What does all that mean in practical commercial terms?  The Minister has not explained how that objective can be achieved in the timescale.  We can only conclude that the Exchequer will have to provide those funds to ensure that pension entitlements of the employees concerned are properly provided for.  Of all the important issues we have discussed, as this one involves such major sums of money, it deserves further explanation from the Minister.  I hope he can give one before the amendment is put.</P>
    <P>Great credit is due to those who built <Col N="1479" /> up funds and made adequate arrangements. It is irregular to pay pensions out of current revenue and that position cannot be tolerated.  There must be change irrespective of who or what party is in Government.  The Government has a duty to ensure that adequate statutory provision is made, and we would support such a measure in the House.  I am puzzled as to how the objectives of building up such huge funds in such a short time will be achieved without having to resort to the Exchequer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome the Minister's amendment dealing with superannuation. We cannot reach conclusions as to what will happen until we see the DKM report.  I agree with Deputy Cullen that this report should be made available to Members, many of whom have direct links with ports and port workers.  It should at least be available in the Dáil Library.  There is no doubt that all trade unions were concerned about this subject and viewed it as one of the most serious matters to be dealt with under the legislation.</P>
      <P>In these amendments the Minister has found a fair balance.  However, it must be remembered that somebody has to fund this Bill which arose out of irresponsibility on the part of some ports. While some ports paid their way and covered their workers who themselves made a contribution, others ignored their responsibilities.  The problem was created by port authorities.  While I welcome the fact that workers in the port will be guaranteed their pensions, it was no fault of the trade unions that this mess arose.  Huge sums of money are involved.  In the case of Dublin port I am not sure that £50 million will cover the bill for what needs to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister struck a balance which will allow for the cover of workers and at the same time put a certain amount of responsibility on the boards of these new companies.  If they are to operate with the freedom we have all been talking about, they have a responsibility to <Col N="1480" /> put their house in order in the shortest possible time, taking into account the financial constraints that may be on them.  Other workers in the PAYE sector, including those in the docks, will have to pay the bill.  I look forward to seeing the proposals being put forward in the DKM report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Members for their contributions on this subject.  As Deputy Cullen said there has been some worry on the part of pensioners of harbour commissioners and employees of harbour boards that their pension entitlements would not be met.  The first thing people can be absolutely clear about is that those worries can be put firmly to rest, irrespective of the history of the pensions problem in a number of ports.  The first priority is to protect the pension entitlements and rights of those who are on pension and those in employment who may be worried about their pension rights.  These amendments ensure that whatever happens, whether companies trade well or badly or how well they manage to set up their pension funds or where a harbour company might conceivably go out of business, the rights of the pensioners and the pension rights of the employees will be protected. They will be protected, if necessary, by Exchequer funding &mdash; either by the Exchequer building up the fund or by the pensions concerned being taken out of the remit of the pensions Act and being provided through the Exchequer. No matter what happens, the pensions of pensioners and employees are protected by the amendments I am putting forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that nobody in the port companies or anywhere else gets the impression that the pensions problem is now resolved, that the Exchequer will write the cheque, that this is some kind of blank cheque for the pension obligations of the port companies, that they do not have to worry about the problem and that the Minister for the Marine and the Minister for Finance will look after the problem.  I want to dispel that notion absolutely.  The first obligation in <Col N="1481" /> relation to pensions will be one for the port companies.  We know a certain amount about the extent of the problem.  I say that subject to what additional information may become available to us through the DKM report.  The port of Cork has a pension fund amounting to £13.6 million which needs to be built up to about £18.9 million; Dublin Port does not have a pension fund but a fund of approximately £50 million is needed, £32 million is to fulfil past liability and £18 million for future liability.  Limerick Port has a fund of £1.3 million which needs to be built up to about £2 million; Waterford Port does not have a fund and one of about £3.9 million needs to be created.  We are talking about substantial funds which will have to be built up.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Depending on what the DKM study reveals it may be marginally plus or minus in individual ports but it is a great problem.  The purpose of the DKM study is to identify what resources may be available to the companies to address the problem, the likely trading position and the capacity of those ports to establish those funds. Following receipt of the DKM study, the intention is to have discussions with the boards of the port companies about how that liability can be met.  We cannot anticipate the outcome of those discussions until we have available to us the DKM study and until the process gets under way.  I do not underestimate the difficulty of building up those funds. I want to emphasise that the port companies will have to address the problem. It may be that a longer period than that mentioned earlier may have to be given to some of the companies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the point.  This is not providing a blank cheque.  The purpose of these amendments is to reassure the pensioners and the <Col N="1482" /> employees of those companies that come hell or high water their pensions will be paid.  I want to make it clear that this will not be in the form of a blank cheque to the port companies or in the form of some kind of financial guarantee to the companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reason I am emphasising it.  The primary responsibility will be on the port companies to address the problem of how the pension funds are to be established.  They will have to look to their own resources, future trading and commercial prospects in order to meet those liabilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The liability has already been built up in those ports.  Many different reasons can be given as to how it happened.  Various pensions experts, actuaries and so on, will view the problem differently but the companies will have to address the problem and seek a solution from their resources and from their trading position.  That is being made clear to the companies concerned.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to formulate a comprehensive and co-ordinated national policy on early education embracing all existing providers of early education in Ireland at present and calls on the Ministers for Education and Health to take the following interim steps as a means towards achieving this objective:</P>

Tá sé mar phríomh-aidhm aige polasaí náisiúnta oideachais don aos óg <Col N="1485" /> a chruthú a bheadh comhraghaithe agus forleathan agus ag an am céanna a bhainfeadh fiuntas iomlán &mdash; agus tá sin an-thábhachtach &mdash; as na seirbhísigh uilig atá ar fáil i láthair na huaire.</P>
      <P>Molaim freisin cuid de na gnéithe atá i bhfeidhm ag an Aire ach tá an modh ginearálta lochtach.</P>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy Martin on bringing this motion before the House and for the obvious research into its formulation.  In particular, I congratulate him on the constructive and positive spirit in which he introduced it.  In supporting his case I want to refer briefly to some of the points behind the motion.</P>
      <P>I do not wish to knock the early start programme.  As I understand it and from talking to teachers, including former colleagues, the early start programme is based on the philosophy of early intervention being targeted at areas of greatest socio-economic disadvantage and marginalisation.  It reminds me of the head start programme undertaken in the United States which I studies many years ago.  That programme was introduced in the 1970s but as I cannot recall its details and could not find any information about it last night, I cannot say to what extent the early start programme models itself on the United States programme.  I recall that case studies were carried out at the time which indicated that this type of early intervention had obvious positive effects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must declare a previous vested interest in regard to this debate.  I am not saying that primary teachers are not the appropriate profession to implement the early start programme's elements and modules and I am satisfied that nothing in this motion attempts to make that charge.  The Fianna Fáil position is that the whole question of early childhood education, if it is to seriously and profoundly address the major challenges faced by a young child growing up in an increasingly more complex environment, must take full account of the totality of needs of the three year old child.  We are saying there must be <Col N="1486" /> a comprehensive, co-ordinated national policy in this area.  In the absence of such a clearly thought out and well defined policy all that is left is patchwork. Despite all the merits of the early start programme, without a national policy there will be merely patchwork and <i>ad hoc</i> solutions.  The Minister of State is, unwittingly, going down this road.</P>
    <P>I do not intend detailing the merits of the philosophy and ideology of play and creativity for children; all of us who have studied education are fully familiar with those.  The challenge to this House is for a full national debate on the needs of the pre-school child and I am glad the Minister of State with responsibility for children is present.  Such a debate will have to embrace all the existing providers of early education, including voluntary groups, the community, professionals and statutory organisations.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister of State &mdash; and he has had a great deal of involvement with children &mdash; that if the early start programme is progressed and expanded and if the Department's policy proceeds along that line, it will create a two-tier system.  That is very dangerous because those who opt for the State system the Minister has hurriedly put in place will have enormous resources, and I concede that major resources are being made available to the early start programme. Those who continue to opt for the non-State structures, already in place in some cases for over 20 years, or who cannot find places on the early start programme will be at an acute disadvantage. Is this duplication really necessary?  Has the Minister sufficiently thought out what she wants to achieve in relation to the whole question of early childhood education?  I believe she has not.  In turning her back on the providers of this service, she made a fundamental blunder but it not too late for her to seriously examine the suggestion behind this motion.</P>

      <P>I will not have time to go through the various aspects of the motion but I pay tribute to the work of <Col N="1487" /> the Irish Pre-School Playgroups' Association which has worked in areas of social disadvantage, with which I am familiar, when nobody else either seemed to care or to be doing anything for children in that age group.  I hope its concerns will be met by the Minister.</P>
      <P>I want to concentrate on the Government amendment to this motion which I find quite offensive.  I refer in particular to the first section which commends the Government for the initiatives it has taken to alleviate the effects of social disadvantage on the educational welfare of children.  This Government has done the exact opposite.  It has concentrated resources on the children of the rich who least need them by giving free third level education at a time when primary education&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and supposedly is here to represent the children who need it most, those living in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>I am still waiting for the Minister for Education to respond to a request from many groups throughout the centre of Dublin &mdash; the Minister of State present is aware of this &mdash; for a community college in the Sean McDermott Street area. The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, was positive in his response to me but, unfortunately, the Minister does not appear to be in a position to make a decision on this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputy Currie is also familiar with the Cherry Orchard area of Ballyfermot where they do not have any school. There is 50 per cent unemployment in the area and the children of those people, whom our friends in the Labour Party were elected to represent, cannot afford to travel to schools in other districts. The area has the highest absenteeism from primary schools in this State.  Yet this Government, instead of providing resources to give hope to children in these areas, concentrates most of the resources available on third level education, conferring benefit on people who need it least.  I find that extraordinary, particularly considering the presence of two so-called left wing parties in this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is offensive to hear this Government propose an amendment to this good and comprehensive motion, an amendment which makes claims that could not be further from the truth.  I know there are concerned elements within the Government.  I ask Deputy Currie to speed up decisions on the <Col N="1489" /> issues I have addressed on numerous occasions in this House.  If the Government does that, not just in the two areas I mentioned although they are probably the most acute areas of disadvantage in this State, it will be doing something to alleviate social disadvantage.  If it continues to ignore those areas, it cannot with any integrity put amendments like this before us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased they are now focusing on early school education. Fianna Fáil Ministers for Finance have been extremely slow to put money into and support the development of services in this area.  Their motion comes when this Government has not just given a commitment to but put resources into this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to ask why a country whose Constitution claims that all children are cherished equally produced a political system which had such an insensitive and incomplete response to the welfare of children in the past.  We are aware now, because it has been forced upon us, that the welfare of children in Ireland has been a hit and miss affair.  We are aware that there is gross abuse of children within the sacrosanct shrine of the family and that the pattern of family life is changing utterly, with vast implications for children.  We must pull together the scattered threads of our concern for children into a national <Col N="1490" /> policy of which we can be proud.  This Government has that national policy under way.  There is increased money for child care, an Early Start programme, both a committee and a commission on the family and increased focus on investing resources in disadvantaged areas.  However, more needs to be done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Early Start initiative which is extremely important.  It is also important to give credit to the many women and parents in disadvantaged communities who, without State help over a long period, put in great effort to develop pre-schools in their communities. I am pleased to hear Ministers say there is good consultation and liaison with the providers of those services in communities and that a way has been found to link the work in the Early Start programmes with the resources these communities have already put in place. There is great scope for co-operation between the two.</P>
    <P>Early Start education is important.  It is clear from international research that if we invest money in young children, particularly disadvantaged young children, we reap the rewards later.  For every pound invested during the early years, we save £20 at a later stage and we help to move children away from the paths of truancy, delinquency and from being caught up in the justice system. We have been negligent about developing these services and we have been frightened that, by developing services for children, we will somehow undermine the family.  This is far from the truth because we support families by giving children these services and we create stronger families.  I call on the Minister for Education to expand and develop the Early Start programme once it has been monitored because it is both urgent and vital.</P>
    <P>We also need to invest resources in the primary school system generally.  I refer to a letter from a teacher in my own constituency who writes about the problems facing children in his primary school in an area where there is a high unemployment rate, poor housing, a <Col N="1491" /> high proportion of lone parents, growing drug abuse, gambling, lack of parenting skills and a high dependency on social welfare.  He tells me that within his school there is a great problem with children who are experiencing emotional and educational difficulty.  He says that this manifests itself on a daily basis in vandalism of school books and property, absenteeism, lack of punctuality, temper tantrums and aggressive behaviour towards peers.  Some 40 per cent of children in this school have reading difficulties.  It is critical to focus on the primary schools with these problems.</P>
    <P>National policy must ensure that we reduce the numbers in our primary schools as we move towards the 21st century.  We should look at the home maker services provided by the health boards and how they can be linked into schools.  One of the great changes we are seeing in primary schools is co-operation between teachers and home liaison officers and services provided by health boards.  Parents are becoming more involved.  This is an important support for teachers but primarily gives a better service to our young people.  We also must consider introducing an information programme in the primary schools on smoking, alcohol, drugs and crime.  It is not enough to bring these programmes in at secondary level.  We should also consider supplying hot meals in schools.  Many teachers tell me that children are coming in without breakfast and are unable to learn.  We should have a pilot project to ascertain whether this is feasible in certain areas.</P>
    <P>I welcome what the Minister said about the implementation of the Child Care Act.  People have been calling for its implementation for a number of years.  I regret that the social workers have some problems with the implementation of this Act on the basis that they need more resources.  It is clear that children need the protection of this Act and the Government is right to go ahead with its implementation.  I hope there can be further discussions and <Col N="1492" /> consultations between the social workers and the health boards and that this situation will not escalate further as it is not in anybody's interest.  Millions of pounds have been invested in child care over the last few years and it is making up for past neglect in the area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the implementation of regulations on pre-schools.  It is important to ensure pre-schools comform to high standards.  The regulations which will be in place shortly, following some further discussion and consultation, will ensure the standards in pre-schools are uniformly high.  This is important if we do not want a hit and miss development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Government for its initiative in alleviating the effects of social disadvantage on the education and welfare of children.  I wish, in particular, to commend my colleague, the Minister for Education, for her role in targeting disadvantage in primary and second level education and for initiating the Early Start projects.  Her work in this area indicates a political realisation of the need for a proper State funded pre-school education system.</P>
      <P>I welcome this debate on pre-school education, the first such debate in the House.  I am glad that at last attention is being paid to this vital area of education. It is interesting that the debate has been initiated by Fianna Fáil which in its typically reactive mode is trying to block the very important initiative by the Minister for Education.  This raises questions about what that party did during all the years it had control of the Department of Education and why it was not in a position to introduce a proper State funded pre-school system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>The White Paper on Education states that the Government strategy for education is characterised by the hallmark of equality.  The denial of education has powerfully negative <Col N="1493" /> social and economic consequences which are all too evident in society.  This problem implies a need for intervention in order to eliminate the source of the disadvantage and alleviate the consequences. An integral component of this intervention is pre-school education. The Early Start programme is based on three principal considerations; first, the importance of early childhood experiences for the child's development; second, the frequent difficulties which children experience on entering formal schooling; and, third, early disadvantages which affect the child's enduring experience with formal schooling. Research carried out abroad and here indicates that high quality pre-school education can play a vitally important part in offsetting the effects of social disadvantage and in preventing school failure.  The Early Start programme was initiated in the light of these findings and this is reflected in the fact that the programme was another important step in bringing our measures for dealing with educational disadvantage into line with those adopted in other EU states.</P>
      <P>The Early Start philosophy views learning as a guided discovery through a series of structured activities with the aim of developing the entire child.  The Early Start programme was established with the express objectives of introducing young children to an education programme which would enhance their overall development, prevent school failure and offset the effects of social disadvantage.  This is one of the reasons careful consideration was given to the areas selected for the pilot programme. I am very glad that two centres have been set up in Finglas South and Ballymun in my constituency.  The programme also involves parents and transition year students.  Parents are involved in the programme at three levels: first, they belong to an advisory group in each centre; second, they participate in the everyday running and organising of the centre; and, third, they join their children in many of the centre's activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1494" /> The correlation between social disadvantage and the lack of formal education is well documented and broadly accepted.  Education not only makes a fundamentally important contribution to the quality and well-being of society but also contributes in a very substantial way to an individual's quality of life and well-being.  It is extremely important, therefore, for the State to promote and support the conditions within which education can realise its potential in society.  It is through measures such as the Early Start programme that the true importance of education can be inculcated and its true potential realised.</P>
    <P>Research has shown that the three most important hallmarks of quality are accommodation and equipment, personnel qualifications and the adult-child ratio.  Early Start centres are based in good accommodation in existing classrooms and there is a considerable grant of £4,000-£5,000 per classroom for equipment.  The teachers are fully qualified teachers with experience of infant teaching, while there is an excellent adult-child ratio of 15:2.  The emphasis on these quality issues should be applied throughout the entire education system. I hope they set a precedent for future education provision.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil proposes the establishment of a national forum to look at the area of pre-school provision.  The Minister has set up a monitoring committee which will oversee the Early Start programme. It will carry out its work on an ongoing basis and will advise on best practice in relation to early education. The national forum proposed by Fianna Fáil would work in a vacuum and on a theoretical basis.  It is much better to establish a well researched programme on a pilot basis, to evaluate it and to take decisions based on its success.</P>
    <P>Nobody denies that the Early Start programme has experienced teething problems.  It is only natural that a new system would experience such problems. It is important to recognise the enormous contribution made by the voluntary and private sectors in this area.  Many of the people involved in <Col N="1495" /> this area have worked in a voluntary capacity on a shoestring budget.  In spite of this they have done much good work particularly in disadvantaged areas.  It is important to record our appreciation of the work they have done over the years.</P>
    <P>Now that we recognise the role the State must play in a properly funded system, it is important to look at ways in which we can marry the voluntary and State sectors.  Obviously the question of consultation and the location of these centres is important and there is room for improvement within the monitoring committee.  I recognise the constraints placed on the consultation process this year and I hope there will be improved consultation next year.  The question of qualifications is also important and a door must be opened for those who have vast experience and expertise in this area so that they can become involved in the Early Start programme. I am glad the Department has recognised this difficulty and I welcome the Minister's announcement that the NCVA and the NCEA are in the process of introducing a mechanism which will give accreditation to people who have experience in this area.  I would like to see this being brought about as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party believes that without due recognition of the socio-economic role of education we can never hope to realise our potential as a modern State.  Education is probably the most important formative force in a person's development on both a personal level and also as part of the community. The Labour Party is committed to ensuring that individual and collective potential are realised and the initiation of the Early Start programme is an indication of our commitment in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the final points made by my colleague, Deputy Shorthall.  The section in the White Paper dealing with education and the economy made the connection between education and an advanced economy <Col N="1496" /> and paid tribute to the great work carried out by pre-school, primary, secondary and third level teachers in helping us achieve a high tech economy.  It has been stated today that there are now more people in better jobs than at any time in our history.  The Labour Party is proud that this has been achieved under a Labour Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>The role of pre-school education and the age at which children should start formal education have been the subject of much debate internationally.  A later start is preferred in Germany and some Scandinavian countries, for example.  It is agreed internationally, however, that early intervention in deprived areas is essential.  I, therefore, commend the Minister for commencing the early start programme on a pilot basis last year and for extending it to a further 33 centres this year.</P>
      <P>Pre-school education has been developed in an <i>ad hoc</i> manner.  Nonetheless, it has to be acknowledged that an enormous effort is being made on behalf of tens of thousands of children by all the teachers in the voluntary pre-school sector who have been trained to a high standard.  They must be allowed to participate in the ongoing debate.</P>
      <P>The location of pre-schools, including the importance of locating pre-schools in the workplace, has been the subject of lengthy discussions at Dublin City Council.  Much valuable experience has been gained during the past 20 to 30 years.  I have no doubt that this will be taken into account by the Minister and the Department of Education in evaluating the early start programme and in the ongoing discussions leading to the formulation of a national pre-school programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gregory cast a slur on the Labour Party in relation to its efforts to eliminate educational disadvantage for children from a working class background. I reject this.  Since 1992 the education budget has been dramatically increased by more than 20 per cent in real terms.  The capitation grant for primary schools has been increased by almost 50 per cent in the same period.  I <Col N="1497" /> would like Deputy Gregory to speak to parents from a working class background on low incomes in my constituency who are now in a position due to a Minister for Education who is a member of the Labour Party to send their children to third level.  The Labour Party makes no appologies to anyone for this, certainly not to Fianna Fáil or people like Deputy Gregory.</P>
    <P>In commencing the early start programme the Minister was right to concentrate on deprived areas.  A number of centres are located in my constituency. I do not know whether the Ceann Comhairle has stepped inside one of the new early start centres, but it is a wonderful experience.  I visited one of the centres in the Darndale-Belcamp area some months ago where a special atmosphere was created by the 15 three-year-old children in each class as they beavered away at various tasks with their teacher, parents and child care worker.  It is almost impossible to replicate this elsewhere in the education system.</P>
    <P>I reject the notion put forward by the columnist Drapier in <i>The Irish Times</i> recently &mdash; I understand this column is written by a number of different journalists and, possibly, a number of Opposition politicians &mdash; that the Labour Party has abandoned areas such as Darndale in Dublin and others in north Cork to Democratic Left and Fianna Fáil.  I am sure that Deputy Byrne of Democratic Left who was due to speak in this debate would share my sentiments that it was not Fianna Fáil which provided the resources for the areas to which Drapier was referring, but the Labour Party which will always seek to have additional resources allocated, despite great opposition from the conservative parties, in the areas of health and education.</P>
    <P>Although it had many opportunities to do so Fianna Fáil failed to put a formal national pre-school system in place. The Labour Party is to be commended for doing so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have only been a Member of this House for three years. In that time the Labour Party has carried out its duty in terms of putting a formal pre-school system in place in deprived areas.  My colleague emphasised the need to deliver a high quality service and pointed to the current adult-child ratio of 15:2.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that my teaching colleague, Deputy Liam Fitzgerald, cast aspersions on primary teachers who play an important role and who have served their communities well.  I thought he would be the last person to do so.</P>
      <P>Parental involvement is a key feature of the early start programme.  This is happening in the two centres with which I am familiar in my constituency. Second level transition year students are also involved.  That is an interesting development.</P>
      <P>All aspects of the programme are being rigorously evaluated by the Educational Research Centre in Drumcondra, with a view to assessing the problems encountered during implementation, how it interfaces with other programmes and initiatives such as the home-school-liaison programme, the extent of parental involvement and the achievements of participants as they progress through the formal primary school system.</P>
      <P>In addition to principals, teachers and parents, the expert monitoring committee comprises representatives from the Irish Pre-School Playgroups Association, the World Organisation for Early Childhood Education, the colleges of education, the Catholic Primary School Managers Association, the INTO and the Department of Health.  The Minister has also nominated two distinguished experts on early childhood from UCD and the Dublin Institute of Technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first formal debate in this House on the subject of pre-school education. I hope that all those involved in <Col N="1499" /> the voluntary sector who have been providing a service on a shoestring budget will be encouraged with all those involved in the formal education system to participate in the ongoing debate.  I taught many children who came through the pre-school system and they did exceptionally well.  I am confident that the Minister in evaluating and expanding the programme will seek to encourage all the interests involved to participate in laying the foundations for a national pre-school system.</P>
    <P>One of the most notable features of the 27th Dáil over which the Ceann Comhairle has presided with such distinction is that the Minister has secured a massive increase in resources.</P>
    <P>She deserves great credit for that.  She has laid a wonderful foundation for the future.  We will have more good news, like that which we received in recent days on the development of the economy, in the years ahead as our children develop as the most educationally advantaged in Europe.  Our education system is, perhaps, our greatest capital investment resource, as the White Paper stated.  We have laid a good foundation in the pre-school area to carry that on.</P>

      <P>I do not intend to take the same line as the last speaker in criticising different political parties because it is a waste of my valuable time.  I want to concentrate on the important issues covered by this debate, irrespective of from which side of the motion one comes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also take this opportunity to point out to Deputy Frances Fitzgerald that in her comments regarding the treatment of children over the years she neglected to point out that it was my party, after a series of wide consultations which were held leading up to 1991, which was responsible for enacting the Child Care <Col N="1500" /> Act, 1991.  My colleague, the then Minister for Education, Deputy O'Rourke, introduced the new home-school liaison officer and the school psychological service. These are only a couple of small contributions but Fianna Fáil has made many contributions over the years to the development of education and child care and the party takes a certain pride in this.  We accept we have a long way to go in terms of providing facilities for pre-school children and I hope this debate will help to concentrate the minds of those who have the power to make such decisions.</P>
    <P>In my role as Minister of State at the Department of Health with responsibility for child care, I took the opportunity in the short time available to establish an &ldquo;out of hours&rdquo; services for the young homeless in Dublin, for example, and to provide a mobile health clinic for travellers, wherever they were located, on official or unofficial sites.  I understand both services are working quite well.</P>
    <P>In any role which it has been called upon to play, Fianna Fáil has been conscious of its contribution to the development of child care and child care facilities. For that reason this debate is timely.  Frankly, I would prefer to avoid this slagging which we have seen earlier in the debate as it does not help anybody. Let us get on with the issues.</P>
    <P>The motion on the early start programme gives us the opportunity to discuss this important issue.  My colleague, Deputy Martin, set out clearly in this contribution many of the current concerns of the Opposition about the present operation of the early start programme. We are not saying there should not be a programme.  We have some pertinent points to make which the Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, might well consider taking up even at this stage.</P>
    <P>Among a number of calls we make on the issue is the need to establish a national forum because one of the criticisms coming through time and time again on the early start programme is the lack of consultation, particularly <Col N="1501" /> with the voluntary and community sectors. This is the kernel of the problem and the area from which the complaint comes.  Unlike the Child Care Act, 1991, where there was wide consultation with interested groups who influenced the content of the Act in the end, the same opportunity was not given to those working in this pre-school area on as wide a basis.  That is where the criticism comes from and if that consultation had taken place, we might have been able to further develop the early start programme, perhaps in a different way but certainly involving the voluntary and community sectors.  I believe genuinely that at this stage in the development of a child, that sector has a role to play.</P>
    <P>The compelling reasons for setting up the forum were twofold: first, we needed to consult; and, second, we needed a co-ordinated approach to the provision of early education because it does not exist, if it did, early education would be the better for it.</P>
    <P>To illustrate the lack of co-ordination in funding, for example, the following provide pre-school facilities for children; primary schools, nursery schools, Montessori schools, play school groups and naíonraí, the Irish créches.  They provide a service and have been doing so for quite a long time but this Government finds itself, as, in fact, other Governments did, funding it through a whole range of Government Departments. The Department of Education, the Department of Health, through the health boards because they grant-aid community play groups, the Department of the Environment, through its consultative role under the Child Care Act, 1991, in relation to setting up play schools and certain facilities in them, particularly in terms of safety, are all involved.  Even the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry has become involved under the Leader II programme and the Department of Enterprise and Employment, through FÁS training schemes in the child care area.  The Department of Equality and Law Reform is involved too, through a pilot child care initiative, which is <Col N="1502" /> funded through its 1994 budget.  I have not been able to get too much detail on the latter initiative but I understand that is where the funding comes from.  The Department of Social Welfare, of course, funds various child care projects, particular with reference to disadvantaged areas.  Practically every Department is involved in the provision of pre-school facilities and services.  That is where the lack of co-ordination arises and where a national forum might help to focus on what may be a wasteful distribution of resources, which are always tight.  That is another reason the forum was a particularly good idea.</P>
    <P>The Minister missed a valuable opportunity to work more closely with the voluntary sector because of lack of consultation.  I believe the voluntary sector would have said many things to the Minister which might well have influenced the manner in which the service was set up and the difficulties it caused in some areas.  In one parish in my constituency, where the first of the early start programmes was established, the existing pre-school play group had to vacate the school classrooms because the new service was being made available. In fact, I raised the matter on the Adjournment at the time in early 1994 and the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne FitzGerald responded.  Four ordinary people living in the area contacted me when they discovered they were going to lose the facility of a classroom in the area because this other service was being established.  They had built up a good relationship with parents and youngsters over the years and it was unfortunate that happened through a lack of consultation.</P>
    <P>The Minister could have taken other options in introducing the early start programme and might well have included an initiative with the voluntary sector even if she was treating it as a pilot scheme.  She could have explained to the voluntary sector what she was trying to do.  She could have asked them if they could play a role become involved or bring their experience to bear on what the Department was trying to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> They could also have been asked if the voluntary sector could become part and parcel of the early start programme. Unfortunately, that did not happen.  It should have and the voluntary sector ought, at least, to have been given a chance.</P>
    <P>If the early start programme continues to expand and be successful, it will push aside the groups which are already working in the community and voluntary sectors.  All the experience and local commitment which these groups have brought to bear will evaporate, which is unfortunate.  That is another reason wider consultation and a national forum might have given us an opportunity to tackle the issue in a much better way.</P>
    <P>I met members of the IPPA, an association which was ahead of its time, when I was Minister of State at the Department.  The association, set up in 1969, catered for 22,000 children and with a membership of 1,700 was a substantial organisation with a vast level of experience.  It had its own rules, regulations and standards, received State funding and many different State agencies used its network.  When I met the members they were talking about recruiting advisers and extending into sparsely populated rural areas.</P>
    <P>There is a lack of understanding and sympathy for the organisation.  That is why we believe the forum or pilot initiative might be a better approach.  It is not too late for that.  We are talking about eight early start programmes which are up and running and a further 21 or 22 which is a drop in the ocean.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board region 200 social workers have indicated they find it impossible to operate the provisions of the Child Care Act which is to come into force next Tuesday.  The onus on this occasion may well rest with the health board.  I agree with Mr. Tierney of the ISPCC when he said: &ldquo;let us get on with it and implement the provisions&rdquo;. We have waited long enough for the implementation of various sections.  Adequate funding, resources <Col N="1504" /> and structures must be put in place as the Act cannot be implemented if the basic structures have not been provided. I wish the Minister well in tackling this issue and hope he is successful.  Children will suffer if this row continues.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with some of the comments made by backbencers on the Government side.  They engaged in slagging matches which will not help one child who is affected by the early start programme.  I ask the Minister to try to involve the community, the voluntary and private sector which has been so committed to this area and particularly the association I mentioned which has a contribution to make.  Unfortunately it has been brushed aside by the Minister who is determined to pursue her own course.  There should be consultations between the two sides to see if they could work together and put the best system in place in the shortest possible time.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to debate this most fundamental part of education.  Over the past 20 years there has been an immense growth in early childhood services, for the most part unregulated and under-financed. This growth has developed for a number of reasons.  The number of mothers in the workforce has led to child care becoming a political issue. Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned the head start movement in the late 1960s. Research into that movement demonstrated the intervention possibilities of pre-school provision for disadvantaged children.  Early childhood care and education have received little attention in general and virtually none at policy or Government level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his book on &ldquo;Childcare Services in Ireland&rdquo;, Robbie Gilligan highlights the fact that although we have a high regard for children at a personal level, &ldquo;child centred public policy in Ireland is more the exception than the rule&rdquo;.  In comparison to our European partners, and despite the advances of the past few years, we remain with Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the UK, lowest in <Col N="1505" /> terms of publicly funded child care provision for young children.</P>
    <P>That emphasis must change because we cannot consider children in terms of what they will become or their future as adults &mdash; we must consider what children are now.  We need children who will cope and succeed as adults, but there is very little debate on how early experiences that are developmentally appropriate can facilitate the development of children who can think, cope and adapt in a rapidly changing world.</P>
    <P>My party sees children as a starting point in our plans for the future, particularly at a time when we cannot predict the knowledge and skills they will need. We must ensure they can adapt to and cope with change and think flexibly. Child services were provided on an unregulated and <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  There are many committed providers of various types of services working to ensure that their service is of the highest calibre.  It is necessary to plan if we are to ensure the best for children.  That requires the investment of resources and the collection of information so that various services exist to meet varied needs.  In order to plan efficiently and cost effectively, we need to gather material on the number of children and services, those using different services, the spread of services and so on.  This must be done urgently if we are to present a policy and begin planning good quality services across the country.  The Government need not take on the complete administration of these services but it must support that type of initiative.  It can do so by having a policy within which services can develop.</P>
    <P>Many voluntary and private bodies which administer services work well but they lack support and a structure within which to grow and develop.  There is a role for the State in that and, perhaps, as suggested in the motion, through a national forum.  The Child Care Act clearly allocates responsibility to the Department of Health and to the Minister with responsibility for the co-ordination of children's services.  It is important that the provisions of the Act <Col N="1506" /> are implemented and it is unfortunate that there are difficulties with this due to a lack of resources.</P>
    <P>Different services have different needs and a study of training courses, their objectives, outcomes and validation should be conducted.  The Minister rightly established a monitoring committee which is specific to the early start programme.  There is provision in the Child Care Act for monitoring which should be extended to provide evaluation and determine what should go into quality child care services generally. I advocate a system of registration and regulation for full day care services. We should be able to collate and disseminate information on issues of concern to the education and welfare of young children and perhaps this could be done by an agency run independently by a board of management with members from both the statutory and voluntary sectors.  Funding for such a body should not be a problem as it could be derived from voluntary, trust and membership fee sources, for example.  It is important to have an independent evaluation and review of services.  Without information on what is already happening, it is impossible to plan or budget effectively.</P>
    <P>Some Members of the Labour Party referred to what the White Paper on Education says about our education services generally. It pays very little attention to the early years as being one of the most important stages in educational development, which in a way implies that what we are now doing is satisfactory whereas it is not.</P>
    <P>For example, Part VII, section 50 of the Child Care Act, 1991 draws a distinction between a pre-school child and a child attending national school &mdash;&ldquo;pre-school child&rdquo; meaning a child who has not attained the age of six years and who is not attending a national school or a school providing an educational programme similar to a national school.</P>
    <P>Clearly, then, there is a division between care and education.  While it is understandable that the Department of <Col N="1507" /> Health should not concern itself with a service regulated by the Department of Education, there is no Government policy on the provision of early education for our young children.  We must insist on a national policy on education from the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>Our services fall between too many different agencies and Departments, which is fundamentally wrong.</P>
    <P>In 1989 the European Council of Ministers of Education passed a resolution on measures to be implemented to combat failure at school which stated:</P>
    <P>The member states, in the framework of their educational policies and constitutional structures, will make every effort to combat failure at school....</P>
    <P>and went on to outline a number of proposals, one being the strengthening of pre-primary education which contributes to a better subsequent performance at school, particularly in the case of children from disadvantaged backgrounds.</P>
    <P>The report of the Review Body on the Primary Curriculum produced in May 1990 stressed:</P>
    <P>The need for early intervention strategies to ensure greater access to primary education for disadvantaged children.  A substantial body of research from Ireland and abroad suggested that properly structured professionally staffed pre-primary provision can foster positive attitudes to schooling and can contribute significantly to the development of linguistic and cognitive abilities among disadvantaged children.</P>
    <P>Therefore there must be wide discussion on policy and practice in early education in general, with particular regard to children at risk of educational failure.  I have no difficulty with the principle of the early start programme.  Contrary to the impression created, including by some contributors this evening, that is not the purpose of this motion.  There is no quarrel with the rationale behind the programme, rather the quarrel is with <Col N="1508" /> the manner in which it has been introduced, the Minister ignoring the facilities already available within the community.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shorthall referred to teething problems but I am afraid the problems are somewhat deeper.  There is a certain degree of unevenness in the quality of services provided, which highlights the necessity for regulation.  The Minister has ignored the facilities already provided over many decades.  She was embarrassed into engaging in consultation with members of various organisations who Members of the Labour Party say should have been consulted, but no consultations were willingly undertaken.</P>
    <P>People providing pre-school facilities may well ask why we should incur additional expense since there is already a pre-school facility available.  How can we ascertain what is needed without consultation?  Had there been a proper consultation as promised, the Minister would have had better information to enable her make an informed choice on which children would most benefit from an early intervention programme, and could establish where the early start programme should be placed to best advantage for our children.  There has been a dearth of consultation on the early start programme.</P>
    <P>In June 1991 the ESRI said in its report under the heading &ldquo;Education, Employment and Training in the Youth Labour Market&rdquo; that early intervention is advocated to combat early school leaving and went on to say:</P>
    <P>Essential in such an innovation in educational policy would be intervention at an early age, built around the development of stronger links between school, home and the community. Remedial provision, curricular reform and so on, if introduced at the post-primary level, while obviously helpful, would be insufficient.</P>
    <P>The ESRI talked there about links with the community.  One cannot establish <Col N="1509" /> links with a community without consultation with that community, which is where the Minister has really fallen down.</P>
    <P>We have already heard about the financial sense of early intervention.  In the Perry pre-school programme study of 1962, Dr. David Weikart discovered that for every $1,000 invested in a high quality, pre-school programme, the return to society was $4,000, mainly through reduced costs of remedial education, reduced legal procedures in the case of delinquent behaviour and increased lifetime earning for its participants.</P>
    <P>Along with Froebel, Montessori, Dewey, Piaget and others of more recent years, the Progressive Democrats believe that money invested in the early years of a child's life &mdash; when unconscious learning is gradually brought to the conscious level &mdash; is money wisely invested.  An example of the Minister's incomprehensible decision in regard to the Early Start programme was her refusal to employ Montessori teachers. The Minister of State said last evening that teachers participating in the Early Start programme must have complete mobility within the school in which they are employed and went on to say it was doubtful whether Montessori teachers would wish to apply for the position of child care workers.  Of course, they will not want to apply for positions as child care workers.  They want to apply for posts as teachers, which is their due after a long training in early childhood psychology and education.  Any graduates of colleges accredited to the NCEA should be able to apply for teachers posts, not as assistants; they want their education and training acknowledged.  Those who have worked long and hard and gained much expertise over many years within community pre-school groups need to have their expertise and work acknowledged and deserve that recognition.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State rightly pointed out the quality issues in pre-schooling, citing as its hallmarks, professionally trained staff.  In that case why are those <Col N="1510" /> who are specifically trained, with accreditation from the NCEA excluded?</P>
    <P>While we all like to be bolstered up from time to time it is a bit rich that, any time we attempt to discuss educational policy in this Chamber &mdash; not often enough as far as I am concerned &mdash; Labour backbenchers are wheeled in to deliver eulogies on the Minister's performance. It does not add anything to the debate.  One might have thought they would be the very people who would clamour for the type of strategy called for in this motion.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to support this motion.  It underscores the fact that we are moving in the wrong direction.  The Minister does not consult sufficiently, takes decisions and thereafter must pick up the bits and pieces.  That is most unfortunate, since we are all agreed on the value of early intervention.  The Early Start programme is a good one but why could we not have had consultation, with community groups, who know the needs and have worked with their communities over many years?  I find such lack of consultation absolutely amazing and am indeed sorry the Minister appears to turn the blind eye to this so frequently.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have the opportunity to outline to the House my policy on pre-school education. I am greatly encouraged by the Opposition's belated but nonetheless welcome interest in and appreciation of the need for a high quality pre-school education system.  I welcome the recognition that pre-school and infant education is of equal importance to education in all sectors.  This has always been my position as a professional early educator and I am delighted to be in a position to do something about it now as Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Early education requires the same high standards of professional training that we have in other educational sectors. Ireland's high standards are the <Col N="1511" /> envy of many European Union countries where the training and conditions of staff are lower for pre-school than for primary education.</P>
    <P>No step in Irish education has been as well reported on and researched.  There have been exhaustive reports, studies, conferences and publications on this issue over the last 25 years.  We are not short of recommendations and policy statements, but until last year when the Early Start programme was introduced we were woefully short on action.</P>
    <P>The Government can proudly claim to have a comprehensive policy of tackling disadvantage in education.  The Early Start is just the latest strand to be put into operation in this area.  In moving the amendment, my colleague Deputy Allen, referred to the very adequate funding of the Early Start project through capitation grants, allocation of additional staffing for schools, and a dramatic increase in the home/school/ community links scheme, Youthreach and the vocational preparation and training (VPT) schemes.</P>
    <P>Any suggestion that Early Start was embarked on without a background of education and psychological research at national and international level is false. It is doubtful if any educational reform has such a high level of research consensus to consolidate its position as a very important education intervention.</P>
    <P>The vision of intervening effectively at the earliest time in the cycle of educational disadvantage is a bold and ambitious one.  It is backed up by decades of painstaking research and experience.  This research includes our own results from the intervention programme in Dublin's inner city which, 25 years down the road, is continuing to show that we can break the vicious cycle of poor school attainment, early dropout, low participation in third level and subsequent high unemployment.</P>
    <P>All reputable research makes it clear that not all pre-school or care settings will work to offset the blighting and cumulative effects of low school <Col N="1512" /> achievement.  To be effective, educational intervention must have a number of quality marks which the House can be assured are present in this programme. These marks are: staff professionally trained in early education and child development; favourable adult/child ratios &mdash; the Early Start ratio is 1:7.5; small groups of children; well organised space with a variety of materials; and involvement of parents right through the programme.</P>
    <P>It seems illogical and even irresponsible that there are those who would criticise and try to halt the Early Start programme on the grounds that not all other care systems for children under six come up to this standard.</P>
    <P>With regard to training in the child care sector, my Department recognises the difficulty that has arisen due to the variety of courses on offer from private organisations.  This variety makes the task of selection a difficult one for both parents and employers alike.  However, the National Council for Vocational Awards &mdash; NCVA &mdash; and the National Council for Educational Awards &mdash; NCEA &mdash; have taken on the task of bringing comparability into the system. The NCVA is in the process of introducing a mechanism which will give accreditation for prior learning to all people with previous training in private colleges or organisations.</P>
    <P>I have listened to the debate with interest.  I challenge Deputies to continue their support for the concept of Early Start and not to become involved in the efforts being made to destabilise this intervention.  We have waited 25 years to increase State intervention in early school-leaving.  I cannot be criticised for 25 years of inactivity.  I ask Deputies to support this intervention which comes at a time when national and international research points the way to it as a way to break the cycle of disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The Opposition's motion has one virtue in that it represents a plethora of interests and concerns within the pre-school area.  My concern, however, is with a powerless constituency with no <Col N="1513" /> political voice, namely the children.  I make no apology for ensuring that Irish children at the most critical and vulnerable stage of their development will have the best quality educational opportunity available in the European Union.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le mo chomhghle-acaithe a bhí pairteach sa díospóireacht seo.  I am not going to engage in banter in this debate because I believe this issue is above banter and slagging. There have been no recent conversions on this side of the House.  None of us has changed our religion, politics or views regarding the need to pursue and promote pre-school, early child care intervention and so on.  We have held that view for many years.</P>
      <P>When first elected to this House, I had the honour to participate in two years of debate &mdash; between 1988 and 1989 &mdash; with regard to the Child Care Act.  The committee's debate was non-acrimonious and produced one of the best pieces of legislation put through this House.  That legislation involved commitment and the committee engaged in real consultation while producing it.  I regret the Minister's statement that her concern is with &ldquo;a powerless constituency with no political voice, namely the children.&rdquo;  We are all here to represent those with no political voice.  It is a disgrace to say that others who support early education do not consider the needs of children.  I am sure that is not what the Minister intended to say but that is how I understood it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has been a very frustrating debate for those involved in the community pre-school and playgroup area who might have hoped for a real response to their needs by the Minister for Education.  They might also have expected a fuller and more enthusiastic recognition by the Minister of the considerable effort and commitment they have displayed in building up the early education sector in recent decades. Initially this was done without significant State aid.  More recently, however, it has been achieved with the welcome <Col N="1514" /> support of the regional health boards. Many of these pre-schools were established in areas of great poverty and disadvantage in our cities.  Others were set up in areas of moderate advantage, where honest working people came together to do the best they could for their own children.  In areas where parents had a desire to ensure that their children grew up with a reasonable fluency in the Irish language, the naíonraí were established.</P>
    <P>There are other areas of rural disadvantage, &mdash; of particular interest to me &mdash; where playgroups have been established and maintained, often with little or no support from the State sector.  The concentration of attention on urban disadvantage and the enormous problems attached to it is often used to hide the real problems of rural disadvantage. People living in County Donegal have a unique insight into rural and urban problems because of the close links that exist along the Atlantic seaboard with Scotland and Glasgow in particular.  We can readily support initiatives to cope with serious urban problems but we know that, relative to population size, remote rural areas can have different but equally serious problems.</P>
    <P>The Minister's Early Start programme is based on designated areas.  A significant factor in their designation is the existence of local authority housing and flats.  There are not many local authority flats in County Donegal or in areas of rural disadvantage.  Many of the other criteria for Early Start do exist. These include possession of a medical card or being in receipt of unemployment assistance.  Factors such as unemployment, poverty, low incomes, lone parent families, family break-up and the associated emotional problems, alcoholism, poor housing conditions, lack of discipline within the family, poor financial management skills, poor diet and negative attitudes for schooling are all to be found in remote rural areas, yet the communities there will never qualify for the early start programme.  Needs can be met and in some cases are being met by community playgroups which <Col N="1515" /> involve playgroup leaders, community leaders, and parents.  This involvement increases the participation of the community in education and gives young parents, in particular, greater control over their lives and the destinies of their children or empowerment &mdash; if we want to use the fashionable word.  To establish such playgroups throughout sparsely populated rural areas requires leadership, training and a modicum of funding and facilities.  The cost of this would be substantially less than the cost of the early start programme.  It would provide encouragement or éachtacht mar a dheireann siad to communities which have lost Garda stations, post offices and other public services.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of debate in recent times on the role of State companies. It is a fundamental tenet that the State does not do what private individuals can do well.  The Minister, intentionally or otherwise has been putting community playgroups out of business and I agree with what has been said by Deputies who represent areas which have lost their playgroups.  In the two suburban new towns of Tallaght and Mulhuddart in County Dublin the introduction of the early start programme has had a major impact.  In Tallaght one of the playgroups lost its premises and closed last year.  This year another playgroup has had to relocate and its numbers have dropped from 15 to five.  This happened in two communities where the early start programme was established. In Mulhuddart three early start programmes opened this year and the local playgroups have decreased their numbers by almost 50 per cent.  The statistics are there but, unfortunately, nobody in the Department of Education read them.</P>
    <P>It is frightening that almost 50 per cent of those who attended pre-school playgroups in six areas of Mulhuddart have been attracted to the early start programme.  In an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 26 September 1995 the Department of Education was said not to be aware of any playgroups closing <Col N="1516" /> down.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the position because those ladies who got little recognition made themselves known to the Minister but, unfortunately, did not get to meet her.  They have a very strong voice and we should empower them and allow them have a say in their own community.  I am sick, sore and tired of discussing the bottom up approach but what is more bottom up than the people in a community for decades providing a service that is not recognised?</P>
    <P>Contrary to what Members on the Government benches may say we are not trying to knock the early start programme. It is a tremendous concept and is probably the only scheme that is properly funded.  I cannot understand why the programme was introduced without consultation with those in the area.  We are ghettoising pre-schools and that was not the intention I am sure of any Member. Why create disadvantage?  If there is free access to the early start programme but people pay to playschools that creates an economic disadvantage. That is wrong, it is the worst thing that has happened to the early start programme.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to put educationally sound well researched programmes into an area without consultation, pretending that other people do not exist.  It amounts to the worst decision made in recent years especially when we are trying to force on the agenda the need for early intervention and to provide a national research study on early childhood services, as we state in our motion, so that we can have a proper database. We do not have a data base.  We also need to develop a proper early education policy.  The Minister introduced a pilot scheme and if, following the report of the education research centre, it is decided to discontinue the scheme the disadvantaged areas will be in a worse position than when they started because they will have lost what they had set up themselves.  Will the Minister give me a guarantee that she will accept the need for a national forum to discuss early education?  I dread the day when we will <Col N="1517" /> have areas that need our help and intervention being left worse off than at present.</P>
    <P>I would welcome Deputy O'Shea's assurance that Part VII of the Child Care Act will be brought into force during 1996, if I could believe it.  As the Minister is aware, it is doubtful if the other 44 sections that were to be brought into force in 1995 will be implemented.  Before those sections are implemented very significant resources will have to be found and this in the teeth of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn's embargo.  If there is no money there will be no personnel and no implementation.  No Deputy believes the Minister of State's assurances that he cannot be accused of misleading the House.</P>
    <P>In our motion we are calling on the Minister to consult the various agencies who have experience of developing early childhood education, consider the immediate needs, take note of the desirable medium-term development and put together a programme to achieve it.  The education White Paper contains three and a half pages on early education and whether it is in black and white, colour or on video, that is not the plan.</P>
    <P>The Minister should listen to the people who have experience of providing playschool and pre-school services. People have provided these services over the decades without State funding or recognition but with a vast amount of goodwill, energy, commitment and hard work.  We cannot have the Department of Education, which impinges on everyone's life, behaving like an ostrich with <Col N="1518" /> its head in the sand.  It is high time the head was taken out of the sand and that we considered how to use our resources wisely.  We are always complaining that we have not the resources but when we have them it is important that we do not waste them.  The sum of £1.5 million is being allocated to the early start programme in 30 centres this year but the allocation of £1.5 million to preschools and playgroups would do a great deal for people in disadvantaged areas. There is an absolute need for proper consultation.  We are not here to say that the early start programme is wrong.</P>
    <P>The Minister seeks to amend our motion to read that Dáil Éireann commends the Minister for the establishment, following the most detailed research and preparation, of a high quality pre-school service in areas of disadvantage; but the one word missing is consultation.  So much research has been carried out here that it is a wonder there are any trees left.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, Sir, for allowing me to raise this matter.  I raised it last April, following which the customs office in Castletownbere was opened during the summer, but closed again at the beginning of this month.  As well as closing down that artery of the State to an outlying peninsula, the dole office was closed in the same week. Castletownbere, a major fishing port with access to one of the busiest traffic lanes for pleasure and fishing craft off the south-west coast, has been left without the presence of a customs official. The customs officers who operate off the south-west coast are very badly equipped.  Last week Deputy Deasy outlined the pathetic resources made available to such officers to fight the drug barons off the Wexford-Waterford coast.  Some of the largest drug hauls in Europe have been found off the south-west coast, yet some customs officers in the area do not even have a car radio or a cellular phone.  To make contact with headquarters they must borrow a few pence from their wives or neighbours and make such calls from a telephone kiosk, and to make matters worse the customs office in Castletownbere has been closed.</P>
      <P>I know from my contacts with Customs officers that they brought many suspect vessels to the attention of the mobile service.  I cannot understand why a large area of coastline is left without Customs officers.  The coat of arms of Cork Statio Bene Fida Carinis, could be applied to Castletownbere because we welcome these barons with open arms and they may as well make the most of it because we are not particularly concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> I was informed in April by the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins, that the deployment of Customs personnel at Castletownbere would be kept under continuing review.  Speeches such as that were once written for me, but I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, will be more positive tonight.  Has the continuing review produced any results, or how often was the position in Castletownbere appraised by Department officials?  Does the fact that drug smuggling continues in this area not signal the urgent need for a permanent and adequately staffed Customs service? There is only one member of staff there at present, Mr. Carey from Adrigole, a very fine individual who has to drive to Bantry and back to Castletownbere, a distance of more than 30 miles.  Considering the cost of travelling and subsistence expenses, there is no saving in that regard.  Somebody should tell the officials in Dublin that the present position is crazy.  A properly serviced and resourced Customs office at Castletownbere should be a priority.  The Minister should rethink the decision on this matter and provide support to the Garda, the Naval Service and the Customs officers to help combat the drugs problem on the south-west coast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy feels a little uncomfortable and that is why he is not listening to what I am saying.</P>
      <P>The specific point raised by the Deputy was responded to by Deputy Jim Higgins, Minister of State at the Department of Finance, when it was raised on the Adjournment on 5 April 1995.  The matter was also responded to in written parliamentary questions on 9 March and 20 September 1995 and in a letter to the Deputy on 6 July 1995.  The position remains that, with the introduction of the Single European Market on 1 January 1993 the volume of Customs work in Castletownbere declined significantly. The Revenue Commissioners studied the impact of the Single Market on the Customs and Excise Service. They concluded that the most effective means of providing a Customs Service in the Bantry Bay-Beara Peninsula area was to have staff centralised in, and operating from, Bantry and deployed, on a flexible basis, to various locations including Castletownbere, as required, to meet the needs of the work.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners recognise that because of the large concentration of fishing vessels in Castletownbere at certain times of the year, the full time assignment of an officer of Customs and Excise during the peak period is warranted. Full time attendance has been given from March to the end of August to cater for the peak fishing period. Outside the peak fishing period, the Commissioners cannot accept that a sufficient volume of work exists to justify the full time attendance of an officer of Customs and Excise.  In the off peak season, therefore, the best means of providing a Customs service is, as already stated, by the deployment of staff from Bantry on a flexible basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware the Customs National Drugs Team &mdash; CNDT &mdash; comprising more than 70 staff, was set up by the Revenue Commissioners with the advent of the Single Market in view <Col N="1524" /> of the increased responsibility on the Irish Customs Service for protecting our own coastline as well as that of the European Union, in the battle against the illegal importation of drugs.</P>
    <P>CNDT staff based in Cork comprising 16 officers consists of operational units, intelligence units and a sniffer-dog unit. Intelligence units, each comprising two full time members of the CNDT, are also based in Bantry and Tralee and are supervised by two higher officers of Customs and Excise who become involved in drugs related work as necessary. All units are mobile and employ the most modern means of communication and have access to aerial and sea surveillance.  My information contradicts the point made by the Deputy about the officers not even having mobile phones.  Specialist CNDT officers in the Cork and Kerry regions, can call on the assistance, where the need arises, of other Customs and Excise staff.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that intelligence gathering and surveillance, rather than a static presence, are the best means of combating drug smuggling. The CNDT has close liaison with its EU counterparts via mutual assistance programmes. Additionally, the team is in the process of negotiating bilateral agreements with all European maritime states on the exchange of intelligence.</P>
    <P>My colleague, the Minister for Justice, recently brought proposals to Government to deal with the drugs problem.  The measures included in the proposals are being implemented.</P>
    <P>Experience shows that a flexible approach to the disposition and use of our resources is needed to tackle this problem effectively and I hope we may expect further assistance from the European Union in this task.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, the commissioners do not deem it necessary to re-open the Customs office in Castletownbere on a full time basis at this time.  The Revenue Commissioners have <Col N="1525" /> informed me that they will keep the question of the deployment of Customs staff in Castletownbere under continuing review.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Methadone Maintenance Programmes.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this important topic.  I support the methadone maintenance programme. However, as operated at present it is exacerbating the hard drug abuse problem in Dublin.  An expert group established by the Minister for Health in a document published in March 1993, recommended various measures to control the supply and distribution of methadone.  That group drew attention to the potential for the abuse of methadone and pointed to the thriving black market for methadone on the streets.  It made a number of recommendations designed to ring-fence the supply and distribution of methadone.  Among those recommendations was the establishment of a central register of methadone users and the issuing of treatment cards containing, among other information, a photograph of the user.  It almost defies belief that two and a half years later neither of those fundamental recommendations have been implemented. The previous Government must share responsibility for that &mdash; I say that to prevent a re-run of what we heard a moment ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No realistic steps have been taken to control the supply and distribution of this substance.  Admittedly, a voluntary register is maintained in Trinity Court. However, it has been represented to me that it is totally inadequate and falls far short of what the expert group had in mind; in terms of control and supply, it is virtually worthless.  Treatment cards for patients have not been introduced despite the fact that in a letter written to the general practitioners in the Eastern Health Board area on 20 September 1994 Dr. Niall Tierney, Chief Medical Officer of the Department of Health, <Col N="1526" /> said that arrangements for their implementation were being finalised.</P>
    <P>The net result of this bureaucratic inertia is that the thriving black market in methadone, which the expert group warned about in March 1993, has grown substantially.  Some addicts are selling methadone and using the money to purchase hard drugs.  It is not uncommon to see a number of individuals at various locations in Dublin sharing a bottle of methadone.  That is hardly surprising in view of the fact that, apart from Trinity Court which is open seven days a week, the other satellite clinics open only five days a week and close early.  It means that people are being handed a week's supply of methadone, a recipe for disaster.</P>
    <P>In addition, there does not seem to be any control over the distribution of methadone by general practitioners who are dispensing it to all and sundry without properly checking the people they supply.  Addicts are attending several doctors accumulating a stock of methadone and selling their surplus supply to purchase heroin.  That intolerable position must be brought under control without delay.  The Government should urgently move to implement the recommendations of the methadone Protocol published by the Department's expert group in 1993.  It should also establish a system of court clinics for the worst cases which would be referred to ordinary satellite clinics as the next step and, ultimately, to a GP.</P>
    <P>The Government should also implement a proposal made by a number of people, including myself, to establish mobile clinics with a proper back-up service.  Such clinics would enable the system to reach those whose addiction behaviour is most chaotic and who reside in an area where a satellite clinic service may not be available at present.  It would also take a great deal of pressure off the present system. Experience elsewhere has shown that the availability of mobile services can <Col N="1527" /> complement the service available at satellite clinics and assist in the development of such clinics.  The Government must move immediately on all those fronts to control the supply and distribution of methadone or the methadone maintenance programme will continue to do more harm than good.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Methadone maintenance programmes <Col N="1528" /> are available for drug misusers at the Eastern Health Board's three community drug centres and at the Drug Treatment Centre, Pearse Street.  In addition, approximately 20 general practitioners provide methadone maintenance to more than 500 patients by prescribing methadone which is then dispensed by pharmacists.</P>
    <P>It is widely agreed that general practitioners have a vital role to play in the provision of a comprehensive service for drug misusers.  This would include prescribing methadone.  It is also, however, widely acknowledged that prescribing should take place in a proper setting.  The Report of the Expert Group on a Protocol for the Prescribing of Methadone set out the appropriate conditions under which general practitioners should become involved.  Following the finalisation of the report the first task which had to be undertaken was to ensure that a central treatment list of all those currently in receipt of methadone was established to minimise the risk that patients might be in receipt of methadone from more than one source.  The first stage of this task was completed and a validated list was compiled of those in receipt of methadone at the drug treatment centres.  The next stage was to send a copy of the expert group's report to every general practitioner in the Dublin area.  This took place in 1994 and general practitioners were also requested to: (a) submit a list of all persons, to whom they were prescribing methadone, for inclusion on the central treatment list, which is held at the Drug Treatment Centre, Pearse Street and (b) check with the central treatment list at the Drug Treatment Centre before they initiate prescribing methadone to a new patient to ensure that double prescribing does not occur.</P>
    <P>If a case of irresponsible prescribing is suspected, my Department has a mechanism in place to address the situation. Department officials initially visit the general practitioner in question to advise him or her that the Department is aware that the prescribing patterns of that individual are not in keeping with <Col N="1529" /> the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  A period of time is allowed to give the general practitioner the opportunity to improve prescribing patterns.  If this does not happen I have the power, under the Misuse of Drugs (Committee of Inquiry) Regulations, 1984, to establish a committee of inquiry, which will, in turn, report to me on the matter.  Having considered this report I may decide to give a special direction to the general practitioner specifying all or any of the controlled drugs indicated in a recommendation of the committee.  A copy of this direction is then issued to the Medical Council which may then take further action on the matter.</P>
    <P>I am aware of a particular problem, which has arisen from the opening of some of the community drug centres on a five day week basis.  In such cases clients were provided with sufficient methadone on Friday to tide them over until the centre opened again on Monday and there were reports of some of these supplies finding their way to the black market.  Steps have now been taken to stop this practice and this supply has now been cut off.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that methadone is playing a vital role in the control of the heroin abuse problem in Dublin, but I am also acutely aware of the possible dangers associated with methadone.  The measures we are taking should ensure that methadone does not fall into the wrong hands, but if further measures to ensure this are necessary I will not hesitate to take appropriate action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State for coming to reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed to hear the result of the review carried out in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry some months ago concerning the special beef premium, the suckler cow premium and extensification premium schemes. As a result of that review a number of <Col N="1530" /> farmers were told they had been overpaid premiums and that there were demands from the Department for refunds of the 1994 extensification premiums.</P>
    <P>I tried to raise the matter in the Dáil by way of question to ascertain how many farmers were asked to refund an overpayment as it appeared a number of farmers in my constituency were requested to make such a refund.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry does not appear to have figures for the whole country, but on 17 October I was told that 73 farmers in County Galway had received a letter requesting a refund.  My colleague, Deputy Leonard, informed me that 73 farmers in County Cavan and 50 in County Monaghan received a similar letter.  Perhaps the Minister of State will indicate how many farmers are involved and how many are being asked to pay a refund.</P>
    <P>A rule governing the extensification scheme states that to qualify for the scheme one must be under the limit of 1.4 livestock units per hectare.  Why were farmers paid such premia when it clearly stated on their cheques that they were under the limit?  I have a cheque which states that the stocking density was 1.38, which is under the 1.4 limit.  It is disappointing and frustrating for farmers to be told that they will receive a cheque and then to be asked to make a refund.  A farmer wrote to me inquiring why he was paid if he was not entitled to it and why he must pay it back.  That reflects the frustration experienced by farmers in dealing with the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The letter from the Department states clearly that the recipient must pay a refund to the accountant in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and that failure to do so will mean the grant will be deducted with interest from any moneys due under the 1995 schemes.  I have seen letters requesting refunds of £500, £600 and one constituent has been asked to pay a refund of £1,586.23.</P>
    <P>If a genuine mistake was made and a grant for a cow too many was paid <Col N="1531" /> which might amount to £100, is it fair that a farmer would be penalised to the tune of £1,500 as a result of giving him or her an extra grant of £100?  If a genuine mistake was made, it is obvious that the £100 could be refunded by the farmer in question who could retain the £1,500.  That is natural justice.  If the Minister dealt with the scheme in a fair and impartial manner, the farmers concerned would not experience hardship.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a fair man and I hope he will be able to give me news that will gladden the hearts of the large number of farmers who have received letters requesting that they pay back the extensification premium.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Deenihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EU regulations a farmer may qualify for payment of extensification premium if his stocking density is less than 1.4 livestock units per hectare when, <i>inter alia</i> account is taken of: the number of animals on which applications were made under the suckler cow premium scheme and under the special beef premium scheme; the number of cows required to fill the milk quota; the number of animals on which applications were made under the ewe premium scheme and the total forage area declared on the area aid application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Ireland a total of 97,731 farmers were initially deemed to have qualified for payments totalling almost £58 million under the 1994 extensification premium scheme.  Of this amount some £750,000 was subsequently found to have been overpaid to 930 farmers. When overpayments occur the normal practice has been to arrange for deduction of the amounts from future entitlements or request a refund directly from the farmer concerned.  On this occasion, my Department decided that farmers who were overpaid amounts in excess of £100 should be made aware of the position by letter at the earliest possible date.  Refunds were requested in these cases or alternatively the letters <Col N="1532" /> stated that arrangements would be made to recoup the amounts due from 1995 schemes entitlements.  Unfortunately, some of the letters referred, inadvertently, to the question of charging interest on the overpaid sum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that in these cases there is no question of charging such interest.</P>
      <P>The main problem which gave rise to these overpayments was the difficulty experienced by my Department in obtaining certified details of milk quotas held by farmers at 1 April 1994.  The position in 1994 was that farmers who indicated on their area aid application that they had a milk quota were requested to approach their co-op or milk purchaser to have the individual quota formally certified.  The certificate, when received from the co-op was to be furnished to my Department.  A number of farmers did not furnish quota certificates in good time with the result that some payments of extensification premium were made without taking into account the number of cows required to fill the milk quota.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of these difficulties, my Department put new arrangements in place for obtaining milk quota details in 1995.  For the 1995 schemes, each farmer was required to indicate on the area aid application whether he or she had a milk quota at 1 April 1995.  Following agreement with my Department, ICOS asked the co-ops to issue individual certificates of quotas as at 1 April 1995 to each of their quotaholders.  Quotaholders were expected to forward the certificates to my Department's area aid unit. While these new arrangements were an attempt to improve on the 1994 position, we are continuing to experience difficulty and delays in obtaining the certificates from some farmers.  We are now arranging to obtain details of milk quotas electronically from co-ops and other milk purchasers and this should also contribute to ensuring that the 1994 <Col N="1533" /> extensification premium overpayment problem is not repeated.</P>
    <P>Over payments also arose in a small number of cases where farmers were allocated additional quota rights from the 1994 suckler cow and ewe premium national reserves having been already paid extensification premium based on their existing quota or number of animals on which they applied whichever was the lesser.  The additional allocations from the national reserves had the effect of increasing the number of animals which attracted the premium, thus increasing the stocking density in those cases.  Most member states, including Ireland, experienced difficulties and delays in allocating quota from the ewe premium suckler cow national reserves in 1993 and 1994 mainly because individual quotas were initially agreed by the Council of Ministers in June 1992 and introduced with effect from January 1993.  The timeframe involved for all member states was simply too tight to enable allocation of automatic quotas and to put in place national reserve arrangements.  The difficulties have now been resolved, and I am satisfied that allocations from the 1995 and future years' reserves will be made in good time so as to avoid a repeat of extensification premium overpayments in future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to you and your office for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It arises as a result of the reply I received to parliamentary questions I tabled yesterday seeking details of the bills for consultants which this Minister has engaged, since coming to office ten months ago.  It is a matter of public concern that in excess of £1 million in consultancy fees has been paid out by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry and three State bodies under his control.  In his reply to a recent parliamentary question which elicited this information, the Minister <Col N="1534" /> had no problem in giving me full details of the names of the various consultants and consultancy firms who had been given work by these firms and by his Department, but when I asked for a breakdown of the overall figure for the individual consultancies the Minister was uncharacteristically coy, despite the fact that to the best of my knowledge all the State bodies concerned have issued that information to him.  Obviously the Minister sought that information on foot of my initial parliamentary question. Why is a Member, on behalf of the public, denied access to legitimate information when the Minister was prepared to give me the overall information in reply to a previous question?</P>
      <P>In his reply to this matter in the <i>Irish Independent</i> on 16 October, when I raised the scandalous waste of tax-payers' money, the Minister explained that the bulk of the fees of £325,000 in his Department went on consultants who had been brought in to advise on the introduction of a new computer system to speed up the payment of £750 million in headage and other cash payments to farmers which had been negotiated by his predecessor, Deputy Walsh.  The computerisation programme in Portlaoise was well under way long before the Minister arrived. He continues to give the impression that nothing had happened in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry until he arrived in December, 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That information is seriously incorrect. I call on the Minister of State, on behalf of the Minister, to withdraw the explanation which was given by the Minister claiming that the bulk of his consultancy fees is in respect of the introduction of a new computer system. The Minister's woefully incomplete answer has flatly contradicted his previous public explanation for the £325,000 spent in his Department.  He has refused to account for the £680,966 spent by the bodies under his control. This refusal is in spite of the fact that the bodies in question have provided <Col N="1535" /> the Minister with the detailed information necessary for him to answer the questions asked.</P>
    <P>When challenged on this scandalous expenditure last week, he asserted that the bulk of it related to computerisation. The Minister's partial and selective answer showed this to be untrue.  In fact, less than one-fifth, or £62,186, was spent on computerisation.  It has now also emerged from the inquiries I have made that £34,220 has been marked for public relations advice to the Minister. In addition to a full-time staff of four in the Department's information section, this Minister is spending £3,000 per month on hired spin doctors &mdash; a matter in which I am sure the public is interested.  The public has a right to know what spin on what stories he considers too sensitive for his civil servants to handle.</P>
    <P>The time is long past when talk was cheap.  The Minister is withholding information which the public has a right to know.  I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment to give the Minister of State the opportunity to give us that information which the public has a right to know and which I am sure he will give me in his reply.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil demands an immediate and full disclosure of all the facts surrounding Minister Yates's £1 million spending spree on public relations advisers.  If we are to have Government that is as clear as a pane of glass, it must be glass we can see through, not Venetian glass.  I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, will confirm that he is prepared to withdraw the inaccurate information regarding his own Department's expenditure and give the information which not only I but the taxpayers are entitled to have in respect of the scandalous amount of money being spent on consultancies while hundreds of staff are permanently employed in these bodies for the purpose of serving the public.</P>

      <P>The Deputy uses the <Col N="1536" /> word &ldquo;scandalous&rdquo;.  His treatment of this subject is scandalous because most of the money that has been committed is on record as being committed by the previous Administration.  It is ridiculous to suggest that this Minister is spending £1 million of his own accord.  That is totally unfair and I would expect more from Deputy Cowen, who should get his facts right.

      <P>The Deputy will get whatever information he wants.  Deputy Cowen accuses the Minister of spending money on communications consultants. He seems to think it is wrong for money to be spent on getting information clearly and speedily on the agricultural, food and forestry industries.  He also seems to be unaware that the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Joe Walsh, sought the approval of the then Minister for Finance to retain communications consultants for a fee of £36,000 a year, although it must be said that the Minister for Finance sanctioned only a fee of £20,000.  These consultants were employed by Deputy Walsh during 1992, 1993 and 1994.  Deputy Cowen seems to forget that the appointment of consultants was common under the Government of which he was a member. Most of this expenditure, which is public <Col N="1537" /> knowledge, was incurred during the previous Administration.</P>
      <P>In reply to Parliamentary Question No. 39 on 11 October 1995, I indicated that the total expenditure on consultancy services by my Department since Minister Yates's appointment was £325,399.  A large percentage of this figure relates to pre-committed expenditure on consultancy services dating from the time of the former Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh.  The same reply indicated that expenditure by the non-commercial State bodies was £680,966.</P>
      <P>The employment of consultants by bodies such as Teagasc, An Bord Bia and An Bord Glas is a matter for the boards and management of those bodies to decide, without specific reference to my Department.  We must respect the freedom of these bodies to manage their own day to day affairs, particularly bearing in mind that their accounts are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</P>

      <P>For this reason, I must emphasise that the Minister was not aware &mdash; and properly so &mdash; of the consultanty programme being implemented by these State bodies.  However, the position in relation to An Bord Bia, which accounts for three quarters of the consultanty expenditure by the State bodies, needs some elaboration in fairness to that body.  I have a close association with this group by virtue of the fact that I have travelled with them to a number of foreign destinations.  I have absolute respect for An Bord Bia and I commend it highly.  It is outrageous of Deputy Cowen to cast aspersions on this effective State agency.</P>

      <P>An Bord Bia was established less than a year ago.  The board was given a much wider brief than its predecessors.  It was assigned a key role in the development of the Irish food industry and the creation of jobs and wealth that would flow from that.</P>
      <P>Two broad categories of consultancy service were provided to An Bord Bia in 1995.  The most significant category refers to what may be termed &ldquo;once-off&rdquo; costs relating to the establishment of the organisation and the formulation of its strategic plan for the period 1995-99. This category accounts for approximately 75 per cent of the expenditure. By their very nature, costs incurred under this heading will not recur in 1996.</P>
      <P>The second category, which is of much lesser significance in terms of overall expenditure, relates to ongoing activity in the areas of market research, product testing under the quality assurance programme, communications and product promotion.  Such activity is central to the implementation of An Bord Bia's strategy by providing industry with quality information and promotional intelligence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to my Department's expenditure of £325,399 to date, seven of the consultancies involved were entered into prior to the change of Government and these accounted for approximately £146,000 of this amount. As I indicated in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 190 on Tuesday, 24 October, the estimated total cost of consultancies to which the Department is committed is over £1.1 million; over £700,000 of that amount was contracted <Col N="1539" /> prior to 15 December 1994 by the previous Minister.

      <P>Taken out of context, the amount spent on consultants may seem large.  However, this figure should be seen in the context of the overall expenditure of my Department which was over £1.75 billion in 1994.  The Department's expenditure on consultants, therefore, accounted for .02 per cent of total departmental expenditure. The expenditure by the non-commercial State bodies accounted for a further .04 per cent of that £1.75 billion.  It cannot be seriously suggested that these figures are excessive or out of line with general administrative or commercial practice.</P>

In undertaking this task it may be necessary or advisable to seek advice and expertise from outside the Civil Service from time to time.</P>
      <P>The use of external consultants is desirable in certain circumstances such as where specialised knowledge is not available in the Department and the service is required for a temporary period. Consultants might also be engaged where there is a need for an external view of some issue.</P>
      <P>Having regard to all the points I have made I am sure the Deputy will agree that the contracts for consultancy services entered into by the Department under the present Minister's stewardship were in the public interest and do not involve unreasonable or excessive expenditure.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22, 27 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The decision of the European Court of Justice in Kalanke and Bremen outlawed an automatic quota related system for promotion which was in operation in the German public service.  A promotion system of the kind involved in the case would not be admissible under the Employment Equality Act, 1977.</P>
      <P>The ruling will not affect existing positive action measures which are geared towards the removal of existing inequalities, so that women and men can compete on an equal basis for employment and promotion.</P>
      <P>The ruling is binding in relation to EU gender equality legislation.  I do not expect that it will have any direct application outside of that area.</P>

      <P>The appointment to a principal officer position made recently in my Department involved the promotion of a serving officer.  In this regard, selection for promotion in my Department is made on the basis of merit with due regard to seniority.  The recent appointment, in the manner of its making, which included consideration of the respective merits of other officers, <Col N="1355" /> both men and women, was in conformity in all respects with this criteria.  I am, of course, continually monitoring the gender balance in my Department within the framework of the general policies relating to appointments and promotions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>At present, victims of sexual harassment in the workplace have access to legal redress.  Any employee who considers that she or he may be a victim, may refer a complaint to the Labour Court under the provisions of the Employment Equality Act, 1977.  In 1985, the Labour Court, in a precedent case, ruled that &ldquo;freedom from sexual harassment is a condition of work that an employee of either sex is entitled to expect&rdquo; and accordingly the court treats any denial of that freedom as discrimination within the terms of the 1977 Act.  Within the revised employment equality legislation I intend to strengthen this protection by making explicit provision for protection against sexual harassment.</P>
      <P>Towards the end of last year I published a code of practice on measures to protect the dignity of women and men at work.  This code was prepared by the Employment Equality Agency with the full co-operation of both IBEC and ICTU and to date, the Employment Equality Agency has distributed it widely to employers, trade unions, individuals and other interested parties.  The case for legal recognition for such a code of practice has been under consideration in the context of the current review of existing legislation and I am disposed to pursue an approach along these lines in the new Bill.</P>
      <P>Both IBEC and ICTU have developed their own initiatives to combat sexual harassment in employment. The efforts of these bodies and the energy and commitment of the Employment Equality Agency in this particular area, have stimulated a greater awareness of the rights and responsibilities of both employees and employers on the issue.  In 1994, the most frequent single issue raised in inquiries to the Employment Equality Agency was sexual harassment comprising 18 per cent of the total inquiries of the agency.  These developments imply a growing awareness of rights and responsibilities on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This form of invidious behaviour is <Col N="1357" /> unacceptable and must be eradicated from the employment environment in Ireland.  The level of consensus achieved in preparing the code of practice indicates an across the board commitment to combat this type of behaviour and prompts confidence in the prospect of increasing workplace protection for women in particular against such behaviour directed at them.</P>

    <P>Consultants are also employed on short-term consultancy contracts under the Irish Aid Programme to assist with the review and evaluation of existing projects and to plan, design and prepare <Col N="1362" /> for new projects.  A register of consultants was set up, in September 1993 following national advertising, comprising people with skills in particular sectors applicable to the bilateral aid programme such as primary education, agriculture, engineering etc. who would be interested in obtaining short-term assignments under the aid programme.</P>
    <P>Projects requiring the use of a consultant are approved at a meeting of the project appraisal and evaluation group, an interdepartmental committee which approves spending under the bilateral aid programme.  When projects have been approved short-lists of suitable consultants are prepared based on the register of consultants.  The most appropriate consultant is selected by a committee of three officers from the division having regard to the necessary skills and experience required to undertake the project.  The question of tendering does not arise because consultants are employed on short-term contracts at rates set in accordance with the Department of Finance guidelines for short-term assignments.</P>
    <P>The following consultants have been employed since 16 December 1994 to undertake specific projects in the areas listed.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1363" /> The Office of the Tánaiste has utilised the services of one consultant since 16 December 1994.  On 23 May 1995 consultants were appointed to carry out research on employment options for the long-term unemployed for the task force on long-term unemployment.</P>
    <P>The contract was awarded to Fitzpatrick Associates (Economic Consultants) in conjunction with Kieran McKeown Ltd. (Social and Economic Research Consultants) following a competitive tendering procedure in which six consultants were invited to tender and three proposals were submitted.</P>
    <P>Fitzpatrick Associates (and McKeown) were the second cheapest tender.  It is not possible to name the cheapest tenderer in order to preserve the integrity of the tendering process. The contract was awarded after a comprehensive selection procedure which included presentations by the consultants to members of the task force.  The selection procedure involved an examination of the expertise, capacity and suitability of the consultants to undertake the task and their previous experience in this area.</P>

      <P>The Department of Foreign Affairs consists of a Headquarters in Dublin and 48 missions located throughout the world.  In fulfilment of their obligations headquarters staff travel to meetings and conferences abroad on a regular basis.  Diplomats posted abroad are also obliged to travel <Col N="1364" /> regularly within and between the countries to which they are accredited.  In these circumstances a considerable length of time and level of resources would be required to conduct the exercise requested by the Deputy in a comprehensive and accurate manner.  The diversion of scarce resources necessary could not be justified in this case.</P>
      <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that the travel policy in my Department strives at all times to achieve the maximum in terms of economies. Requests to travel are vetted by designated travel officers in each Division of the Department and close and regular monitoring of expenditure in this area is the norm.</P>

      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the press release of 4 October 1995 from the European Commission which gave details of the Commission decision on the allocation of the reserve for Community Initiatives through to 1999.  The Commission is now in the process of notifying the European Parliament and the member states of these allocations and it is likely that the indicative amount of 16.05 MECU (about £12.8m) for Leader II for Ireland will be confirmed. Matching funding for Leader projects is provided by the Exchequer and by private sources.  The necessary Exchequer funding to ensure the full utilisation of this additional EU funding will be forthcoming over the life of the programme.</P>

    <P> 1.  Mr. Gray was appointed on the basis of a per diem rate quote which was considered fair and reasonable having regard to the known comparable rates charged by competitor firms.  The number of days worked by the consultant was closely monitored and a ceiling was put on total expenditure. The consultant, in fact, agreed to reduce his final charge in order to stay within the limit fixed.</P>
    <P>2.  This firm was used to provide urgent assistance with a technical problem on a live computer system; it was not practical to hold a tender competition.</P>
    <P>3.  This consultancy contract was in relation to the sale of the State's 15 per cent stake in Irish Life plc.  Proposals were sought from a wide range of qualified parties, both domestically and internationally but, in the event, it was decided to offer a fee structure which was not covered by any of the proposals.  The advisory/marketing team which carried out the Irish Life sale was appointed by me solely on the basis of suitability, following a process of written submissions and interviews.  In order to maximise the proceeds of the sale to the Exchequer the fee arrangement was incentive based.  This arrangement provided for a fee structure ranging from NIL to 1 per cent of proceeds, the maximum fee being payable only in the event of the stock being sold at market price (i.e. zero discount).  No fees would have been payable if the shares were sold at a discount greater than 4 per cent to market price (or if the shares had not been fully placed).  The shares were sold at market price i.e. zero discount.</P>
    <P>4.  The requirements for selection of the chosen consultants centred on the expertise already acquired in the specific field and the ability to perform the task within the time allotted. </P>
    <P>Where it is indicated above that the consultants appointed were not in fact the lowest tenderers, I am unable to state who the lowest tenderer was.  My reason for not divulging this information is that it is commercially confidential and could be market-sensitive.</P>

      <P>Work on the project to consolidate the extensive law relating to income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax commenced in June last with the establishment of a team comprising experienced staff from the Revenue Commissioners and a private sector consultant with the requisite editorial and tax background.  This team is initially compiling a computer based record of the exact status i.e. whether repealed, amended, substituted, etc., of each tax provision enacted from the Income Tax Act, 1967, to the Finance Act, 1995, inclusive.  This record will be necessary in order for the parliamentary draftsman to trace the origins of each <Col N="1367" /> provision in the Consolidation Bill. Such tracing is required so that the Attorney-General's office can endorse the Bill as no more than a re-enactment of existing legislation in a consolidated format.</P>
      <P>The team is also engaged in identifying provisions of the tax code which could usefully be amended in order to facilitate the preparation of the Consolidation Bill.  The teams proposals in this area, which are to be considered with a view to including them in the 1996 Finance Bill, may include: measures for rationalising existing provisions, rectifying inconsistencies and drafting errors and repealing spent or redundant provisions.</P>
      <P>A draft structure for the Consolidation Bill has also been prepared and the indications at present are that the Bill will run to some 50 Parts comprising about 1,100 sections.  In the circumstances the Bill is likely to be the largest in the history of the State.  Preliminary discussions about the structure of the Bill, and the logistics of processing the drafting, have taken place with the parliamentary draftsman.</P>
      <P>Work on the actual detailed drafting of the Bill is expected to commence shortly and, assuming that the work schedule can be adhered to and no unforeseen difficulties arise, it is hoped to have the Bill published early in 1997.</P>

      <P>As indicated in reply to questions on several occasions, my Department is committed to a legislative programme which involves fundamental reform in the broad area of family law and equality law.  These are the priority areas for me at present and until such time as the necessary progress has been made on them the position remains that attention to certain other areas such as defamation must await further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While, for example, the reform of our defamation laws is a subject of particular interest to the newspaper industry, there is a need to carefully consider the extent to which the right of persons to defend and vindicate their good name can and should be modified by way of reform.  The report of the Law Reform Commission will be among the matters of assistance to the Government when it comes to making decisions on policy changes in these areas.  It is also my intention that in deciding on such important matters the Government might also be in a position to draw on the work of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry which has been established by the Government under <Col N="1371" /> very comprehensive terms of reference which include an examination of the laws of defamation as they affect that industry.</P>

      <P>The time taken for cases to be addressed is dependent on a number of factors: the nature and complexity of the case; the necessity for court proceedings; and the waiting period for the hearing of the case by the court concerned.</P>

      <P>The promotion of equality of treatment is a priority of my Department.  Among the key initiatives being undertaken to redress disadvantage experienced by particular groups in the community are the following: Legislation is being prepared which will outlaw discrimination on grounds of gender, marital status, family status, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, race, colour, nationality, national or ethnic origin and membership of the travelling community.  Two Bills are being prepared, the Employment Equality Bill <Col N="1373" /> dealing with discrimination in employment and the Equal Status Bill which will cover non-employment areas such as education, supply of goods and services and disposal of accommodation and premises.</P>
      <P>The Commission on the Status of Disabilities is expected to report in April 1996.  Its terms of reference require it to make recommendations setting out necessary changes in legislation, policies, practices and structures to ensure that the needs of people with a disability are met in a cohesive and comprehensive way.</P>
      <P>The report of the task force on the travelling community made recommendations on key issues of relevance to travellers including accommodation, access to health services, education and training provision and economic development and employment; relationships between travellers and `settled' people; and the experience of travellers with a particular focus on culture, discrimination, traveller women and travellers with a disability.  The Government has established an interdepartmental working group of officials to consider implementation of the report.</P>
      <P>Substantial progress has been made in implementing recommendations of the report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.</P>

      <P>The information requested is as follows: The contract for the Government's information programme on divorce was awarded to Quinn, McDonnell, Pattison Limited.  It was appointed following a tendering procedure in which it was the lowest tenderer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1374" /> One person was commissioned by the task force on the travelling community to carry out professional editing and consultation services on the report on the task force.  The person's name was Ms Grainne Healy, editorial consultant. She was appointed following the request for and submission of quotes from three professional editors.  Ms Healy was not the lowest tenderer, but in view of time constraints, was considered to be the most suitable person for the job.  I feel that it would be inappropriate to give the names of those who were unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>Mr. Michael Keegan was appointed to conduct an inquiry on my behalf into the appointment of a solicitor-in-charge in the Monaghan office of the Legal Aid Board.  There was no tendering involved in this case because he was the most suitably qualified person for the task.  A former secretary of the Department of Labour, he was also a member of the Labour Relations Commission and has industrial relations experience.</P>
    <P>Ms Ann Colgan, who was appointed to assist my Department in the setting up of the proposed Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities and the proposed Council for the Status of People with Disabilities, had her contract extended from January 1995 to advise me on disability issues.  There was no tendering involved in this case. She was originally appointed in September 1993 following an advertised competition and selection following interview.</P>

      <P>Since the Government took office there has only been one occasion in so far as my Department is concerned when it was necessary to alter the travel arrangements of proposed participants at meetings and conferences, subsequent to bookings having been made.  It occurred in the context of the UN Fourth World conference on Women in Beijing.  I was required to return to Dublin on a date earlier than originally arranged because of urgent Government business.  It was also necessary for one of my officials to return early from Beijing on that occasion.</P>
      <P>To date, my Department has not been fully invoiced in respect of all the costs associated with attendance at that conference. However, I will communicate directly with the Deputy in the matter when all of the relevant invoices have been received in my Department.  I do not anticipate that any additional costs will have been incurred as a result of these revised arrangements.</P>

      <P>The initial survey and selection of sites for the proposed natural heritage areas was based on a resurvey of the former areas of scientific interest.  Ballyseedy Wood was not included in the areas of scientific interest and accordingly was not surveyed.</P>
      <P>The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) believes that the wood may have a limited ecological interest as it is not a natural wood and it contains much scrub and exotic species.  NPWS has, however, arranged for a survey of the wood in the near future and when this is completed a decision will be made on whether the area should be proposed for designation as a natural heritage area.</P>
      <P>The NPWS has discussed the proposed dual carriageway with Kerry County Council and agreement was reached that the development would include the insertion of culverts to enable wildlife to pass under the road. It is estimated that about five to six acres of the wood, from an area of approximately 80 acres, will be affected by the road and that a small number of oak trees will be removed.  The NPWS believes that this disturbance will have little adverse ecological impact on the area.</P>

      <P>Information on consultancies commissioned since 16 December 1994 is set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>Where tendering procedures are used to determine the award of consultancies, it is standard practice to engage the most suitable tenderer after due consideration of a range of relevant factors, including the cost.  In these circumstances, it would not be appropriate to disclose the names of the lowest tenderers for particular consultancies where a tender other than the lowest was accepted.</P>
      <P>To establish a reservoir of expertise on environmental projects, the Department of the Environment agreed a framework for such projects with the ESRI in 1993, and relevant projects have subsequently been assigned to the Institute outside the normal tendering process.  In the other cases where direct appointments were made, the type of expertise required was specialised and the value of the consultancies was small.</P>
      <P>In addition to the information set out in the table, eight graphic design companies were engaged to prepare designs for a total of 45 Departmental publications. The average value of these contracts was small.  In the main, a selective tendering procedure was used and the lowest suitable tenderer was engaged.  A small number of publications were required urgently; in these cases graphic design companies were engaged directly.</P>

      <P>The staffing of a national school for a particular year is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year.</P>
      <P>The staffing allocation of the school in question for the current school year is a principal and three assistants.  This allocation was determined by reference to the school's enrolment of 116 pupils on 30 September, 1994.  In September, 1995, the school's enrolment had increased to 129 pupils.  This latter enrolment is sufficient to warrant the appointment of an extra assistant in September, 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Exceptions to the normal staffing arrangements arise when a school <Col N="1381" /> experiences rapid growth in its enrolment, or where it is not possible to organise classes within maximum class size guidelines.</P>
    <P>Although this school is experiencing some growth in its enrolment, the level of growth is not sufficient to qualify for additional staffing in the current school year.  Additionally, since the current enrolment can be managed within recommended maximum class size guidelines, I regret to inform the Deputy that it is not possible to sanction the appointment of a temporary teacher for the current school year.</P>

      <P>In July 1995 the Government approved proposals from the Minister for Justice for a series of legislative, financial, operational and organisational measures designed to combat the smuggling of drugs into the country. The Government recognised that multi-faceted actions are required, and asked the Minister for Health, in consultation with the Minister for Education and other relevant Ministers, to bring a report to Government before the end of 1995.</P>
      <P>Among the key measures proposed by the Government is the reconstitution of a high level co-ordinating committee under the chairmanship of a Minister of State to devise measures to reduce the demand for, and the supply of drugs. The committee will have representatives from the Department of Justice, Defence, Health, Education, Foreign Affairs, the Revenue Commissioners and other relevant agencies.</P>
      <P>The Inter Agency Drugs Committee proposal is under consideration in this context at present.  My Department will be in contact with the committee shortly about the matter.</P>

      <P>For contracts greater than £5,000 tenders were invited and appointments made strictly in accordance with Government procedures.  The consultancy firms appointed in all cases, apart from one exception, had submitted the lowest overall tender.  In one case the accepted tender was the lowest of four tenders received in terms of cost per day but not the lowest in overall costs.  However, the tender represented the best value for money and was the most appropriate one having regard to the evaluation criteria.</P>

I have been informed by the Garda authorities that they are opposed to supplying the detailed information being sought by the Deputy on the grounds of security and in the interests of crime prevention generally, and I am in agreement with this view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer the Deputy to the policing arrangements outlined in the response to the Deputy's previous Parliamentary Question No. 108 of 11 October 1995. In addition to the uniform and plain <Col N="1387" /> clothes manpower, attached to Kilmainham, the area is regularly patrolled by members attached to the divisional task force, and members based at Kevin Street and Harcourt Square as occasions demand.  Where the need arises, the gardaí at Kilmainham are also assisted by both plain clothes and uniformed members who are attached to Crumlin and Pearse Street Garda stations.</P>
    <P>I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the dog unit, manned by a sergeant and 11 gardaí, is also attached to Kilmainham station and is available, when required, to assist with crime investigation in the sub-district.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities state that in view of the extensive policing arrangements outlined it is not a true representation of the facts to imply that there are only six gardaí available to patrol or respond to requests from the public. The Garda authorities assure me that they are satisfied that the current policing arrangements for Kilmainham sub-district are adequate to meet the needs of the area.  These arrangements are kept under continuous review in the context of manpower levels throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Area and adjustments are made as necessary.</P>

      <P>With regard to the consultancy firms appointed by my Department since 16 December 1994 I wish to refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 95 of 19 October 1995 to Deputy John O'Donoghue.  Further to my reply on 19 October 1995 there is one additional firm which is employed in relation to consultancies for prison <Col N="1388" /> work, specifically concerning health and safety aspects in prisons, at a cost of £6,200.</P>
      <P>All consultancy firms appointed by my Department since 16 December, 1994 have been engaged in strict accordance with the guidelines and procedures laid down by the Department of Finance. These guidelines outline the criteria for selecting design, management and other consultants and also set out the circumstances under which tenders must be sought.</P>
      <P>I should inform the Deputy, at this stage that there are circumstances whereby a single tender can be obtained (for example where the service sought is of a specialist nature) and the guidelines laid down by the Department of Finance in this regard are very specific.  I can confirm to the Deputy that where relevant, my Department complies with the requirements of the Department of Finance in this regard.</P>
      <P>I can also confirm to the Deputy that where competitive tenders were sought by my Department the lowest tender, which complied with the requirements of the project, was always accepted.</P>

This will be aimed at police from a number of member states who are involved in the operational aspect of the prevention of drug trafficking.</P>

      <P>The Inner City Organisations Network approached my Department for part funding of this project early this year.  In response, it was explained that a review of areas in which there was an overlap as between my Department and the Department of Health was carried out earlier this year. Following from this review, it was decided that the Department of Health would have exclusive responsibility for funding organisations providing services appropriate to the health services.  This would include services relating to drug and alcohol abuse and addiction.  On foot of this agreement, a total of £1.54 million was transferred from my Department to the health services in 1995 to be made available for support to voluntary social services organisations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context, it would not be possible for my Department to provide funding for this specific project as it is outside the remit of the grant schemes operated by the Department.  I might also explain that the Department of Social Welfare has never had a role in relation to funding of services in <Col N="1393" /> relation to drug abuse.  The Departments with the lead roles in this area are Health and Justice and I understand that both these Departments have undertaken to support the Inter Agency Drugs Sub-Committee with funding.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this, I have arranged for an official of my Department to attend meetings of the group as an observer to ensure that should matters arise which come within the remit of this Department that there will be a speedy response.  I have asked to be kept informed of developments.</P>

This amount includes a sum of £4,170 which is charged to the travel and subsistence subhead in respect of an unvouched expense allowance payable monthly under the provisions of Oireachtas (Allowances to Members) and Ministerial and Parliamentary Offices (Amendment) Act, 1992 (Allowances) (No.2) Regulations, 1992 (S.I.No. 397 of 1992) to cover expenses incurred both as a member of the Oireachtas and as a Minister.</P>
      <P>A detailed breakdown of the balance of £265 is given in the following table.  It should be noted, however, that this table does not give the full extent of my official travel within the State.  I have made many other trips, both within the Dublin region and throughout the country, for which expenses have not been claimed.  As has been pointed out in my reply on Thursday 19 October 1995, information in relation to the destinations, dates, duration and purposes of such trips is not readily available and its compilation would involve a disproportionate amount of time and work.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals to assist the establishment of ostrich farming units.  Ostrich farming is considered poultry substitute by the EC and therefore grant aiding is prohibited under Regulation 2328/91.</P>

      <Quest>the reason the Government, at its meeting on Tuesday, 17 October 1995, released to Goodman International a sum of £17 million pounds in guarantees relating to Beef Intervention and beef export refunds; and the reason these guarantees were not kept in existence in view of the imposition of proposed fines totalling almost £110 million pounds on the Exchequer in relation to, inter alia, irregularities over a period of years in the administration and operation of these schemes.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 95, 96, and 97 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statistics requested are not available in the format specified.  However <Col N="1405" /> statistics relating to export refund payments made and amounts recovered in respect of refunds and intervention for the FEOGA years in question are given in the following tables together with the information on amounts of guarantees currently being held.</P>
    <P>For advance payment of export refunds the relevant EU Regulations require the lodgment of guarantees with the intervention agency to ensure that the stipulated conditions are fully compiled with.  Once this is the case the guarantees are releasable.</P>
    <P>The detailed processing and assessment of the export refund payments in accordance with the regulatory provisions has now been completed relating to a substantial block of guarantees which covered beef exports in the late 1980s.  Guarantees against which no liability has been established are releasable. As the processing work has just been completed on these files recently no decisions on these matters were taken by any of my predecessors.</P>
    <P>It is the clear legal position that guarantees obtained against specific performance of the obligations involving export refund and intervention trade and in relation to specific trading contracts cannot in any circumstances be used to cover any other liability or potential liabilities which may arise.</P>
    <P>The proposed disallowance of FEOGA expenditure is a totally separate issue and arises mainly from an inquiry into the operation of beef intervention in 1990 and 1991.  This matter has been submitted to a conciliation process in Brussels which is at present in train.</P>

      <P>The position is that under the operational programme for fisheries which was agreed in mid-1994.  EU aid to fish processing in the period 1994-1999 has been allocated in annual tranches.  The company to which the Deputy refers had a project approved in September of this year as part of the current tranche of EU funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Demand for funding significantly exceeds the aid available.  As a result, grant payments in respect of approved projects are being phased over the years 1996-98.  This approach has been adopted in order to maximise the spread, accommodate as many projects as possible and to protect the jobs of <Col N="1414" /> those who work in the fish processing sector.  I would stress that this was clearly communicated to all successful applicants at approval stage in a letter of offer.</P>
    <P>The grants will assist companies to meet the requirements of EU health and hygiene regulations which must be complied with from 1 January, 1996. Had only those projects which could be funded from the 1996 allocation been approved, many essential projects would have had to be excluded thereby placing numerous jobs right around the country at risk.</P>
    <P>The decision to fund these projects for funding on a phased basis is the most prudent, indeed, only course available and will protect employment whilst enabling the sector to remain competitive and to operate in full compliance with EU standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that when it was noticed that the individual concerned was missing at about 23.15 hrs. on the evening of 19 September 1994, an initial search of the vessel was undertaken by the crew at the direction of the master.  The vessel departed from Pembroke at 02.45 hrs. on 20 September, and the view on board at that stage was that the individual had gone to some area on board and fallen asleep.  A second fuller and more complete search of the vessel was subsequently undertaken, which similarly proved to be unsuccessful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the docking of the vessel at <Col N="1415" /> Rosslare the disappearance of the person was reported to the Garda in Wexford who, in turn, notified the police at Pembroke.  The coastguard at Milford Haven, Wales, initiated a sea and air search at first light which was terminated later the same afternoon without success, having failed to locate the missing person.</P>
    <P>Investigations into the disappearance of an individual in these circumstances are the exclusive responsibility of the Garda authorities, whose investigations I understand are still ongoing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 109, 110, 111, 112 and Nos. 115 to 122 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>Following the tragic canoeing accident at Dunmore East last February, in which two lives were lost, the then Minister for the Marine, Deputy Hugh Coveney, ordered a review of the circumstances of the accident.  The sole objective of the review was to establish what lessons could be learned from the accident with a view to minimising the possibility of a recurrence of such a tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dunmore East accident review resulted in the following safety recommendations in relation to canoeing activity on or near the sea and on large open lakes: all equipment including canoes, helmets, buoyancy aids, paddles, cagoules and both wet and dry suits should be made more visible by attaching retroreflective tape, which would assist the rescue services in locating a person or canoe in the water, especially in heavy seas and poor visibility; all persons should have a whistle capable of being used in the water, which should be attached to the wrist; each canoeist should be issued with a hand flare and the leader of a group of canoeists should have at least one parachute flare; the leader of a group should carry a hand held marine VHF radio and be capable of operating it; the area of operation for canoe training should be clearly defined and the persons in charge of training should be made fully aware of such areas; a checklist of all the necessary requirements, including weather forecasts and updates as appropriate, should be complied with prior to departure; the leader of a group should inform the relevant local authorities, e.g. harbour office, pilot station, coast radio station, giving them the time of departure, area of operation, expected <Col N="1419" /> time of arrival, number in group and type and numbers of equipment in use; lifejackets should be worn for sea or open water canoeing.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine has taken steps to implement these recommendations. Consultations have taken place with the Irish Canoe Union, as well as with the Sea Scouts and the Irish Windsurfing Association, and a comprehensive set of guidelines have been produced for implementation, on a voluntary basis, by these organisations.  In addition to the recommendations arising from the Dunmore East accident review, the following safety measures are included in the comprehensive guidelines agreed with these bodies: learn how to swim; avoid strong tides and local hazards and make inquiries locally; keep an eye on the weather and seek shelter in good time, and well before daylight fades; keep within your own abilities and the limitation of your craft; and if you get into trouble, raise the alarm sooner rather than later, and stay with your craft.</P>
    <P>Implementation of these safety guidelines on a voluntary basis is in keeping with current policy, which considers the most effective approach to water leisure activity to be through self-regulation by the various governing bodies.  Such self-regulation will continue to be augmented by means of the Department of the Marine's safety awareness campaign, which employs a dual strategy of altering the watersports enthusiasts to the need for safety consciousness, and providing information regarding appropriate safety measures.  While I fully endorse this policy, I have asked that the possibility of introducing statutory safety regulations, particularly in respect of adventure centres be thoroughly examined by the Department, and the question of whether it is necessary for canoeing groups to be accompanied by a manned motorised boat will be considered in that context. I have also asked that the question of written permission from children's parents being required before clubs or <Col N="1420" /> adventure centres allow them out canoeing be considered.</P>
    <P>I also intend to develop an ongoing and close liaison with the marine leisure clubs and controlling bodies.  Initially this will explore how best the resources of my and other Department's might be used to communicate the safety message to water users, whether operating under the aegis of clubs or adventure centres or otherwise.  As a more long-term measure, I intend to develope, in consultation with the relevant bodies, an analysis of marine leisure incidents, in which the emergency services under the aegis of my Department will have been involved, as a means of providing general feedback to the marine leisure bodies and the public on the circumstances and causes of these incidents.  This will make an important contribution to raising safety awareness among the public and to designing practices and procedures to reduce such incidents.</P>
    <P>Finally, I wish to put on record that it is essential that a strong sense of personal responsibility for one's own safety is developed among marine leisure users.  Ultimately, no amount of regulation, statutory or otherwise, will make a difference if water users have not developed a strong personal belief in the need to adhere to a basic safety code.  This will require a sustained effort by parents, schools, clubs and others to inculcate this culture of safety from the earliest possible age.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 113 and 114 together.  In line with the recommendations contained in the report of the review group on Air-Sea Rescue Services, the coast and cliff rescue (CCRS) is an integral part of the Irish marine emergency service.  Direct paging and radio communications are now available between the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre and local CCRS units.  Each CCRS unit is available to provide a visual coast watch whenever and wherever required.  All CCRS area officers are being trained as liaison officers to provide a local shorelink between sea rescue units and land based rescue units and mission co-ordinators.</P>
