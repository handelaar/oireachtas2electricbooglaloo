      <P>Bearing in mind the encouraging peace breakthrough in Bosnia, does the Taoiseach agree it is high time that stubbornness on the part of the British authorities, which has been obstructing the Northern Ireland peace process, should give way to a more realistic, constructive approach and allow the Taoiseach and British Prime Minister to convene a summit over the next few days?  If the Taoiseach agrees, would he also inform the House whether he still hopes to convene such a summit within the next few days?</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, as you are aware, the Taoiseach replied to approximately a dozen parliamentary questions on Northern Ireland together yesterday, to which we did not object, that being his prerogative.  However, because of that and questions in my name and that of Deputy Harney having been ruled out of order and since there <Col N="1167" /> are no questions on Northern Ireland tabled today, the next occasion on which such question can be taken is Tuesday next, by which time President Clinton will have landed in the United Kingdom, when there will be no opportunity for us to support and assist the Taoiseach in endeavouring to achieve a breakthrough in the peace process and convene a summit.  Will the Taoiseach say whether we can look forward to a summit over the next few days and does he agree that stubborness on the part of the British is totally preventing that possibility?</P>

      <P>I join Deputy Bertie Ahern in seeking information.  I asked the Taoiseach yesterday whether he had had a telephone conversation with the British Prime Minister, or intended to have one, when he told me it was not relevant.  The Taoiseach went on to say that the manner in which he sat, how he looked and spoke was not a matter of relevance.  Yet, within a matter of hours, a Government spokesperson was able to brief the media to the effect that the Taoiseach had had such a telephone conversation and would have another with the British Prime Minister today. To quote the Taoiseach's own words in the House in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions: &ldquo;It is not appropriate that this House gets less information than is given to other channels&rdquo;.  I wish the Government spokesperson could be present in the House to answer our questions because it is wrong that the media get more information than the Taoiseach is prepared to give this House on this or any other matter.</P>
      <P>I once again strongly register my objection to this House being insulted and Question Time being rendered a mere farce.  I note there is no response, which is even worse, demonstrating how irrelevant is this House.</P>

    <Title>Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Compellability, Privileges and Immunities of Witnesses) Bill, 1995: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I referred to matters on the periphery of the compellability of witnesses Bill, my views on the committee system and how it will operate in the future.  In the course of the inquiry into the collapse of the last Government difficulties arose on the question of privilege enjoyed by people <Col N="1170" /> appearing before the committee and it was agreed that the compellability of witnesses Bill would be given priority by the incoming Government.  The Bill has been 20 years in gestation and much effort has been expended in the last 12 to 15 months to bring it before the Dáil, but I wonder if we have learned any lessons from the inquiry into the collapse of the last Government that brought these matters under public scrutiny. Legal opinions were offered and there was considerable debate inside and outside the House and in the committee, but I am not certain from my reading of it that the distilled wisdom of Members who contributed has been included in this Bill.</P>
      <P>I wonder if any lessons have been learned from the fact that the committee of inquiry resembled a media circus. After the change of Government the same importance was not attached to it as in November and December 1994, but the general conclusion must be that people believed what they wanted to believe and there was no question of ensuring that the proceedings would not be prejudiced.  However, that is not the point I wanted to make about that investigation.  We spent many hours in this House discussing the legislation that gave the standing committee wide powers.  I would like the Minister to explain on Committee Stage what happened to all the learned discussion on the provisions of that Act and why similar provisions are not included in this Bill.</P>
      <P>There are some persons we cannot command to appear before a committee.  However, it is open to the committee to call almost anybody provided it pays that person's reasonable expenses and provided the committee acts within its terms of reference.  The compellability aspect of the Bill is to be found in the provision which provides that nonattendance in response to a committee's direction shall be an offence, and also in the provision that false evidence shall constitute perjury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of who may be called to give evidence section 6 (2) excuses from attendance any Dáil Deputy or <Col N="1171" /> Senator who has made relevant utterances in either House.  This is a recipe for continued irresponsibility by Deputies on all sides.  There is no reason Dáil Deputies should be excluded in this way when section 11 provides that persons giving evidence are to enjoy the same privilege as if the person were a witness before the High Court.  Presumably this means privilege and immunity from defamation proceedings.  According to section 7, civil servants and others may ask the Taoiseach to give them a letter excusing them from attendance if the matter being inquired into relates to confidential information, business sensitive information, information regarding the family life of a third party, or information whose disclosure might be prejudicial to the State in its relations with other states.  The Taoiseach may refuse such a letter if it is in the public interest to do so.  All this is confusing.  I would, therefore, ask the Minister to explain it more fully when concluding this Stage or on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Non-civil servants who have similar objections to the type of evidence being required of them are to be given an opportunity to have their concerns considered by the Public Offices Commission, and in due course the matter may be appealed to the High Court, all at the State's expense.  These provisions are all new to Irish law, and some of the terminology employed requires clarification.  What is meant, for example, by &ldquo;necessary in the public interest&rdquo;?  This is what the commission or the High Court have to determine in respect of any information in respect of which a witness is invoking the commission and/or the court procedure.  What is information given in confidence, and what constitutes information which would or might be prejudicial to a person?</P>
    <P>Now we come to the next group of persons with whom this Bill is concerned.  These are the third parties, the parties who are named by witnesses giving evidence and whose reputations are at stake.  These are the persons who, <Col N="1172" /> because of immunity given to witnesses appearing before a committee, have only one opportunity to vindicate their name and that is by invoking the proposed procedure set out in section 10 whereby such a person, having been named or referred to in the proceedings, may appear and make submissions and also request the committee to call other witnesses who may be cross-examined on behalf of the named party.  Presumably because of the requirement to protect the good name of such a person and to vindicate their constitutional rights, the committee is required, in the interest of justice, to comply with such a request and to advise such persons if their names have been mentioned in the course of the inquiry or committee proceedings.  There are various provisions for adjournments of the committee's procedures to allow the use of other procedures to be processed.  All in all, including various trips to the High Court, it seems that these proceedings are likely to be extremely long-winded and in most cases inconclusive.  This needs further consideration.</P>
    <P>In principle I am for openness, transparency and accountability in public affairs, as is every Member of this House.  However, in trying to produce a Bill that lives up to that, we may be going down a road which will prove extremely costly in the future.  It will not solve very much and will bring this House into further disrepute.  In the recent past Ministers and others in this House have used the privilege enjoyed by Members to make wild allegations against people who are not in a position to defend themselves.</P>
    <P>Despite the best efforts of the Chair who goes out of his way to ensure this does not happen, a Member is able to put the name of a person outside the House on the record.  It is regrettable when politicians, be they Ministers or backbenchers who find themselves in difficulties throw mud at people outside the House who do not have an opportunity to defend themselves here.  The temptation for people who find themselves in a hole is to blame somebody <Col N="1173" /> else and in recent years it seems to have become acceptable for a politician in difficulties to name people outside the House.</P>
    <P>Politicians are in the public eye and cannot complain if accusations are made against them by Members on the other side of the House.  We are paid to take it, and if we do not like it there are remedies open to us.  However, it is not acceptable for them to name people outside the House.  As Deputy O'Keeffe who operates a solicitor's practice knows, people spend a considerable time building up their businesses and professions and when it is alleged that they are involved, even in a peripheral way, in a scandal with which they may have nothing to do, the mud sticks. Even if the allegation is subsequently withdrawn in the House it will have had an extremely damaging effect on the person's practice.  Many members do not come from this background, and those of us who do, have a particular responsibility to point out that such allegations have an abysmal effect, on a person's profession.  People will be slow to avail of the service of a person who is closely associated with a political party and who is alleged to have been involved in an incident which may have taken place some years previously.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely scandalous that Members on the other side of the House should have recently adopted this attitude.  I would make the same point if it was adopted by Members on this side of the House.  Many Members are now aware of the damage naming people can cause.  Neither is it correct for Ministers who are in political difficulty to name civil servants or public servants in the House.  In the past the tradition was that these people were not named.  However, in recent years everyone seems to have become fair game.  Perhaps we need to change the rules of the House in this regard.  I am afraid under the Bill the names of people outside the House will be dragged into the debate in the case of investigations.  In the past five years naming people in regard to particular issues of public interest which gave rise <Col N="1174" /> to difficulties both inside and outside the House has had an adverse psychological effect on their families.  The psychological damage done to many of these innocent people will never be repaired.  I do not want to be more specific than that.  I earnestly request all Deputies to bear this point in mind. Given the competition among the members of political parties and between political parties, consideration must be given to tightening up the rules in this regard.  I am afraid the Bill, which will extend the committees' powers of investigation, will put us further down this road.</P>
    <P>Who will decide whether, say, a business person should be brought before a committee?  This person may not have any involvement in the item under investigation but he may be connected to a political party.  He would be correct in refusing to come before the committee.  Who will decide on this matter? Will we have to traipse to the High Court every day for decisions in this regard?  Regardless of what one says about their decisions, one readily recognises that the courts are independent. Many of the difficulties in the Dáil in regard to privilege, inquiries, etc. arise from the correct decision in 1971 in the Haughey case which more or less set down the rules under which people could defend their good names.  This has given rise to some difficulties for politicians but I would prefer to be tried before the courts than to be brought before a committee where political accusations could be made and where I would have no rights.  Regardless of the cost of going before the courts and given my experience in recent years and the partisanship on all sides of the House, I believe a business person would prefer to go before a court than before a committee of this House.</P>
    <P>I have reservations about many aspects of the Bill.  I am afraid that in our obsession to appear on the side of the angels and to show that we stand for openness, transparency and accountability we may enact legislation which is not justified and which will give rise to <Col N="1175" /> severe difficulties in the future.  I will tease out these matters further with the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand Deputy McCreevy's reservations about the Bill given that we are straying into new and strange waters in providing these additional powers for committees. However, we can only draw from our experience and he will agree that the investigation carried out earlier this year by the Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security was worthwhile.  I think he relished his role as a witness &mdash; he imparted some information and provided a degree of entertainment &mdash; and entered into the spirit of what the committee was trying to achieve.</P>
      <P>We propose to introduce a new and exciting development into the committee system.  This brings us back to the fundamental point about whether the committee system is good.  When talking about the committee system we must look in broad terms at the role and function of the legislator.  Over the years the powers have been drawn more towards the Executive while the Legislature has become more of a rubber stamp.  Our membership of the European Union has accentuated this trend and while I understand the reasons for it I do not think it is beneficial to parliamentary democracy and it should be reversed.  It cannot be reversed in the traditional way but one way to develop our parliamentary democracy is through the development of the committee system. We have been remiss in this regard during the years.  There have been tentative developments, not least as a result of the proposal of the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton but we have not developed them fully and we need to look at other aspects of our parliamentary system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the centralisation of power in the hands of the Executive as opposed to the Legislature, we need to look at our Whip system, and what happens in other parliaments.  We need to reflect <Col N="1176" /> on whether the tightly controlled parliamentary whip system is appropriate to modern democracy.  In my view it is not, and it has to some degree stifled the development of parliamentary democracy.  I accept that on issues of confidence, the budget or serious matters of that type there should be a tight whipping system but in other matters if people have genuine difficulties about a section in a Bill and would prefer something else they should be entitled to openly argue their case and if necessary put it to a vote.</P>
    <P>I am attracted by some aspects of the American system in that regard where Democrat Senators quite freely oppose measures proposed by a Democrat President.  Of course there has to be a balance and that applies to the development of our committee system as well. There is a great deal of good in the American system but there is some bad in it too, for example, the famous committee on un-American activities under Joe McCarthy.  In the committee he chaired there was a paranoid obsession about anybody with an association with socialism.  People were hounded out of their jobs and some were hounded into committing suicide because of the outrageous activities of that committee which developed into a witch-hunt.  The Arthur Miller play &ldquo;The Witches of Salem&rdquo; was a reflection on the activities of that committee.  That is the other side of the coin &mdash; committees can go overboard.</P>
    <P>The Minister in introducing this Bill would have done a service to the House if he had examined the parliamentary systems in other countries and set out the pluses and minuses of the committee systems that have evolved in them.  I note the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle will sum up the Bill and will deal with it from now on.  I am not anxious to send her on junkets around the world but it would be useful on Committee Stage if we had some idea what was happening in other countries and an input from Deputy Doyle on her research in this regard.  Essentially what we are talking about is compulsion to <Col N="1177" /> attend, to produce documents and the right to privilege for somebody who appears before a committee.</P>
    <P>The Bill to a certain degree is cautious and that is what one would expect in our bureaucratic culture and more importantly perhaps in the context of the constitutional constraints.  It may be overcautious and this has to be teased out on Committee Stage.  To a degree the Dáil has become a rubber stamp but a counter argument is that because of the views expressed in this House about the situation of the DPP, the Taoiseach has directed that there be a change in the Bill so that the exclusion of the DPP from the terms of the Bill will be changed.  I applaud that.  The Bill does not apply to the Attorney General or officers of the Attorney General except where the committee is a Committee of Public Accounts and there are other restrictions.  I would like that to be looked at as well.  I am not sure this is the right approach.  The matter needs to be teased out on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year an officer from the Attorney General's office, referred to as &ldquo;Witness A&rdquo; was called before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  If I recollect rightly, three officers from the office of the Attorney General appeared before it at the committee's request.  If something similar arose &mdash; and I certainly do not think it will with this Government &mdash; have we now specifically excluded them from being called under the terms of this Bill?  This needs to be looked at further. I understand there may have to be restrictions but while having regard to constitutional constraints, they need to be fully justified and if they are not fully justified the question has to be raised as to whether the restrictions should be removed.</P>
    <P>We should also look at how the committees could operate more efficiently and effectively in the future in the context of having these additional powers. It is fashionable to deride the inquiry of the subcommittee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security into the events leading to the fall of the last <Col N="1178" /> Government.  Not least because I was a member of the subcommittee, I think that is altogether wrong.  I recognise the restrictions that were on the subcommittee but broader issues have to be looked at.  It is a question of comparing the benefits of a judicial inquiry with a committee inquiry.  Cost is the first thing that springs to mind and when we compare the cost of that inquiry with the cost of the beef tribunal it cost approximately £35,000 but the beef tribunal cost approximately £35 million.  There is no doubt who wins on that score.  The second thing to spring to mind is the length of time.  The committee inquiry took approximately three months and the beef tribunal inquiry took approximately three years.</P>
    <P>Taking into account the constitutional constraints, time is a factor and an inquiry that meanders on forever is of little benefit because by the time the report comes out people have forgotten what it is about.  There is also the question of conclusions.  I appreciate that in the beef tribunal inquiry Mr. Justice Hamilton produced a very comprehensive report and I appreciate that there were huge constraints on the subcommittee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security but how many people can remember the main conclusions of the beef tribunal.  That the committee could not produce findings of fact did not matter as the judge and jury were not the committee and should not have been the committee.  The committee could have broken down into its constitutional political parties on this political issue.</P>
    <P>The judge and jury are the general public.  It is a question of public opinion deciding the relevant questions.  Therefore, it did not matter that there was not a finding of fact in the report.  Those are some of the matters that must be taken into account when deciding how to hold such inquiries in the future.  It is lawyers who gain from judicial inquiries and the amount of money involved is exorbitant.  In the rush to hold public inquiries in the past consideration was not given to the length of time or cost involved.  If <Col N="1179" /> it is necessary to hold an inquiry in the future, due consideration should be given to holding it before a committee of the Oireachtas rather than by way of a judicial public inquiry.</P>
    <P>There are many issues, some of which are touched on in the Bill and others that are not, that need to be examined. If inquiries are held before a committee of the Oireachtas we must carefully examine that committee's terms of reference.  We would have to decide if it would be expected to reach conclusions of fact that might impugn the good name of an individual.  The follow through from that would affect the conduct of any such proceedings irrespective of whether there is compellability.</P>
    <P>Section 13 provides that a witness may be required to give evidence on oath and section 3(8) refers to the offence of perjury.  The question of taking evidence on oath must be carefully examined.  The terms of reference of an inquiry would need to specify if evidence is to be taken on oath.  Considerable care should be taken before any such requirement is put on a committee. If an inquiry is of a political nature, it is not appropriate that evidence should be given on oath.  Much of the evidence given to the Sub Committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security was hearsay, people's opinion as opposed to hard concrete facts.  It is not appropriate that such evidence should be given under oath and if a person's opinion is wrong it should not lead to charges for the offence of perjury. That area must be teased out further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The size of a committee that would hear an inquiry is not dealt with in the Bill.  The first day on which the Select Committee on Legislation and Security sat was similar to the activities in a bear garden.  Sufficient thought was not given in advance to how matters should be conducted, they became more manageable when a sub-committee was established.</P>
    <P>The most important matter arising <Col N="1180" /> from the Bill is the question of legal representation for a person called to give evidence before a committee.  I am not pleading a case for lawyers, rather I am considering the constitutional aspects. Will a person called before a committee be entitled to legal representation?  At what stage will he or she be entitled to such representation?  Comments may have been made that would affect that person's good name before he or she comes before the committee.  Should people be given notice in advance so that they can employ legal representation?  Will we reach the stage where up to ten people could give evidence before a committee, all of whom will be entitled to legal representation?  Will it be possible to cross-examine all witnesses?  We must think through the processes and procedures that would arise in the context of the constitutional constraints of a person giving evidence before a committee.</P>
    <P>The normal practice in judicial inquiries is to lodge statements in advance of the inquiry.  There is a danger that such statements would contain tendentious material that should not be brought into the public domain.  We will have to devise a procedure whereby statements can be examined by, say, a legal adviser and, if necessary, amended before entering the public domain.  That matter must also be considered.</P>
    <P>In general while the Bill is an improvement on the present position, it is experimental.  The alternative is to sit and do nothing and I am not in favour of that.  We must welcome it, understand the constitutional constraints under which it was produced and explore how far the legislation can comply with the Constitution while at the same time giving the committee the greatest possible role and scope.  That challenge will lead to an interesting Committee Stage debate.  The Bill will test the powers of the committee system to put it into the best possible shape before being enacted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation and <Col N="1181" /> share many of the views articulated by Deputy O'Keeffe.  In many respects the Bill is a rather limited measure when compared with the fine sounding rhetoric we heard last November, in particular about the need for greater accountability and transparency in the way the Civil Service, the Dáil and Government do their business.  I am concerned about the limited nature of the Bill and the degree to which Members appear to be over anxious to prevent other senior public figures, whose daily decisions affect people's lives, from appearing before a committee of the Oireachtas to answer questions, namely, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General and the Governor of the Central Bank.  There is no reason the Governor of the Central Bank should not be compelled to appear before a committee of the Oireachtas to defend his or her banking policies.  In many ways we suffer from a hangover from our colonial past in the administration we inherited.  We need greater transparency in the way the State administers its business.  Many senior public officials with responsibility for a number of key areas should appear before Dáil committees or this House to explain the <i>raison d'être</i> for their policy decisions and the diffculties that arise in their respective portfolios from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is a difficulty in the Central Bank or trouble in the Office of the Attorney General or the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, they should answer for it.  People refer to the issues that achieved notoriety and publicity in this House.  Many of us have seen the spectacle of Ministers defending some of these people and the Ministers concerned would have had little involvement in, or responsibility for, any wrongdoings or mistakes made. However, the tradition has been that the Minister comes before the House, even if they did not know anything about what happened in the office, to endeavour to answer the charge.  They are very much dependent on information from a variety of sources, which has not proved up-to-date or accurate in <Col N="1182" /> the past.  There is a need to open up the matter to a greater extent.</P>
    <P>I am delighted the Bill has already been modified to facilitate bringing the Director of Public Prosecutions before the House to answer questions about the policy of his office and how it is administered.  It was ludicrous that it took Marian Finucane's radio show to force this House and the Taoiseach to see there was a logical argument and a need for a mechanism compelling the Director of Public Prosecutions to answer questions before the House.  I listened to that programme and thought it was good as interesting queries came from the general public about many important issues.  I did not see why the same questions could not have been asked in this House by the elected representatives of the people, many of whom spoke on the show anyway.  That incident illustrated the degree to which we are overcautious about the need for protection of individuals in powerful public office positions.</P>
    <P>That applies equally to the Office of the Attorney General I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe.  This Bill represents a rowing back from the position achieved last November by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security when the Attorney General and officials from his office answered questions when they came before the committee.  This Bill seems to give too much protection to the Office of the Attorney General. While this office has a lot of responsibility for important issues, the Attorney General should be as accountable to the House on its duties as a Minister would be and have to answer questions in the same fashion.  The Bill falls well short of that and it is a major drawback.</P>
    <P>I am at a loss as to why the Bill only provides for the compellability of witnesses to the committees that already have these powers.  The standing legislative committees, for example, are excluded from the remit of this Bill.  All committees should have these powers because we can never foresee the circumstances when such powers may be necessary or need to be used by our <Col N="1183" /> legislative committees in respect of their duties and functions.  Confining it to those committees that already enjoy the power to compel and summon witnesses before them is a limited measure and it needs to be changed.</P>
    <P>Our present committee system is still not acting or operating effectively. When we debated the reform of Dáil procedures and the establishment of new committees earlier this year, we were given undertakings by the then Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Barrett, that legislative committees would have a role in formulating legislation by becoming involved much earlier than heretofore in their formulation and that committees could, for example, have brainstorming sessions on the Heads of Bills. They should also meet civil servants and committee members could offer their views as to what should go into legislation from the beginning.  That has not happened.  There has been no practical involvement of committees in the formulation of legislation at the early stages and this is regrettable.</P>
    <P>I raised the Government of Universities Bill on the Order of Business on numerous occasions, much to the chagrin of the Ceann Comhairle.  This is a classic case of where the Select Committee on Social Affairs should have been involved at a much earlier stage.  A number of position papers have been produced on that Bill.  Many of them are in the public domain because the media have secured them.  The heads of the universities also have copies of these position papers and have been involved in negotiations and discussions with the Ministers, which is fair enough.  It is now clear from media reports that there has been a considerable rowing back from the original position paper to the present one.  The one body of people who have been totally excluded from the process are the Members of this House who are meant to be the legislators and have an input to the legislative process.</P>
    <P>A final discussion document, which <Col N="1184" /> contains the agreed position of all the heads of the universities, the Minister and the Department of Education, will now come before the House almost as a <i>fait accompli.</i> The degree of influence or input which Members of this House will have on that will be negligible, as will the degree of changes made during the debate in this House.  That is one example; there are many others.  This example illustrates to me the degree to which our committee system is not effective in being involved in legislative proposals at an early stage and having a genuine input to framing legislation. That has not happened and is unlikely to happen.</P>
    <P>The culture of secrecy and of not giving the full answers or information to Dáil questions or of giving evasive answers still reigns supreme.  There has been no magical change.  My experience of the education area tells me the emphasis seems to be on telling people only what one needs to tell, giving them the minimum amount of information and avoiding answering particular questions if at all possible.  There is still a tremendous reluctance to publish reports.  It is ridiculous that Members have to table Dáil questions asking for the publications of reports on education matters.  I, like others, have had to do this.  Some requests have been refused while others have been granted.</P>
    <P>Many who read the statements made last November are disillusioned because nothing has changed in the process 12 months later.  There was a minimalist change two weeks ago with the written question rule but the entire situation needs to be changed and be allied to the strategic management initiative in the Civil Service.  Many civil servants would be more than willing to have more openness in how they operate and would have no problems with releasing more information.  However, this is the way the system has operated for years. Everyone is part of it and unfortunately it is still continuing.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about a number of other features of the Bill.  Section 7 <Col N="1185" /> (3) provides that, if the Taoiseach considers that it would be in the public interest to refuse to give such a declaration, he/she shall so refuse.  That declaration concerns whether witnesses would have to give certain information they have at their disposal.  There are procedures in section 6 where witnesses can claim exemption from giving certain information and four categories are listed.  If the information they have falls into any of those categories, the committee cannot compel them to publish that information and that needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>The section also seems to give the Taoiseach a veto over whether that information can be disclosed by giving him the power to make a judgment in the public interest.  That places the Taoiseach of the day in a difficult situation and it may be wise to remove it.  The commission set up under the Ethics in Public Office Bill might be the appropriate body to decide on admissibility of information and whether witnesses should disclose certain information. There could be a conflict of interest between a Taoiseach and officials acting under him or her or under a Minister and the Taoiseach will decide whether the public interest is best served by the disclosure of information.  If the Taoiseach makes the case that the information should not be disclosed he or she would be open to allegations of a cover up and hiding behind this procedure.  We could write the script of what would transpire.  Even if the decision was correct the perception would be one of hiding the truth and so on.  That section must be examined and changed.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe mentioned legal representation.  Will those who appear before committees have the right to legal representation and what form will it take?  What are the implications for the effective implementation of the Bill if that proves to be the case?  Another issue of concern is the definition of areas where information cannot be brought forward, in particular the heading &ldquo;security of the State&rdquo;.  When we <Col N="1186" /> consider the development of nuclear power and military technology we need not be paranoid about the security of the State.  We probably overstate our case.  We should put protections in place to ensure that &ldquo;security of the State&rdquo; is not used as a blocking measure to prevent the disclosure of information.</P>
    <P>Senior public officials such as the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Attorney General and the Governor of the Central Bank should appear before committees and this House to answer for their activities.  Section 5 details areas which are outside the scope of compellability in all circumstances.  One of these is &ldquo;matters currently before the courts including the European courts&rdquo;. What do we mean by &ldquo;before the courts&rdquo;.  Is a matter before the courts if a summons has been issued or if proceedings have been instituted?  That must be clarified.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with Cabinet confidentiality to a certain extent.  I share the caution which is manifest in the Bill.  We may have a referendum on the issue in the future.  If everything said at Cabinet is in the public domain we would go down the road of government by the media with which I do not agree.  We need to clarify the relationship between this Bill and the promised Bill and referendum on Cabinet confidentiality.</P>
    <P>Civil servants are precluded from offering an opinion on policy.  That is correct as politicians are responsible for policy.  They are elected by the people to run the country according to their political manifestos and are judged on their performance in subsequent elections.  The function of the Civil Service is to serve the political mandate of politicians.  In a memorable speech in 1924 Kevin O'Higgins set the ground rules of the relationship between the Civil Service and politicians and between the Garda Síochána and the civil arm of the State.  Those fundamental principles still hold true.  Irrespective of the merits or demerits of politicians ideas and policy, some of which are daft, politicians are elected by the people and the will of the <Col N="1187" /> people must reign supreme in a democracy.</P>
    <P>The Bill is limited and does not usher in a new era of transparency in the way the State conducts its business.  On 16 November 1994 the Taoiseach stated:</P>
    <P>We need a new government that will reform the institutions of this State to make every Member of this House who holds office truly accountable. We need reform to ensure that when the answers to questions asked in the House are not adequate the Ceann Comhairle can demand that a further answer be given.</P>
    <P>We know that no one demands that the Ceann Comhairle put pressure on anyone, particularly on the Government side, to provide more information or ensure questions are answered.  I thank the Chair for allowing me contribute to the debate and look forward to putting down amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a possibility that I may wish to share my time.  It would appear to many who read the title of the Bill that this should be a most boring and mundane debate. However, it is an interesting one and Deputy Martin's contribution has shown the diversity of opinion on the issue.</P>
      <P>The Bill is a first step in giving an opportunity to those who are unaccustomed to participating in the system to see how business is conducted.  People can be assured that the concerns they express to public representatives will not only be addressed by them but by the representative with responsibility for the area in question.</P>
      <P>There is a saying that information is power.  It is extremely dangerous to relinquish the power to distribute information.  We live in a technical era and it will be obvious to the public if a question is not properly put and answered or if insufficient notice is taken of a query.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Society is changing and I hate when people say it is crumbling around us. <Col N="1188" /> However, it will crumble if we do not welcome and manage the change.  The system has not changed for 20 years. This Bill is a first step in the process of change.  People demand to know exactly how the business of Government is conducted and they are right to demand accountability because they pay for and elect Governments.  Responsibility and accountability are two sides of the same coin so far as democracy is concerned.</P>
    <P>Our democracy has been tarnished by the steadfast refusal of successive Government to throw open the shutters on the business of Government. Not only Governments but politicians have suffered because of this.  For years Ministers were able to complacently dodge Dáil questions secure in the knowledge that no forum had the power to bring them to book.  This practice, to which Deputy Martin referred, of giving as little information as possible as late as possible culminated in the refusal of Fianna Fáil Ministers to answer questions on the beef industry.  Everyone recognises that this was a mistake.  It was a denial of democracy which led to the hugely expensive beef tribunal.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a cornerstone of this Government's programme of renewal together with other elements such as the introduction of freedom of information legislation, a relaxation of the absolute principle of Cabinet confidentiality, a review of the Official Secrets Act and the reform of the antediluvian Ministers and Secretaries Act.  This Bill is a small part of a package which will be the first step.  These measures form a comprehensive package of reform designed to shed light on the process of Government, and to ensure that those who formulate and implement policy are fully accountable to Members of the Oireachtas and, ultimately, the people.</P>
    <P>Since the foundation of the State we have witnessed a fundamental alteration in the relationship between Government and those it governs.  Yet our institutions have not kept pace with social and political changes.  Many of our procedures were adopted wholesale from Westminster, not withstanding the fact <Col N="1189" /> that unlike the UK we have a written Constitution.  <i>The unwritten English Constitution</i> of Walter Bagehot has hung over successive Irish Governments over the past 70 years.  The 19th century view outlined by Bagehot was that the business of Government was to govern rather than to inform.  The principle of consent, an essential pillar of democracy which we uphold, was reserved for general elections.  That was the only time he considered the public had a right to be consulted.  Democracy was viewed as periodic rather than continuous.</P>
    <P>As we approach the 21st century there is a growing impetus to broaden our democracy.  If we consider the civil wars which have taken place in Europe, it is essential that we cherish our democracy and ensure that it works.  There is also a realisation that elected representatives must function not only as legislators but also as monitors on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>Until now the Oireachtas committees have largely been confined to teasing out the finer points of legislation.  That is a valuable role and, indeed, the legislative function of committees is often underestimated by commentators who view Deputies as overpaid <i>apparatchiks</i> who spend their days trotting between the voting lobby and the Dáil bar.</P>
    <P>However, the ability of committees to examine and probe the issues of the day &mdash; with the exception of the Committee of Public Accounts&mdash;has been limited by the absence of legislation enabling them to compel the attendance of appropriate witnesses who have been deterred by the absence of privilege.  We must not forget that.  It is easy to publicly call for an official to attend a committee to be scrutinised.  I would not consider the use of the word &ldquo;explain&rdquo; to be correct.  If a witness comes before a committee, he should articulate his position rather than explain.  We should not be in an adversarial position.</P>
    <P>The public views the committees as being largely irrelevant.  The proposals in this legislation will help to transform the role of the Oireachtas committees <Col N="1190" /> enabling them on behalf of the electorate, to delve into matters of public importance and to seek answers to questions being asked by the people. However, I am concerned at the restrictions in the legislation.  The two contributors I listened to this morning expressed the same fears.  I appreciate there are certain matters which, in the public interest, must remain closed to public scrutiny.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why, according to section 5, discussions by civil servants at committees appointed by the Government should be exempt from this legislation.  Surely such discussions do not fall under the imperative of Cabinet confidentiality?  If they do, is that not a reason to speedily reform the Cabinet confidentiality rules rather than limiting the scope of the legislation?  I do not understand why information used to assess liability for taxes, duties and other payments owed to the State and public bodies should not be covered.  It is possible to reveal such information without compromising the individual's right to privacy.  Fair taxation is essential to the equitable conduct of public affairs.  There is a perception that taxation in this State is anything but fair and that PAYE workers bear a disproportionate share of the tax burden, while the self-employed and large farmers pay less then their due.</P>
    <P>It is in the public interest that information regarding tax liabilities, especially liabilities which are not met, be disclosed to Members of the Oireachtas.  There are a number of precedents for disclosing such information without referring to named individuals and I urge the Minister to revisit this section with a view to bringing taxation matters within the scope of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Section 3, which exempts certain officeholders, also appears to present some problems.  I believe the Taoiseach is looking at this and it should be noted that the Government side as well as the Opposition have reservations.  I appreciate the need to maintain the independence of the Judiciary and legal officers <Col N="1191" /> of the State.  However, I would welcome a broadening of the compellability provision as regards the Office of the Attorney General whose function is political as well as administrative.  Committees other than the Committee of Public Accounts should be entitled to compel witnesses from the Office of the Attorney General.  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Attorney General are referred to almost daily.  Previously, these Offices were rarely mentioned and only in relation to very technical matters.  We should look again at this section.</P>
    <P>On a more positive note.  I welcome the section which exempts from compellability the source of any information contained in a statement by a Member of the Oireachtas in the House or in a committee.  The trust between a Member of the Oireachtas and the public &mdash; this Bill is about how we relate to those who elect us &mdash; is essential to the functioning of our democracy.  The public must feel free to come to any Oireachtas Member with information or questions secure in the knowledge that the source of such information will not be revealed and that they will not be exposed to adverse consequences as a result of having passed on such information.  I will not revisit debates we have had over the years as a result of information passed on to Oireachtas Members.</P>
    <P>This principle is copperfastened in the Bill and I hope the concept of protection of sources will be enshrined in other legislation in this area.  In this regard, I hope the forthcoming Freedom of Information Bill will contain a clause enabling journalists to protect their sources except in certain clearly defined cases where it is in the public interest for such sources to be revealed.</P>
    <P>On entering office the Taoiseach said that Government must be as transparent as if it were being conducted behind a pane of glass.  This legislation will go some way towards fulfilling that aspiration.  It is, however, only one element of a package of reforms which <Col N="1192" /> must be speedily enacted if our democracy is to be strengthened.  As for Government being conducted behind a pane of glass, there are still certain elements that need to be protected.</P>
    <P>A recent book about Deputy Reynolds, who will go down in history as being mainly responsible for bringing about peace, refers to an off-the-cuff remark by a Minister whose statement at a currency crisis meeting resulted in a decrease in the German Mark.  There are times when we need to be careful what we say and how we say it.  We must be as open as possible and inform the people who elect us how we spend their money and order their lives.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, in which I have more than a passing interest.  Having sought for the best part of two years to have it introduced, I am delighted it has at last made an appearance.  I very much regret that some of the restrictions, about which I was concerned and which I discussed with officials when I was Minister of State, remain in the Bill.  It does not differ greatly from the draft of the previous Bill.  Why did it take such a long time to bring before the House a Bill that was in draft form this time last year and appears not to have been altered greatly in the meantime?  The Government is supposed to be totally committed to openness, transparency and accountability, but that claim rings hollow with many people, and their doubts are justified by the fact that it took 12 months to bring this Bill before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In certain quarters of the Civil Service as well as in political circles there are grave reservations about this and other Bills.  It was my experience in dealing with civil servants that many of them would welcome much more openness and an opportunity at various times to justify actions taken under policy directions by Minister.  There is perhaps a suspicion that civil servants do not welcome Bills such as this, but the vast majority, particularly civil servants other than those at top levels in Departments, would be happier with a more <Col N="1193" /> open system.  Very often they wish to justify their actions but do not have an opportunity to do so.  Perhaps that opportunity will be available to them under this and other Bills.</P>
    <P>Having had knowledge of the previous draft of the Bill, I wonder whether it is worth the bother of putting this legislation through the House.  Party because of my experience of the Bill introduced this time last year to allow a committee to investigate events at that time and partly because of background information I received about the implications of the Haughey judgment, I do not know whether this Bill will be effective or whether the constitutional rights of people appearing before committees will be vindicated.  While I agree committees should have powers of investigation.  I have no doubt that, even on enactment of this Bill, clever individuals will be able to tie committees up in knots on the basis of that much-cherished document, the Constitution. There must be ways and means of vindicating the rights of people appearing before committees but in that respect I am not sure this Bill will be effective.</P>
    <P>The Bill will be very helpful to the House in investigating political matters relating to the activities of Ministers since it provides for the setting up of political inquiries.  The history of inquiries since the foundation of the State, whether relating to the beef tribunal or Locke's distillery, is not good in that reports have been produced but no conclusions have been drawn.  Some form of inquiry is necessary to deal with charges of a political nature which are sometimes made in this House, and this Bill goes some way towards dealing with that matter.</P>
    <P>Does anybody believe that under section 7 (1) it will be possible to make inquiries into certain matters?  Will the Opposition, or even concerned Government Deputies, ever be in a position to make inquiries?  Will the Taoiseach of the day sign a certificate at any time in the future to say that a person should give evidence to this committee?  It is <Col N="1194" /> difficult to believe, in view of the escape clause in section 7 (1), that a Taoiseach would sign a document to compel somebody to go before a committee and answer questions where they would be embarrassing for the Government and might mean a Minister or the Government having to resign.  That provision should be looked at again.  The Taoiseach will have a role with regard to matters pertaining to the security of the State but that role should not be as all-encompassing as it is in this section.  A Taoiseach can effectively stop an inquiry in its tracks by refusing to say that a person must come before a committee.  That should not be allowed in view of what this Bill is attempting to do.</P>
    <P>We have seen a recent example of what can happen in this regard.  A Government Minister was loud in his condemnation of certain activities of a semi-State company.  There have been three calls for an inquiry and the Government parties have voted them down on three occasions.  That clearly illustrates what will happen.  Section 7 (1) will facilitate that happening again and we will be back to square one.  We are bringing ourselves into disrepute.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the point made by Deputies Martin, O'Keeffe and others. Why does the Bill restrict to certain committees the right to send for papers, documents and witnesses?  It should not contain that restriction as all committees of this House should have those powers.  We have the remedy in our own hands &mdash; we can change the terms of reference of each of the committees to give them the power to send for persons and papers although it would be a pity if we had to follow that route because many of the legislative committees would go off on all sorts of tangents. The Bill should not contain that restriction.  Every committee of the House should have that power by resolution of the House which will ensure that the committee does not necessarily make the decision itself.  The House should be able to give powers to a committee to investigate certain matters and it should <Col N="1195" /> not be restricted to the committees mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with section 3 which provides that the Attorney General should not come before a committee. Nobody should be excluded from appearing before a committee of this House.  I am delighted the Taoiseach said that the Director of Public Prosecutions should appear before a committee of the House; so should the Attorney General and every other person who is employed and paid by the State.  In the last 30 years and particularly in the last ten years we have established quangos and bodies of various types that are given specific directions by Government to carry out certain policies.  They are given independence to do so and that is a good thing.</P>
    <P>However, in this House we continually fail to make a proper distinction between independence and accountability.  Anybody in charge of a State or semi-State organisation or a quango that is expending large sums of taxpayers' money and is in a position to abuse his or her power &mdash; usually his where these bodies are concerned &mdash; should be accountable and we, as representatives of the people, should have the power to bring them before the House and question them as to how they are discharging their functions.  It is either that, or the Minister who appoints these bodies should be made responsible for their actions so that we can avoid the situation in which a question about roads or roads policy to the Minister for the Environment is diverted to the National Roads Authority or a question on a health matter is referred to a health board.  We are doing ourselves an injustice by excluding such people.  Under the Bill most of them can be brought before the House but the Attorney General is specifically excluded.  He should not be and I hope that before Committee Stage the Minister and the Government will have second thoughts in that regard.  There is no reason the Attorney General should <Col N="1196" /> not appear before a committee of the House.</P>
    <P>Section 4 refers to the terms of reference of a committee.  It states: &ldquo;A committee may not direct a person to give evidence, or produce or send a document, to it or attend before it to give evidence, or produce a document, to it which is outside its terms of reference.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I can see this provision being tied up for years in various courts.  Who will decide what is outside the terms of reference of the committee?  If the chairman decides that a document or a person or a matter being inquired into is outside the terms of reference of the committee and a Member says that it is not, who will be the arbiter?  The Member will have to vindicate his right somewhere else, in the High Court or the Supreme Court.  There should be clarification of this provision and, if necessary, it should be amended to provide a clear line of decision about such matters.</P>
    <P>My other major problem with the Bill relates to section 5 which outlines the matters outside the scope of the Bill.  I have no difficulty, as others appear to have, in excluding discussions at Cabinet and with maintaining Cabinet confidentiality.  I have no difficulty with the Supreme Court ruling in that regard. Having sat at the Cabinet table in my capacity as Chief Whip, having listened to those discussions and seen the interaction, I believe the one way to cripple Government decision making processes and the cut and thrust of discussion around the table in which everybody gives their opinion until a decision is finally made &mdash; and to finish real Government &mdash; is to introduce provisions whereby discussions at Cabinet table can become non-confidential.  It would be madness of the highest order and I am as much, if not more, committed to accountability as those who preach it every day.</P>
    <P>Fifteen Ministers would have to go to the Cabinet table with a prepared script of what they planned to say.  They would have to carefully file everything they say at such meetings so that two, three or <Col N="1197" /> four years hence they could refer back to what they said.  I have no problem with Government decisions or Government papers or memoranda.  However, I have a problem with abolishing the confidentiality of discussions.  The Minister and Chief Whip, Deputy Higgins, is here.  He attends Cabinet meetings and I guarantee him that in four weeks time he would not be able to give an accurate recollection of what happened at the Cabinet table this week.  It would be subject to all sorts of interpretations. One can only go by the Government's decisions and that is the end of the matter.  The way the decision was reached around the Cabinet table is not relevant. We should cop ourselves on before such madness gets out of hand.  Every party has been in Government during the past seven or eight years and I would be amazed if any Member who has been in Government would agree that Cabinet discussions should be subject to such scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Regarding section 5, I am concerned about provisions relating to court actions.  The Minister should clarify the position regarding matters outside the scope of the Bill such as issues which are the subject of proceedings before the courts.  All Members are familiar with the infamous gagging writs issued to prevent matters being discussed or raised in the House.  That position has changed because to all intents and purposes we have abolished the <i>sub judice</i> rule, but under this legislation it is proposed to revert to the position where a person may issue a write preventing a matter being subjected to an investigation by the House.  That must be addressed and the Minister should clarify the position.  If that provision is retained in the Bill, it will make the Bill useless in many respects.</P>
    <P>The famous phrase &ldquo;the security of the State&rdquo; is mentioned many times in the Bill.  With due respect to the officials in the Department of Justice, they have a wide interpretation of what is meant by that phrase.  It literally means anything, including signs on the wall directing people where to go in the <Col N="1198" /> Department of Justice which could be an official secret.  I do not favour the inclusion of that phrase in legislation. As its interpretation is so wide-ranging, it should not be included in a Bill.  Any person could plead they were acting in the interests of the security in the State. If an investigation is required into some matter in the Department of Justice, the phrase &ldquo;the security of the State&rdquo; would appear in every letter relating to that inquiry.  That phrase must be properly defined.</P>
    <P>Section 9 requires clarification.  I may be interpreting the section incorrectly, but it appears that if a clerical officer or staff officer of a Department is summoned to appear before a committee the Secretary of the Department must be informed and he or she, the official's employer, may appear before the committee in the official's place.  I do not disagree with the notification procedure, but it appears that an official can be replaced by a superior.  I hope that is not the case and I seek clarification of section 9(1)(a).</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the spirit in which it was introduced by the Minister.  As he said, this is revolutionary legislation about which many of us have been talking for some time.  Some of my colleagues who are chairmen of committees have advocated that without the power of compellability and subsequent protection of witnesses' rights some committee work will be stymied due to lack of co-operation.  Other members of my party who are chairmen of committees will identify some of the difficulties they encountered, particularly in regard to those responsible for the spending of public money who have refused to attend and supply information to a committee.  I am sure my colleague, Deputy Kavanagh, will have more to say on that topic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister touched on some of the points raised by Deputy Dempsey who was involved in the drafting of the Bill. The Minister said the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, who will be responsible for steering the Bill through the <Col N="1199" /> Oireachtas, will consider suggestions that might improve it or remove anomalies.  The Bill is undergoing political analysis and I expect it will be the subject of an excellent debate in the House.</P>
    <P>As chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs I have received nothing but co-operation from all concerned particularly Government members, who were requested to appear before us.  It has always been said that Ministers implemented Cabinet decisions and followed decisions by the EU or directives from the European Commission with little accountability to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Following such decisions there is public analysis to determine if such decisions were good, bad or indifferent and how they affected the lives of our people.  Many of the decisions, particularly those taken at meetings of the European Council of Ministers are very relevant to Irish people, whether the business, social or agricultural sector.  Decisions arrived at during Council of Ministers meetings are of relevance to this House and, on the basis of accountability, to the people who elect us.  People elect us to represent them at all levels.</P>
    <P>The Government set up new committees, particularly the Joint Committee on European Affairs, and gave them new terms of reference empowering them to compel officials, Ministers, holders of high office and journalists to appear before them.  This Bill will confer additional power on committees to compel witnesses to appear.  The committee of which I am chairman has interviewed ten Ministers and Ministers of State.  They, and their officials, briefed the committee on the position they adopted in Europe.</P>
    <P>The committee chaired by Deputy Mitchell was briefed by the Minister of State on the Reflection Group which is preparing the Government's position on the Intergovernmental Conference. That Minister of State made himself available to the committee in the afternoon following a meeting he attended in <Col N="1200" /> Brussels that morning.  That should clarify the position in case the public are under any misapprehension that a culture of secrecy still exists or that the Government is guilty of not being transparent and open as its members said they want to be.  This facility has been and is available to my committee.  With respect to those who criticise committees, the members of all political parties who are members of the committee are satisfied with the responses that have been forthcoming from Ministers in the public arena.  Subject to media and television coverage, Ministers have come forward and given their views as well as written documentation.  There has been no effort to cover up any decision arrived at before the committee was set up.</P>
    <P>An EU directive which had a direct bearing on cargo and baggage handling at Dublin Airport created confusion, unhappiness, discontent and much unnecessary fear in the minds of the trade union movement representing those workers.  They sought an opportunity to put before the committee their concerns in a thorough and forthcoming manner.  We immediately requested the relevant Minister, Deputy Lowry, to come before the committee and explain if the trade union's concern was well founded, to explain to the public what was decided by the Community and the Commission.</P>
    <P>On the occasion of the Minister's attendance at the committee the Opposition tried to use his presence for other, ulterior motives but failed because we specifically asked him to come before the committee to give evidence on a specific subject for which he was accountable to the committee, the trade unions and the people.  That was a most useful procedure.  When the Minister was responding we invited the trade unions to come and listen to what he was saying.  Arising from that, further meetings took place between the Minister and Commissioner Kinnock who had overall responsibility.  We discovered that the decision had not been made but the decision in principle had <Col N="1201" /> been made by the Minister's predecessor, which confused all the political pundits.  This is a useful power.  There is no doubt that the House and the Minister are prepared to listen to reasonable amendments in this regard.</P>
    <P>I see nothing wrong with precluding Cabinet confidentiality from public discussion because, as Deputy Dempsey said, it might undermine the workings of Government and the Executive.  Likewise the Attorney General, in his special role as a constitutional lawyer and as an adviser to the Government, should not be subject to critical analysis by a committee.  Recently the Attorney General attended the Committee of Public Accounts for the purpose of giving evidence and to speak on areas which were the responsibility of that committee <i>vis-à-vis</i> spending and value for money in the adminstration of that office.  That is appropriate.  I have no doubt that if somebody is refused permission to come forward on the basis of the preclusions in the Bill a written authority for that refusal will be forthcoming.  Everybody would then, understand the reason was serious and probably involved Cabinet confidentiality or the security of the State.</P>
    <P>As an elected Member, everything I say or do is subject to critical analysis, examination, media publicity and so on. On a daily basis some people in the media act as if they have a special privileged position because the terms of their arrangements were agreed on the understanding that information would not be divulged to anybody.  If those in the media were paid the same as Members I have no doubt they would make use of such information on a daily basis.  Not only do these people vote themselves wage and salary increases but they will not tell anybody about it because it is secret.  Of course, we do not vote ourselves anything &mdash; we do not have that power.  If we did have that power, perhaps we would pay ourselves properly.</P>
    <P>Everything we do, from the day we are elected, is subject to critical analysis. On the first day I became a member of <Col N="1202" /> a county council or an urban council I had to sign the register of interests of members <i>vis-à-vis</i> ownership of property that might be involved in planning or any other decision I could have influenced.  I did not have any problem with that or in signing the register of interests following the passage of the Ethics in Public Office Act.  This created problems for many people simply because there was some area of their lives which they did not want to make public, particularly as it related to their holding an elected office as a Dáil Deputy or Senator.  I do not have any problem with these requests because I offer myself to the public in the knowledge that whether I am a Member, a chairman of a committee or a member of a county council I am in the public arena and paid from the public purse.  Likewise I have no problem in registering with the data protection commissioner information such as social security numbers, PRSI numbers, tax numbers or any information in connection with my constituents, who come to me in their wisdom.  The fact that I retain some of that information in my data base requires me to register.  I do not have a problem with that and I do it because it is my public duty.  Likewise, under the new Freedom of Information Bill, which is being prepared, why should people not have information if it is in their interest?</P>
    <P>I am in discussion with various colleagues in the COSAC group of European committees on how to break down the communication gap between Government, parliament and the people.  If we do not keep the people informed of what we are doing they will lose interest, particularly in European affairs.  They are only interested in Europe as it affects their daily lives and it affects many in a positive way.</P>
    <P>I worry because from time to time, following the Intergovernmental Conference, it will be necessary to hold further referenda to try to come to grips with changes which will be necessary following the introduction of the Maas-stricht Treaty.  Inevitably, fundamental changes will take place, following the <Col N="1203" /> Maastricht Treaty, which will require referenda.  If we are not able to communicate to the public the significance and the reason for referenda, it is possible that some could be lost, with tremendous implications for this country.</P>
    <P>The recent successful challenge to the rights of Government to spend money to advise the public in a particular way raises the question of the Government being able to communicate a message in the interests of the common good.  In the event of the message not being transmitted in a forthright manner, we could run the risk of losing a referendum in the future.  That is a serious consequence of the recent decision but it makes us who work on committees responsible in every way possible.</P>
    <P>Some of the newer members of the European Union, particularly the Scandinavians have set up various named committees, from grand to European committees, all with the same function. They have taken to themselves many new powers which some of the older committees, such as the UK, the German and the French committees do not have.</P>
    <P>The Danish Committee, for example, can virtually veto its Government Ministers.  Before decisions are made in the Council of Ministers they must come before the committee, account for what they are doing and obtain the approval of the committee before casting a vote in a particular way.  That is a powerful weapon for a committee.  It may be cumbersome, if one is in the final throes of reaching an agreement, but it places an obligation on Ministers to report back to the committee every Friday, explain their actions and receive its <i>imprimatur</i> before signing any agreement.</P>
    <P>Our committees do not have that power, and have not sought it, but they can advise Minister in the knowledge that cross-party views are expressed at committee meetings.  Ministers are beginning to appreciate the fact that they are not going to Europe simply as <Col N="1204" /> Ministers of the Executive but in consultation with all other representatives in this Parliament.  When Ministers and officials respond positively to requests to appear before committees, it is an indication that the committee system, of which people have been critical, is working reasonably well.</P>
    <P>Committees are obliged to report to a plenary session of the Dáil on the work they have completed, the work on hand, attendances at meetings and their voting records.  A full debate on that information takes place, thereby completing the cycle of transparency and accountability.  In that way, the Ministers who have come before us, and others we may request to attend, will be accountable to this House also.</P>
    <P>It is important also that the Bill confers on witnesses before committees the same privilege afforded to witnesses before the High Court.  That is appropriate because people must be assured that what they say will not be subject subsequently to a legal challenge.  They will be giving their evidence and answering questions based on what they regard as a legitimate interpretation of events.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents a great step forward.  It is an issue we have been talking about in my party for quite some time. It is appropriate that it has come before the Dáil.  I realise the Bill may be amended for the purposes of improving it but its supreme principle is that Parliament, through its elected representatives, must have the power to ensure that everybody in the public services is accountable to it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, the principle of which is to strengthen the committees of the House and make them more meaningful.  I have enjoyed participating in various committees of the House since I first became a Member in 1989.  At that time there was ongoing controversy about the need for a tribunal to investigate the beef industry, an issue I will return to later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will have an opportunity for a more detailed debate on Committee <Col N="1205" /> Stage.  I welcome the fact that the Minister for Finance indicated the Bill was not perfect and that he remains open to any reasonable suggestions to improve it.</P>
    <P>We have all heard about compellability and the testing of it in 1970.  When I first came into this House there was much controversy and ambiguity surrounding the then Taoiseach and his Government with regard to answering questions on the beef industry.  A number of Members of the then Opposition were calling for the establishment of a tribunal.  We can only learn from that experience, particularly in terms of the costs involved to the State.  I table questions periodically on the costs of the tribunal which, when everything is calculated and the Taxing Master has paid all the outstanding bills, will probably amount to £70 million.  I understand the current figure is approximately £30 million.</P>
    <P>I have sat on a number of committees and had the privilege of being the convenor to the first Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  Despite the fact that we must work in accordance with regulations governing committees and that some of the new standing committees are still in their infancy, the committees in general have achieved a great deal, particularly the committee of inquiry which investigated the events of December 1994.  That committee achieved what it set out to do by completing its inquiry and reporting to the Dáil accordingly.  Few difficulties arose in relation to the witnesses called to appear before the committee of inquiry, with the exception of a Minister of State in this Government who indicated initially that he would attend but then indicated in a flippant manner that baby meal times had to be adhered to.  The same individual had made quite outlandish statements in the House about evidence available to him.  It subsequently emerged he did not have any such evidence.  When one examines the record of the Government on accountability and transparency, one discovers it is questionable.  While not wanting to <Col N="1206" /> tar everybody with the same brush, that has been the case of a number of colleagues of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins.  When in Opposition Members have availed of an opportunity to climb on the bandwagon at a particularly delicate or sensitive time on a national issue, but when the acid test is applied they are not prepared to stand over their wild allegations.  If this Bill prevents the recurrence of such practice, I wholeheartedly welcome it.</P>
    <P>On the matter of compellability and privileges of witnesses, questions to be put to them, documentation and so on, there is need for much greater clarity. Section 5 sets out the areas which are outside the scope of compellability in all circumstances and goes on to list them, while another section specifies the categories of witnesses that cannot be compelled to give evidence before a committee of the House.  I should like the Minister to give a clearer definition of those witnesses named by the Minister for Finance, such as the President, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the officials of their offices, members of the Judiciary, the Attorney General, members of his or her staff and so on and spheres within which the Taoiseach has what might be described as a veto. I should like to know why this was deemed necessary and the considerations in arriving at that decision.</P>
    <P>This would appear to be a Bill which will create conditions for accountability and transparency in the case of witnesses appearing before House committees.  I welcome these provisions and the fact that each committee will provide annual reports.  When the Dáil is not in session, the public assume we are all on holiday, whereas the contrary is the case.  Perhaps when these committees are working, when investigations are in train which receive the necessary media coverage, highlighting their deliberations, the true message will reach the electorate.  Last Christmas, when I normally try to get a break with my wife and family.  I had to attend the inquiry that lasted right up to budget day.  The public generally would have thought <Col N="1207" /> most Members were free of their parliamentary duties.  It is a pity there is need for House committees to engage in investigations and inquiries and require press coverage to highlight the fact that they are in session and engaging in that task.  In recent years these committees, with full and frank exchanges between Members, Ministers and their officials, provided with the requisite secretarial assistance and facilities, have done excellent work and allowed Members discard the straitjacket normally imposed on them within this Chamber. The more we can highlight their good work the better.</P>
    <P>This Bill affords committees the powers to take whatever action is deemed to be necessary for their purposes at any given time.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ferris referred to the burning question of Government expenditure of £500,000 on advocating a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; vote in the forthcoming referendum on divorce. It is galling to read a letter circulated by the then Leader of the Opposition, now Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, on his position in regard to such expenditure. I cannot recall its full contents but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We all have seen it from time to time.  Deputy Callely need not worry about it.  Deputy Callely knew better than the High Court; he is advocating we should sack the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it clearly indicated that the then Leader of the Opposition would object to such expenditure which, to paraphrase him, would coerce somebody to vote in a certain way and would not represent a fair presentation of the arguments advanced on both sides.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the circulating of that letter, which many constituents brought to my attention, the need to address fairness has arisen.  Let us be quite clear on this issue &mdash; perhaps Deputy Dukes would welcome a clear understanding of it. When I tabled a question to the Taoiseach, he decided he would not answer it.  Is that what he regards as &ldquo;accountability&rdquo;?  He arranged for its transfer.  I <Col N="1208" /> continued to endeavour to elicit some evidence of accountability on his part. When he sat in this very seat, he gave a clear indication of his intention some four or five weeks prior to his assuming his present high office.  Since then, it would appear that his partners in Government have persuaded him to change his stance or course of action. One does not know because he has refused to answer my question.</P>
    <P>I followed a number of avenues open to me to try to get clarification of the issue of the fairness of the Government spending £500,000 on the referendum campaign.  Of late there have been developments in the campaign on the proposed amendment of the Constitution but these are of no benefit; the Minister for Finance put his foot in it and had to withdraw statements, and the Minister for Social Welfare blatantly and boldly exploited his office in an attack on the Catholic bishops and, unlike his colleague, the Minister for Finance, has not apologised.  This is regrettable and I hope the Minister for Social Welfare will see the light and make the necessary apology as quickly as possible.  There is no doubt that the debate is becoming heated.  People on either side of the argument are boiling, and some are spilling over as we have seen in the case of the Ministers for Finance and Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Let me return to the burning question of the provision of information and documentation to ensure that the general public, who are a sophisticated electorate, will make an informed and fair decision freely without being bewildered or browbeaten.  It is important, particularly in the light of the recent High Court ruling, that we stand back and allow the people to make an informed decision, particularly in referenda which are the utmost in democracy.  This has only been achieved on this occasion because people outside this House, at their own expense, brought a case before the courts when Ministers failed to give a fair response to Deputies in the House.</P>
    <P>Committees will have the power to <Col N="1209" /> make investigations, compel witnesses to appear, and to adjudicate on matters they are dealing with.  Will the general public be able to bring matters of concern to them to the attention of a committee without the expense of having to go through the legal system?  The Minister should give the public access to and indicate how they can avail of the system.  It might be by writing to the chairman of the committee and asking him or her to place a particular matter on the agenda for consideration by the committee.  Alternatively, it might be better to put in place a procedure not involving the chairman of the committee, because the membership of most committees is heavily biased so that the Government would always be in a position to decide that a committee should not entertain a particular request.</P>

      <P>The policy agreement between the three parties in Government &mdash; Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left &mdash;<i>A Government of Renewal</i> referred to the &ldquo;need for fundamental reform of the Oireachtas to make it more responsive to the needs of a modern democratic society&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In pursuit of this aim, one of the proposals on Oireachtas reform was to complete and publish this Bill and following its enactment, to form a committee of investigation.</P>
      <P>Last March, the Government brought forward a number of measures promised in our programme to enhance the Oireachtas committees.  These measures needed, however, to be complemented by those included in the Bill now published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Credit is due to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, the Minister of State, Deputy Avril Doyle, their officials and the Office of the Attorney General for their steadfast commitment and efforts in producing this Bill.  It has not been easy.  It is a relatively short Bill that has attracted much attention.  It needed to be very carefully put together and necessitated many hours of work by <Col N="1210" /> all involved.  Opposition Deputies have castigated this Government on its legislative record.  I am happy we were able to bring forward Bills such as this and I have no doubt our performance will prove itself in the end.</P>
    <P>The enactment of this Bill will result in a fundamental reform of these Houses and make the spectacle of another beef tribunal less likely in the future.  Democracy and the taxpayer will be the net beneficiaries.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give bite to Oireachtas committees which have the power to call for persons, papers and records.  The power to call witnesses and evidence, both written and oral, while bestowing privilege as enjoyed by a High Court witness will give effective powers to committees to do a much more complete investigation of the myriad of areas for which they have responsibility.  Unfortunately, to make these investigations thorough, compellability is also essential.  We have all seen how the work and the concept of the committee system has been thwarted by reluctance and evasiveness.  This will not be tolerated any longer.</P>
    <P>The only point on which I could agree with Deputy Callely related to the competence of committees and the manner in which they are generally deemed to be working effectively.  Deputy Martin mentioned that the committees had not taken on one of the key functions for which they were set up, which is to examine legislative proposals.  I wish to draw the attention of the House to the proposal in the document <i>A Government of Renewal</i>&ldquo;to give power to the committees to discuss the draft proposals for legislative changes and new legislation for recommendation to Ministers&rdquo;.  Deputy Martin did not seem to be aware that that is being done at present.  I would draw his attention to the fact that the orders of reference of the four legislative committees and the Joint Committees on European Affairs and Foreign Affairs have been amended to provide that they and Ministers of State may, where practicable, discuss with the committees general proposals <Col N="1211" /> for legislation relevant to their areas. This option has not been utilised to date although the Minister for the Environment submitted to the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs a list of suggested reforms to electoral law.</P>
    <P>In regard to Private Members' Bills, the terms of reference of the four legislation committees and the Joint Committees on European Affairs, Foreign Affairs, the Irish Language.  Women's Affairs, Sustainable Development, the Family and Small Business and Services, empower the committees to draft and discuss proposals for legislative changes for recommendation to Ministers.  The power already there might well be utilised given that we have already amended the various orders to enable the committees and Ministers to participate in a very valuable exercise.</P>
    <P>I take on board the point made by Deputy Callely that the committees are not given the recognition they deserve. We have tried to ensure, where possible, that the public is made aware that even though the House is not sitting in plenary session it is sitting in committee fulfilling a vital role and examining legislation in detail.  I exhort the media, particularly the print media, to devote the necessary resources to cover the valuable work done by committees in which there is now a much more meaningful participation by Members in regard to the detailed provisions of legislation.  We not only have a better input but also a better output in terms of comprehensive legislation whose provisions are teased out thoroughly in a depoliticised atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The Bill creates offences in the areas of contempt, perjury and the non-disclosure of evidence and stipulates penalties of fines not exceeding £1,500 for summary conviction or not exceeding £20,000 on conviction on indictment. These penalties will make the relevant committees more effective and will ensure they are taken seriously by everyone.  The compellability aspect <Col N="1212" /> has, of course, been the focal point for the Opposition in the preparation and production of the Bill.  It is now clear that, apart from attending the Committee of Public Accounts and his obligation to answer questions in regard to the general administration of his office, the Attorney General will not be compelled to attend a committee.  Like me, many others believe this is only correct given that the Attorney General is in a unique position under the Constitution, as is the President.  No one could seriously argue otherwise and it would be totally inappropriate to compel the Attorney General to attend a committee in any capacity other than that provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has stated that the Bill has already been flagged by the Government for amendment on Committee Stage regarding the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We make no apology for availing of this opportunity to display our stated policy of transparency.  The amendment referred to by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance will not impinge on the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974, which gives the Director of Public Prosecutions his independence in the performance of his functions.  He will not be compelled to discuss or comply with any specific criteria relating to particular cases and he will only be required to give evidence regarding general policy on administration in his office to a committee to be designated.  I imagine the emphasis will most likely be on the areas, persons and circumstances where the Bill does not apply.  These are valid exceptions but, as the Minister for Finance said, the Government is open to suggestions and will accept amendments if the arguments are good and sound.</P>
    <P>The Bill will give powers to the committees entitled to avail of its provisions. Following its enactment the Government intends to bring forward proposals to establish a committee of investigation which will examine matters of serious public concern.  Proposals on this committee will form part of the wideranging package of further Oireachtas reform <Col N="1213" /> measures which the Government is actively considering and will be published very shortly.  Obviously I cannot elaborate on our proposals in regard to the committee of investigation but I am confident that the House will welcome this innovative reform when it is introduced.  Last night Deputy O'Donnell said she will propose reform of the committees generally.  I look forward to receiving these proposals which will be taken into account by the Government in its consideration of Oireachtas reform measures.</P>
    <P>Having regard to this Bill, the proposed committee of investigation and the proposed package of reforms.  I am sure it is recognised that we are a Government of reform.  We do not just talk about reform.  Rather we regularly produce solid innovative and tangible measures which will make this House and the Seanad more responsive to the needs of a modern democratic society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad this Bill has been brought before the House as it constitutes a useful, targeted and selective extension of the powers of certain committees in circumstances where a degree of selectiveness is justified.  Some of its provisions may well be contentious from a legal point of view &mdash; I will refer later to certain issues which will have to be discussed in detail on Committee Stage &mdash; and it will certainly be contentious in the House.  We have already seen some indications of this and it may not be a bad thing because some Members, particularly the Members of Opposition parties, seem to want to go further than provided for in the Bill and to deal with some of its measures in a rather unselective basis.  This would not be correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is correct that this Bill is somewhat selective in terms of the powers it gives to committees and the committees to which it gives those powers.  It is essential for us to remember the functions of this House and of the Oireachtas generally and the role of committees in the performance of those functions.  As I see it, the function of the committees &mdash; I <Col N="1214" /> am glad we have expanded the committee system &mdash; is to assist the Oireachtas in its duties as a Legislature, in ensuring accountability on the part of the Government in supervising expenditure on the basis of the sums voted in the House, in assessing the effectiveness and appropriateness of legislation and in considering the manner in which that legislation is applied.  However, this House is not and cannot be &mdash; and we should not try to make it so &mdash; an alternative to the court system, a new form of court.  That is not our function under the Constitution and to the extent arguments for expanding the scope of the Bill are based on the idea that this House should have functions of judgment, they are ill founded, wrong and dangerous in the context of a constitutional system which clearly and correctly reposes on the principle of the separation of powers.</P>
    <P>It is possible that in the course of their deliberations, with or without the provisions of the Bill, committees may come across matters which should properly be the subject of judicial attention. If that is the case then the judicial function should be handed over to the proper authorities, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the courts.  If any Members have it as part of their ambition for committees, to turn them into courts then they are absolutely wrong and we should be very careful about doing that.</P>
    <P>We have to resist the temptation to broaden the activities of committees beyond the proper functions of this House and we should rein in our natural inclinations.  I can understand those inclinations and would love to extend the powers of compellability to compel Mr. William Binchy to come in here and justify the stance he took in public on radio this morning when he said he approves of two highly objectionable posters which are downright lies, to the extent that they helped to raise an issue. What he was saying &mdash; this is a most extraordinary statement by a lawyer and a person so-called campaigning on the side of justice and equity &mdash; is that the <Col N="1215" /> end justifies the means and any lie is good enough in order to raise an issue. I would like to have powers to compel that person to come in and explain that in circumstances where he cannot wriggle and dodge out of the way he tried to wriggle out of that very damaging admission this morning but of course, we shall contain ourselves.  We will not be able to compel him but with God's help and all the rest, we will not have to do it after Friday because the issue will be put beyond doubt.</P>
    <P>It is very important that members of committees and those of us who have ambition for further developing the roles of committees should look very carefully at the terms of reference that would apply to any investigation or any inquiry that committees would make under this Bill.  We should look back on recent history and learn lessons from it. A great many people profess themselves to be disappointed by the findings of the beef tribunal which sat for years with the expenditure of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.  Nowhere in the findings of the tribunal did it appear to be possible to attach criminal blame to persons many would have blamed for certain things.  I was not all surprised.  I invite Members to look again at the terms of reference of the tribunal which were proposed by a previous Taoiseach, who is now outside the political sphere. It was standing out a mile for anybody who cared to examine the terms of reference closely that they were written in such a way that it would be impossible for the tribunal to arrive at the kind of conclusions which people in this House suspected might be justified.  I do not think that was an accident.  The terms of reference were designed with that end in mind and the House, the media and the general public bought them hook, line and sinker without having looked at them with sufficient care and attention. It is essential when committees are undertaking the kinds of examination allowed for in this Bill, that they should be very careful to ensure that the terms of reference are drafted properly.  From <Col N="1216" /> my experience of membership of committees but not, I am happy to say, from my experience of the committee I chair in most cases where there are arguments in a committee as to whether a matter can be properly dealt with by the committee the arguments arise from the fact that members of the committee have not read the terms of reference.  We could save ourselves some time if we all read the terms of reference and if we find something wrong with them we should have the argument about it here in the Chamber when it comes to modifying the terms of reference of committees.  I think the Minister for Finance had something like this in mind when he said in his Second Stage speech:</P>
    <P>This Bill gives committees strong coercive powers, backed up by serious penalties &mdash; but there is a price to be paid for using them.  That price is the sacrifice of the free ranging, often spontaneous and sometimes idiosyncratic questioning to which Deputies often productively resort. That price may even be the replacement of the traditional chairpersons of committees by new chairpersons more disposed to restrict members to pre-ordained lines of inquiry.</P>
    <P>I can understand what the Minister was getting at but to speak of the free ranging often spontaneous and sometimes idiosyncratic questioning to which Deputies often productively resort, seems to me to be a gross excess of charity on the part of the Minister.  To characterise what Deputy Callely said a few minutes ago as free ranging and spontaneous is gilding the lily more than a little.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder what the Minister really meant when he said that.  I think he meant something he said on another date when he said forensic care will be needed in using the powers in this committee.  That is a much more accurate representation of what the <Col N="1217" /> Minister set out to say.  I wonder what he meant when he said the price to be paid for those powers may even be the replacement of the traditional chairperson of committees by new chairpersons more disposed to restrict members to pre-ordained lines of inquiry.  I know that the acting chairperson would be very disposed to restricting Members to pre-ordained lines of inquiry and I thank you for the little liberty I have been allowed so far.  Does the Minister actually mean that chairpersons will have to take a more &ldquo;forensic&rdquo; approach to the way they deal with the members of their committees.  I am not sure if that is what he means but I hope he does not mean that we will see a wholesale purge of the old fashioned traditional chairpersons and a whole bunch of new sharp toothed people coming in, who are more disposed to restrict Members to pre-ordained lines of inquiry.  I think what the Minister was saying is that committees will have to use these powers in a focused way because the powers are there for very clear and focused reasons.</P>
      <P>The Minister also showed another line of thought that we could dwell on. Later on in his speech he said:</P>
      <P>I expect that the strengthened role of the committees involved will restrict the need for future tribunals. Evasiveness in answering parliamentary questions becomes a less attractive option when the possibility exists of frustrated Deputies or their colleagues looking behind the answer to the documentary and other information on which it was based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am tired of frustrated Deputies on the bench opposite giving vent to their complaints about how their questions are not being answered.  They were happy enough to sit on this side of the House in previous times and listen to questions not being answered.  They should be reminded from time to time of the need for a certain amount of forensic skill and care &mdash; as the Minister for Finance describes it &mdash; in framing their questions.  I sat in this House a number of <Col N="1218" /> weeks ago and I saw Deputy Harney getting apopletic with righteous indignation.  She asked the Taoiseach a question, to which he answered &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  That was a perfectly reasonable answer to the question but she wanted more than &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  The science and art of framing parliamentary questions has been lost and most of the annoyance on the opposite side of the House has more to do with that than with any unpreparedness of the Government to answer questions.  The same thing could happen in committees.  I hope that when the committees start using the powers given here, the discipline will be applied to the use of the power.  It is only if we use the powers in their proper way that we will get full value from them.</P>
    <P>I have a question about the inclusiveness of the list of committees to which the Minister for Finance referred in his first statement on the publication of the Bill.  He listed the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I have the honour to be the chairman and the Joint Committee on European Affairs. In his speech introducing the Second Stage he omitted both of those committees.  I have been told one of the possible reasons for that omission is that those committees while they have powers to send for persons, may have information denied them on the grounds that the supply of the information would create difficulties in the State's relations with other countries.  That matter should be clarified.  Those two committees should be given the powers provided for in the Bill.  I ask the Minister of State to introduce an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage to deal with that matter.</P>
    <P>I am pleased at the way section 3 is drafted.  It clearly states that the Bill respects the constitutional separation of powers that has served us well.  If committees are tempted to take on additional powers, there will be noisy and sometimes venomous scenes in the House because they will be totally unjustified in doing so.  As I stated earlier, it would be improper to try to <Col N="1219" /> constitute the House into an alternative court.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should have patience.  I am pleased the Minister proposes to introduce a committee of investigation in the near future.  However, Members opposite should bear in mind that whether it is introduced under this Bill or a Bill providing for such a committee, we will run into unnecessary and unproductive trouble if we try to constitute this House into a court.  That would be unjust and undemocratic.</P>
      <P>Section 4, which provides that a committee may not direct a person to give evidence or produce or send a document which is not relevant to the committee's terms of reference, is contentious.  While it is a sensible provision, it will be the subject of many arguments on Committee Stage, some of which will be brought to the House and others to the committee on Procedure and Privileges.  It is important that we avoid that.</P>
      <P>Section 5 sets out the areas that are outside the scope of compellability in all circumstances, including matters respecting the security of the State.  Will the Minister of State define those matters?  If the section remains as drafted there will be a temptation to define &ldquo;matters&rdquo; as those that are not crucial to the security of the State.  Other provisions deal adequately with information used in the pursuit of crime investigations and so on.  I want a transparent definition of those matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides that &ldquo;the source of any information contained in a statement by a Member of the Oireachtas made in the Oireachtas or at a meeting <Col N="1220" /> of an Oireachtas committee&rdquo; is also outside the scope of compellability.  It is as broad as it is long, a two edged sword. Members of the Oireachtas who invoke that provision will be sniped at in the newspapers for refusing to divulge sources and for being coy about the meaning of information.  They will be sniped at in all righteousness and solemnity by people who invoke this right every day.</P>
    <P>Section 6 will also be contentious.  It includes a reference, for example, to information, the disclosure of which might be prejudicial to the State in its international relations.  I am sure all Members would agree that must be carefully defined.  Will the Minister of State explain section 9 which provides that where a direction is given by a committee to a person in his or her capacity as an employee, that person's employer may decide to send another person to the committee.  Why is that provision so broad?  With those qualifications and admonitions, I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution on the Bill.  I am sure no Member is in a better position than I to make a contribution on this matter, particularly having regard to the events of last year, the inquiry into the fall of a Government and the contributions and unsubstantiated allegations made about events at that time.  I am sure all Members looked forward to the introduction of this Bill and, while I welcome it in principle, I am disappointed at its failure to address issues of major concern to the public. There was a great deal of talk last year about transparency and openness, but we all know what has happened in that regard since the change of Government. One has only to reflect on the ongoing saga about a certain Minister and the efforts to get information that is not forthcoming.  Legitimate attempts from this side of the House to get information have fallen on deaf ears.  The transparency and openness about which we heard a great deal have not been <Col N="1221" /> brought about.  The goalposts have been moved and the public know that.</P>
      <P>Last week the Attorney General appeared before a meeting of the Select Committee on Finance and General Affairs.  I frequently corresponded with him last year to get information about certain matters.  At that time a witness appeared before the committee who, because of constraints, could not give certain information.  The Attorney General's advice was sought on the matter. Following further communication with him, information was made available which all Members believed would have helped the committee to get vital information while not affecting the restrictions on the Attorney General.  We subsequently learned he acted in a professional capacity for the witness who appeared before the committee. When he appeared before the committee last week I asked him what action his office is taking to ensure there is not a conflict of interest in the future, but I did not get a satisfactory reply.  The chairman had decided the committee's agenda one hour prior to the meeting and I was informed that because the matter was dealt with last year and was not on the agenda it could not be discussed.  That is the transparency and openness we are witnessing.  We looked forward to the Attorney General appearing before the committee to clarify matters but questions fell on deaf ears.  I am disappointed that in drafting the legislation the Minister did not provide for transparency and openness in all matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my public statements on the divorce referendum, I have made it clear that our civil law should no longer refuse any possibility of remarriage to those whose beliefs permit it.  The Irish Constitution places a heavy burden of responsibility on its citizens.  In the case of the forthcoming referendum in particular, it requires them to balance their opinions and feelings against those of others and to take special account of the views of minorities.  These considerations are important in the context of relationships on this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach share the view of Archdeacon Linney of the Church of Ireland who said that if the divorce referendum was beaten, it would undermine the position of moderate opinion in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Moderate opinion both here and in Northern Ireland is seeking a structure of Government and a constitutional expression which respects the rights of minorities and minority viewpoints.  Successive Irish Governments have been seeking a new constitutional dispensation which respects the minority view and allegiance in Northern Ireland.  If we are to make that case with conviction on behalf of the people of this State, we must show that when it comes to a difficult decision like this, the people of this State are willing to show the same respect for the conscientiously held views of minorities that we would wish a majority in Northern Ireland to show to the conscientiously held views of a minority there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach further agree that a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote in Friday's referendum will be music to the ears of people like the Rev. Ian Paisley and extreme Unionists who follow the &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; strategy, who do not wish <Col N="1223" /> to adhere to the principle that minorities have rights in any civil society and continue to maintain the majoritarianism approach which they have always demonstrated in Northern Ireland?  Is the Taoiseach concerned that a &ldquo;No&rdquo; vote on Friday will be seen by them as something to celebrate because they will feel they will not have to adhere to minority rights in their jurisdiction if they are not given here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would prefer not to become involved in a discussion on the views on any individual personalities in Northern Ireland politics.  The views I expressed about us showing respect for the rights of minorities is sufficient in itself as an argument for a &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote.</P>
      <P>Our concern, as a people, for the rights of minorities is not confined to concern about Northern Ireland. Ireland seeks throughout the world to show respect for minorities, which is why we have earned a reputation as a peace keeping people.  It is equally important we recognise that Irish people, in their daily dealings and in the way in which they relate to others show tolerance, respect for minorities and respect for difference in our social interactions.  That is part of who we are and our Constitution should reflect that and not something different.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This society must determine the right to remarry issue for itself.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the rights of minorities is a key issue and there is a growing consensus that the spirit of majoritarianism in both parts of Ireland has had an unfortunate effect for all on this island over the decades? Does he also agree that the decision taken on Friday will indicate whether we are prepared to take seriously the rights of the many minorities in this State?  We cannot dodge that question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I heartily agree with Deputy Ahern.  If we are looking for reconcialiation in all areas of life, majoritarianism and the simple application of <Col N="1224" /> a rule for all does not work.  It does not promote reconciliation, does not respect the dignity of each individual and does not adequately regard the fact that responsible citizens are able to make important decisions for themselves in their interests and that of their children without having a rigid law laid down in the Constitution which must apply with all the sanctions of the State behind it in every conceivable situation.</P>

      <P>The Catholic hierarchy said at the New Ireland Forum that it would raise its voice to resist any constitutional proposals which might infringe and imperil the civil and religious rights and liberties cherished by Northern protestants.  Given that statement, is the Taoiseach surprised at the stance it has taken in this debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly defend the right and obligation of each and every church to comment on public affairs.  It is important that the view of the Catholic Church, and other churches, should be heard on public matters.  It is also important to recognise that there is a distinction between the role of a church and the role of the State.  A church is a voluntary association.  People are free to be part of it and follow its teaching or not.  The State is a compulsory association and people have no choice but to follow the rules laid down by it.  Therefore, the criteria used in deciding whether something should be church law should be different from those used in deciding whether something should be State law.  In the case of church law, people have the freedom to be part of the church or not.  In the case of State law, people have no choice but to abide by the law or leave the State.  You cannot transpose the teaching of any church into State law.  There is a clear distinction between the function and role of the two institutions.  Though equally important they are different.</P>

      <P>The UN and EU systems of national accounts define a number of indicators for measuring the performance of a country's economy but there is no generally recognised single measure of national living standards or economic well-being.  The three most widely used indicators are:</P>
      <P>(1)&nbsp; Gross domestic product (GDP) which measures the income generated from productive activity in this country irrespective of whether producer units are Irish or foreign owned;</P>
      <P>(2)&nbsp; Gross national product (GNP) which measures the income from productive activity which actually accrues to Irish residents; GNP is calculated by deducting from GDP the income made in Ireland that is paid to foreign investors and adding income made by Irish residents on their overseas investments;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> (3)&nbsp; National disposable income which is defined as GNP plus net current transfers from overseas including, in particular, EU current transfers.</P>
    <P>All three measures can also be calculated on a net basis to exclude depreciation.</P>
    <P>GNP, rather than GDP, is a more appropriate measure of the economic well-being of this country because it excludes the repatriated profits of foreign owned companies and other net factor income outflows including national debt interest.  However, national disposable income is a more comprehensive indicator of the income available to the nation because of the substantial amounts of transfers received from the EU.</P>

      <P>The reason I am anxious to ensure we use the most accurate measure of Irish living standards is that in eight months the EU will look at all the beneficiaries, particularly the cohesion countries &mdash; Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland &mdash; in their review of Structural Funds.  That will determine what will happen in 1999.  It is fine for the Minister to say there is no accurate statistical basis to use but we must be able to stand over whatever case we put forward for 1995 figures.

      <P>It is generally accepted that if the 75 per cent rule applies we will have to examine the position seriously.  Irish GDP per head is now approximately 81 per cent of the Community average which is way above qualification limits.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 33 together.</P>
      <P>Since coming into office I have on a number of occasions set out a clear and consistent mandate for CIE which has three main strands: a clear vision for the future strategic development of the company; a definite medium term investment framework; and a plan to transform the company's financial relationship with the State.</P>
      <P>I have specific strategic objectives for the future development of CIE: it must provide effective and high quality public transport services; it must give full value for money to both the taxpayer and the public transport user; it must develop a new industrial relations culture based on partnership and co-operation and it must be more competitive, customer driven and meet the real needs of users.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to a £600 million public transport investment programme over the six years 1994 to 1999.  The strategic framework for that investment is set out in the Operational Programme for Transport, agreed with the European Commission.  About £275 million is being spent on the renewal of the mainline rail network and upgrading the locomotive fleet.  The strategy recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative provides the policy framework for an investment of over £300 million in light rail, quality bus corridors and other public transport improvements in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final part of my strategy is the creation of a new and sound financial relationship between the State and CIE. The company currently receives a £100 million Exchequer subvention each year.  I plan to negotiate a series of public service contracts with CIE.  They will cover a five year period, beginning with the 1997 financial year.  These contracts <Col N="1229" /> will spell out clearly what services CIE will provide and what the State will pay to support socially necessary non-commercial services.  CIE's contractual obligations will be defined in terms of both the quantity and quality of service to be provided and taxpayers will see how taxes are being used.</P>
    <P>The Government is very concerned about the position in CIE.  Although it appreciates the work which the individual members of the board have undertaken on behalf of CIE and do not intend to reflect on the integrity, ability of reputation of any individual members, the Government has decided that it no longer has confidence in the board and has resolved to restructure it in the public interest.</P>
    <P>Consequently, the Government, in the public interest, has invited the members of the board, other than the worker directors, to tender their resignations by midday on Monday, 27 November.  The Government proposes as part of the restructuring, to appoint two CIE executives and a senior civil servant to the board of CIE.  This is fully in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Commercial State Companies which I established earlier this year.</P>

      <P>Why is the Minister proposing to sack some but not all members of the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have already outlined, the Government deems that restructuring of the board is necessary. Members of the board other than those elected under the Workers Participation Act have been asked to resign.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Minister that he appoints all the directors of the board and I note that he proposes to ask some members but not others to resign. On 19 October the entire board unanimously stood over the Horgan's Quay site sale, yet the Minister subsequently described the sale as a shameful deal.  Is it not unusual that he should select some members of the board but not others for dismissal?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>My priority question deals with policy and the board of CIE. This matter is central to the board of CIE.  Given that the entire board stood over the sale of the Horgan's Quay site and the Minister subsequently called the sale shameful, why does he propose to dismiss only part of the board?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>And that of the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this is a Government decision.  I want to make it clear that the restructuring of the CIE board is necessary to implement the mandate which I outlined.  Major challenges face the CIE group.  It is commencing the largest public transport investment programme in the history of the State, totalling £600 million.  CIE is the major player in the transport sector of the economy.  It carries almost 300 million passengers per year, employs 11,000 and has a turnover of £400 million per annum.  CIE receives a State subvention of £100 million annually.  European Union legislation requires a move towards a more commercial approach to public transport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor which must be taken into account is the refusal of the board <Col N="1231" /> to reconstitute the property subcommittee.  The Deputy mentioned Horgan's Quay.  I would like to state&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Minister convey that request to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that it has been discussed at board level and at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  I gave all the necessary responses to questions in regard to that.  Last week Deputy Brennan and some of his colleagues incorrectly tried to infer that the decision of the outgoing chairperson to resign was because of Horgan's Quay. However, he emphatically stated that it had nothing to do with his decision to resign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It was because of the hassle the Minister created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government must have confidence that the structural weaknesses in the CIE group relating to management, financial planning, sound industrial relations and service to customers are being addressed and that necessary changes are being implemented.  The board of CIE must be restructured to face the challenges of the largest public transport investment programme in the history of the State, a changed commercial and competitive environment, a new industrial relations culture based on partnership and co-operation and a sound financial relationship with the State.  These considerations are the sole basis for the removal of board members under the 1950 Act.  No other basis is being advanced.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that selecting some members of the board for dismissal but not others <Col N="1232" /> sets a significant precedent?  How does he expect future directors to feel comfortable with an incoming Government in that they may be politically selected for dismissal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the decision of Government to govern.  This decision has been taken in the long-term interest of CIE and its employees.  I am aware that two directors have acceded to the request of Government to resign.  I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the individuals who have honourably acceded to the Government's request to tender their resignations.  It cannot have been an easy decision and it is appropriate that I acknowledge the public spiritedness of the individuals in question in agreeing to the Government's request made in the interest of the public good. It must be said that persons appointed to State boards work largely as a matter of public service for modest remuneration and I acknowledge that these individuals served in that tradition.  Their willingness to step aside is a tribute to their sense of public service which the Government and I acknowledge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The chief executive has come from the Civil Service and the Minister told us today that he proposes to appoint two CIE executives to the board and somebody else from the Department.  Do either of the two executives come from the Department? If they do, there could be up to four civil servants appointed to the board, including the chief executive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This would tighten the Minister's and his Department's grip on CIE.  It is clear the Minister is firing these people because they do not agree with him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that <Col N="1233" /> the Deputy should avail of this opportunity to cast aspersions on the integrity and ability of civil servants.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The chief executive, like many others, answered a public request when people were invited to make an application for the vacant position.  He came through the due process, was appointed to this position and has been doing an exceptionally good job.  The decision of the Government in respect of individuals who will be appointed to serve on the board will be made shortly. I do not know any private sector company which runs its business by excluding executives from the decision-making process at board level.  I want to ensure that this does not happen again and that the views of those who run the affairs of CIE on a daily basis are represented when decisions and policies are made where it matters most &mdash; at board level.</P>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 18, 26 and 36 together.  I am glad to be able to inform Deputies that ESB management and unions, following the personal intervention of Mr. Peter Cassells, have succeeded in reaching agreement on the bulk of the outstanding issues, including new work practices, revised grading structures, flexibilities and questions of reward. Unions and management, along with officials from my Department, will now meet to draft the text of the overall tripartite CCR Agreement.  The outcome, in so far as it affects ESB staff, will be put to ballot by the unions in due course.</P>
      <P>The agreement provides for 2,000 redundancies in the ESB and for changes in work practices to reflect best practice in the electricity industry worldwide.  The annual savings expected to arise from this level of re-structuring is estimated by the ESB to be of the order of £80 million.</P>
      <P>The voluntary severance scheme for staff who elect to leave the ESB was approved by the Government in May last.  The terms on offer, while specific to the ESB, are roughly in line with those on offer in other State bodies, including Aer Lingus and Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the opportunity to commend management and unions in the ESB for the effort put into achieving this historic agreement, which is essential if the ESB is to face the competitive challenges which lie ahead.  As the House knows I <Col N="1235" /> was anxious at all stages that my Department facilitate a partnerships approach to addressing necessary change.  The emergence of this agreement has confirmed the wisdom of a consensus approach, even though there were times when success seemed to be in doubt.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true the Government plans to sanction in the next few weeks an ESB price increase of more than five times the rate of inflation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a distinct and separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter to be considered by the Government.  I have not yet received a formal request for a price increase although I anticipate I will shortly.  While the level of savings that will emerge as a result of the CCR process is estimated in the region of £80 million per annum, the company faces significant additional costs.  Significant investment in our electricity network is essential to improve the quality and reliability of supply, particularly in rural areas.  The Government is committed to providing a high quality electricity service throughout Ireland to promote industrial competitiveness and provide a high standard of living.  I am conscious that consumers will want to ensure that if there is to be a price increase it will be the lowest possible.</P>
      <P>The steering committee which is meeting at present will put together a formal document which will be presented to Government.  As soon as the financial implications are assessed, particularly the savings involved in the restructuring plan, we will be in a position to carry out in an informed way an evaluation of the requirement for a price increase.  I am not in a position to state if and when a price increase should be granted but it is the subject of discussion at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the <Col N="1236" /> Minister will consider an application of about 10 per cent, which would amount to the highest increase in electricity charges in the history of the ESB.  What is the Government's reaction to that? The Minister said he received no application, but I understand he received one some time ago for 5 per cent.  How many jobs does the Minister envisage will be lost from the ESB as a result of reorganisation of the company?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny the suggestion that I am considering or will consider an application for a price increase of 10 per cent.  Deputy Brennan is scare-mongering.  He knows that no Minister would consider a price increase of such enormity.  I have clearly spelled out the Government's position on a price increase.  When a formal request is made it will be assessed.  Such assessment will be conducted in light of the savings that have been made and the necessary investment required by the ESB.  I do not envisage an increase of the magnitude suggested.  Any application made will receive careful consideration by my Department.  I will then bring the necessary proposals to Government and a decision will be communicated to the consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In respect of the jobs issue, I have not yet received a formal presentation on the outcome of the CCR process.  The CCR embodies the type of response identified in the Culliton and Moriarty reports which focuses on the importance of minimising costs within the company to support industrial growth and job creation.  Cost savings in energy utilities such as the ESB should generate increased employment in other sectors. For example, firms in the tradable sector will take advantage of improved competitiveness to increase output and employment, and the consequent growth in GNP will eventually benefit consumers as a whole.  One of the outcomes of the CCR process is a reduction in the jobs complement in the ESB. That is a very sensitive issue and complex questions have been addressed in that regard.  Agreements have been <Col N="1237" /> made and I look forward to receiving a formal presentation at the conclusion of the CCR process.  The outcome of the deliberations of the steering committee, which is in session at present, will be presented formally to me.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5, 10, 13, 25, 29, 30, 35, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 84, 85, 86, 87 and 88 together.</P>
      <P>I am pleased that Deputies have put down questions on the GSM competition because it gives me an opportunity to detail what I believe was a landmark competition in terms of the process, its objectivity, its fairness and the speed with which it was carried out.</P>
      <P>When I announced the competition for this second GSM licence last March, I was determined to put in place a selection process that, like the process for telecom's strategic partner, would be fair, impartial and objective.  This was done.  Clear selection criteria were set, published to the interested parties, and rigidly adhered to.  International consultants with specialist experience were engaged to advise.  An evaluation team, led by my Department was set up and included the consultants and officials from my Department and the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of the competition were specifically approved by the EU Commission.  The selection criteria included demonstrated financial and technical capability; the credibility of the proposers' business plan and their approach to market development; their pricing <Col N="1241" /> policy, which had to be competitive; their timetable for achieving roll-out.</P>
    <P>The contenders were each required to supply an immense amount of detailed information in regard to financial, technical and business development matters. All this material was examined exhaustively by the evaluation team, which worked intensively over a period of more than two months after the closing date.  The consultants, and subsequently the full project team, came unanimously to a single result.  I am very pleased with the way the process worked and am completely satisfied with its integrity.</P>
    <P>No political or other considerations whatever entered into the selection, which was made totally on the basis of the objective criteria laid down in advance and made known to all.  This exhaustive and patently fair process can now serve as a model for future decisions of a similar kind in other areas.  It is an example of the standard of decision making that I wish to see become the norm across the spectrum of Irish public life.</P>
    <P>The import of Deputy Kenneally's question is that I should have awarded the licence by reference to factors other than the selection criteria which were announced in advance and known to the applicants.  I reject the import of that question.  It was not open to me to follow such a course and I would have exposed myself and the Government to legal redress if I had done so.  ESAT Digifone won because the project team determined, after meticulous comparative evaluation, that they had submitted the best application.</P>
    <P>The decision to grant the licence and to whom is statutorily that of the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  In view of the importance of this decision I, and the Minister for Finance, discussed the result of the competition with the leaders of the parties in Government on 25 October.  The matter was put before the full Cabinet for noting on the following morning.  In a case as sensitive as this there is a great advantage in announcing the result as soon as possible thereby putting an end <Col N="1242" /> to speculation and media hype which grows around such matters, as was the case on this occasion.  The formal decision makes it clear that the licence will be awarded to ESAT Digifone subject to satisfactory conclusion of discussion leading to a licence which incorporates as binding commitments the relevant contents of the application which led to its selection.</P>
    <P>The Government agreed the detailed selection criteria and their order of priority in advance of the opening of the competition and agreed to the appointment of consultants to carry out the evaluation.  It was clear to me, and to the Minister for Finance who was represented in the project team throughout the competition, that the thoroughness of the approach taken left no room for doubt as to the clear-cut result contained in the consultants' report.  Bearing in mind the foregoing, the Government had no difficulty in agreeing to my recommendations in relation to the result.</P>
    <P>There was no undue haste.  In fact a flowchart diagram prepared by the consultants on 14 July in the context of the relaunch of the competition following consultations with the European Commission shows clearly that the final report was to be submitted in the week beginning 22 October.  The consultants are to be congratulated on achieving this target.  My commitment was to announce the result not later than the end of November.  If I had not allowed some interval in case of slippage I would have been open to criticism for not meeting my deadline.</P>
    <P>At an early stage in the competition four out of the six applicants requested and all were given assurances that the information in their bids would be kept confidential on a permanent basis.  It would be impossible to have detailed disclosure of the comparative analysis without breaching this confidentiality. This dilemma is one of the reasons reputable independent consultants are engaged in competitions of this type. The consultants act as guarantors of objectivity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> The question of detailed feedback to applicants as to the reasons one applicant was successful and the others were not therefore presents me with a difficulty.  Furthermore, disclosure by me at this time of significant elements of the winning application which would arise in any comparative feedback on public discussion of the outcome could be of considerable competitive advantage to the existing operator, Eircell.  I would like to be as helpful as possible to understandably disappointed applicants but the constraints on me are severe. The involvement of reputable consultants was intended to be a guarantee of fair play at the outset and the clear-cut result from them was the one which I announced.</P>
    <P>Deputy Gallagher refers in his question to &ldquo;the seriousness of the situation&rdquo; in reference to non-EU ownership of Telenor.  Five of the six applications had significant participants which were not of EU origin but the origin of any of the participants had no place in the selection criteria.  It was a competition open to all.</P>

However, the Minister is also aware that since he announced the awarding of the second mobile telephone licence concern has been expressed about certain aspects of the selection procedure and the awarding of the contract.  My question asked if the Minister had an obligation to disclose the reason one tender was successful over and above the others.  This could have been done in a way which would not have required the disclosure of confidential information.  Does the Minister accept that a Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have an obligation, responsibility and duty to adhere to the criteria which were established at the start of the competition and published and furnished to all interested applicants.  At the preliminary stage of the competition four prospective applicants &mdash; it is important that this is understood &mdash; sought assurances about confidentiality.  No doubt they saw this as being essential should they win the licence. The priority at that stage was to maximise participation in the contest and it would have been foolhardy not to respond to such widespread feeling.  The people now seeking disclosure were among those seeking confidentiality guarantees six months ago.</P>
      <P>There has been concern about this matter and Deputies have been in contact with me about it.  I contacted the consultants who advised my Department and the Government on this issue and the following was their response.</P>
      <P>In pursuance to your inquiry regarding the extent to which other European ministries have published the evaluation reports, we can give you the following information:</P>
      <P>We [the consultants, Andersen Management International] have followed the GSM evaluation process in</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1245" /> Denmark, Holland, Germany, Norway, Spain, Italy, Sweden and France.</P>

      <P>Not Belgium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The letter continues.</P>
      <P>We only know of one country, France, which has published parts of the evaluation documents.  In the case of France two aspects should be mentioned: firstly, the ministerial evaluation report was modified for the public audience before it was released, secondly, prior consent was given by the bidders.  To our knowledge, the evaluation reports used in the above mentioned countries &mdash; except for France &mdash; were kept secret in order to protect the bidders, who have provided the Government with information under the belief that it would be treated confidentially.</P>
      <P>The information included in the applications for the Irish GSM2 licence is also marked confidential, and it cannot be disclosed in any form to the public, without breaching the expressed non-disclosure agreement. This would probably lead to a court case initiated by one of the losing applicants.</P>
      <P>We therefore strongly recommend you to reconsider the question and the eventual consequences of an immediate publication.</P>

      <P>The Minister was asked specific questions which he has not addressed.  I refer him particularly to Question No. 42 which he included in his response but did not answer.  Will the Minister indicate the role played by his Department and the Government in agreeing with the European Union that a vital national asset such as this licence would be capped at £15 million when applicants competing for the licence believed it could be worth up to £100 <Col N="1246" /> million?  Will he outline why agreement was reached on the cap?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy read the Official Report, he would note that Deputy Brennan chided me about this matter on a regular basis.  He said I should not allow it to go to public auction and that it should be capped in the interests of bringing competition into the sector.  There is a change of heart on part of Deputies opposite.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding the licence fee, when the competition was launched it included an auction element as the fourth selection criteria in descending order of priority, ranking below the tariff deal for customers and other important criteria.  It is public knowledge that the European Union Commission raised legal arguments against this aspect and after taking the advice of the Attorney General's office my Department entered discussions with the Commission which led to modification of the rules of the competition.  A cap of £15 million was put on the licence fee in the context that Eircell would also pay £10 million.  That led to the approval in advance of the selection process by the Commission.  It is speculative at this stage whether the Commission would have accepted a higher figure than £15 million, but it is clear that there would have to be a commensurate increase in the demand from Eircell.  In the long run consumers should not be asked to pay a higher fee.  I am satisfied we have struck the correct balance and that we will get what we are looking for, a high quality reliable and efficient service to compete with Eircell, that will bring competition into the sector which will in turn benefit the consumer by way of lower charges for handset equipment and lower tariff charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 85 in my name requests information regarding compliance with article 3 of the bid document which states that applicants must give full ownership details for proposed licensee.  I asked if that had been complied with in awarding the licence and if the Minister would indicate the identity and ultimate beneficial ownership of the institution investors who will own 20 per cent of the successful bidding company.  Were they known to the Minister when he made the decision bearing in mind that recent newspaper articles refer to the fact that a finance company in Dublin has been appointed to place 20 per cent of the consortium shares with institutions and other investors?  If the investors were not identified, was article 3 complied with?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>All aspects of the established criteria were scrupulously adhered to and monitored closely by my Department, the consultants and the project team.  None of the six who submitted applications to the Department was rejected because of the absence of technical and financial ability to deliver the service.  Examination of those aspects was an integral part of the evaluation process.  Paragraph 3 of the bid document to which the Deputy referred relates to full disclosure of ownership. That was adequately dealt with in the evaluation of all applications including the successful one.  The majority of the applications contained indications of probable changes in the ownership of minority interests by way of flotation, institutional investment, after licence award and the level of such proposed changes considered acceptable.  The intentions of the willing applicant in this regard were fully disclosed.</P>

      <P>A number of the investors stated that minority shareholdings would be available through various mechanisms such as by way of flotation or institutional investment.  The winning applicant clearly stated that ESAT would have a 40 per cent ownership, Tellenor a 40 per cent ownership and the other 20 per cent would be available to institutional investors or other interest groups.  That was clearly stated publicly as well as privately.</P>

      <P>The Minister accepts that he has full responsibility for a large number of semi-State companies.  The report of the task force on semi-State companies states that those companies must maximise their potential to make an economic contribution to this country.  Given that a number of semi-State companies had pledged fixed assets as part of equity in respect of one of the applications ultimately rejected by the Minister, that represents a vote of no confidence by him in the semi-State companies for which he has political responsibility and which have a fundamental obligation to make an economic contribution to our country.</P>

One could say this was a case of sour grapes, but it goes beyond that.  A large number of major international companies were involved.  They went to the expense of submitting tenders.  One applicant spent £5 million on its application which, I understand, included £1 million from the ESB.  Where such an amount of money was invested by tenderers, surely the least to which they would be entitled in common law and justice, and in the interests of fair play, openness and accountability is that they should be told the reasons the tenders were unsuccessful.  The reasons they were unsuccessful should be made public.  I have a document&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The process included a confidentiality clause inserted at the request of the applicants.  Some who requested that clause are now seeking open disclosure regarding the outcome. That would be totally unfair to the winning applicant.  The process was carried out in a scrupulous way.  We have rigorously adhered to the criteria established, with which applications were satisfied at the outset.  I am aware that some people would like to have results published and I have gone out of my way to establish if that is feasible.  I have read today the response I received from Andersen Management International Consultants which are experts in this area and specialise in it.  They advised me not to publish the results because to do so would leave me open to legal challenge from other applicants and groups who participated in the process.  That is the position.  I would like to be in a position to publish the consultants' report but it is not practical or legally feasible.</P>

      <P>The Minister asks us to accept that everything was done above board and I accept that but I ask him to recall that similar assurances given by members of the Government were upended by the Supreme Court less than a week ago.  Will the Minister accept that his decision is open to judicial review?  If that is so, will he accept that under the law he is obliged to give the reasons for the decision to enable parties who may be interested in seeking a judicial review to decide whether they should seek such a review?  Will the Minister approach all the tenders and ask them to withdraw the confidentiality clause which they sought at the time the application was lodged to facilitate a statement being made with regard to how this decision was arrived at?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">

      <P>I have nothing to add to what I already stated.  The relevant section in the letter, which I have <Col N="1251" /> received from Andersen Management International, emphatically states that the information included in the applications for the Irish GSM 2 licence is marked &ldquo;confidential&rdquo;.  It cannot be disclosed in any form to the public without breaching the expressed non-disclosure agreement.  This would probably lead to a court case initiated by one of the losing applicants.</P>
      <P>In that context, I cannot accede to the request.  All applicants entered this competition in the full knowledge that the criteria were established, that it would be imposed in a strict manner and that there would be no deviation from it.  I am satisfied with the integrity of that process.  The manner in which this competition was held will stand up to any scrutiny, including legal scrutiny.</P>

      <P>This issue of confidentiality is a double-edged sword.  On the one hand, the Government is calling for openness.  It is clear that many people are concerned about the manner in which the licence was granted.  If a suggestion is being made that the successful applicants were the only people not to offer any benefits to this country other than the agreed EU cap of £15 million then, as Members, we are not in a position to check whether there is substance to such a claim.  That issue must be of concern to the Minister.  In line with what Deputy Molloy said, will the Minister ask the tenderers to withdraw the confidentiality clause so that we can have openness and transparency relative to all the matters put before his committee?</P>

      <P>In respect of the <Col N="1252" /> decision to grant the licence, is the Minister aware that the Tánaiste, the day before the licence was issued, met one of the competitors, informed him that the tender was above board and that it would receive his support?  He also informed the group that a decision would not be made for a further month. Yet, the following day the decision was made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am being asked the same question over and over and I cannot change the answer to suit the Deputy.  The reality is that I have received advice in respect of what I can publish.  I have even examined whether it is possible to publish some details of the report but I have been advised it is not because of the express wish of the applicants at the outset who wished to have a confidentiality clause imposed. Publication of the report would consist of detailed comparative analysis of the applicants.  Obviously, the applicants do not want that now or in the future.  Publication of part of the report which does not contain confidential information is not possible.</P>

In respect of the decision in regard to the GSM licence, the consultants made a clear recommendation.  The project team made an unanimous recommendation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that this debate is fuelled largely by the unsuccessful applicants for the licence and that these same applicants agreed in advance the criteria on which they made their tender and are now seeking retrospectively to change the ground rules? Will the Minister further agree that to unilaterally make sensitive information available &mdash; which the tenderers insisted on keeping confidential &mdash; would possibly expose the taxpayer to liability in subsequent court proceedings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I confirm that what the Deputy outlined is our approach to this matter which I clearly stated today. The Government, as stated, agreed the detailed rules of the competition and the selection criteria before it was launched.  As long as these rules were respected and the result was a single clear-cut recommendation, there was no <Col N="1254" /> room for any flexibility.  I assure the House that neither I, the officials of my Department nor any member of Government had any desire to massage the outcome or to change the result.  We appointed consultants.  We accepted the recommendation of professional experts in this area and implemented their recommendation by giving the second mobile licence to ESAT Telenor.</P>

      <P>Discussions are ongoing in respect of finalising the award of the licence to the successful applicant and I have no doubt that is part of the discussions.  I have not been involved at any stage in the discussions regarding this process.  No doubt that matter will be made public in due course but, I am not aware of its precise details at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister not confirmed, in reply to supplementary questions, that the successful tenderer did not comply with Article 3 which required him to give disclosure of full ownership details of the proposed licensee?  The Minister said they are not available and I accept that &mdash; I have no reason to suspect that anything wrong or improper was done &mdash; but I am asking for full disclosure, openness and accountability.  Is the Minister familiar with the granting of the second licence in another EU member state, Belgium, which gave full disclosure on the method of selection?  It was possible to do that without giving any confidential information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each of the applicants was assessed under three main headings: tariff, quality and franchise.  Various scoring points were awarded accordingly and the applicant with the highest number of points was awarded the tender.  That is <Col N="1255" /> what we are seeking and surely the Minister knows that under our system of administration of justice, there is the right to judicial review and that, in those circumstances, such judicial review would take precedence over confidentiality.  If this matter were to go to court, the confidentiality cloak, similar to the <i>sub judice</i> cloak which is often hidden behind here, would not protect the Minister from seeking to refuse disclosure as to how the decision was arrived at.  Will the Minister agree it would be more proper and correct to inform Parliament as to how he made this decision, the reason he made it and the various details&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The mandate for strategic alliance negotiations allows for the issue of up to 35 per cent of the company's equity to an alliance partner.</P>
      <P>The mandate also states that subject to certain conditions the shareholder is willing to consider setting aside up to 5 per cent of company share capital for an employee shareholding scheme.  Work on setting up this scheme is at a very preliminary stage and the final structure will have to be worked out in the overall context of the alliance and the adoption of a business strategy that will enable the company to thrive in a competitive environment.</P>
      <P>In relation to share ownership for subscribers, the strategic alliance mandate makes clear that Telecom Éireann will continue to remain in majority public ownership.  In that context the question of further dilution of the State's holding beyond the terms of the mandate is not envisaged.</P>

      <P>The Government agreed a mandate for the conduct of the negotiations after consultations with Telecom Éireann, the unions and all interest groups.  The mandate is the document outlining the procedure and the interest of the shareholders and Telecom Éireann in this alliance partnership.  I cannot be exhaustive at this initial stage about the key criteria under which the decision on a strategic partner will be based but in broad terms the general strategic fitness of a partner will be important, by that I mean the ability of a partner to bring marketing, technology and marketing skills to Telecom. <Col N="1258" /> Partners must also now show a long-term commitment and be in a position to maximise sustainable employment. Equity consideration, representing a fair price for a stake in the company, will also be a factor.</P>

The success of our telecommunications network establishes, to a large extent, our competitiveness as an economy. That is part of the process and our principal consideration.  Because of the level of interest already expressed by international operators in forming an alliance with Telecom Éireann.  I have no doubt that when this process is concluded, we will be in a position to move Telecom on to a more successful era and ensure it continues to make an important contribution to Ireland and its economy.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the proposed acquisitions by Statoil of Aran Energy plc. and Conoco Ireland Ltd.  I understand that the Minister for Enterprise and Employment is examining the acquisitions under the Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies (Control) Acts, 1978 and 1987 as amended by the Competition Act, 1991.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1260" /> In so far as the supply and distribution of petroleum products is concerned my prime concern is that the security of oil supplies is not adversely affected.  Deputies will be aware that Statoil is the largest producer of North Sea crude oil and is one of the largest net sellers of crude oil in the world. Since entering the Irish market through the acquisition of BP in 1992, it has demonstrated its intention to develop its Irish operations.  The proposed acquisition of Conoco Ireland Ltd is further evidence of its long-term commitment to Ireland and, as such, is to be welcomed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Statoil, a large multinational company, has taken over two wholesale oil companies.  Is the Minister worried this will seriously distort competition to the detriment of consumers? Since he is the custodian of strategic stocks on behalf of this nation, has he engaged in direct consultations with Statoil demanding a guarantee in the event of any international difficulty in the supply of oil to this country?</P>

      <P>Statoil will control 25 per cent of the retail trade if its present acquisition proposal is successful.  The company has indicated to me that it is committed to improving its pricing profile, ensuring it remains competitive and offering good value to its customers. There is no price control on petrol products and consumers should reap the benefit of a competitive market.  In terms of petrol prices there are significant differences between retailers, with discounts of up to 20p per gallon for the very same product available to the public at various pumps.</P>

        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly)</i> asked the Minister for Health the action, if any, he will take to help to remedy the very serious situation in the Midland Health Board area arising from the one day stoppage by nurses which has brought most services to a standstill in Portlaoise, Tullamore and Mullingar general hospitals and is seriously affecting patients and their families.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of the deployment of staff, within ceiling and budget, is a matter for the management of the respective health boards. Individual health boards are in the best position to determine how best to deploy their personnel, having due regard to the different priorities and service requirements throughout their area of responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Midland Health Board received approval for the recruitment of 63 additional staff in 1995, which posts <Col N="1262" /> related to specific service developments accorded priority within the board's area.  The number of nursing staff in the Midland Health Board increased by 4.5 per cent from the end of 1992 to the end of 1994, the latest date for which figures are available, in line with the increase in nursing staff across the whole of the health sector.</P>
    <P>The issue of strengthening staffing levels will have to be considered by the board within the general context of balancing all service developmental priorities with the total amount of available funding.  In the normal course, staffing levels for individual units within each hospital are adjusted regularly to take account of overall service demands.</P>
    <P>The Midland Health Board has agreed to assign a minimum of five additional nursing posts to acute hospitals in 1996 at a cost of £100,000 per annum.  It has also agreed to review its staffing levels, in the context of any developmental funding available in 1996, with a view to further increasing the number of nursing staff.  The board will also consider what further additions to nursing staff numbers might be required in subsequent years in the context of overall service demands and available resources.</P>
    <P>In such circumstances it is a matter of deep disappointment that the Irish Nurses Organisation has seen fit to take industrial action on the scale of their withdrawal today.  I should like to be associated with the expression of regret by the Midland Health Board for the inconvenience caused to patients and their families by the action taken.  I can assure Members the Midland Health Board has put arrangements in place to minimise the effects of this industrial action.  Out-patient clinics have been cancelled, as have all elective admissions, and nurses are manning an emergency service.  There has been no report of any breakdown in these arrangements and the hospitals are coping adequately.</P>

      <P>Nobody regrets the inconvenience caused more <Col N="1263" /> than members of the Irish Nurses Organisation who were forced to arrive at a decision to take industrial action today.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister of State say how many of the 63 additional posts within the Midland Health Board area to be filled this year have been allocated to general nurses in whose sphere this dispute has arisen?  Will he confirm that none of those 63 additional posts has been allocated to general nurses and state why nurses have not been allocated to acute hospitals within the Midland Health Board area since his Department was prepared to sanction those additional 63 administrative posts?</P>

      <P>The health board sets its priorities in regard to its services at any given time.  Posts in accordance with the list I have here are not ones that were accorded priority by the health board. Over the past couple of years priority has been given to ear, nose and throat and orthopaedic services within its area of responsibility.  Priority accorded to services is set by the health board itself. Following a ballot held in October, the board has offered to provide a minimum of five additional posts in the coming year.  I must emphasise that it is incumbent on all parties to avail of the industrial relations processes in their endeavours to resolve this problem and I appeal to them to take that route as a matter of urgency.</P>

        <i>(Laoghis-Offaly):</i> Does the Minister of State agree it is most unfortunate that the negotiations being conducted between nurses' representatives and the health board have not yet yielded agreement on this issue?

We regret the parties involved were unable to reach an agreement on the issue before today but I can assure Deputies that the good offices of my Department are available to the parties if it can be of constructive assistance to them.  I must stress, however, that the allocation of staff is a matter for the health board itself and that the resolution of this type of dispute must be pursued through the normal industrial relations processes.  It is incumbent on both parties to get together and resolve this difficulty in the interests of patients and their families. Today's disruption is something we do not want, and it is incumbent on all parties to see that it does not happen again.</P>

They have a well equipped unit, a lovely building and the expertise to run the unit.  All that is needed is the nursing staff.  Will the Minister intervene to try to restart negotiations because all there is between the two groups is five additional posts costing, at most, £100,000?  Will the Minister assure the House that this unit in Mullingar which will serve the midlands generally will be brought into use?</P>

      <P>In or out of office, we all clap ourselves on the back when <Col N="1265" /> there are fresh developments within the health services, particularly the opening of new clinics and the development of new technologies which lead to earlier diagnoses, cures etc.  This has happened in Mullingar with the neonatal facility. The Minister is merely stating what he has been told, but I have been informed that the fact that nurses have not been allocated for this particular speciality in Mullingar Hospital is a major part of the shortfall in question.  The Minister should check his facts.  I read an account of a Midland Health Board debate in one of the local papers which gave that issue high priority.  It is extraordinary, therefore, that we are talking about five extra posts over three major hospitals catering for a huge number of people with, over the last three or four years, very large developmental services augmenting the core services in those hospitals.  It is the old story; the area with the biggest muscle gets the personnel and those who do the work, in this case, the general nursing staff, do not get their due reward.  What they have put forward is the minimum.  They did not go all out and ask for 40 or 50 new posts.  They said their base line was 21 and what is being offered is five posts over three general hospitals.  It is a ridiculous offer and I would ask the Minister of State and his senior Minister to come up with something more realistic.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that Government Deputies are expressing regret at the situation.  Is the Minister aware that at a public meeting in July, attended by public representatives from the Government and Opposition, it was indicated by Government representatives that they had full confidence that the Minister would seek to rectify the situation and meet the legitimate demands of the INO representatives at the meeting, that a meeting was offered with the Minister, that such a meeting did take place in August as a result of which the INO representatives were informed that the additional posts would be made available in 1995 and in 1996, and that when they went back to the health board to discuss the detail of that they were told there could be no increase in staff until 1996?  Is the Minister aware that that is the understanding of the INO representatives who attended the meeting in the Department of Health?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the health board itself, the Minister suggests that this is all a matter for the health board.  Would the Minister agree that, through all the rationalisations of the 1980s, the Midland Health Board, including all its members from all political parties, has been the most responsible and co-operative health board in the country?  Would he agree also that, year after year, the Department of Health refused to give increased allocations based on requests made by the management of the health board for extra resources, particularly extra nursing staff?  Will the Minister agree also that the nursing levels in these three hospitals are way below the national average and that the offer being made by the INO to agree to an interim measure of ten posts is the minimum that any representative organisation could, in good faith, be asked to accept?  Rather than engaging in a typical departmental cover of suggesting that it is a matter for the health board, the Minister should fulfil the commitments given by public representatives on the Government benches.  Will the Minister agree that a fair and honest appraisal of the situation should mean <Col N="1267" /> that the five posts for 1995 should now be allocated as indicated at the meeting with the Department of Health?  Will he agree to find the funds for a much stretched health board which has been the most co-operative health board in years?</P>

Regarding the meeting the Minister had with the Irish Nurses' Organisation which took place at their conference in Drogheda in August 1995, he listened carefully to the comments made.

The Minister, his Department and the Midland Health Board have been informed about this problem.  Does the Minister not agree that these patients are entitled to a better service?  In regard to acute, accident and emergency services there has been an increase in output of 48 per cent. This has been achieved by the overstretched nursing staff, consultants, doctors and other personnel involved. My information is that at least five additional nurses are required in the Tullamore hospital alone.  Even though all the machinery for dealing with industrial disputes has been looked at, we have the regrettable situation where clinics have been closed down today.

      <P>Steps must be taken to upgrade the nursing levels on the wards to those comparable in other hospitals. The problem is clearly being caused by a lack of nurses to provide the services. Will the Minister consider utilising the machinery available in the Department of Enterprise and Employment to try to get the parties back to the negotiating table immediately so that they can solve the problem?  The kernel of the problem is that while the services have been expanded and the capital provision has been increased &mdash; these are very much <Col N="1272" /> welcomed &mdash; we have failed dismally to provide a similar increase in the number of staff to keep pace with these improvements.  I appeal to the Minister to utilise the machinery available to try to get both sides back to the negotiating table immediately.</P>

If he accepts that, will he assure the House that, before making a decision on the non-capital allocation for 1996, he will meet officials of the Midland Health Board with a view to remedying the problem and making available sufficient funds to bring up to the national average the patient-nurse ratio in that health board?</P>

Will he confirm that is the scale of the money being sought as an interim measure?  He stated on a number of occasions that this is a matter for the health board in the first instance.  At what stage does the Department believe it has primary responsibility?  This evening nurses are on picket lines in Tullamore, Portlaoise and Mullingar and clinic and in-patient facilities are not being attended to so that those nurses may highlight a problem on behalf of their patients.  The Department of Health must come off the fence at some stage instead of shoving the responsibility down the road to Tullamore.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. The Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies has been requesting the introduction of this legislation for many years.  In 1976 &mdash; the year the committee was established &mdash; the Oireachtas Privilege and Procedure Bill was introduced.  In its original form it dealt with compellability and privilege for witnesses but those provisions were removed during its passage through the Houses and we were left with a simple, <Col N="1317" /> short Bill which merely extended to committee members the privileges enjoyed by Members of the Dáil.  Since then we have been requesting that committees of the House such as the Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies, which was set up to do a particular job, shold be given the means to do it by legislation.  Members have referred to the delay in bringing this Bill before the House.  As you may recall a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, in 1981 you and I were members of the Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies.  The chairman at that time was the former Deputy Roche and he outlined on behalf of the committee the reasons for the introduction of this type of Bill that would give power to committees.  On that occasion he indicated that the Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies had no legal redress where a person refused to attend, in other words anyone requested to attend could thumb his nose at the committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also deleted on Committee Stage of the Committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas (Privilege and Procedure) Bill, 1976, were the subsections designed to compel witnesses to come in and the provision of penalties for those who did not.  The demand to increase the relevance of the committees has been ongoing since then.  I was an ordinary member and a vice-chairman before I became chairman and during that period we had many examples of witnesses refusing to attend or submit documents to the committee.  In 1984 the Department of Communications refused to submit its particulars about Irish Shipping's five year corporate plan.  Also in 1984 the then chairman of Irish Shipping refused to attend a meeting of the joint committee and in December 1984 the Departments of Finance and Communications informed the joint committee that it would not be appropriate for their officials to attend the meeting and give evidence during an inquiry into Irish Shipping.  In June 1985 officials of the Department of Energy did not attend a meeting of the joint <Col N="1318" /> committee during its examination of Bord Gáis Éireann.  In March 1989 the Irish National Petroleum Corporation refused to meet the committee with the usual <i>sub judice</i> ploy because of a very minor matter in this semi-State body. This is one of the semi-State bodies that should be investigated regularly by the Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies.</P>
    <P>In April 1989 members of the then board of Siúcre Éireann were invited individually to attend before the committee and they refused or were told not to attend.  In February 1991 An Post refused to discuss its viability plan and any matters connected with it.  This is not an exhaustive list and in all these instances the Joint Committee on Commercial State Sponsored Bodies was unable to take further action apart from voicing its disappointment at the negative response and how its credibility was being undermined by these refusals.  In fact the whole committee system had become a joke in the eyes of the general public and the media rarely covered its discussions at that time.  As a result the then committee decided to report to the Dáil on its Terms of Reference and resources as follows:</P>
    <P>In the context of recent developments, revelations in certain semi-State bodies it is clear that the Joint Committee as currently resourced and empowered is severely hampered from carrying out the incisive and persuasive examinations that are required.  While the Joint Committee believes that the mere fact of considerable resources will not of itself guarantee 100 per cent effectiveness nevertheless it can be argued convincingly that it is unreasonable and disingenuous to require the Joint Committee to act as an alert watch dog with only extremely limited resources. Consequently the Joint Committee recommends:</P>
    <P>(1)  that it be given power to compel witnesses to attend or produce documents and that penalties apply to non-compliance in accordance with <Col N="1319" /> the procedures to be determined by law;</P>
    <P>(2)  the question of the privilege of witnesses to be resolved by extending qualified privilege to witnesses before public meetings of the Joint Committee;</P>
    <P>(3)  a formal mechanism to be provided to facilitate debates on its report;</P>
    <P>(4)  adequate resources and</P>
    <P>(5)  the review of the <i>sub judice</i> practice be expedited as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>In the absence of appropriate powers, realistic resources and follow-up debate on the action of the report the existence and operation of the Joint Committee will be seen or perceived to be only a token exercise in public accountability rather than the genuine monitoring body it was intended to be.</P>
    <P>The then chairman of the committee, the former Deputy Roche, on behalf of all members of the committee presented this report to the House on 26 November 1991 and the matter was debated in the House in 1992.  The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, promised action on the various areas mentioned but I am sorry to say that although assurances were given no action was taken.  After the General Election of 1992 the matter was taken up on many occasions.  I am amazed the Opposition has accused the Government of foot dragging but I can show the House four letters which I wrote to the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bertie Ahern, between 1992 and 16 March 1994 to which I received the usual reply:</P>
    <P>I wish to acknowledge your further letter regarding compellability of witnesses to appear before the Oireachtas committees.  The matter is receiving attention and I will be in <Col N="1320" /> contact with you again as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>That happened on four occasions in those two years and nothing happened. I compliment the Minister on bringing forward this Bill and on implementing other measures.</P>
    <P>On 1 March of this year the order of reference of the Joint Committee was changed and widened.  The main recommendation is that appointees to high office in the State shall attend meetings of the joint committees as appropriate and subject to legal constraints in their office to discuss issues which are relevant to the matters comprehended by paragraph 1, which is to report on the accounts and operations of the commercial semi-state bodies.</P>
    <P>Order 11 states that Ministers and Ministers of State shall appear before the joint committee to discuss current policies relevant to the matters comprehended in paragraph (1) and the implementation of such policies in their Department.  A Minister or Minister of State may request the joint committee to convene to enable him or her to explain current policy proposals or to initiate debate thereon.</P>
    <P>This expanded our operation as regards Departments.  Two Ministers have come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies since those additional terms of reference were given.  The first Minister requested to attend the committee since it was set up in 1976 was the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, who dealt with the White Paper on broadcasting. The second was the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, who discussed the difficulties in CIE.  That meeting was well publicised but our terms of reference remained the same.  While the Minister's accusations of surveillance etc. were well known to committee members, it was not possible to investigate them further and they had to be <Col N="1321" /> ruled out of order.  However, the Minister was questioned.  The meeting was lively and well attended.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome because people who, under the present terms of reference may refuse to attend at or produce records before the committee will not be in a position to do so under this legislation.  The committee of which I am chairman initiated the pressure to have introduced this type of legislation.  The provisions of the various sections are set out in the explanatory memorandum as follows.  Section 2 &ldquo;provides that only those committees on which power to send for persons, papers and records is conferred by the Oireachtas shall be covered by the principal provisions of the Bill&rdquo;.  That is in line with the terms of reference of our committee.  Section 4 &ldquo;provides that a committee may not direct a person to give evidence or produce or send a document which is not relevant to the committee's terms of reference&rdquo;.  This is the way in which we have been interpreting those terms of reference over many years.  This Bill seems to contain the exact copies of those terms for which we have been asking for a long time.</P>
    <P>The many sections of this Bill will require close scrutiny by all Members, especially those who will deal with it on Committee Stage.  Any Member interested in this will have an opportunity to suggest improvements and seek explanations as to how it will work. It will have a great influence on the type of work committees can do and will be an improvement on what the position has been.</P>
    <P>The financing and staffing of committees, indeed the level of legal advice they will require, will need to be vastly increased.  My committee has lost an analyst and a clerk who has been replaced by a clerk with responsibility in respect of all the other committees.  I consider that to have been a retrograde step.  Without adequate staffing and other resources we will not be in a position to carry on our present level of work, take on the responsibility that this <Col N="1322" /> Bill will impose on all committees and still hope to get good results.</P>
    <P>Section 6 (7) &ldquo;provides that the reasonable costs and expenses in relation to an appeal shall be paid to the person concerned by the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  If people do not live locally and have to travel to come before us or if they need legal representation, their expenses will have to be paid for out of the Votes of the Houses the Oireachtas. This will impose a heavy additional expense.  On the other hand, if legal representatives come with witnesses&mdash;it will be necessary for them to have legal-advice since committees are held in public&mdash;we will need a proper legal section within the Houses so as to be able to give proper advice in respect of any investigation.  With these extra powers the committees will be transformed. They will be in a position to carry out much more rigorous investigations, the type of role that was envisaged for them in the first place.</P>
    <P>Many commercial semi-State bodies were integral parts of previous Departments.  For example, An Post and Bord Telecom came out of the old Department of Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; other Departments had such responsibility, too.  Until they were re-established as semi-State bodies, they could be questioned as part of a Minister's responsibility under the various mechanisms available in the House &mdash; Question Time, private notice questions, matters on the Adjournment or during debate on departmental Estimates.  When the relevant committees were set up, questions from Deputies about the performance of these bodies were referred to their boards and that was the end of it. This was the reason for setting up a committee like the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored bodies, which is responsible for a sector where considerable amounts of public funds are spent and money collected through a form of taxation supported by grants from Government &mdash; taxation, legal fees, licence fees etc. Therefore, it is proper that public representatives have a forum in which they <Col N="1323" /> can question the operation of these bodies, their spending and their reports.</P>
    <P>Without the powers being provided for in this Bill, that work could not be done adequately.  There has been a great reluctance on many occasions by some chief executives and chairmen of boards to give evidence before Committees.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill.  I have drawn attention to what will be involved when its provisions are implemented.  I look forward to the Committee Stage debate on this, one of the most important Bills ever to come before us, dealing, as it is, with the semi-State sector which involves the expenditure of some billions of pounds.  Other committees will have similar problems to those of the committee with which I am associated.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill forward.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>As chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts I welcome the opportunity to make a brief contribution.  I, too, congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill forward.  The committee made many requests for such a Bill over the years.  There were many instances where witnesses refused to come before the committee.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides for Oireachtas committees whose terms of reference include provision for calling persons, papers and records, powers of compellability in respect of witnesses and evidence both written and oral.  Witnesses giving evidence to committees, or sending papers and records to them, will be accorded the same level of privilege as is enjoyed by a witness appearing before the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill sets out a limited range of areas where the exercise of the committee's power to compel the attendance of witnesses, the giving of evidence or the production of documents is circumscribed.  It prescribes the procedures to be followed in summoning and swearing witnesses, in obtaining evidence and where a witness disputes his compellability to give evidence.  It provides a <Col N="1324" /> mechanism under which, in certain instances, the public interest can be invoked in such disputes.  It sets out arrangements to protect the rights of persons mentioned in the course of a committee's proceedings and confers certain rights on employers or bodies whose employees or representatives are summoned as witnesses in connection with their employee or representative capacities.</P>
    <P>Under Article 15.12 of the Constitution Members of the House have absolute privilege in respect of utterances in either House.  This was extended by legislation to cover them at committee meetings.  Witnesses appearing before such committees enjoy qualified privilege.  This does not prevent legal action being taken against them for anything they say before a committee but provides them with a defence against libel or slander unless it can be proved that he or she was motivated by ill will, spite or any other improper motive.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to give to committees which have provision to call for persons, papers and records power to compel witnesses and evidence, both written and oral.  Unfortunately compellability is essential.  We know the work of committees has been thwarted by evasiveness and the reluctance of some to appear before them.  This will not be tolerated any longer.</P>
    <P>The Bill creates offences in the areas of contempt, perjury and non-disclosure of information and stipulates penalties &mdash; a fine not exceeding £1,500 on summary conviction and not exceeding £20,000 on conviction on indictment. Those penalties will make the relevant committees more effective and ensure they are taken seriously.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker mentioned staffing and legal advice and these issues will be to the fore.  It is imperative that legal advice be provided for the committees and that sufficient staff is available. This is an important Bill which will benefit all committees but particularly those who call witnesses.  I welcome the <Col N="1325" /> Bill and the proposal to set up a committee of investigation.</P>

      <P>As a matter of politeness I suppose I must join in the general congratulatory chorus to the Minister and the Department of Finance on bringing this Bill before the House.  In case it should be thought that Christmas arrived a month earlier, I must query why it has taken so long for the Bill to be introduced.  I am driven to the conclusion that the present mess suited many people.  If that were not so, the position would not have been tolerated for so long.  I will not point the finger now but there is a vested interest somewhere which was served by making persons non-compellable as far as Oireachtas committees are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a general way, it is a case of the executive arm of the State doing everything in its power to avoid responsibility to the legislative and representative arm of the State, the Oireachtas.  This is only one of the ways in which the balance between the Executive and the Legislature has been badly distorted over the years.  The Executive, in the form of Ministers and Ministers of State and the public service, has a horror of being compelled to come before committees. I recall asking at the beginning of this Dáil if Ministers would go before committees established under the previous Government when Deputy Reynolds was Taoiseach.  I remember suggesting that the Minister should appear before the Committee on Foreign Affairs and was given the reply that Ministers are responsible to the Dáil and not to its committees.  It was a constitutional doctrine and would not be trenched upon. That has been forgotten now and we realise it is necessary to make the Executive responsible to the Legislature in more ways than simply fencing with words on Question Time where, as the Chair has often pointed out, there is no way to compel an answer, still less to compel a document, to be given.  It is somewhat different now in that a Minister can be compelled to go before a <Col N="1326" /> committee or if a Department is compelled to send documents it cannot refuse to do so.  That is a great step forward.</P>
    <P>I have been critical of a number of the Bill's features.  Section 14 (1) provides:</P>
    <P>A civil servant or a member of the permanent Defence Forces or the Garda Síochána shall not&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  while giving evidence to a committee, question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the Attorney General or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy...</P>
    <P>Consider what that idiotic provision will mean if translated into law.  If the Government has a programme for drug eradication in our cities and Commissioner Culligan appears before a committee he will be expressly precluded from discussing the merits of Government policy.  He cannot say: &ldquo;This is daft; the fight against drugs is directed by ill-conceived policy&rdquo;.  Why do we not want the merits of some Government policies discussed by those we charge under statute with the task of implementing them?  It is absurd that the Commissioner cannot answer and the chairman must say that he cannot be asked such a question.  He cannot say if the drugs policy is correct or incorrect, effective or ineffective and whether it offers a solution.  That illustrates the fundamental conservation of this measure.  What is at issue is to grudgingly give as little as possible to the Legislature.  It is sad that the Government portrays this as a dramatic new Bill when what is dramatic are provisions of that kind.</P>
    <P>If the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána is summoned before or even voluntarily appears before a committee of the Dáil to deal with drugs, for example, he is caught by section 14 (1) and is not permitted to express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government.  If he believes our laws <Col N="1327" /> on drug abuse, for instance, are misconceived and are a waste of his members' time, he is bound to keep quiet about it and continue to bat as if he held the opposite opinion.</P>
    <P>Section 14 (1) (b) also fascinates me. It states that a civil servant will not send to a committee a document in which the merits of any Government policy are mentioned.  We should be able to consider that in the context of the beef tribunal &mdash; I do not want to be controversial &mdash; to see if a decision was made on advice or in the teeth of advice.  That is one of the many examples.  However, we cannot find out what was the case.  If a strong condemnatory memorandum is sent to a Minister by his top adviser saying it is the universal opinion of the Department that a particular exercise is foolish, that expert opinion tends to support that view and urging him not to pursue it, a committee of this House charged at a later stage with investigating why a disastrous policy had been embarked upon will be expressly prohibited from knowing about or seeing such material.  That is very sad.</P>
    <P>Section 14 (2) is even more dramatic. It states that if by chance a poor benighted garda, soldier or civil servant expresses an opinion or produces a document before a committee in which an opinion is expressed on the merit of ministerial policy, it will be kept secret. Nobody, not even a Member of the committee, could divulge it to the public.  They could not even mention that a decision had been taken in the teeth of advice.  It is extraordinary that the only person who can be told is the Minister or relevant departmental authority whose policy might have been criticised. That is another sad provision.</P>
    <P>One might believe in relation to section 14 that an enlightened and liberal Government would have at least proposed that a civil servant or member of the security forces could decline to answer a question on the grounds that it touched upon areas of policy. However, to prohibit them from doing so and to suppress the fact that they <Col N="1328" /> have done so is entirely misconceived and wrong.</P>
    <P>I understand the Government has decided to make some significant changes to the Bill.  I welcome that and, in particular, the Taoiseach's views in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  I respect the independence of the DPP's office and I concur with the view that it would be most unsatisfactory if the Director of Public Prosecutions could be hauled before a committee of this or the other House and asked to justify decisions in a particular case because we would effectively have Oireachtas trial of the case which was not tried before the courts.  It is a legitimate aim of legislative policy to avoid that situation.  However, this House should be entitled to ask the Director of Public Prosecutions, through a relevant committee, to explain his policy in relation to the prosecution or non-prosecution of certain categories of offences.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of the difficulties that arise in those circumstances. The offence of dangerous driving has two sub-categories &mdash; dangerous driving simpliciter and dangerous driving causing death or serious bodily injury.  Frequently the Director of Public Prosecutions prosecutes in the District Court dangerous driving where a death has occurred as a simple dangerous driving charge.  By doing so, he avoids the difficulties and expense of a jury trial.  Perhaps that is something he may legitimately take into account.  However, he also brings about a situation in which the public, in particular relatives of the deceased or badly injured person, find it impossible to believe that the necessary ingredients for an indictable offence were not present.  It would be reasonable for this House to ask the present incumbent of that office to come before a committee to lay out the general principles he applies to decisions in such cases.</P>
    <P>There are many other cases where general policy decisions of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions should be the subject of public discussion.  If we need to change the law <Col N="1329" /> in a particular case to make an offence indictable rather than summary, the Director of Public Prosecutions is one of the first people we should ask about the implications of such a decision.  We would need to know the policy implications of a decision we were contemplating for his office.</P>
    <P>It is nonsense to say that because the Director of Public Prosecutions is independent he should not be accountable to this House in certain respects.  The Ombudsman is as independent as the Director of Public Prosecutions and is appointed by a resolution of both Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; it is not even a Governmental appointment &mdash; but at least he is required to report to this House.  I do not believe there is any reason that the Director of Public Prosecutions should be exempt.  I am delighted the Government is at least moving towards creating a situation in which the Director of Public Prosecutions will be amenable in a reasonable way to this House.</P>
    <P>I have a number of other problems with this Bill, including the <i>sub judice</i> rule.  The provision in section 5 (1) states: &ldquo;Subject to the provisions of this Act, a committee may not direct a person to give evidence, or produce or send a document to it, or attend before it to give evidence, or produce a document, to it, relating to&mdash;&rdquo;.  Section 5 (1) (b) refers to &ldquo;a matter the subject of proceedings currently before a court in the State, the Court of Justice of the European Communities, the Court of First Instance of the European Communities, the European Court of Human Rights or the European Commission of Human Rights,&rdquo;.  Is the phrase &ldquo;subject of proceedings currently before a court in the State&rdquo; to be construed narrowly or widely?  If that means any proceedings which have been commenced in a court, this provision would be disastrous because it would mean that by the simple expedient of issuing a High Court writ or having somebody else do so, one could declare a matter off limits to a committee of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>If it has the narrower meaning of <Col N="1330" /> some proceeding which is currently being decided on by a court and set down for trial or at an advanced stage where an Oireachtas committee would obviously be trespassing on the judicial function by embarking on the same territory, there could be a very different meaning to this section.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that this House is always advised that the conservative meaning is the correct one.  We are likely to be advised this means that any matter in relation to which proceedings have been commenced in a court is off limits to an Oireachtas committee.  I would consider that a retrograde provision in any statute concerning the power of an Oireachtas committee.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned with the penalties provided for in the Bill.  For instance, on conviction on indictment for refusing to come before a committee of the House a person is liable to a penalty of £20,000.  There are some people for whom that amount would be practically nothing.  Some people would not face a tribunal or committee of inquiry if by doing so it would cause them significant personal or financial damage.  I can imagine some of the merchant princes for whom payment of a £20,000 fine would be a very good way to bring about a year's delay in becoming responsible to a committee of this House.  Many people who might elect for trial on indictment would consider themselves well off if they were fined only that amount.</P>
    <P>The High Court should have power to compel a person to attend a committee and to punish them for contempt of court if they disobey the order.  That action would be effective.  If the High Court could, on the application of the Attorney General, dictate that a person must attend a committee, otherwise they will be punished in the same way as people who disobey other court orders, there would be some hope that the very rich merchant princes would be frightened into attending.  As it stands some people might find it very sensible to ignore a committee.</P>
    <P>Under section 3 (7) a person may be <Col N="1331" /> found guilty of an offence for failure to appear before a committee.  We should specifically provide that an Irish citizen, wherever he or she lives, on being paid proper travelling expenses, should be liable to attend a committee.  I do not want to be told that a businessman is too busy to attend and will remain outside the jurisdiction.  It should be an incident of citizenship that a person, whether living in Paris, London, the Isle of Wight or the Isle of Man, who receives a summons to attend an Oireachtas committee is obliged as an Irish citizen to comply with it and refusal to do so would be an offence under law.  Subsection (7) is doubtful in terms of territoriality.  Provision should be made for requests to people outside the ordinary jurisdiction of our courts to attend committees.  It should be incumbent on an Irish citizen living abroad to at least answer a request of a committee and to bring documents from abroad in so far as they are in his possession or power of procurement, irrespective of whether failure to comply with such an order would be deemed to occur within the State.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy with the exemption procedure contemplated for the Taoiseach in sections 6 and 7 and the functions given to the High Court in that regard.  Time does not allow me to elaborate on the extent of my unhappiness &mdash; I have done so before in public and would prefer to do so again in circumstances where the exact implications of individual decisions under those sections could be considered at greater length and in slightly less formal circumstances.  Presumably that will be done on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The Bill, while welcome, is not generous in its spirit.  It is grudging and externally conformist but internally reluctant legislation in terms of increasing the powers of the Oireachtas and rebalancing what I consider the present distorted relationship between the Legislature and the Executive arm of the State.  In that context I do not want to be negative.  There is much in the Bill <Col N="1332" /> that is good, welcome and manifestly overdue.  An explanation is due from the powers that be &mdash; I am not talking about politicians in office but a generation of politicians pressurised in a different direction by people who believed the Oireachtas should be kept in its place &mdash; on the reason it has taken so long for this Bill to come into being. We will not receive that explanation and the best redress we have is to make it as good a Bill as possible during its passage through Committee and Report Stages. I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on it.  I hope it will be capable of improvement and that some of the matters I mentioned will be considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill. Perhaps I am not the best person to speak on such a Bill since I have been a Member of the House for only a few years and may not understand the workings of committees down the years. Deputy Kavanagh listed various reports by sub-committees who believed they had been stymied in carrying out their work.  Obviously long serving Deputies have a greater appreciation of that matter.  While there was need for a Bill such as this, the events of November last year probably made it more obvious that it was urgently required.</P>
      <P>There are one or two interesting comments in the Minister's speech.  On reading the first page I wonder whether there is a hidden message.  The Minister said that when a party comes into Government it has great ideas about solving the problems of the world. Further in his speech he seemed to be in a very despondent mood, as if he knows something of which I am not aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. Doyle Mrs. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not read too much into it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will quote the Minister's statement:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any party coming into Government carries with it some vision of the direction which it wishes society to take.  It is, in the case of my party, <Col N="1333" /> such a vision of the needs and rights of the public &mdash; ordinary workers and the underprivileged &mdash; which has animated our representatives, our activists and our core supporters since before the foundation of this State.</P>
    <P>Later he states: &ldquo;I think no Minister has left Government, for the Opposition benches, without a sense of things left undone or things done less than well&rdquo;. That makes me wonder whether there is a problem with next year's Estimates of which I am not aware, or maybe the Hitler remark is coming back to haunt the Minister.  Perhaps the Cabinet is looking for a scapegoat and the Minister believes the finger is pointed at him.  It is rather extraordinary &mdash; it is the type of speech one would expect somebody to write on leaving the Dáil after about 40 years.  The Minister also spoke &mdash; if he is leaving he seems intent on bringing others with him &mdash; about the free ranging, spontaneous contributions from Deputies, probably Deputies such as me, and said that we might need new chairmen.  What does that mean?  Is he referring to new Members or saying that in future we will have to approach Deputy McDowell's colleagues in the Law Library?  Will independent senior counsels act as chairmen to whip us in and quickly cut out the messing?  I do not know what the Minister means.  I have nothing derogatory to say about the current chairmen; I am sure they are as good or as bad as any other Members.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us what he means because it appears he intends to bring in outside chairmen to whip us into line.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a welcome attempt to reform and modernise the work of the Oireachtas.  However, the Taoiseach was questioned earlier today about the North and his statement of a few days ago, that nobody outside this House should be better briefed than anybody within it, was quoted to him.  Many things are said and put on record but are not subsequently lived up to.  This is fine legislation but some people seem to think that once one genuflects in the right direction one need not act on what one says.</P>
    <P>The committees are working well <Col N="1334" /> although perhaps there are too many of them.  In the three years I have been in the House the number of committees has rocketed.  The philosophy behind the system is grand but most of us have constituency work to do as well.  How are we to run from one committee room to another if we have to do our constituency work at the same time?</P>
    <P>I agree with giving committees real power if they are asked to do a job. However, I have attended committee meetings this year which were only attended by two or three Deputies.  That is understandable because they have many other things to do.  It is fine to try and imitate a British or European system of committees in which Members specialise in particular areas, but unless we go the whole hog and introduce single seat constituencies we cannot grapple with the problem.  Imitating other countries will not work if we must cram everything into three days when our minds are constantly on other problems.</P>
    <P>Perhaps it is different when one represents a constituency such as Dublin south-east; perhaps there is not the same volume of constituency queries. However, most of us represent middle of the road constituencies where, sadly, consituency work takes up too much of our time.  That is a problem.  While to try to imitate the foreign system of committees which have real power and are composed of specialists is good, one cannot have one's cake and eat it.  One cannot have a parliamentary system like ours and expect members of large parties who are looking over their shoulders at their colleagues rather than at the opposition, to participate effectively in committees.  I do not have that problem at present, although I am supposed to work towards bringing in a colleague&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1335" /> A number of speakers have said the introduction of this Bill will mean no more tribunals like the beef tribunal because we will be able to do work like that here for a fraction of the cost.  I hope they are right.  However, we saw what happened in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored bodies which dealt with the Lowry affair in recent weeks.  The Government will always have a majority on committees.  We will have to get away from that and give committees freedom to do what is right.  There is no point in establishing a system and allowing a committee to deal with issues by calling witnesses and hearing evidence when ultimately it will vote along party lines. There is no point in going through the procedures unless the committees are given the wherewithal to to the job.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kavanagh referred to instances when people refused to appear before committees.  Any official working for an organ of the State should appear before such committees.  I am horrified that people have refused or tried to evade doing so in the past. However, the officials are probably no different from Ministers who often are reluctant to appear before committees or to attend Adjournment debates. They try to wangle out of it in whatever way they can.  I suppose it is a natural human reaction to try to avoid awkward questions.</P>
    <P>The Government said this legislation has been studied in great depth, yet it proposed an amendment with regard to the DPP one week after the Bill was published.  If it was studied in such great depth how can this happen?  If the Bill was deeply thought out I fail to see how the Government could omit to provide for a fundamental public official and so quickly realise that he had been left out.</P>

      <P>It is extraordinary.  The Bill also provides that the Attorney General can appear before committees <Col N="1336" /> on some issues.  One might be slightly nervous about how that provision will be implemented.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker mentioned a number of omissions in the Bill which refers to matters &ldquo;respecting the security of the State&rdquo;.  Part of the problem is that every public servant thinks everything he does and everything that crosses his desk affects the security of the State.  I am not jibing at public servants; I worked in a semi-State body for long enough.  However, we all try to create a mystique about what we do and that phrase could be interpreted in many ways.  We know what it should mean but it is open to interpretation.</P>
      <P>The Bill also refers to matters currently before the courts.  It is cheap and easy to get a solicitor's letter.  Does that mean that the matter is before the courts or that the procedure has started?  The Bill is good and could work well but if somebody wished to make a mess of it and bind it up in bureaucracy he could successfully do so by referring to those provisions.  Section 5 (2) refers to &ldquo;the source of any information contained in an utterance by a member in either such House or at a meeting of a committee&rdquo;.  If I came to the House with information and refused to disclose its source I would probably be hounded by the media, although they are quite good at not disclosing their own sources.  I am nervous about how that provision will be interpreted, not by this Government but by future Governments which might not be fully committed to the objective of the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Chief Whip referred to a committee of investigation.  What will be the role of that committee?  Will it deal with all matters of inquiry that would previously have been dealt with by the other committees?  There are so many committees that their business is overlapping.  There was a recent problem regarding the Garda Commissioner's appearing before the Joint Committee on the Family.  Some committees appear to be operating in different directions dealing with various issues.  It appears that sometimes they do not know what <Col N="1337" /> work they should be dealing with and are looking for work to include in their programme.  I imagine other committees would be annoyed if the committee of investigation were to deal with matters of great interest and priority.</P>
    <P>This legislation is part of the Government's OTA approach.  Openness, transparency and accountability are words which have been said so often that they are now part of the Government's folklore, but is it living up to those principles?</P>
    <P>I raised a matter on the privatisation of a section of CIE on the Adjournment before the summer recess, but the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications.  Mr. Lowry, did not come into the House to reply to it.  He said that matter was a policy decision for CIE although most of us thought it was an important matter that required Government approval.  Since then the Minister is almost telling the company what newspaper it should buy.  He is saying that the board of CIE deals with major issues, but we learned earlier today that he will take the easy option of moving in to take control of it by putting his cuckoos on the board.</P>

      <P>This is not the appropriate time to talk about the Minister, Deputy Lowry.  In the context of openness, it appears he is sacking the board of CIE for no particular reason.  I cite that as an example of how the Government is committed to one set of principles but does not adhere to them.  It is difficult to decipher the truth because of the manner in which matters are glossed over.  There is so much tinsel, wrapping paper and spin doctoring surrounding every Government statement that it is difficult to distinguish truth from fiction. My philosophy is that I will accept the word of anybody provided that everybody is judged by the standards they set themselves.  If a Government creates hype about the principles of openness, transparency and accountability, it will be judged by those principles.  I accept that to date it might not have been caught out to any major extent.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope the committee system will operate more efficiently and that people will not abuse their privileged position inside or outside the House, a matter about which we must be careful.  It was mentioned that the reputation of some people outside the House has been damaged by statements made here.  I like to think that Members on this side have not been guilty of that in the past, but some Members have abused their privileged position and some have been scathing in their comments about others outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare made over the top comments about some of the Catholic hierarchy during the past few days.  When I raised that matter with the Taoiseach I was disappointed he did not distance himself from them. In the past one could have expected <Col N="1339" /> more from the Leader of Fine Gael.  I am aware Fine Gael is Fianna Fáil's natural enemy.  Whatever else we may say about Fine Gael its members are mainly decent people of depth and substance.  It is extraordinary that a Fine Gael Taoiseach would not distance himself from Deputy De Rossa's personalised remarks about the Catholic bishops.</P>

      <P>The commission set up under the Ethics in Public Office Bill might be the appropriate body to decide on the admissibility of information in respect of witnesses that may be called before a committee.  I interpret that to mean that civil servants may not give evidence if the information disclosed could prove to be commercially damaging.  A decision can be made on that matter in various ways.  If a civil servant were to write a letter to the Taoiseach of the day and inform him or her of a matter, he or she might decide not to proceed on a certain course.  However, having regard to the manner in which the Civil Service operates, I would not envisage a Taoiseach overruling a civil servant unless he or she thought that the matter concerned was of great importance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 17 committees, the work of many of which is unwieldy and overlapping.  Another difficulty is that many of them are held on Dáil sitting days.  That has to be taken into account also.  I have been a Member for many years and I have heard allegations made here <Col N="1340" /> against non-Members which have proved damaging for commercial and other reasons.  When people hear allegations made under privilege they often adopt the view that there is seldom smoke without fire.  I reject such allegations which can have far reaching consequences.  I never resorted to making such wild allegations and I do not intend to in the future.</P>
    <P>While section 7 is important further clarification is required on which witnesses may be called or who may decline to appear before a committee.  If issues not related to those under investigation are raised will the person who raises them be subject to legal action? The courts may rule certain Bills unconstitutional, for example the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (Amendment) Bill was returned to the House on three occasions.  On two occasions the courts found it to be unconstitutional although the legal advice to the Government at the time was that it was constitutional.</P>
    <P>A person who is not a Member of either House who appears before a committee must be clear on the extent of the privilege they enjoy.  It is important to hear the opinion of the Attorney General on this matter.  If it is not clarified witnesses called before the committee may request such clarification before giving evidence.  If the implications are not spelt out clearly the issue may be contested in the courts.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to third parties, those named by witnesses giving evidence whose reputations are at stake.  They, because of immunity granted to witnesses appearing before a committee, have put one opportunity to vindicate their name, by invoking the procedure set out in section 10.  Under that section a person, having been named or referred to in the proceedings, may make submissions before a committee and request the committee to call other witnesses who may be cross-examined on behalf of the named party.  That may have serious repercussions for those named.  I need further clarification on a number of issues.  Three decades ago <Col N="1341" /> Mr. Jock Haughey declined, and rightly so, to appear before a committee because he would not have privilege in giving evidence.  We need to ensure that those who are called before the committee and those against whom allegations may be made get an opportunity to defend themselves.  I have no doubt on Committee Stage that I and others will have much more to say on the issue.</P>
    <P>I have been listening to words such as &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; and &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; for the past couple of years.  One would think there was no accountability by successive Governments over four decades.  I do not agree with that.  Those Members who have been in Government have carried out their duties responsibly and with integrity.  Those who have been in Government know that the big problem &mdash; the Minister will confirm this &mdash; is that Departments do not have enough money to go around. Nevertheless, public servants are always fair, reasonable and understanding. They give their views to the Government of the day on how they see their position.</P>
    <P>I would like confirmation from the Minister that witnesses who come before a committee cannot be sued subsequently for making statements they believe are true but which are challenged by others outside this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mrs. Doyle)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies from all sides of the House for their contributions, including my colleague, the Minister of State Deputy Higgins.  This complicated and long awaited legislation has been generally welcomed.  Some Deputies indicated it was the 1970s when we first started talking about the need to empower committees to operate effectively but the main reason this legislation has taken three or four years to see the light is the need to take careful legal advice on the steps we are now proposing to take in the Bill.  In another context the Minister referred to the need for forensic care.  This Bill needs to be handled with forensic care and, once enacted, the committees will <Col N="1342" /> have to implement it with the same forensic care to ensure natural justice for those appearing before them.</P>
      <P>In opening this debate the Minister, Deputy Quinn, indicated the origins of the Bill and its place in the thinking of his party.  I and the Fine Gael Party share his view of its importance, as do all Government parties, and it is that convergence of thinking which secured its inclusion in the joint agenda of the three Government parties set out in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> If I bring a different emphasis to this Bill it is because of my own role in Government. The mandate I have been given, which is reflected in my assignment to each of the three Departments which have a central function in relation to the public service and the public sector, is to improve the responsiveness of all parts of the State machinery to the needs of the citizen and the client.  Put simply, my mandate is to improve the performance of public institutions and to bring about certain fundamental reforms in the public service.  This Bill facilitates both processes.  It provides an enhanced means for democratically elected public representatives to elicit information and to close the information gap which exists not not only between them and the Government but between them and the personnel in public institutions.  It also provides a new and, I hope, effective mechanism to make officialdom accountable for its actions.</P>
      <P>I am glad Deputies Dermot Ahern and O'Donnell noted the connection between this Bill and the wider question of public service reform and made particular reference to the strategic management initiative.  What the Bill and the initiative, as it has been developed under my stewardship, have in common is the inculcation within the public service of a culture of accountable management.  The Bill provides one of the capstones to this process by improving the accountability of office holders and public administration to Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second element will involve the creation of new mechanisms in public Departments and officers designed to <Col N="1343" /> ensure a heightened degree of individual accountability for their actions and, less spectacularly but more importantly, their use of public resources.  I am happy to assure Deputy Ahern and other Members that I have presided over the working out of the arrangements this initiative requires and I expect shortly &mdash;certainly by the New Year, if not earlier&mdash;to be in a position to indicate the steps being taken to put them into effect.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some general points. At times, the debate strayed beyond the confines of the Bill&mdash;at one stage we were talking about Catholic bishops and the management of CIE&mdash;into the wider topic of the committee system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Some of the contributions made last night suggested that the effect of this Bill would be to diminish the existing powers of Committees or to place Members in a less advantageous position <i>vis-á-vis</i> witnesses than at present.  This is not the case.  The Bill deals with the grant of privilege to witnesses and of powers to compel witnesses to appear before committees and sets out the arrangements which will apply when those powers are exercised. It does not debar committees from proceeding as they always have when they are exercising compulson.  It does not prevent them from discussing matters exempted from disclosure under this <Col N="1344" /> Bill except when they are utilising the powers it confers.  That is an extremely important point.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell alleged this Bill was delayed in the Department of Justice and that certain features of the Bill confirm this view.</P>

      <P>I do not know how this canard gained currency in certain political quarters but I must take this opportunity to correct it.  The Bill was given normal circulation through all Government Departments and involved substantial discussions at all stages with the State's legal advisers but nothing which would justify singling out the Department of Justice or its recent Ministers for criticism in this regard.  It is true the Department of Justice had views, as would its counterparts in any jurisdiction, about the impact of public disclosure on certain areas of its operations.  These are reflected to some degree in the Bill.  The idea that security of the State is a blanket term which can be used at whim by officials of this or other Departments is also inaccurate.  A court judgment some years ago narrowed the extent of this term.  Deputy O'Donnell has available to her in her party a Deputy who contributed to the debate this evening with direct personal experience of operating in this sensitive area.  He can no doubt explain to her the real concerns which certain exclusions in the Bill reflect.</P>
      <P>The Bill prohibits civil servants and others from commenting on the merits of the policy of Ministers or the Government.  This does not preclude them from explaining particular policy and the reasons underlying that policy nor does it prevent the members of committees forming their own views on the merits of that policy.</P>

      <P>It prevents a civil servant <Col N="1345" /> setting him or herself up as a judge on the success or appropriateness of a policy which has been chosen by the people who, unlike him or her, have been entrusted by the electorate with that task, in other words, the democratically elected Members of this House.  I am gratified that Deputy Martin shares that view.  Deputy O'Donnell would not wish civil servants or gardaí to arrogate to themselves functions appropriate to politicians.</P>
      <P>We have a tradition of a politically neutral Civil Service and police force. This restriction is intended to maintain and reinforce that tradition.  It is not unparalleled.  The legislation passed in 1993 dealing with the Comptroller and Auditor General imposes precisely the same restriction on accounting officers who appear regularly before the Committee of Public Accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with a specific point raised by other Members, not by Deputy Ahern.</P>
      <P>Deputy Jim Mitchell made it clear that, in exercising their powers under this Bill, committees will require the guidance of a legal adviser independent of the Attorney General and that view is shared by the Government.  What remains to be settled is how that advice will be obtained, whether by direct recruitment, secondment or the deployment of private practitioner.  My Department and the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas have already engaged in discussions on these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Several Members put down markers about specific sections and subsections to which they promised to return on Committee Stage, to which I have no objections.  We have already signalled, as has the Minister for Finance, our readiness and openness to consider suggestions from the Opposition.  At least two of the comments from the opposite side of the House struck a <Col N="1346" /> chord on this issue.  Deputy McCreevy raised the matter of public interest and how it might be defined and Deputy O'Donnell queried the definition of &ldquo;private affairs&rdquo;.  In the light of the law in relation to privacy in other jurisdictions, we felt it appropriate to build in some protection for personal privacy. We also recognise that circumstances could arise in which an investigation of some importance could be frustrated by blinkered observance of a privacy restriction.  The solution we have devised, after much heart-searching, is embodied in section 6 (4).  On this and on other sections we are open to conviction that there might be, or is, a better way.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy appeared to be concerned that Members of the Oireachtas are to be beyond compellability.  That is not the case, save in so far as they cannot be compelled to disclose the source of any statement made in either House or to a committee.  In including this provision we are merely reflecting the decision of the courts. Deputy McCreevy was also worried about abuse of privilege, as am I. However, in this Bill we have included a specific provision that if somebody giving evidence abuses privilege, and is requested to cease giving evidence by the chairperson of the relevant committee and refuses to do so, they will no longer enjoy the High Court-type privilege.  Equally, if any person is named or their identity hinted at in committee, they will have a right to come forward to put their case before that committee. This right will exist regardless of whether the person is named or identified by a Member of the Oireachtas or by a witness.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCreevy and others raised the question of a change from last December's Act, a once-off legislative measure, compared with this Bill.  There are two fundamental differences.  First, it was clear that that committee would not be making a finding.  Second, as any Member who sat through the proceedings of the subcommittee of the Select Committee on Legislation and <Col N="1347" /> Security will be aware, legal advice was given to them in relation to the line of questioning; in other words, strictly pre-ordained lines of inquiry were laid down.</P>
    <P>I fear Deputy Dempsey does us too little credit.  The Bill he saw and circulated as a draft last year contained one significant provision absent from this one.  Under his Government's proposals committees could not have compelled Ministers or Ministers of State to attend before them whereas under mine they can; whether that is a worthwhile change I will leave to the House to judge.</P>
    <P>I should like to allay one of the fears of Deputies Dempsey and Dukes &mdash; that section 9 has been drafted to make it impossible for a boss in the public or private sector to substitute himself or herself for any employee called before a committee.  However, he or she does have a right to respond in person or through another employee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Jim O'Keeffe raised a number of questions about procedural issues for committees arising from their compliance with the provisions of this Bill. Clearly, it would be neither possible nor appropriate for any legislative measure to seek to tell the Oireachtas, or any of its committees, how to organise its affairs in detail.  I anticipate that the appropriate authorities in the House of the Oireachtas will draw up the necessary guidelines to ensure compliance if the Bill is sensible, fair and workable.</P>
    <P>Deputy Michael McDowell painted a malign scenario based on the restriction imposed on civil servants or members of the Garda Síochána in dealing with the merits of Government policy.  I must stress that that restriction applies only to those categories of Government employees.  It does not prevent Ministers from disclosing the existence of advice contrary to the line followed or preclude committees, armed with the power to compel witnesses to appear before them, from following lines of questioning designed to elicit such information.  On the evidence available to <Col N="1348" /> me.  Deputy McDowell's forensic skills are well up to that task.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connolly was worried that a witness who disclosed information under the provisions of the Bill would be open to legal action as a result.  The Bill extends to a witness the privileges he or she would enjoy in giving the same evidence to the High Court; they cannot be sued.  Deputy Connolly also raised the issue of third parties named in proceedings.  As he noted, we have provided a right of rebuttal.  However, there is an additional protection contained in section 11, designed to stop abuse of privilege on the part of a witness, including malicious references to third parties.  When a chairperson tells him or her to stop, privilege ceases.  That is an extremely important point and demonstrates the responsibility this Bill will place on the skills of chairpersons and how important such supervision and strict discipline will be at such committees.</P>

      <P>That takes me back to references by Deputy Noel Ahern to the speech of the Minister for Finance, when he wondered whether the Minister had some Machiavellian motives in terms of what he said, whether the present chairpersons might not last too much longer, or whether he had other plans to recruit outside chairpersons &mdash; I am paraphrasing Deputy Ahern's concerns.  The Minister was really pointing out the extra degree of responsibility to be placed in future on the chairpersons of the various committees to ensure the disciplined conduct of proceedings, particularly when witnesses have been compelled to appear before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am conscious there is no great difference between the two sides of this House about the desirability and necessity for a Bill to deal with compellability and privilege.  In essence, what we have been discussing are matters of detail, <Col N="1349" /> procedural points, exemptions in limitations and, I fear, some misunderstandings.  These have received much consideration on the part of the Government and its predecessor.  The Bill before Members is our best shot at striking a balance between the needs of committees, the requirements of Government in certain sensitive areas and the rights of witnesses and others. There appears to be a feeling, not confined to any one side of the House, that some further refinement of subsections, some more precise targeting of exemptions or restrictions is required.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance and I discussed this Bill with the Government Chief Whip we explicitly identified it as one which, more than any other, provided meat for Committee Stage.  The debate today has made it clear that that view is widely shared.</P>
    <P>The Government is not prejudiced in considering improvements or refinements suggested by any side.  Our joint endeavours should be to produce a Bill which will withstand legal scrutiny and prove effective and readily workable in practice.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak about bovine TB on the day I published, in consultation with farming organisations and the Irish Veterinary Union, what I believe to be most historic changes in the TB scheme for 1996. I hope today will mark a turning point in the history of the TB scheme so that we can look forward to a future in which we can move towards final TB eradication.  I hope the Opposition spokes-persons received a copy of the data which we arranged to send to them early today.</P>
      <P>Before dealing with the Bill, I propose to address the broader issues of the disease eradication programme and the proposals I outlined to the farming organisations and the Irish Veterinary Union today.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the economy and employment in the agricultural sector rely heavily on exports of livestock and livestock products.  Access to export markets is underpinned by our relatively high animal health status and freedom from major animal diseases. Such freedom will continue to be decisive in maintaining our capacity to export as the animal health status is raised elsewhere and as consumers become more discerning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is in this context that we operate a number of measures to prevent the introduction of new diseases and to control, reduce and eradicate diseases in <Col N="1351" /> cattle.  The most important measures in terms of human and financial resources are the TB and brucellosis programmes. It is important for perspective to realise that significant progress has been made in reducing the levels of these diseases. Currently over 90 per cent of the cattle population of seven million animals in the national herd are clear of TB while 99.9 per cent of cattle herds are brucellosis free.  Thus the problem we have is with residual levels of infection which are proving notoriously difficult to reduce.  Under current trading rules, it continues to be necessary to operate annual programmes for these diseases which are both costly to farmers and taxpayers and which cause particular difficulties and hardship for some farmers whose herds break down.</P>
    <P>Since 1954, when the compulsory TB eradication scheme was introduced, total expenditure on both schemes is in excess of a billion pounds.  The current annual cost of the schemes is almost £67 million of which about £20 million is spent under each of the headings, testing, compensation and administration with the balance on operational aspects. Since disease levies were introduced, farmers have contributed about £285 million while some £16 million has been received from the EU Veterinary Fund. Most of the EU funding received relates to the brucellosis scheme rather than the TB scheme for which we have received minimal EU funding to date.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding this major expenditure, it has not, unfortunately, been possible to make progress in reducing the residual level of TB in the past 20 years.  While the country was declared officially brucellosis free in 1986, and notwithstanding various intensive programmes in recent years, there are a number of areas where there is still some infection and over 400 herds were restricted in 1994.  Accordingly, it continues to be necessary to implement arrangements aimed at the total eradication of brucellosis using blood testing, milk ring analysis and other technology.</P>
    <P>As regards TB, Deputies will be <Col N="1352" /> aware that under ERAD, an intensive testing programme was undertaken under a four year programme aimed at reducing the incidence by 50 per cent. The main conclusion to be drawn from that experience is that eradication is more difficult than had been envisaged. Indeed, the consensus now is that while some progress can be made, final eradication will be possible only when new diagnostic tests, vaccines for wildlife and movement control arrangements are in place.  Pending the development of these to practical field application level, the emphasis must be to contain and reduce the disease and costs of programmes.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that on assuming office.  I was faced with a situation under which EU funding had been approved for the 1995 TB programme. That programme provided for the rotation of testing between practices over three years.  We sought to secure the agreement of the IVU for this programme in negotiations which continued over 15 months.  Despite an offer to increase testing fees by 23 per cent over three years, the IVU rejected rotation following a ballot.  It was incumbent on me to seek to draw down EU funding for a variety or reasons.  We have received minimal EU funding for the TB programme over the years; because of IVU and farmer difficulties with aspects of the proposed programmes we failed to secure potential EU funding of about £10 million for three years which was agreed in 1991 and also to secure potential funding of £20 million a year over three years from 1993.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the various approved programmes would have demonstrated to our EU partners our willingness to implement agreed programmes aimed at combating TB; secure EU funding which would have relieved some of the burden on farmers and taxpayers; and opened the way for continued support for our programmes.</P>
    <P>For these reasons, and notwithstanding the IVU position, I sought to implement rotation of testing in phase <Col N="1353" /> three of the 1995 round.  That effort was resisted and obstructed by the IVU. While this has resulted in the level of rotation achieved being at a lower level than we would wish, the position is that some additional rotation has been achieved.  On this basis, we would hope to secure funding for the 1995 programme and we will seek further funding for the revised programme from 1996 onwards.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, the difficulty in securing EU funding for future programmes should not be underestimated.  The Commission has made it very clear to us that it will not support the allocation of Community funding for a continuation of the <i>status quo.</i> Therefore, to receive funding, we will have to convince the Commission and the 14 other member states that we are making real changes, that the measures we are proposing will be at least as worthwile as those included in the 1995 scheme and that we can implement revised measures &mdash; all of this against the background of our repeated failures to implement a number of earlier approved programmes.  It will be of benefit that we sought to introduce changes in 1995 when we seek EU funding in later years.</P>
    <P>From an early stage, I made it clear to all concerned that in the event that it proved impossible to implement the approved programme for TB, the continuation of the <i>status quo</i>&mdash; involving on-going and escalating costs for farmers and taxpayers &mdash; was not an option. Realistically, in view of the IVU stance we could not continue to seek to implement rotation in 1996 as this would result in large-scale and unacceptable disruption of the testing programme and the cattle industry generally.  Consequently, earlier this year I set about reviewing the measures that should be operated from 1996 and which would improve the effectiveness of the measures while at the same time moderating their overall costs.  This review was undertaken in consultation with the farming organisations which, together with the Government, provide the funding for the schemes.  At this <Col N="1354" /> stage.  I pay tribute to the farming organisations for the constructive approach they adopted and the assistance they have given in developing the measures I have outlined today.</P>
    <P>The main elements of the new regime I announced include the following: the continuation of orderly annual testing of the national herds and other testing designed to meet our obligations under EU rules so as to maintain our trading status; follow-up and focused strategic testing; a quality control programme; a comprehensive programme aimed at expediting derestriction of some herds in certain circumstances; a comprehensive research programme aimed at curtailing TB spread by wildlife; improved epidemiology and feedback to farmers who have serious disease outbreaks in their herds; and continuation of research on developing blood tests, vaccines and other technological tools required to improve the effectiveness of the programmes.</P>
    <P>The revised arrangements involve a partnership approach to implementing and overseeing the operation of the new arrangements at national and local levels.  Farmers will have greater direct involvement and responsibility under revised and more effective measures.  In particular, farmers will choose practitioners to carry out the first tests on herds each year and negotiate and pay practitioners for such work; assist the Department in research work into disease spread by wildlife; and have responsibility for protecting their own herds and in particular for deciding whether to buy in cattle which have been tested before movement and whether to test them after purchase.</P>
    <P>Coupled with the revised operational arrangements, I have proposed an intensification of control measures, a more focused approach to tackling infection, continuation of research and a rearrangement of the financing of the operational aspects of the schemes.  As already mentioned.  I am proposing that farmers would engage and pay practitioners directly for the first tests on their herds each year; as these costs <Col N="1355" /> were borne heretofore from central funds to which farmers contributed, the disease levies would be reduced to about £10 million a year for the first year.  Thereafter, compensation and the operational costs would be shared by the Exchequer and farmers on a 2:1 ratio.  Under the present funding arrangements, farmers pay some £28 million a year under disease levies.  In overall terms, total costs to be borne by farmers would be reduced substantially for the compulsory aspects while some savings will also accrue from the discontinuation of the 60 day compulsory pre-movement testing requirement for internal movement.  Apart from a reduction in overall costs, there will also be a more equitable burden-sharing of costs between farmers.  Under the levy arrangements, costs are borne by farmers who supply milk, who finish cattle and whose cattle are exported live. Under the new regime, all farmers will contribute towards the costs of the measures.</P>
    <P>I outlined these proposals to the farming organisations and the Irish Veterinary Union today.  I have asked the organisations to let me have their reactions, if possible within the next two weeks so that hopefully we can proceed within a short time with the adoption of the necessary legal changes to underpin and support the new regime.  The proposals I outlined represent the best course of action to be pursued over the next few years pending the development of more effective technologies to tackle eradication of TB.  The proposed measures are the most effective we can implement at present and, moreover, they will contribute significantly to moderating the overall costs of the programme for the Exchequer and farmers.</P>
    <P>The measures involve a more coherent and strategic approach where efforts will be better concentrated on real infection, laboratory and epidemiological considerations will be more widely used to assist with the more rapid derestriction of some herds and all sources of transmission will be tackled.  In <Col N="1356" /> addition, I believe that farmers will welcome the additional involvement and responsibilities which I am proposing and that they will act responsibly under the new regime.</P>
    <P>I also hope that the Veterinary Union will co-operate fully with the new regime.  The union had very strongly and vehemently opposed the principle of structured rotation on the grounds that this would involve testing of non-client herds and, in particular, it could tend to undermine the practice structure.  As the new measures envisage that farmers will choose practitioners, this source of difficulty has been addressed. There will, of course, be enhanced and structured measures to oversee the quality of the regime.</P>
    <P>The main objective of the Bill is to provide a legal basis for the payment of disease levies on cattle exported direct to the Minister of Agriculture, Food and Forestry rather than as heretofore to the Revenue Commissioners who acted as agents for him.  The Bill also proposes to increase fines from the levels fixed some time ago and includes a number of other technical adjustments to improve the effectiveness of the collection service.</P>
    <P>The bovine disease levies which were introduced in 1979 under the Bovine Disease (Levies) Act required the farming community to make a financial contribution to the cost of the disease eradication programmes.  Under this Act, <i>inter alia,</i> a levy was imposed on all cattle slaughtered in the State, on all live exports and on each gallon of milk delivered for processing.  The current rates of levy are £7.30 on each animal slaughtered or exported live and 1.3p on each gallon of milk delivered.  The cost of the programmes is some £67 million and farmers contribute £28 million annually by way of levies towards the costs other than those relating to administration.  The Exchequer carries the balance and the cost of administration, the cost of the latter being in excess of £20 million.</P>
    <P>Under the Bovine Disease (Levies) Act, 1979, responsibility for the collection of levies was given to the Revenue <Col N="1357" /> Commissioners in respect of live exports.  On the completion of the Single European Market, most Revenue personnel were withdrawn from the export points and alternative administrative arrangements were put in place to collect levies on live exports.  The proposed amendments do not involve any extension of the levy arrangements or any change in the rates of levy. Instead they are essentially of a technical nature and provide for a proper legal basis for the payment of levies on live exports by exporters to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry rather than to the Revenue Commissioners who under the 1979 Act were appointed as his agents.  Nevertheless, I expect that I will be seeking the approval of the House for reductions in the rates of levy when the revised arrangements to which I have adverted have been agreed. However, such reductions can be made by way of regulations under the 1979 Act which have to be approved by both Houses.</P>
    <P>A number of technical adjustments are also proposed to improve the supervision and inspection of the levy system. In particular, it is proposed to extend the definition of an accountable person to include a person by whom or on whose behalf an animal is being exported from the State, to remove the exemption in regard to the keeping of records by a person by whom or on whose behalf an animal is being exported and to provide for the inspection and removal of such records by an authorised officer of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for increased maximum fines on summary conviction for offences under the disease levies legislation from £500 to £1,500.</P>
    <P>I am also taking this opportunity to increase the maximum fines in respect of certain offences under sections 48 and 49 of the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966.  These fines were last increased from August 1979 under section 23 of the Bovine Diseases (Levies) Act, 1979. The proposed increases are from £500 to £1,500 in respect of a summary conviction, from £2,000 to £10,000 in <Col N="1358" /> respect of a conviction on indictment for specified offences and from £1,000 to £5,000 for other indictable offences.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased with the cordial, constructive and positive nature of my discussions with the IFA, the ICMSA, ICOS, Macra na Feirme and the IVU today.  Without pre-empting their decisions, it was generally recognised that my proposals represent the most radical restructuring and overhaul of the TB scheme in the past 40 years.  The proposal to reduce the levies on beef animals from £7.30 to £2.50 and to reduce the levies on a gallon of milk from 1.3p to a half penny will mean an immediate net saving to farmers of £4 million.  In addition it is proposed to abolish pre-movement compulsory testing which presently costs farmers approximately £4 million.  These measures are indicative of a new thrust in the scheme where farmers will have to take responsibility for TB in their herds in the same way as they would in case of other clinical diseases such as mastitis or BSE.</P>
    <P>Instead of dealing with a monolithic scheme, State bureaucracy, red tape, inspectorates and testing restrictions, farmers will have to make sure they do not bring the disease into their herds. That is the shift I am seeking to bring about.  At the same time I am seeking to decentralise the public sector pay and negotiation aspect of the scheme into the private sector so that farmers will have the same relationship with their vets as they have with their accountants, solicitors and merchants.  We now have a great opportunity to modernise veterinary practices and I believe farmers and others will agree that this is the only logical way to proceed.</P>
    <P>On the effectiveness side, I have taken stern action on wildlife.  In future there will be farmer participation where licences are obtained and multiple licences will be granted.  I wish to pay tribute to the Office of Public Works for its assistance in the bilateral talks and for ensuring that the projects in east Offaly will be extended to other areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1359" /> On the question of non-specific infections, these are single reactors in individual herds.  I am aware that some farmers were not able to trade for a year because of a false positive test.  In future such farmers will be able to trade following one clear test where the disease pattern and history facilitate such a change.</P>
    <P>These changes have not been easy to achieve.  I wish to say a profuse thank you to my officials who worked intensively over the past four months and put forward what I regard as acceptable proposals.  It is almost impossible to get two people at a meeting on TB to agree but the measures proposed provide a basis on which to deal with this problem over the next three years, starting on 1 February next year.  It is also proposed to establish a mobile quality control unit which will move into black spot areas and carry out targeted quality testing in a focused way.  I appeal to all interested parties to engage in earnest dialogue with my officials over the next two weeks.  I am determined to proceed with the scheme and a decision is required by Christmas.  I hope Opposition Deputies to whom I furnished data earlier today will have time to reflect on these proposals.  I will be happy to provide them with briefing material on any of the complex issues.</P>
    <P>This debate gives us a timely opportunity to address the fundamental reorganisation of the entire scheme.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>This technical Bill, which has been introduced because of the completion of the Internal Market, proposes to put on a legal basis the new system for the payment of disease levies on cattle exported direct to the Minister rather than as heretofore to the Revenue Commissioners who acted as agents for him.  The increase in the fines will enable the Minister to deal with some of these technical matters.  The Bill gives us an opportunity to discuss the proposals the Minister has brought forward today.  I obtained a copy of <Col N="1360" /> these proposals only after I asked for it yesterday evening.  It is important that we look at the deterioration in the TB eradication scheme, much of which has been of the Minister's own making.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken over his Minister of State's role in negotiations with the IVU for changes in the eradication scheme.  I raised this matter on 29 June as a way of putting it back on the rails. I pointed out that we were not advocating the <i>status quo</i> but were concerned that the partnership approach was not evident when the Minister took personal charge of the negotiations.  In reply the Minister of State referred to the need for the Minister's intervention prior to the ballot, which of course hardened attitudes and probably ensured its defeat.  This may have been the Minister's intention all along &mdash; and I am not sure if it was &mdash; but his attempt to speak to the veterinarians over and above their union executive did nothing to improve the prospects of the agreed solution which was on the table if it had been properly handled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the reasons it was not properly handled was that the Minister was probably the sole and most vociferous advocate of the EU situation he had inherited.  A major condition in drawing down EU funding for the TB eradication scheme, according to Deputy Deenihan, was the &ldquo;primary requirement that the testing of one third of the herds nationally would be rotated over the next three years&rdquo;.  Evidently this was a gaffe, as nowhere in the proposals brought forward by the Minister today is there a reference to rotation testing. Obviously the Minister recognises that in the absence of a partnership approach it is not possible for him, to use his own words, to bring the veterinary profession &ldquo;not only into the 21st century but drag them out of the 20th century&rdquo;.  The pauline conversion to the partnership approach, which the Minister is now seeking to indicate, was not evident in his previous efforts to ensure confrontation.  The Minister saw himself as the man on the white horse who would deliver to the EU and would <Col N="1361" /> ensure that testing of one third of the national herd would be rotated.  It may not have been his own preference.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnConnor" hpid="Mr. Connor Mr. Connor">

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is debatable, but I will discuss it later.  The Deputy has obviously gone off the law and order tack, which was a very slippery slope, and he is now coming back to matters on which he might have some more competence.  I will not be disrupted by the Roscommon beagle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The deterioration in the TB eradication scheme is the Minister's sole responsibility and any efforts he makes to mend his fences will be welcome.  The Minister's reference in his speech to a partnership approach is the first instance I have seen where he understands that improvements will only be brought about on the basis of agreement with everybody involved.  His advocacy of rotation testing was on the false assumption that a soft test was being conducted for many years by veterinarians.  That prejudice against the professionalism of the veterinarians has been proved to be unfounded, not by my assertion in this House but by the fact that spot testing carried out by departmental staff indicated that private veterinarians identified a higher incidence of TB reactors in the national herd. That is conclusive evidence that the assumption that lay behind the attack on members of the Irish Veterinary Union was unwarranted.  The Minister was wrong in seeking to continue with that tack.  As long as he was behaving in that way he was gaining great kudos from those who were paying for the scheme.  Obviously the Minister made the political calculation that there are far more farmers than veterinarians &mdash; I see him nodding in agreement &mdash; and for that reason he decided that if someone is to be blamed for the inadequacies in the TB eradication scheme, it should be the veterinary union.  However, he failed and continues to fail to tackle the <Col N="1362" /> one area under his control, the acknowledged prohibitive cost of administering the scheme which is one third of the cost of the scheme.</P>
    <P>In outlining his new approach the Minister suggests that an assessment of the administrative costs will form part of the strategic management initiative. This is under the direct control of the Minister but no decisions have been taken on how to reduce these costs.  Too often the rhetoric does not meet the reality.  The Minister has come forward with a new approach, and he has some very welcome ideas on epidemiology and how to improve the comparative tuberculin test which has served us well since the mid-1950s in terms of reducing the incidence in the herd from 33.3 per cent to a minimal 0.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>Many involved in research in this area have been highlighting that the lateral spread of TB should not be regarded as the primary source of TB infection in the national herd.  There is a need for more accurate testing and confirmation as to whether we have been getting false postitive to false negative results in the national herd so that we achieve the eradication of the disease and maintain our disease free status.  Our consumers at home and abroad need to be reassured that we are trying to eradicate TB from the national herd.</P>
    <P>In the new approach outlined by the Minister the only figures mentioned are those that will receive an immediate positive political reaction.  Under compulsory aspects of the scheme&mdash;fine detail introduced by the Minister&mdash;he stated farmers will pay only £10 million and that under the present arrangements, farmers pay some £28 million a year under disease levies.  Veterinary surgeons and others will have many questions to ask about the deregulation of the scheme if what the Minister outlined today are simply proposals. However, it is clear from parts of his speech that he made decisions, irrespective of consultations.</P>
    <P>The Minister welcomed the contribution of farmer representative organisations to the partnership approach, but <Col N="1363" /> hopes the measures proposed will meet with the approval of members of the veterinary profession, obviously because he has not had a similar level of consultation with them as with the farm representative organisations.  There is a political element to the Minister's approach that may not be dominated by the question of the eradication of TB from our national herd.  The hallmark of this Minister has been to assuage the vested interests who cause him the most trouble or can give him the best press. He may laugh and dismiss what I am saying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimmyDeenihan" hpid="Mr. Deenihan Mr. Deenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Veterinary Union acknowledged that a number of its proposals relating to non-specific infection and epidemiology have been included in the scheme proposed by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I already indicated that on first reading I welcomed some of the proposals.  Obviously, the proposal not to lock up a herd for two tests in respect of non-specific infection would be welcomed by all farmers.  In doing so we should not contribute to the spread of disease, but that is a scientific and epidemiological consideration beyond my <Col N="1364" /> competence.  We would welcome agreement between the Department's technical staff and members of the Irish Veterinary Union on that matter.  I have already pointed out that there is agreement on the inadequacy of the comparative tuberculin test.  The test used to detect the level of incidence of one in three is now required to detect the level of incidence of approximately 3 in 1,000 and, therefore, must be more scientifically based.</P>
      <P>I have never gone on record as approving the <i>status quo</i> in this regard. I am concerned at people belatedly seeking to obtain a partnership approach when such an approach was available at all times.  When a decision was made on a proposal, a Minister committed to consultation was not prohibited from re-entering negotiations for the purposes of resolving the problem, but that did not happen.  The loss of confidence in the scheme by one of the major participants did not bring credit to the Minister who merely referred to a confrontational approach.  He appears to be surprised at the cordial meeting he had today with the IVU, but in the interest of being courteous to a Minister, some of them may have held their tongues.  The Minister's blunt messages in the past few months would not cause anyone to be cordial towards him and the recent spot tests carried out by the Department proved that it could not detect a higher level of incidence than veterinary surgeons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must get away from the politicking on this matter in the past six months.  While the Minister may have made short-term gains it is easy to recognise the political astuteness of his proposals about farmer participation at local level and so on.  I do not have a difficulty in that regard.  It was farmer participation, with committed staff in the district veterinary offices, who did not always receive the finance or resources one would expect from the Department, that enabled the east <Col N="1365" /> Offaly project to be a success.  However, that is an observation in defence of those involved in the project which may be inaccurate.  The east Offaly project is sufficient evidence to enable the Minister to make certain decisions.  The proposals he outlined will allow him carry out further assessments and verification of what happened in the east Offaly project.  That project stands on its own merits.  From the representations I made about the project, I am aware of the level of Office of Public Works reticence to go down this road in identifying the causal link between diseased wildlife and disease in cattle.  Efforts to improve the relationship between the Department and the Office of Public Works would be welcomed.  For obvious reasons, the Minister may not publicly admit that the east Offaly project shows that in TB blackspot areas there is a causal link between diseased wildlife and disease in herds.  In some cases up to 40 per cent of diseased badgers were taken out of areas which resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of TB in herds.  I live near the Rahan area where many of those problems arose.</P>
    <P>Rather than carrying out further studies, decisions should be taken.  I hope some of the aspirations put forward to compromise with the Office of Public Works on this matter will not mean a delay in similar, more focused and better resourced projects in other blackspot areas.  The continual existence of diseased badgers appears to take precedence over the livelihoods of farm families.  Lovers of wildlife should recognise that there is ample scientific evidence to suggest that intensive eradication of diseased wildlife in TB blackspots would not affect the badger population.</P>
    <P>The Minister said in the appendix to his proposals that many studies have been made of the badger population. The idea that the badger may in any way be at risk by confronting the issue <Col N="1366" /> in those TB blackspots areas is totally unfounded.</P>
    <P>The Department indicated before the publication of this document that this issue would be confronted in a more immediate way than is being suggested. I encourage the Minister to ensure that whatever compromises reached with the Office of Public Works are not a bluff or a deferral of dealing with this matter and to ensure that areas like east Offaly, which were affected by bovine TB in the past&mdash;they have improved quickly due to the uniqueness of that project&mdash;are not deferred on the basis of further consultations and assessments of the project.  This project showed the farmers in the area were correct in suggesting it was not a bovine to bovine spread but that the wildlife, especially the badger, had a major impact on the level of bovine TB.  The issue should be addressed urgently.  I am concerned with the area of these proposals, although I only had a peremptory and preliminary look at them.  There is a greater movement of cattle here than in any other EU country, which is the reason there had been a need for many pre-movement tests.  Is it correct that a 30 day pre-movement test will not be required for movement of cattle here unless they are for live export?</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no compulsory pre-movement test if the animals pass the one year test.  However, if a farmer is exporting live animals within the EU, there is a 30 day export search.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Since we have more internal movement of live animals than any other country and have test days.  I am not convinced this provision will solve the problem.  I can see how popular such a proposal would be but I am concerned it will not ensure the disease free status of our herd and I will need to get further advice on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnEllis" hpid="Mr. Ellis Mr. Ellis">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether this will work or not is open to question.  Deputies involved in the cattle trade, like Deputy Ellis, may have more to say on this matter.  That struck me as a weakness in the arrangements and I need to be convinced we are not going too far in seeking to accommodate the interests of sellers without putting buyers at risk.</P>
      <P>I welcome some provisions of the Bill, such as the D restriction involving non-specific infections.  It has been a great injustice that the infection of one animal has meant that two clearing tests were required for the rest of the herd and the holding up of the sale of cattle from that herd, especially when subsequently no lesions were found on the animal concerned.  We will withold judgment on what is proposed.</P>
      <P>I would like an indication from the Minister on whether these are propossals.  It had been suggested that a two week period will elapse to allow the people involved to make their observations on this matter.  It is clear from the level of consultation with the farmer representative bodies that the Minister secured agreement with them on that matter before it was published and that is not surprising.  The professionalism and commitment of other people has been questioned by the Minister on numerous occasions, without justification.  He did so on the basis of a simplistic analysis of what has happened with the TB eradication scheme, given that there has been a low level of incidence that the disease can remain latent in shedding and elsewhere over a number of years and be reactivated, the high levels of movement in our cattle and that they have had to deal with a comparative tubercular test which served us well when the incidence of TB was higher.  Too much criticism has been laid at one door without justification.  The Minister's spot testing in the Department did not give credence to his side of the case in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State at the <Col N="1368" /> Department, Deputy Deenihan, for giving us that information at Question Time.  The Department usually operates on the basis of giving us the minimum but at least we got that much from him publicly.  The information showed that spot testing was less severe and that there were not as many incidences of infection as the veterinarians operating the scheme had said.  I await their detailed consideration of this matter. Deregulation, the farmer-veterinarian link, the impact this will have on small veterinary practices and to what extent the farmer will be paying over and above the non-compulsary aspects must be carefully examined.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to farmers paying £10 million under this new proposal. Since this scheme was run by the State, they have had to pay £28 million in levies towards its cost.  There is no indication from the Minister's proposals as to how much he thinks will have to be paid directly to the veterinarians.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>Now we know the level of savings.  The Minister said his proposals will lead to a 64 per cent reduction in the payment of levies, which is correct.  However, he does not outline what the direct reduction will be between the payment of levies and veterinarians which is a new charge in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill gives us an opportunity to confirm that the Minister has relented <Col N="1369" /> on rotation testing.  He cannot introduce changes which do not involve some modicum of co-operation with the veterinary union.  It also proves the idea that the Minister needed rotation testing for getting EU funding was based on a false premise because he says he is confident of drawing that funding down. He has not confirmed, despite being asked at Question Time and elsewhere, that the level of rotation testing in the national herd in the third and fourth phase this year was no more than 3 per cent.</P>
    <P>In replying to an Adjournment Debate question raised by myself, the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Deenihan, confirmed that one third of the national herd would have to be tested on a rotational basis over the following three years.  The Minister is saying he is confident of drawing down that £4 million and subsequent money from the EU for the TB scheme this year although we know that rotational testing does not involve more than 3 per cent of the national herd.</P>
    <P>The Minister also indicated at Question Time last week, when his proposals were well nigh completed for today's meetings, that he did not rule out rotation testing for the following phases of the herd&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">

      <P>I would like to go through that in greater detail, possibly at Question Time.  Will the Minister explain how it is that the only rotations that took place were in the third and fourth phases and they only account for 10 per cent of the national herd?  That would mean they were tested twice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I gather that is not what the Government is taking on board. There is urgent need to address the area of victim support.  The Irish Victim Support Group do excellent work on a voluntary basis.  Initially it received <i>ad hoc</i> funding but that has been strengthened <Col N="1371" /> in recent years.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was the first Minister for Justice to give it the level of funding required. Such groups are badly needed to offer support to victims of crime.</P>
      <P>I tabled questions recently to the Minister for Justice.  We all recognise that violent crime is escalating at an alarming rate but the Minister is not prepared to grasp that nettle.  On 3 October 1995 I drew the Minister's attention to the fact that Dublin city is experiencing more extreme levels of violence in terms of weapons used in committing crime, for example, knives, hammers, guns and so on.  I asked the number of offences committed daily over the last six months and was told that the information is not readily available.  On 9 November 1995 I asked the number of people charged with offences who availed of bail, on a monthly basis, from January 1995 to date.  The Minister replied that court statistics are not maintained in that way.  As regards the level of crime, in 1965 it was 9,000; in 1975, it was 26,000; in 1985 it was 52,000 and in 1993 it was 55,000.  Over 100,000 crimes were reported in 1994.  That is over 300 a day.  In most cases the perpetrators walk from court as the prosecution cannot prove its case.  In every one of those cases there is at least one victim, that is 100,000 victims who pay in one way or another.</P>
      <P>Under our criminal justice system the State acts on behalf of the victim to vindicate his or her rights and the victim expects it to do so, professionally, efficiently and sympathetically.  If the State fails the victim is disillusioned. Victims are expected to act as witnesses for the prosecution when it suits their purpose.  For the prosecution it is run of the mill but for the victim it is of the utmost importance and a new experience of how the system works.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister not to play politics on this issue and to accept the principle and spirit of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and the debate.  It is an important issue to which we will return as soon as the Government concludes its studies on the matter.  I disagree with Deputy Callely that there is an element of politics in it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, said it was important and helpful legislation and that Deputy O'Dea has much to contribute in the area of criminal law reform and victim support.  Bills on these areas are welcome.</P>
      <P>I wish to concentrate on one aspect of victim support which is lacking in the Bill, the position of children in the court system.  In comprehensive legislation on victim support, I thought there would be a reference to children.  We all agree that children are often the most vulnerable sector of society and most in need of legal protection&mdash;victims in the real sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1991 Child Care Act reformed matters somewhat to include representation on behalf of children in care proceedings but, unfortunately, it is unclear as to the extent of the powers and functions of the representor and how best the position and views of the child might be expressed.  The question as to how the views and wishes of children can be represented to courts is a difficult, complex and problematic matter which I hope we can debate with a view to Government and the Legislature formulating a resolution.  It is essential where a child is unable because of its age to provide adequate instruction that a device is available to provide for the child's interest.  In some recent cases judges have made orders allowing for separate representation for children but unfortunately it is unplanned and haphazard because it depends on the circumstances of each case and on the absolute discretion of the sitting member of the Judiciary.  In the area of child representation I regret that we appear to be in breach of the Convention on <Col N="1373" /> the Rights of the Child, in particular Article 12 which states that a child shall be provided the opportunity to be heard in any judicial and administrative proceedings affecting the child, either directly or through a representative or appropriate body in a manner consistent with the procedural rules of the national law.  Ireland is a signatory to this convention and we are obliged to comply with it, yet we ignore it.  That is something we should redress.</P>
    <P>Many of our statutes specifically refer to the rights and wishes of the child, for example, guardianship of infants, adoption, child abduction and child care and so on.  Yet too often children are unable to become directly involved in proceedings which have huge consequences for their welfare and well-being.</P>
    <P>In cases where courts have appointed representatives, the legal profession must address the sad reality that it is not used to this concept, has little training in this area and needs guidance.  The best interest of the child must be contrasted with the best wishes of the child.  This is complex and difficult at the best of times but it is something which we as legislators have not addressed in the legislation passed in recent years.</P>
    <P>Many recent reports have addressed the matter of child representation.  Perhaps the most noteworthy was the large report of the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.  An interesting report was presented by Mr. Cormac Corrigan and Ms Catherine Forde of the Coolock Law Centre and another by the Law Reform Commission on consultation, reports, child sex abuse and rape.  The Law Reform Commission considered the concept of the guaridan <i>ad litem</i> but decided against its introduction in criminal proceedings on behalf of a complainant as &ldquo;it would tilt the constitutional balance in favour of the prosecution&rdquo;.  While not crossing swords with the Law Reform Commission.  I would like to see more <Col N="1374" /> research and debate before agreeing with it on that point.</P>
    <P>The guardian or child advocate would protect the child from improper cross examination, ease the stress and trauma of courtroom proceedings and ensure greater co-ordination between the civil and criminal arms of our judicial system. The commission acknowledged that the role and function of the guardian are still very much at an infant stage in the United States and in other jurisdictions. It is an area to which I believe we should give greater and ongong consideration.</P>
    <P>The child in care proceedings is always a victim and requires victim support as a top priority.  The courts under our constitution are the ultimate protector of civil rights and must be given the power to ensure the rights of the citizen are at all times adequately met.  In recent years we have heard much about constitutional protection for the unborn. We have seen legal representation for the unborn in the many SPUC cases which have gone through the courts, yet I regret we are unclear as to the role, function and application of legal representation for persons already born, namely our children.</P>
    <P>The concept of a child services agency in legal matters, as proposed by the Coolock Community Law Centre in a recent report and by the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, is worthy of support.  There are huge difficulties in a child instructing its legal representative &mdash; the basic lack of understanding being the major stumbling block.  Despite the Child Care Act's application to children and a number of care cases where children have been represented by being made party to the proceedings, there are no firm guidelines or satisfactory procedures in place.  A child does not have an automatic guaranteed constitutional right to legal representation so any application depends on the discretion of the presiding judge.  Some have been granted.  It is <Col N="1375" /> not proper that such fundamental decisions affecting the welfare and wishes of the child should be determined on a case by case or a piecemeal basis.  Amending legislation to establish a proper procedure for child representation, in essence child victim support, is necessary in the overall response to this Bill.  I would like to hear the Minister for Health or the Minister for Justice comment on this point.</P>
    <P>While a huge body of our statute law specifically refers to the rights and interests of children being paramount and receiving primary consideration, there is no proper vehicle to ensure their views and wishes are adequately presented to a court before a decision affecting their future is taken.  Time will not permit me to look at the situation in other jurisdictions, but many western countries have established a system where the child is separately represented in court proceedings affecting its welfare.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a professional child care agency to be given the task of taking overall responsibility for the provision of independent and separate legal representation for all children. This body would provide a panel of guardians <i>ad litem</i> for the courts.  The Government should develop a relationship with an appropriate body, perhaps the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, to establish proper practice guidelines.  That body would also engage in the preparation of court officers and clerks in this new departure in our judicial procedure.</P>
    <P>At present, under the Child Care Act, we appear to have the worst of both worlds with provision for representation in our statute but no guidelines or practice, accepted or otherwise.  A child care agency would ensure that all involved have a high level of skills and are properly trained, whether they are guardians or legal advocates on behalf of the child.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1376" /> The agency would supply the guardians for the duration of the legal proceedings.  The role of the guardian would not be the same as the State social worker &mdash; the difference being that the guardian would appear and act for the child only, whereas the State social worker, as Members will be aware, deals with the extended family. The guardian would represent the child only and would be independent and accessible.  To gain the confidence of the public, the agency could be a service attached to the Department of Justice with its own budget and managerial functions.  I would see the guardian as someone whose expertise is in the child care area rather than in the legal area and where the interest and welfare of the child would be first and foremost at all times.  The guardian would be obliged to inform the court of the child's wishes irrespective of the fact that they might differ from what the best interests of the child may be.</P>
    <P>Children are always the victims in care proceedings where decisions are made regarding their future, often without any form of consultation.  A child care agency concerned solely with protection and representation of children is essential if adequate and proper protection is to be afforded and if the risk to which children in care disputes are exposed is to be minimised.</P>
    <P>I welcome Deputy O'Dea's Bill as an important step in focusing our minds on the area of victim support.  I accept what the Minister said last night about waiting and perhaps incorporating points made by Deputy O'Dea into more comprehensive legislation.  By focusing on children, I have given the Minister of State, the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan and the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, an opportunity to come to the House to respond to the points I made.</P>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>The speakers I heard welcomed the Bill because it <Col N="1377" /> focuses our attention on an area that is usually forgotten when it comes to crime, particularly high profile crimes which are only a small element of those committed each day.  High profile crime seldom affects the victims Deputy O'Dea has in mind in this Bill.  This is an opportunity to provide for the forgotten victims of crime.  I was always taught there are three parties affected by crime: the Judiciary, including the Garda, the person accused and society. It is only in recent years we have accepted that a fourth party affected is the victim.  Victims were seldom considered and in that respect I welcome the Bill, but Deputy O'Dea will agree it does not go far enough.</P>
      <P>Victims have been largely ignored in the current debate on increasing crime levels.  There is no doubt that measures are needed to redress the imbalance between victims and perpetrators.  I hope the Bill will focus attention on the issue.  There are two aspects to the treatment of victims following crime: court procedures, which they are forced to endure, and the issue of compensation not only for physical injuries but also, ideally, for pain and suffering inflicted by the crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially this Bill provides for a charter of rights for victims of crime something to which the Government, in its programme, is committed.  I look forward to publication of such a charter. While I welcome the intentions behind the Bill, it has not been properly thought out.  Although the Bill is deficient, this does not mean the issue of victim support should be put on the long finger, and from listening to contributions to this debate I am sure that will not happen.  In his speech last night the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, addressed some of the improvements and support services for victims.  While I welcome them, they do not go far enough and Deputy Flanagan has just outlined an entire area that deserves <Col N="1378" /> special attention in any future legislation.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal in particular has proven to be a blunt and unresourced instrument with which to address victims' needs.  Waiting times are excessive and compensation, when it is finally paid, is often paltry.  As matters stand, victims are put through a lengthy and bureaucratic process before receiving compensation under the scheme and, even then, they can expect to receive only out-of-pocket expenses. With removal of the pain and suffering clause a few years ago, a shattering blow was dealt to victims' rights to proper compensation.  At the time there was much protest in that regard.  I hope that matter will be dealt with in the forthcoming legislation.</P>
    <P>Today there is a two-tier system of compensation.  While members of the Garda Síochána, whose claims are dealt with under a separate scheme, may receive substantial pay-outs not only for injuries but also for trauma suffered, such compensation is denied to civilian victims.  Since the Garda scheme was established its members have received more than £10 million in awards.  In one case it is reported that a garda received £1 million.  Nobody disputes the right of the gardaí to appropriate compensation. They are in the front line, protecting us from the mob, and are increasingly the targets of unscrupulous armed thugs. However, innocent members of the public are also caught in the criminal firing line.  The time has come to introduce a comprehensive and unbureaucratic system of compensation which ensures that all victims of crime, whether civilian or members of the Garda, receive compensation not only by way of out-of-pocket expenses but for the considerable trauma they may have suffered.</P>
    <P>My home was burgled on one or two occasions, but it is little comfort to have sufficient insurance to replace the items taken.  What is needed in those circumstances &mdash; burglary in ones absence is <Col N="1379" /> one of the lesser crimes &mdash; is recognition of the violation.  Victims need understanding and someone to listen to them, but they seldom find that in their immediate family because they too are victims.  I hope the current review addresses these discrepancies and makes recommendations on how they can be remedied.  I am confident the Government will address these matters and I will continue to raise them, as I am sure will other Deputies, until they are addressed.</P>
    <P>This Bill, although extremely well intentioned, addresses many of the issues only superficially.  However, I understand the reasons for that.  I have not had the experience of being in Opposition but people who have been have referred to the difficulties in drafting Bills because of a lack of the necessary back-up services.  I am sure that matter will be considered at some stage.</P>
    <P>Many of the issues covered in the Bill have already been dealt with in legislation.  The rights and needs of victims of sexual offence have been comprehensively addressed and will continue to be addressed.  I made representations about that and much has been done in that area by this and previous Governments.</P>
    <P>In the past, victims of crime were considered as peripheral to the prosecution case.  They were merely witnesses, and distress caused to them by court proceedings was often dismissed.  In many cases of burglary or mugging the charges are dropped without informing the victim.  Sometimes victims are informed of it by the person accused of the crime.</P>
    <P>Many deficiencies have been remedied in recent years and Deputy O'Dea's proposals, if implemented, would simply overlap existing law. However, I am concerned about the wider implications of the Bill.  Under section 2 (a) victims of crime have a <Col N="1380" /> right to be consulted about pre-trial procedures.  They would also have full access to the investigating member of the Garda on making a written request. This goes too far in one area and not far enough in another.  Under the Bill there is no right of access without a written request and with a written request there is unlimited access which would place extra strain on an already overstretched Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the provision that victims must be informed when the perpetrator has completed the sentence.  While that would be understandable if threats were made by the perpetrator to the victim at the time of sentencing.  I would be worried about it in all cases.  I appreciate the intention behind the proposal but it would have unforeseen consequences for both victim and offender.  I hope that any similar proposal in future will be thoroughly examined before being implemented and that appropriate safeguards will be introduced.</P>
    <P>At present the State prosecutes suspected perpetrators on behalf of society. It is the State's duty to ensure that the guilty are convicted and the innocent acquitted while protecting the individual citizen and vindicating the rights of victims.  The concept of the State as prosecutor is central to our criminal justice system.  If the proposals in this Bill were accepted the victim would, to an extent, become the prosecuting agent. This shift in emphasis would, unless carefully handled, prejudice the right of alleged offenders to a fair trial.  I use the term &ldquo;alleged&rdquo; advisedly since we retain the concept of innocent until proven guilty.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea's Bill has triggered debate in this house and I hope it will trigger a wider debate.  Few people have been unaffected by the rise in crime rates and there is an understandable feeling of anger at the plight of victims who feel marginalised.  This Bill is not the best way to address the victim's <Col N="1381" /> needs.  Those needs, however, must be addressed and I hope the Government will lose no time in introducing appropriate legislation.</P>

        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Tréaslaím leis an bhFreasúra as ucht an Bille seo a thabhairt os ar gcomhair. Tuigim go bhfuil sé deacair nuair atá tú i do Theachta Dála ar an dtaobh eile Bille a thabhairt isteach nuair nach bhfuil na comhairleoirí agus na dlíodoiri agat atá le fáil ag na hAirí.</P>
      <P>Tuigeann An Teachta O'Dea é sin mar bhí sé ina Aire Stáit bliain ó shin nó mar sin.  Tá an-mholadh tuillte ag an Teachta O'Dea atá ag obair go dian dítheallach anois fé mar a bhí sé nuair a bhí sé ina Aire Stáit.  Tá brón orm nach bhfuil glactha leis an mBille ach táim cinnte go mbeidh Bille níos fearr againn amach anseo.</P>
      <P>It has become part and parcel of life to worry about the victims of crime.  Are the criminals getting away with minimum sentences?  Are they getting away lighter than their victims?  It is frightening for old people &mdash; they must lock their doors at night because they fear being attacked.  My heart goes out to people in their 70s and 80s who are beaten by thugs.  In their heyday some of those people might have been the strongest and toughest men in the country.  They might have been able to take on these thugs singlehandedly and beat them black and blue.  However, in their late seventies and eighties they are victims.  One sees photographs of such people dreadfully beaten by thieves for the sake of stealing a few pounds.  It is a shocking way for old people to end their lives; indeed, the shock of what they have to endure often does end their lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the other end of the scale, young people going home at night can be set upon by equally young thugs.  Recently, such an incident occurred in Carlow and a number of people ended up in hospital, one with serious head injuries. <Col N="1382" /> These people will settle down afterwards and continue to enjoy themselves as young people should.  However, the memory of being attacked that night by young thugs must always remain with them.  Rape victims, too, have to endure the memory of an ordeal.</P>
    <P>Even people who come up to Dublin to shop and have their handbags snatched endure quite a shock.  The other night I was talking to a person whose car had been stolen while she was visiting friends.  The shock of coming out and finding the car stolen &mdash; the property inside the car was not insured &mdash; was not helped by the thought that young hooligans were driving it around fields on the outskirts of Dublin.  That is no consolation for somebody who has suffered the loss of a car.</P>
    <P>The victims of crime suffer such trauma that we must take more positive action.  We should support the Garda with all available resources and the gardaí should be more visible.  It is strange that people can come to towns such as Carlow which is 50 miles from Dublin, do what they like there and get back safely to Dublin.  They all appear to arrive at the same location on the Carlow side of Dublin.  It is amazing that there is no system whereby the gardaí can be there before them, anticipating what is happening, when there is a telephone system.  The Garda should have more power and more cars to follow up reports of stolen cars, break-ins and so forth when they have a fair idea of where people are heading.</P>
    <P>The cost of counselling is high but on the other hand, psychological counselling for victims of crime is very important.  We have to be able to talk to them.  The Irish Association of Victim Support has done much to help such people on a voluntary basis.  Although their grant has been increased from £18,000 to £130,000 it is marvellous value for money and they should receive more.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> The Bill has been faulted by the Minister.  I always feel sorry for Opposition Deputies who introduce Bills because it is not easy to get everything perfect. However, there are difficulties about the wording and its meaning.  The fact that the Government is introducing a charter for victims of crime might be consolation for Deputy O'Dea in view of the work he has done.  The foundation he has laid will be incorporated in the Government's planned charter.  I congratulate Deputy O'Dea on introducing the Bill.  It is marvellous that he is prepared to give time to this type of work.  He need not feel discouraged by the fact that it has not been accepted by the Minister and he can take consolation from the fact that it will be the foundation for a good Bill in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Dea on introducing this Bill.  It is unfortunate that the Government will not support it.  While, on the Deputy's admission, there are omissions in the Bill, the effort he made in drafting it and bringing it before the House is to be commended.  Having listened to Government speakers it is fair to say that there is a consensus that the spirit and general content of the Bill are readily acceptable.  It is unfortunate that the Bill cannot be accepted and amendments introduced at a later Stage.</P>
      <P>Crime is rampant; it is a growth area not just confined to particular urban areas which, heretofore, we have always associated with violence, crime and unemployment.  It has become widespread and middle class areas which until now did not suffer from crime are finding out that in the late 1990s nowhere is safe.  They are not simply crimes of burglary, car theft and robbery; they are violent crimes, one need only look at the newspapers to read about them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parts of the city are not safe to drive through at night because of organised <Col N="1384" /> crime.  Criminals who control their patches lie in wait for unsuspecting motorists.  Even with central locking on many cars criminals will steal a coat or bag from the back seat.  Locking one's car at junctions does not prevent attack. Bars and hammers are used to break the back windows of cars.  Old women, in particular, are put at serious risk by such crime, which is organised by criminals who work in packs.  The danger of such attacks causes some motorists travelling home late at night merely to slow down at red traffic lights and, if there is no approaching traffic, to drive through them.  That poses a risk to unsuspecting motorists approaching that junction who believe they may drive through it when the lights are green.  Crime has a number of knock-on effects that must be addressed by way of legislation.</P>
    <P>This Bill goes some way towards helping the victims of crime.  For too long legislators liked to be seen to be protecting the rights of the accused.  Perhaps we have gone too far in that direction.  When legislating on crime we are always looking over our shoulder for fear of infringing somebody's civil liberties, but that can be taken too far.  The Garda need more support and successive Governments have not introduced the requred legislation.</P>
    <P>Shoplifting has become a serious problem in Kilkenny in recent times and this has been attributed to individuals travelling to the city on the Dublin train. Shopkeepers send individuals to the railway station to check if suspected shoplifters are arriving and, if so, they notify the major stores that they should beware and have their properties and stock well protected.</P>
    <P>This Bill introduced by Fianna Fáil proposes to enshrine in legislation some protection for the victims of crime.  The right to be consulted by the prosecution about any pre-trial procedures is a fair provision.  How often have we seen individuals who may have witnessed a particularly nasty assault brought into <Col N="1385" /> court, which they consider hostile surroundings particularly if they have not been in court before.  Such witnesses see a number of gardaí, members of the legal profession, consultations taking place and find the atmosphere intimidating.  Seeing the justice wearing a wig and gown does nothing to allay the fears of witnesses who may be coming forward to give evidence because they believe that is their civic duty.</P>
    <P>This Bill provides that each victim of crime should be given the right to free legal advice in respect of any trial at which the victim shall be a witness for an indictable offence involving violence or the threat of violence as a result of which the victim suffers physical or mental injury.  While we all have seen at firsthand injuries inflicted as a result of assault, the mental injury involved is difficult to quantify.  We have neglected to help the victims of crime in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that each victim of crime shall be entitled to counselling for the psychological effects of a crime involving violence or the threat of violence as a result of which the victim suffers physical or mental injury.  Such a service will be provided by the State without charge.  Too often victims who may have held down a job may be unable to work as a result of crime. They may not have a medical card and may have to pay their medical expenses. The State has an obligation to provide for such services.  If the State had sufficient resources and legislation in place to help the victims of crime, perhaps the problem would be alleviated somewhat.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that where an accused is being tried for an offence which has resulted in mental or physical injury to a victim or a number of victims, an impact report on each victim who has so suffered shall be furnished to the trial judge who, when deciding the appropriate penalty, shall take into account the effects of the crime on the victim.  It is important that we are aware <Col N="1386" /> of what type of evidence the prosecution intends to bring forward.  There should be an obligation on the defence and the State's counsel to make as much evidence as possible available to the victims of crime prior to going to court. The defence will have its team and witnesses well tutored but, unfortunately, that does ot apply to victims of crime. When the State brings a case against an individual, the victim appears to be left on the outside.</P>
    <P>Crime has been an ongoing problem. As legislators, all we can do is improve the legislation and assist the authorities by giving them more resources, not necessarily in the form of throwing money at the Garda.  We need to address the overall problem and deal with it in an educational and social context.</P>
    <P>When in Opposition politicians invariably focus on the problem of crime and use it as a stick with which to beat the Government to drum up public support.  For several years all parties have agreed that something must be done to tackle the serious problem of crime.  When in power the Government, particularly the Fine Gael Party, is inclined to find excuses for not putting in place what it promised when its members sat on the Opposition benches.</P>

      <P>A number of voluntary organisations is doing good work for victims of crime but the statutory authorities, the Government, are not supporting them in the way they should. We have made a start, our spokesman on justice introduced a Bill but the Government will not support it which means it will die.  The Government will <Col N="1389" /> be out of office before it brings any legislation forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Effectively we are doing our part for victims of crime.  The Garda authorities reported recently that less than one in three crimes are detected. Last year over 100,000 indictable crimes were reported.  It is generally accepted that all crimes are not being reported. Out of 125,000-130,000 crimes the detection rate is one in four.  That is a disgrace and more resources will have to be put into these areas.  Assistance must be given to the victims of crime because if only one in four is detected a huge number of people are getting away scot free.</P>
      <P>The programme, <i>A Government of Renewal</i>, promised a review of the victims of crime and a charter for victims of crime but I do not think such a charter would serve any useful purpose for those who have already suffered as a result of criminal activity.  I compliment Deputy O'Dea on bringing this legislation forward but I am disappointed the Government will not support it.</P>
      <P>It is laughable that the Minister for Justice made a statement earlier in the year that a referendum, which would allow a change in the bail laws, would take place on the same day as the divorce referendum.  She was quickly disowned by her partners in Government &mdash; Labour and Democratic Left &mdash; who said they had not been consulted and that, perhaps, the Minister was premature in mentioning this issue.  They complained in great detail as to why they could not agree to it.  The referendum on divorce is on Friday next and there are no proposals to deal with the bail laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some months ago Deputy John O'Donoghue outlined the problems and the figures relating to crime.  He said <Col N="1390" /> that crime figures show that the number of offences committed by people on bail has been on the increase since 1990 and that had been about 2,500 such crimes. This figure had almost doubled, to 4,500 last year.  This, in itself, shows the urgent need for changes in the bail law.  The Criminal Justice Act, 1984, which provided that an individual who committed a crime while on bail would be given a consecutive sentence did not have any effect and since 1990 the trend has been increasing.  Is the 1984 Act being enforced by the courts?</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Constitution, as defined by the O'Callaghan case in 1966 and the Ryan case in 1989, bail can only be refused by a court if it can be shown there is a probability that the accused will abscond or will interfere with witnesses.  It will have to be changed so that a judge can take into account the probability that an accused person will commit another crime if granted bail.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue has published the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, to change Article 40.1 of the Constitution.  I accept there are civil liberty concerns but we can overplay this card.  A change in the bail laws would have to be made in conjunction with new court procedures.  The operation of the courts will have to be examined sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>If the Government is serious about tackling crime, it will have to bring forward legislation soon.  The public is fed up with politicians making wild allegations about putting more money into the Department of Justice, providing more resources to the Garda and the prisons and yet the crime rate continues to escalate.</P>
    <P>Rural Ireland is awash with drugs, thus increasing the problem of violence associated with the drugs problem.  In the past the drugs problem was only in Dublin, perhaps in Limerick, to a lesser extent, and Cork.  There is no small town which has not been affected by the <Col N="1391" /> scourge and abuse of drugs.  There is a knock-on effect where drug abusers have to feed their habit by acts of crime in order to get money.  The major party in Opposition brought forward legislation which would assist the victims of crime but the Government, because it did not consider it timely &mdash; in fact it was embarrassed &mdash; will not support it.</P>

      <P>The Government's commitment to the law and order problem associated with crime can only be changed by the introduction of the necessary measures. I am disappointed the Government is not supporting the Bill.</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Crime is pervading our society; irrespective of whether it is a small town or one of our largest cities. It has a demoralising effect not only on the people who have the task of enforcing the law but on society in general and even more so on the victims of crime.</P>
      <P>Let us look at an area of Cork city in recent times.  Every night we read of three and four cars speeding on the roads racing each other and the crashing and burning of those cars at the end of the day.  The people in that part of the city cannot do anything about it.  They put their hands to the high heavens and ask what is becoming of our city.  Where is the law and order?  Where is the enforcement?  How can we control these people who are running rife in our city and giving our area a bad name?  Old people travelling on buses to our towns and cities have their handbags snatched and are being attacked in their own homes.  As a result, they live in fear. They constantly demand public lighting on their streets and do not see any point in having a neighbourhood watch system in operation when criminals can still break into their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our young people are the prey of the <Col N="1392" /> drug barons, pushers and others who are the scum of society and little is being done about the problems.  Such people continue to act against the law and yet seem to be above the law.</P>
    <P>How do the members of the Garda Síochána feel about this crisis?  Any garda will say that morale in the force was never lower.  A contributory factor is the staff cutbacks.  Of the latest batch of recruits from Templemore, only one was assigned to Cork city. Complaints were made recently that despite the two barracks in Cork city, only one patrol car was available with one garda to operate it.  In two areas of the city, the patrol car was unable to be used because only one garda was available.  When a call came into the station that a crime had been committed, the garda on duty had to say he could not send out a patrol car because, due to staff cutbacks, nobody was available to man it.  Gardaí cannot attend to the duties for which they are being paid and that is unacceptable.  There is a crisis of confidence in the law and in the administration of justice.  That leads to a lack of respect for the gardaí and our law institutions.</P>
    <P>In the Circuit Court in Cork, there is an automatic right of transfer.  It is a well known fact that people before the courts in Cork who are well known to the gardaí and the judges will be given more severe penalties.  The solution to that problem is for the accused to exercise his automatic right of transfer and the case is listed for hearing in Dublin. He subsequently travels to Dublin on the train with his legal representative and witnesses for both sides and the State is expected to pay for everything. The case is mentioned in court and put back for perhaps 18 months during which time he may commit further crimes.</P>
    <P>I compliment Deputy Nolan for outlining some of the disasters currently befalling this State.  This Government is great at building walls.  It built the <Col N="1393" /> mighty wall in Luggala which cost £2 million; it will cost £1 million to dismantle it.  We also have the wailing wall in Roscrea.  County Roscommon which does not even have a door on it &mdash; it is wide open.  Does the Government expect people to kneel down and pray when they go there or wail at the wall and say they are sorry?  The action the Government is taking amounts to nothing.</P>

      <P>In his opening contribution, Deputy O'Dea admitted there are drafting difficulties with the Bill but he wanted the Government to agree to the basic principles in it.

      <P>That being said, I commend Deputy O'Dea for bringing this Bill before the House.  He has done good work in presenting us with the opportunity of debating this measure. Judging by the contributions I have listend to, there is universal concern about the manner in which victims are treated in our society.  Every Member of this House would sympathise with victims and we are all anxious to ensure that the maximum legal, financial and moral support is given to all those who have been victims of crime.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, until recently, there was not any organisation which concerned itself with addressing the problems experienced by victims of crime. We are often portrayed as a society more concerned with penalising offenders, with prison conditions, as I was, and so on.  We should remember the words of Christ to his disciples when he admonished them for having fallen asleep during his agony in the garden. There was a degree of imbalance in the way our society responded to its needs and that must be redressed.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay a sincere, heartfelt tribute to the good work undertaken by Victim Support in recent years.  Its founder, former Garda Sergeant Derek Nally, was General Secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors in the 1970s and 1980s.  He and I met regularly at debates and seminars and discussed the position of offenders, their victims and prisoners generally.</P>

      <P>I rememeber him saying when he retired from the Garda Síochána that his main objective was to establish an organisation to support the victims of crime.  While I was fully supportive of his ambition I was moving out of that sphere and would have liked <Col N="1396" /> to have been involved to a much greater extent than proved possible.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important that there be that type of voluntary organisation and personnel who provide advice, listen to people's problems, inform victims of relevant court procedures, of their legal entitlements and so on.  This group, representing the victims of crime, has been recognised by the State and was given a contribution last year of £130,000 for its operations.  That represented a considerable improvement since the organisation had received no State subvention for the first two years following its establishment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is great need to stress the provisions of section 3 which deal with information to be provided by the Garda Síochána.  Too often a victim is not informed of what is happening to his or her case, does not know which member of the Garda is in charge of it, whether the accused has been charged, is on bail or in custody and whether he or she will have to appear as a witness. Neither do they know when their case will be taken, or whether it will be deferred.  That causes them tremendous anxiety and stress and sometimes leads to real terror.  While recognising that there is a rather generalised code of practice in existence for the Garda it is time we underpinned it statutorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not for the first time has Deputy O'Dea entered this arena, having been very involved in the Criminal Justice Act, 1993, the provisions of which dealt with many of the issues before us.  For example, it empowered the courts to award compensation whenever a victim has suffered personal injuries or loss and allowed for the payment of compensation in the case of a victim, with <Col N="1397" /> dependants, who died.  That Act permits a court to make a compensation order in lieu of a penalty or fine, taking into account the effects of a violent attack on a victim or where such was threatened. That fact must be taken into account when imposing a fine.  In fairness to Deputy O'Dea, he is seeking to extend those provisions.</P>
    <P>I support many of the provisions of this Bill and hope the Minister will bear them in mind when compiling a package to aid the victims of crime.  However, I have problems with the very wide definition of the term &ldquo;victim of crime&rdquo; in section 1 which states:</P>
    <P>....&ldquo;victim of crime&rdquo; means any person or persons who have suffered harm of any kind including physical or mental injury, emotional suffering, economic loss or substantial impairment of their capacity to function within the community, through acts or omissions which are in breach of the criminal laws of the State and includes, where appropriate, the immediate family or dependants of such persons.</P>
    <P>That is an idealistic, all-embracing definition which, for that very reason, renders it unrealistic legislatively and will have to be considerably tightened up.</P>
    <P>I have a problem also with section 2 (a) which specifies that a victim shall have the right to be consulted by the prosecution in regard to any pre-trial procedures.  I suggest that a better word would be &ldquo;informed&rdquo; by the prosecution.</P>
    <P>In the policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> the Government, as part of its agreed policy, promised a charter of rights for victims of crime and the Minister is committed to this.  We should develop all our services for the victims of crime, voluntary or those already provided for in legislation and produce a code of practice, including one for the Garda Síochána, which will <Col N="1398" /> statutorily underpin victims' rights in law.  I await such developments which will ensure a substantial package of statutory proposals to protect victims, give them something more than mere lip service or sympathy which is not sufficient.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and commend Deputy O'Dea on its introduction.  It is worthy of an airing and, I hope, will bring closer the time when we shall have the promised Government proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and compliment Deputy O'Dea on its preparation.  I am disappointed that such a Bill was not introduced earlier when Deputy O'Dea, serving as Minister of State at the Department of Justice, was afforded such an opportunity.  However, better late than never.  Victims of crime do not have rights, everything is weighted in favour of the criminal or perpetrator of such crimes.  When I was in Westport courthouse recently endeavouring to contact a solicitor, a young man of approximately 18 was brought in, handcuffed to two prison officers.  The judge pointed to a jacket and asked him &ldquo;is this yours?&rdquo; to which he replied, &ldquo;it is&rdquo;.  The judge was about to return the jacket to him when he discovered it contained £300.  The sergeant suggested that the money was part of the proceeds of a crime the person in custody committed in Westport.  That person had been brought from Mountjoy Prison in a van, accompanied by two prison officers and a driver, to the Castlecourt Hotel and given a fine meal at taxpayers' expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why the court could not have held it was his jacket, removed the money, returned it to the owner and sent the young person to prison.  I collected a message for the victim from an old person in Dublin and went to his home at 10 o'clock at night.  The doors were bolted and I could hear a dog inside barking.  I was told to go away.  The owner was terrified because <Col N="1399" /> in the past criminals travelled to Westport in high-powered cars, committed crimes and departed in the middle of the night.  What happens to criminals who are caught?  They are brought to Mountjoy, then to Westport to have dinner in the Castlecourt Hotel.  That is not justice.  What happens to the poor victim who was attacked?  A few weeks ago I parked my car at Lower Mount Street: my side window was broken and my car phone stolen.  I was shocked to discover that this had happened.  I was not hurt but I can imagine how bitter a person who is assaulted and left injured on the street must feel.  There are too many do-gooders in this country, and I am sick and tired of them.  I want to see legislation to put criminals behind bars, not just for a few hours from Friday evening to Monday when they can come out well fed, washed and shaved.  I want to see justice done.</P>
    <P>I would like to compliment the victim support group in County Mayo and take this opportunity to thank them for the wonderful work they have done.  Any new legislation should require a Garda Síochána to notify local victim support groups when a person is injured in a violent crime.  The group could then write to the victim informing him that the service is available.  Victims could decide for themselves whether or not they want help.  The Government has increased the allocation of funding for victim support groups from £18,000 to £130,000, but £.5 million would not be too much to expect and it would be money well spent.  It is a very small amount of money compared with what it costs to keep people in Loughan House or Mountjoy Prison or to bring a criminal from Westport to Dublin, from Dublin to Westport, to dine and wine him and bring him back to collect his jacket.  That is not law and order and we are crying out for these criminals to be dealt with.  People have to feel that they <Col N="1400" /> can walk down the street without being assaulted or becoming a victim of crime.</P>
    <P>I am glad we are now thinking about the victims.  It is time we provided support for them.  If something happens to a decent citizen he will have somewhere to go for advice on his legal and medical rights and get whatever support he needs.  For far too long the law has been on the side of the criminal and that must stop.</P>

I am satisfied that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, will bring in a charter of rights for victims that will stand up in court.  Victims are an extremely important group who are often forgotten.  Old people are afraid to stay in their homes.  This was a problem in Cork 12 months ago when we were canvassing for the by-election.  It has not arisen as suggested earlier.</P>
      <P>Recently in my county two aged people, a brother and sister, had to leave their home following a second robbery and move into a town which was alien to them because of their background.  Now they have to get a cab or a good neighbour to bring them out to their farm at least twice a day.  We as a nation cannot allow this kind of thing to continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not just the old who suffer.  Shopkeepers and people who own cars are robbed.  A shopkeeper I know in Monaghan town who was removing valuable property from his shop before locking up, discovered that while he was locking the doors his goods were stolen from the boot of his car and the hooligans <Col N="1401" /> responsible got away in a high-powered car.  At the weekend a pub was robbed and people were lucky not to be injured by the weapons the robbers had.</P>
    <P>The main issue relates to personal crime and those who suffer from being beaten up, from sexual attacks etc. Imagine the trauma a young girl or woman goes through if she is the victim of a sexual crime.  That woman is a victim and the trauma can stay with her for years.  We have heard more and more revelations of such crimes in the last few years.  The victims worry about how their cases are being dealt with, when they will be dealt with and if the Director of Public Prosecutions will actually allow a case to be taken.  This lack of information and anxiety about how the Garda Síochána and the DPP will deal with such victims has to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The work of the Irish Association for Victim Support has already been commended.  I want to support the comments made by my colleague, Deputy Ring.  In 1993 this group got only £18,000.  This year they got £130,000.  In the context of the overall budget this funding must be increased dramatically. The voluntary efforts of this group are absolutely vital.  I know from comments I have heard from victims that their help has been invaluable, much more beneficial than that of the Garda Síochána and others, not because the Garda do not want to be helpful but because their uniforms sometimes put people off.</P>
    <P>The issue of prisoners must also be dealt with.  I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for Justice regarding the provision of extra prison spaces for juveniles.  The release of many long-term prisoners as a result of the peace process must leave much more space available.  It is easy for the Opposition to talk about Castlerea, but this is not the only way of solving the prison issue.  The Government is right to look long and hard at the type of prison it provides there or elsewhere.  We must <Col N="1402" /> make sure that prisoners are not victims for life but are rehabilitated at the earliest possible date.  This can be of help to victims as well because the victim does not necessarily want to see a person in prison for life.  If the person gets a reasonable punishment for the crime, the victim is happy to see him rehabilitated.  We must try to improve the situation in regard to what is called the revolving door syndrome which has been in existence for many years and did not just start in December last year or January this year.  In this way victims and the public generally can be sure that where crimes are committed justice is seen to be done.</P>
    <P>There is a need for proper vigilance in so far as older people and those living in rurual areas are concerned but there is a danger of creating a perception that gardaí should be mainly deployed in areas of high population.  It is important to ensure that rural areas are also properly policed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Shea, announced that the existing controls on smoking in certain places would be strengthened and extended.  The new controls will apply from 1 January next year and the restrictions on smoking in restaurants will be extended further from 1 May of that year.  He said there was now an unanswerable case to extend the ban on smoking in pubs.  Under the new regulations, from 1 May next year all restaurants which meet ventilation standards must designate 25 per cent of their seating for non-smokers while all other restaurants will have to set aside 50 per cent of the seating for them.  At present restaurants are obliged to have a non-smoking area but the number of <Col N="1403" /> seats has been left to the discretion of proprietors.  Many owners of restaurants and pubs have carried out alterations to their premises in an effort to accommodate their customers and deal with the anti-smoking feeling which is now prevalent.  These new proposals will create many problems for the owners of restaurants.</P>
      <P>The Minister's proposals are a continuation of a process which began in 1988 when he introduced the Tobacco (Health Promotion and Protection) Act which prohibited the consumption of tobacco products in certain areas.  These proposals will be well received by the medical profession but if the Minister is really serious about protecting the health of the public he should impose a ban on tobacco advertising.  The public has become very health conscious in recent years and smoking is no longer allowed in many homes.  The case against using tobacco is easy to make and while the relevant facts in Ireland are not fully known the British ones make startling reading.  According to the British Government, every year 111,000 people die from smoking, 26,000 of these die from lung cancer while the remainder die from other diseases caused by tobacco.  For every 1,000 smokers in Britain, one will be murdered, six will die in road accidents and 250 will die prematurely.  The loss of 111,000 customers each year is a problem for the tobacco industry which seeks to replace them by advertising. Almost all adults who smoke began smoking before the age of 20.  For that reason tobacco advertising is directed at teenagers and children, the only age groups in which the number of smokers is not falling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of smoking to the country is enormous.  While this has never been properly quantified, all one has to do is visit a hospital to see the number of patients being treated for tobacco related illnesses.  The cost to industry is also enormous.  The Government has used price regulations, health warnings, a prohibition on smoking in certain <Col N="1404" /> areas and restrictions in other areas to deal with the problem.  While these measures are generally welcomed by the public they do not achieve the necessary results.  This has given rise to a game where, on the one side, the Government introduces anti-smoking measures while, on the other, the powerful and wealthy tobacco industry engages in sexy advertising campaigns.  Advertising is big business for the tobacco industry. Last year the industry in Britain spent more than £100 million in advertising. It claimed that it was simply promoting brand switching but, as we know, people cannot be persuaded to change brands if they have not already been persuaded to start smoking.</P>
    <P>A ban on tobacco advertising is not a new concept; it has already been implemented in a number of countries where the results speak for themselves. For example in New Zealand it resulted in a 7.5 per cent reduction in tobacco consumption, a reduction of 6 per cent in Canada, a reduction of 7 per cent in Finland and a reduction of 8 per cent in Norway.  I do not want to ban smoking as I know some people love to smoke, they live for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Deputy for raising this very important matter and welcome the opportunity to outline the policy in this area.  I am very much in favour of a total ban on tobacco advertising.  This position has also been adopted by successive Ministers for Health in the discussions by the European Council for Health Ministers over many years.</P>
      <P>The European Commission wants to introduce a Union-wide ban on tobacco advertising.  Its draft proposal was first brought forward in 1989 and modified in 1992 following consideration by the European Parliament which suggested a number of amendments but expressed its support for a total ban on smoking. Since then the proposed directive has been examined at eight of the twice yearly meetings of the Council of Ministers of Health and it will be examined again at next week's Council meeting.  A majority of member states support the Commission proposal, but unfortunately, it is opposed by a sufficient number to form a blocking minority.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the German Presidency of the Council tried to break the deadlock by submitting a compromise proposal which did not go as far as the Commission proposal.  However, it did not command sufficient support.  Similarly, the Spanish Presidency has put forward a compromise proposal for next week's Council meeting which would ban tobacco advertising in all media which cross national boundaries within the Union, for example, publications which are distributed in more than one member state or broadcasts which can be received in more than one member state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's position has consistently <Col N="1406" /> been to support the Commission's proposal.  We will, of course, be happy if some form of compromise proposal can attract sufficient support to break the deadlock and we will certainly encourage the Commission and other member states to explore all the possibilities in this regard.  Given that we will hold the Presidency of the EU during the second half of 1996 we will have a good opportunity to influence the search for a solution if one has not been found by then.</P>
    <P>I have outlined in some detail the position at European level as it is essential for Deputies to understand that there are limits to what we can do at national level in the absence of similar measures elsewhere, particularly in the UK.  We already impose substantial restrictions on tobacco advertising &mdash; I will refer to these in detail later &mdash; and we will further increase these next year. However, a total ban on tobacco advertising would cause major difficulties given the colossal over-spill in Ireland of newspapers, magazines and broadcasts from other countries.  In practical terms we would only be able to implement a ban in respect of media originating in this country.  This would discriminate strongly against Irish newspapers and other publications which are already enduring very tough competition from British titles.  For that reason, the ultimate solution must be a total ban in the context of similar action throughout the European Union as a whole.  We will continue to pursue that goal as long as there is any prospect of achieving it.  I believe that such a prospect still exists.</P>
    <P>I would not like to give the impression, however, that we are powerless in relation to tobacco advertising.  While, as I have explained, a complete ban is not advisable if it is on a unilateral basis, I must stress that the existing controls are quite restrictive. We restrict the content of advertisements and the types of magazines and <Col N="1407" /> newspapers in which they can be published and we do not allow them on radio or television.  We limit the total advertising and sponsorship expenditure of the tobacco industry.  They have not been allowed increase their annual spending in real terms since 1985, and I announced earlier this year that I am imposing a 5 per cent cut in the limits for the year 1996.</P>
    <P>The whole area of discouraging smoking is one of the biggest priorities of both myself and my Department.  It is central to the achievement of the targets in the health strategy.  It is a battle which is being waged on many fronts.  Two weeks ago I launched a new, hard-hitting anti-smoking advertising campaign. Yesterday I launched the health boards' campaign, in association with RGDATA, to tackle the problem of under-age purchases of cigarettes.  I also announced details of the major extensions of the restrictions on smoking in public places, including in particular the new arrangements for restaurants, and I signalled my intention to have discussions with the Licensed Vintners' Association on the position in pubs.</P>
    <P>It will be clear to the House that, as far as tackling smoking is concerned, there is no shortage of either effort or imagination on our part.  When it comes to a ban on advertising, however, I hope I have helped to clarify the importance of community-wide action rather than an isolated measure on our part.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I comment on the case I wish to raise I want to make a declaration of interest.  I have no interest of a financial or other nature in this case but my law firm has on one occasion in recent years represented a young man who alleged he was sexually abused by a priest and secured damages <Col N="1408" /> as a result, and the firm currently represents another young man who is making similar allegations.  Neither of those cases relates in any way to the matter I raise in the House this evening.</P>
      <P>This matter arises from an article in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> which is being followed up by the daily newspapers.  It refers to a Limerick priest who apparently settled a case for a sum allegedly between £20,000 and £30,000 upon an allegation being made that he sexually abused a 12-year-old altar boy.  I read the reports in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> with a mixture of great sadness and great anger.  The sadness arises from discovering yet again that we have another such case and another victim.  I feel a great sadness for the vast majority of priests who are very good people doing very substantial and important work within their communities throughout the country.  My anger derives from the fact that following these instances becoming known a Garda investigation of some description was conducted, no prosecution was brought and the priest was simply moved into other parishes. So we read in the newspaper.  We are told in the context of the newspaper reports he received some degree of counselling.  From my experience in this area mistakes have been made in the past by the church, who having discovered that a priest was engaged in such conduct, arranged that counselling be provided and then allowed him to return to work in another community.  I dearly hope we will not discover that in this particular instance there have been further incidents involving this individual.  I have no reason to believe to date that there have been.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of serious questions arises and the health board and the Garda authorities are involved.  Will the Minister for Health tell us the nature of the contacts the relevant health board had with the church authorities when it learned of these allegations?  Will the Minister for Health tell us the nature of the health board's contact with the Garda authorities?  Will the Minister tell <Col N="1409" /> us about the nature of the investigation conducted by the Garda authorities and the date a report was made to the Director of Public Prosecutions?  Will the Minister explain why no prosecution was brought?  This is the third such case to come to light in the past 12 months where damages have been paid but no prosecution brought.  In the context of the cases we have learned about, I think I am correct in saying it is the third such case where, following allegations of such nature having been made some years before damages were paid, we have discovered that a priest has been moved to another diocese.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister say if the health board has taken any action in such cases to ensure that matters are monitored in the new parish to which the priest is assigned so as to ensure other children are not at risk from such behaviour? The health board has a specific duty to protect the welfare of children.  The Department of Health shares that duty, as do all Members of this House.</P>
    <P>Child sexual abuse is the most horrific, traumatic experience that any child can have and results in many victims of such abuse suffering deep hurt and anguish and psychological damage which they take with them into adulthood.  It is not good enough that damages are paid, matters are covered up and people are shifted around the country as if they are participating in a game of musical chairs without our being assured that other children are not at risk.</P>
    <P>It is my understanding that the Director of Public Prosecutions, for whatever reason, decided in this case, as in the other two, that no prosecution should proceed.  I ask the Minister to talk to his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to request the Garda Commissioner that further Garda inquiries be conducted into this particular case with a view to a new report being furnished to the Director of Public Prosecutions so that he can reconsider the original decision.  I am <Col N="1410" /> very sad to note that it was only as a result of the publication of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> on Sunday that the priest concerned was withdrawn from parish work.  It should not require matters of this nature to be disclosed by the press for the appropriate authorities, be they church or State, to take the necessary action to ensure that children are not placed at risk.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity to inform the House that the Mid-Western Health Board has in place an arrangement with the Garda authorities in the mid-west region whereby a designated Garda inspector is available in each Garda division to liaise on child abuse matters with designated officers of the health board.  This arrangement has been in place for a number of years and I know that the board enjoys very good co-operative relations with the Garda. A number of joint training initiatives have been undertaken between officers of the board and Garda personnel.</P>
      <P>In relation to the specific case raised by the Deputy, I understand from the Mid-Western Health Board that the position is as follows.  In February 1990, the Mid-Western Health Board was informed by a family doctor of allegations made to him by the family of a young boy against a named priest.  The board's staff met the family and considered that the matters reported warranted assessment.  The diocesan authorities and the Garda were informed by the board of the allegations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The family consented to an assessment of the boy in August 1990 but he did not present for assessment at the time.  Between July and September 1991 a formal assessment process of the boy was completed which indicated that inappropriate activity did take place. The appropriate therapeutic services were offered to the boy but he did not accept them immediately.  However, subsequently he and his family did avail <Col N="1411" /> of the support services of the health board.</P>
    <P>In May, 1993 a formal statement of complaint by the boy was made to the gardaí.  As soon as the health board became aware that the boy was prepared to make a formal statement of complaint to the gardaí the health board again contacted the gardaí with all the information available to it at that time. In early 1994, the board was informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions had decided not to initiate proceedings in the case.</P>
    <P>In April 1994 the board made its file on the case available to the family's solicitor and subsequently prepared a victim impact report in connection with contemplated civil proceedings.</P>
    <P>In November 1994 it came to the notice of the board that the priest had transferred from Ennistymon to Galway city.  The gardaí and the Western Health Board were informed of this.  The staff of the Mid-Western Health Board maintain close and continuing contact with the boy and his family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My dissatisfaction about this matter arises from the steering committee's report on higher education.  In 1994-95 there were approximately 3,600 students in Cork regional technical college, representing 10.2 per cent of the regional technical college-DIT sector.  The proposed increase of 4,600 for the year 2000-01 represents a reduction to 9.4 per cent of that sector and the proposed increase of 4,800 for the year 2006-07 represents a further reduction to 9.1 per cent.  If the institutions in the areas included in the committee's terms of reference for special review &mdash; Mayo, Tipperary and the south east and Dublin regions &mdash; are excluded, Cork regional technical college will suffer the second highest percentage reduction in the sector for the year 2000-01 and the highest reduction <Col N="1412" /> for the year 2006-07.  Furthermore, as a result of the report Cork regional technical college will be demoted from its current leading position in the regional technical college sector.  It will take second place next to Waterford and will be almost on a par with Galway regional technical college.  The Minister is aware of the excellent standards at Cork regional technical college and surely must consider this undesirable.</P>
      <P>Cork regional technical college is unable to meet current student demands and is the most difficult college in which to obtain a place.  In 1995 the number of leaving certificate points required for applied chemistry courses in Cork was 345, for Tralee it was 205 and for Waterford it was 300.  The number of entry points for biology was 365 for Cork, 235 for Tralee and 300 for Waterford.  The number of points for computing was 340 for Cork, 205 for Tralee and 270 for Waterford.</P>
      <P>First preference applications for diploma and certificate courses show that Galway and Waterford regional technical colleges got 67 per cent and 55 per cent, respectively, of Cork's regional technical college's 8,211 first preference applications.  In 1993-94, 3,441 students from Cork city and county enrolled in regional technical colleges, but 1,030 were unable to obtain a place in Cork. Even though their first preference was Cork, they had to travel to other regional technical colleges to do courses.  In 1995 the Cork college was unable to offer places to more than 3,000 applicants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Students from Cork city and county are severely disadvantaged compared with their counterparts in other regions and parents must bear the cost of sending them to neighbouring colleges in Tralee, Waterford or Limerick.  Statistical data supplied in reply to a parliamentary question I tabled last year showed that approximately one-third of the students who enrolled in the Tralee regional technical college came from the Cork area.  Why, therefore, allocate £20 million or £30 million to Tralee regional <Col N="1413" /> technical college when there is a crying need to increase the number of places in Cork?</P>
    <P>Cork University will also suffer severely as a result of the report, its share of the university sector will reduce from 17.1 per cent in 1994-95 to 16.4 per cent in 2006-07.  Rather than improve the position, if the steering committee's recommendations are adopted by the Minister, Cork students will be further disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>In reviewing regional needs, I understand the technical working group was required to pay particular regard to requests and proposals for expanded higher education facilities in the south east.  Tipperary and Mayo and the adequacy of the provision of such places within the Dublin area to meet the needs of socially and economically deprived areas.  Those areas were the subject of extensive review by the steering committee but the Cork region was not earmarked for special study.  The disadvantaged suffered because the question of students seeking entry to Cork regional technical college was not on the agenda.</P>
    <P>As the Minister is from Cork, will he ensure that a special case study of student needs in the Cork area &mdash; in the university or the regional technical college &mdash; is carried out?  If that does not happen, many more students will have to go to universities and regional technical colleges elsewhere and that would be unfair to the student body crying out for places in Cork.</P>

      <P>The Government is dealing with the report and recommendations submitted by that steering group.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to respond to the Deputy and to clarify the position regarding the future development of the higher education sector.  I assume the Deputy is referring to the report of the Steering Committee on the Future Development of Higher Education established by the Minister for Education under the aegis of the Higher Education Authority to advise her on the development of the higher education system.</P>
      <P>Higher education has changed dramatically in the past three decades. A fourfold increase in student numbers has been accompanied by a significant structural change leading to a far more complex and diversified system. The brief of the steering committee was to chart developments in higher education over the next 20 years with particular reference to the projected future growth of the system and the financial implications of this growth, the projected disposition of growth between the university and extra university sectors between qualification levels, as well as regional needs addressing in particular proposals for new or enhanced facilities in the greater Dublin area, Counties Waterford, Mayo and Tipperary.  The Deputy can see that County Cork was excluded in the terms of reference given by that Government.  The brief also covered participation in higher education by disadvantaged, mature and second chance students.</P>
      <P>The work of the steering committee was supported by a technical working group whose report was published in January 1995 and was based on detailed investigations by the technical working group, including a comprehensive analysis of demographic trends and projections.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> The steering committee, representing a wide range of interests connected with higher education, undertook its own detailed deliberations following receipt of this report which provided it with crucial data and analysis to underpin them. It also took account of submissions received from interested parties.  The finalisation of the report was informed by, and took account of, the policy directions of the White Paper on education.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware of the Government decision of 13 September, 1995, to create 6,200 additional places in the university sector at a cost of £60 million.  These additional places will be allocated among the seven universities, including University College Cork, over the next five years and will be funded through matching funds from the public and private sectors.  This is the result of an initiative by the universities to commit £30 million of funding from private sources to capital development in their sector over the next five years.  The Government decisions ensure the State will match the funding of £30 million over the same period.</P>
    <P>The creation of additional student places is a positive move by the Government in meeting the projected growth in the third level student numbers as outlined in the report of the steering committee on the future development of higher education.  The Minister is particularly satisfied that the creation of these additional student places will greatly improve the opportunity for increased participation in third level education.</P>
    <P>The Government has, as part of the national development plan, already approved a capital investment programme of £120 million for third level education for the period up to 1999. Some 75 per cent of this funding will be financed by a non-payable grant from the European Regional Development Fund with the balance being sought by way of an EIB loan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1416" /> The current position is that the report furnished by the steering committee is now being examined in the Department together with the Higher Education Authority's recommendations on the matter.  When this examination is completed, the necessary decision will be made, having regard to the available resources.  Pending this, I am not in a position to indicate what specific action will be taken in any area.  The role of Cork regional technical college and the development of industry and commerce in Cork and its performance over the years since it was set up will be recognised.  Rather than talking down its role, both I and the Government will support its futher development.</P>

I acknowledge the difficulties involved, as a contractor in the project went out of business and there was also the subsequent legal and technical difficulties that attached to the bonding and the position of the bondsman.  I hope every possible effort will be made to resolve the matter at the earliest opportunity.</P>
      <P>I received correspondence from the Minister for Education last Friday to the effect that work would commence on Monday, 20 November.  It seems unsustainable that work on basketball courts could go on while rainwater seeped into classrooms.  I saw at first hand the frustration and anger of parents when that work seemed to be given higher priority than work on the classrooms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> What is the position regarding a number of subcontractors and when may they be expected to commence work on the building?  I refer especially to electrical and roof work and window and heating maintenance.  What about the future of the building?  This is a big project welcomed by the people of Mountmellick when it was first announced.  The overall cost of the work was estimated to be approximately £2 million.  However, much of that welcome has worn thin because of the huge delays in dealing with these matters.</P>
    <P>These renovations were designed for a community school of 350 pupils. However, there are currently 415 pupils enrolled in the school.  This is a good school which has always had a good name and I hope it will continue to cater for the educational needs of the children of north Laois well into the next century.  What plans does the Department of Education have for the two upper floors in the building and for what was the convent building?  What extra work outside the original contract has been arranged and how much will this cost?</P>
    <P>Work began last Monday.  Has the Minister placed a target date for completion of it?  I ask this because of the most unsatisfactory situation for arts and home economics students.  These pupils are not in a position to avail of facilities other leaving certificate students have.  There has been a huge disruption of examination classes in both of these subjects and I ask the Minister to ensure the contractor completes this work at the earliest opportunity and to take a personal interest in this matter.  It has gone on for too long. It has been said that the legal and technical difficulties have been resolved.  It is now nearly Christmas and the situation has still not been clarified to the satisfaction of those involved.  It is totally unjustifiable to have the school facilities in turmoil while the school year proceeds.  I hope the Minister will see fit to reply to letters issued to her by the <Col N="1418" /> parents council on both 10 November and 21 November.  It is important that the widespread disillusionment throughout the town is dispelled, which is why I have requested permission to raise these concerns in this House.  It is a serious matter.  The school has a good name in north Laois.  The Government is committed to funding the school and I ask the Minister to take an interest in the case to ensure the sub-contracting work will proceed at full steam in December and January with as little time off as possible for Christmas festivities.  The students cannot be denied access to art and home economic facilities.  They are due to sit the leaving certificate examination next June and it would be unfair to place them in such a disadvantaged position having regard to the high level of stress and trauma experienced in sitting examinations.  I look forward to action being taken at an early stage.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this important issue.  I understand the frustration of the pupils in that area and if I am unable to answer any question he raised tonight I will give him the information tomorrow if he calls to my office.</P>
      <P>The contract for major refurbishment works to Mountmellick Community School was placed in July 1994 and the builder commenced on site in August that year.  It was intended that work would be completed by 21 April 1995. On 11 April 1995 the Department received written notification from the project design team that the main contractor had not made payments due to the sub-contractors.  Two days later the Department called an urgent meeting with the design team at which it became clear there were serious difficulties with the project.  The main contractor has not been on site for some weeks and, because of non-payment, the sub-contractors had ceased work.  It would have taken ten weeks to complete the project.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1419" /> Following consultation with the Chief State Solicitor's office and numerous written and oral communications between the design team and the contractor requesting a resumption of work, the Department formally notified the contractor on 22 June 1995 that his contract had been terminated.</P>
    <P>As the House will appreciate, this is a serious course of action and one not taken lightly by the Department. Despite the inevitable delays that would result the Department was left with no alternative particularly when it transpired that the contractor's company had gone into voluntary liquidation.</P>
    <P>Before signing a contract it is the normal practice of the Department of Education to require the building contractor to become party to a performance bond indemnifying the Department against financial loss because of non-compliance with the terms of the contract. Under Government contract procedures performance bonds are an absolute requirement for contracts above a certain value.  If for some reason, as in the case of Mountmellick, the original contractor is unable to complete the contract or adhere full to its provisions the bond becomes operative and it is then the responsibility of the bondsman to finance and arrange for completion of the work.</P>
    <P>Such a bond was taken out in the case <Col N="1420" /> of the Mountmellick school project and following termination of the contract the bondsman was instructed to make the appropriate arrangements to complete the outstanding works.  The Department's intention was to ensure the building would be ready for the beginning of the school year in September.  Unfortunately, due to a complex series of legal and other difficulties that arose as a result of termination of the contract it proved impossible to adhere to this timetable.  These difficulties have been resolved and the replacement contractor is on site.  Nominated sub-contractors have also been appointed and will be on site within a matter of days when the replacement contractor and the design team have agreed a programme of works.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that since the problem with the contract arose the Department has made every effort to minimise disruption at the school.  The Department's main objective continues to be the speedy completion of the work and I am confident this can be achieved in the near future.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Flanagan for raising this important issue and hope his frustration and worries and those of the pupils, teachers and parents will be dealt with as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 23 November 1995.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 34 together.  The decision I announced in Shannon Airport on 24 October, 1995 assigning full responsibility for the promotion and marketing of Shannon Airport to Aer Rianta required Government approval.  I obtained that approval on the morning of 24 October.  I immediately tried, without success, to <Col N="1277" /> make telephone contact with the Chairman of Shannon Development, Mr. Michael Punch.</P>
      <P>On my arrival at Shannon Airport, I spoke privately to Mr. Paul Sheane, Chief Executive of Shannon Development and told him of the announcement that I would be making at the function then being held at the airport.  At my request, one of my senior officials spoke privately to Mr. David Hogan, Chief Executive of Shannon Airport Marketing and informed him of the position, before I made my address to the function.</P>
      <P>In my address, I reviewed a total package of measures for Shannon.  In addition to announcing the new marketing arrangements for the airport, I also announced that at my request Aer Rianta had developed a new airport charges discount scheme under which there would be no charges at Shannon for a period of two years for new traffic or new services.  I also publicly welcomed the Aer Rianta plans for significant upgrading of the airport terminal facilities, which are the subject of a separate question today.</P>
      <P>I also on that occasion acknowledged the intensive efforts being made to attract new air services to Shannon. These efforts have since yielded a very welcome and tangible result in the announcement by Aer Rianta Shannon of the commencement early next month of a new Shannon/London scheduled service.</P>

      <Quest>the discussions, if any, that have taken place regarding the development of strategic alliances between our national airline, Aer Lingus, and foreign airlines; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to put on record the fact that the Government has and will continue to <Col N="1278" /> encourage Aer Lingus to develop appropriate strategic alliances with other airlines as part of its overall development strategy, where they are judged to be in the best interests of the airline and the economic development of the country.</P>
      <P>My predecessor responded to a similar parliamentary question on 30 March 1994.  In his reply, he indicated that the question of a strategic alliance for Aer Lingus was one of the issues addressed in the document on Irish aviation policy published in February 1994.</P>
      <P>With the progressive liberalisation of the airline industry worldwide, many airlines with relatively small domestic markets have sought alliances with stronger carriers or groups of carriers.</P>
      <P>In some cases, these have involved cross shareholdings while, in other cases, alliances are confined to marketing arrangements.</P>
      <P>Following the implementation of its restructuring programme.  Aer Lingus is in a better position to strengthen both its market and financial positions through alliances with other carriers feeding into the Aer Lingus system.</P>
      <P>The proposed form of such alliances is a matter, in the first instance, for the board and management of the airline. The Government, as shareholder, will seriously consider, on their merits, all proposals from Aer Lingus for such alliances.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that information on Aer Lingus' discussions with specific air carriers is commercially sensitive by its nature and it would be inappropriate for me to comment on such matters.</P>
      <P>I can say, however, that Aer Lingus already has in place a number of route and marketing agreements with other airlines.</P>

      <P>I totally reject the allegation in the Deputy's question which appears to be based on a misapprehension.</P>
      <P>There has been no failure on my part, or indeed on anybody's part, to achieve European Commission agreement to the payment of the final tranche of equity to Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>The fact is that the Commission's authorisation for payment of the third and final tranche of equity under Aer Lingus' restructuring programme is not expected until December 1995.</P>
      <P>As I stated before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies on 7 November 1995, my main priority for Aer Lingus is to secure Commission approval for the payment of the final tranche of £50 million equity.</P>
      <P>At that stage, I cautioned against complacency and stated that the Commission's decision should not be seen as a foregone conclusion.</P>
      <P>The Government has furnished a report to the Commission outlining the success of Aer Lingus' restructuring programme.  That report is currently being examined by consultants appointed by the Commission.</P>
      <P>In the light of the most recent indications, I am optimistic that the Commission will authorise payment of the third and final tranche of equity to Aer Lingus.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>There are six regional airports handling scheduled commercial traffic.  Passenger traffic at these airports fell by 51 per cent between 1990 and 1993.  Traffic recovered somewhat in 1994 and that upward trend has continued into 1995. However, despite this increase in traffic, a number of regional airport companies are experiencing serious financial difficulties.</P>
      <P>In order to alleviate these difficulties, my Department made arrangements for the introduction of an Essential Air Services Programme between four of these airports and Dublin Airport in accordance with EU Regulations.  The purpose of the programme is to guarantee a minimum level of air services to the regions served by these airports.  The provision in my Department's Vote for this purpose in 1995 is £1.5 million.</P>
      <P>Four regional airports are included in the programme &mdash; Kerry, Galway, Sligo and Donegal.  To date, operating contracts have been awarded to Aer Lingus for the Dublin/Kerry/Dublin and Dublin/Galway/Dublin routes.  No contract was awarded for the Sligo and Donegal routes as the tenders submitted presented serious difficulties.  I am arranging for a further call for tenders for these routes to be inserted in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</P>
      <P>The programme is confined to domestic routes within Ireland.  International air services should be able to operate on a fully commercial basis.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>On 3 November 1994 a CIE official briefed my Department by telephone as part of its preparations for an Adjournment Debate later that day on the proposed disposal of the Horgan's Quay site.  Following the Debate, CIE submitted a Memorandum to my Department on 11 November, 1994.  Shortly after his appointment in May 1995, I met the new CIE Group Chief Executive to discuss a range of issues.  During our meeting the Horgan's Quay issue was briefly discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The negotiation of the contract for the disposal of the Horgan's Quay site <Col N="1285" /> was a matter for CIE and O'Callaghan Properties.  Neither I nor my Department had any involvement in these negotiations.  Consequently the question of my seeking legal advice in relation to this disposal did not arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the time of entry into force of the Euratom Treaty in 1958, the European nuclear industry was in its infancy and, therefore, one of its primary aims was to further an ambitious research and development programme for a powerful nuclear industry.  The terms of the Treaty were based on the assumption that uranium would replace coal as the world's energy source.  The EC therefore considered the importance of establishing an institution specifically to deal with nuclear energy.</P>
      <P>However, it must be considered that the Treaty was drawn up nearly 30 years ago and that much has changed since then.  The health and safety provisions of Euratom which includes Article 34, are relatively weak, not surprisingly given the relative lack of appreciation in the 1950's of the dangers of ionising radiation and the lack of emphasis on environmental issues in general.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A possible review and update of this Treaty to place a greater emphasis on health, safety and environmental <Col N="1286" /> aspects is among the ideas being considered by the Ministerial Committee on Sellafield and the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>The Irish member of the EU Reflection Group which is helping to identify options for discussion at the InterGovernmental Conference in 1996 has raised the question of strengthening the nuclear safety and radiation protection provisions of the Euratom Treaty. However, it should be noted that any amendment to the Euratom Treaty requires unanimity and this may be difficult to achieve given the strong views of certain member states on furthering the use of nuclear power.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I reported to the Deputy in the Dáil on 12 October 1995, Nuclear Electric's Reactor 2 at Dungeness A station in Kent underwent a controlled shutdown on 6 September, 1995 and a full report had been sought from the UK Authorities on the incident.  In its initial investigation into the facts surrounding the event, the independent regulator, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate of the UK's Health and Safety Executive were satisfied with Nuclear Electric's actions following discovery of the problem and in shutting the reactor down.</P>
      <P>The shutdown was required to permit checks of a refuelling standpipe following inadvertent stressing of it by the fuelling machine.  The standpipes penetrate the top of the reactor pressure vessel to allow the reactor to be refuelled while operating.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>More detailed investigations were then undertaken by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate.  Nuclear Electric <Col N="1287" /> were required to produce a safety case to the inspectorate before the reactor could be allowed to re-open.  The NII have since completed their investigations and have expressed themselves satisfied with the safety case which Nuclear Electric produced to justify restarting the reactor.  Dungeness A is now fully operational.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may wish to know that Dungeness A is one of the Magnox nuclear plants about which I have concerns about its age, safety and reliability.  In view of this incident and the Court Case concerning the Wylfa Magnox plant in Wales.  I have written strong letters to the UK Minister for Energy and the Secretary of State for the Environment outlining in the strongest terms the very deep concerns of the Irish people about the safety of Magnox reactors.  I have called on the British Government to phase out all such reactors and to ensure that nuclear operators take the necessary steps to make a repetition of incidents such as Wylfa and Dungeness impossible.</P>

      <P>It was agreed in the Government's Policy document A Government for Renewal to seek a prohibition on underground nuclear dumps such as the one currently being proposed by UK NIREX Ltd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>UK NIREX Ltd. is a state-owned company charged with providing and operating a deep underground repository for the disposal of low and intermediate level radioactive waste in Britain.  After examining a number of locations NIREX decided in 1992 to <Col N="1289" /> focus its further attention on the Sellafield area.  On 29 July 1994, after some initial testing, NIREX applied to Cumbria County Council for planning permission to build a Rock Characterisation Facility or &ldquo;Rock Laboratory&rdquo; at the site near Sellafield known as Long-lands Farm, Gosforth in Cumbria.</P>
    <P>The Rock Characterisation Facility would involve primarily the construction of two shafts, underground hydrogeological galleries, and exploratory drilling from underground with the purpose of testing the area's suitability from a hydrogeological point of view as a site for an underground waste repository.</P>
    <P>In December 1994, Cumbria County Council refused NIREX planning permission for the project after considering a number of submissions on the matter, including one from my Department, NIREX exercised its statutory right of appeal under UK legislation against the County Council's decision and the UK's Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. John Gummer MP then decided to hold a public inquiry.</P>
    <P>This inquiry is currently in progress and I will attend the inquiry to object to this new facility.  A date of 7 December 1995 has been fixed for this Government's presentation.  A comprehensive submission has already been forwarded to the inquiry's secretariat.</P>
    <P>This Government opposes any expansion to Sellafield's nuclear-related activities.  Although this Rock Characterisation Facility is not a nuclear facility per se, it is my view that if planning permission is granted for this facility it significantly pre-commits NIREX to an eventual repository development which is likely to result in strong pressure to stay with the Sellafield area because of costs incurred in its development of the laboratory.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 40 together.  The review of strategy in relation to renewable energy resources is continuing apace and will be completed in the coming weeks.  Arising from that review, I hope to announce my proposals on renewable energy in early 1996.</P>
      <P>The review process is an exhaustive one.  It involves the widest possible consultation and expert analysis of the various issues involved.  The review process recognises that the alternative energy requirement scheme was the first major step in the development of alternative energy sources in Ireland and lessons need to be taken from that initiative.</P>
      <P>Provision has been made in the Operational Programme for Economic Infrastructure for support of approximately £15 million for renewable energy.</P>
      <P>As Deputies may be aware, I have announced plans for a competitive scheme to secure one electricity generating plant of up to 30 megawatts using biomass or waste as a fuel.  It is proposed, subject to EU approval, to provide grant assistance of up to £7.5 million to the project under the Economic Infrastructure Operational programme.</P>

Health boards endeavour to make refunds as quickly as possible and the average waiting period under this scheme is four to five weeks.</P>
      <P>I would point out to the Deputy that there is a scheme available for people who incur on-going expenses on medicines whereby they do not have to await refund payments.  The drug cost subsidisation scheme was introduced to cater specifically for people who have a long-term medical condition with a regular and on-going requirement for prescribed drugs and medicines.</P>

    <P>Persons who qualify for inclusion in this scheme pay £32 per month to their <Col N="1297" /> pharmacist in respect of all prescribed medicine dispensed during that month. In order to qualify for this scheme persons must be certified by a medical practitioner on an individual basis.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have power under section 41 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1948, to make by-laws for the regulation of public bathing within their sanitary districts or in coastal waters adjoining their sanitary districts.  Such by-laws may provide for a wide range of matters, including matters pertaining to public safety.  No local authority has made bye-laws under section 41.</P>
      <P>Part VII of the Local Government Act, 1994 (which I propose shortly to bring into operation) contains general provisions for the making of by-laws by local authorities to regulate or control an activity or matter in the interests of the common good of the local community.  It will be a matter for the local authority concerned to consider, having regard to the legal provisions and to local circumstances, whether such by-laws should be made in relation to safety on beaches.  The making of by-laws under Part VII will be a reserved function of the elected members and there will be no requirement for ministerial approval.</P>

All proposals received are currently being examined with a view to the selection of projects for funding.  I will announce grant allocations for selected projects early in 1996.</P>

      <P>Delay in the payment of maintenance grants is a matter for the local authorities as under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Act, 1968, they are the bodies statutorily entrusted with the administration of higher education grants.</P>

    <P>Where the Deputy is aware of specific incidents of delay in payment of grants <Col N="1302" /> she should refer therefore to the relevant local authority regarding the reasons for such delays.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for old age (non-contributory) pension in May 1991.  As this is a means tested assistance payment, all income, including capital and income from foreign pensions, is assessable as means. The British pension which counts as means for this purpose is converted to Irish pounds by reference to an average EU exchange rate used by my Department.</P>
      <P>Following investigations in 1991, it was decided that the person concerned was not entitled to receive a pension as her weekly means of £73.47 exceed the statutory limit for entitlement &mdash; then set at £56.00 per week.  Her means were derived from her British Retirement Pension, a British Superannuation Pension and some capital held on deposit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Repeat applications in March 1992, November 1992, February 1993, May 1993, and May 1995 were all refused as <Col N="1308" /> her means exceeded the statutory limit for entitlement to pension.</P>
    <P>As at May 1995 the person concerned was in receipt of a weekly British Retirement Pension of £58.32 Sterling and a monthly Superannuation pension of £50.72 Sterling.  Together with a small amount of capital, her means of £73.89 exceeded the current statutory limit of £66.00 per week.  If the person's circumstances have changed in the meantime, it is open to her to apply to have her case reviewed.</P>
    <P>Any person in receipt of a United Kingdom retirement pension whose means have changed as a result of the change in the value of sterling may be entitled to an old age (non-contributory) pension from my Department provided their means do not exceed IR£66 per week.  A United Kingdom pensioner who is already in receipt of an old age (non-contributory) pension and whose means have reduced as a result is entitled to request a review of his or her means assessment at any time.</P>

      <P>The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland monitors on a continuing basis the levels of radioactivity in Irish waters and reports regularly on the distribution of contaminating radionuclides as well as identifying trends and assessing the risks of public health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The discharges from Sellafield to the Irish Sea are those which affect the Irish environment and potentially the health <Col N="1312" /> and welfare of the Irish public.  The discharges from Sellafield for 1992 and 1993 are given in the following Tables 1 and 2.  Discharges from other nuclear installations or miscellaneous sources are negligible by comparison with those from Sellafield.</P>
    <P>The consumption of fish and shellfish is the major pathway by which radiation exposure of the Irish public occurs as a consequence of radioactive contamination of the marine environment.  Contamination in seawater and sediments along the coast, even along the northeast coast, gives rise to insignificant exposures to persons frequenting beaches or swimming in the sea.</P>
    <P>Further detailed information on the results of the monitoring programme is available directly from the Institute.</P>

      <P>It is difficult to be exact about the numbers of such stations in operation, since they are transient by nature, tend to move about on the frequency bands and often change their names.  In the Dublin area I believe that there are about six such stations currently in operation.  Some others operate only at weekends.  There are, in addition, a number of other frequencies that are being misused, for example with continuous music being broadcast or perhaps a carrier-wave on the frequency.  Although the problem is less pressing outside Dublin, problems also arise on occasion in other areas of the country.</P>
      <P>As I have previously stated, my position regarding the operation of illegal pirate radio stations is that the full provisions of the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Acts will be invoked against such stations in any situation where the circumstances allow, and those involved in illegal broadcasting, including businesses and people advertising on, or providing services to, illegal stations, should have no doubt that action may be taken against them at any time.  My Department will keep this matter under careful review and efforts will be intensified as the need is identified.</P>

      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to comment <Col N="1315" /> on specific aspects of CIE's financial performance for 1995 in advance of the publication of the group's annual report which is not due until 1996.</P>
      <P>I am, however, aware of the generally difficult financial situation faced by the CIE Group.  I have already indicated the need for a more commercially oriented and customer focused approach to the provision of public transport services by CIE.</P>
      <P>The financial and other problems faced by CIE must be tackled as part of an overall and comprehensive strategy for the future development of the group.  I have already outlined the main elements of this strategy in my statement to the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, and most recently in my reply to private notice questions on 15 November 1995.</P>

      <P>The Merchant Shipping (Jet Skis and Fast Power Boats) Regulations, 1992 enable local authorities, regional fisheries boards, harbour authorities and the Commissioners of Public Works to make proposals to the Minister to designate areas as being unsuitable.  In the interests of safety of pleasure craft and their occupants, for the operation of jet skis and fast power boats.  I understand that the Department has received no such proposals in respect of Sheephaven Bay.  On receipt of any proposals, they will be examined having regard to the above regulations.</P>
