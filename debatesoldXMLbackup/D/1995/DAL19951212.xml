    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Social partnership is a process which has helped achieve a considerable measure of consensus and industrial peace.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> runs until the end of 1996.</P>
      <P>It is my hope that we will negotiate a new national programme.  Any new national programme which would begin in January 1997, would span a critical period for Ireland and could greatly assist in continuing the process of improving our competitiveness.  In that context, I would also expect that mechanisms for extending a &ldquo;partnership approach&rdquo; to the level of the individual enterprise will be a significant feature of discussions on any new programme.</P>
      <P>I will continue my frequent informal meetings with the social partners over the remaining year of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and intend opening formal discussions in relation to a possible new programme in the latter part of 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach intend publishing a mid-term review of what has happened and has yet to happen under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> as was done in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand a review of progress under the programme is taking place and I expect it will be published in the normal way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not a normal way.  In the past mid-term reviews were published, but since we have passed the mid-term on this occasion, will the Taoiseach give a date as to when such a review might be published?  The three previous programmes were based on a comprehensive report published by the ESRI.  What examination of the issues relevant to the next programme has the Taoiseach commissioned in the past few months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand it was the National Economic and Social Council that carried out the review.  It <Col N="1047" /> has already commenced work that will set the scene for negotiations for a new programme to commence on 1 January 1997.</P>
      <P>As I do not have the relevant information with me, I am unable to give the Deputy a date on which a mid-term review will be carried out.  However, I understand work in that area is being undertaken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> and the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, public sector pay increased at between two and three times the rate of inflation?  Does he agree that on the next occasion the social partners are convened to put in place a national wage agreement, the level of take-home pay should be the priority and that it is unacceptable that public sector pay should increase at twice the rate of the average industrial wage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Various matters, unconnected with the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> or its predecessor, contributed to the movement of pay levels.  It would be wrong to assume that social partnerships is the primary reason for such a development.  Most of this happened prior to my accession to office and, therefore, I am not in a position to give the Deputy the information he would like to have.  However, I agree with his view that we should focus on take-home pay because that is what people have to spend at the end of each week or month.  It is a consideration which affects public and private sector employees and the self-employed equally.  It is also important, in the negotiation of any new programme, to strike a balance between the need to maintain good quality public services on which we must concentrate and the need to have people working in those services in a state of good morale and with a sense that their work is appreciated.  It is important to everybody, be they in the <Col N="1048" /> private or public sector, that such services should be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>As well as personal taxation to which I am glad he has referred, does the Taoiseach accept that the cost of PRSI to the employer would also be central to the negotiation of any new agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We should consider all the factors which affect long-term decision-making about employment levels, but it is important to make the point that employers, in deciding to add to their workforce, do not consider the cost to them only in the year in which they employ the person concerned. They consider the likely cost implications in the long-term, during the career of that person in their employment. It is important, therefore, to establish a tax and social welfare regime which is favourable towards employment. One is best able to achieve this in the context of social partnership as it provides a measure of stability which enables long-term planning to take place.  The Government must over time make the employment of additional personnel more attractive in fiscal terms.  In the past Governments of all persuasions endeavoured to introduce short-term measures which offered attractive incentives for six months to one year to increase employment, but such measures do not produce the necessary long-term effects.  One must consider this matter with a long-term perspective.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the terms of the public sector embargo been agreed by the Government under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> or will they be discussed with the social partners in the near future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the basis for the Deputy's question is, but the Government wishes to move its programme forward in regard to public expenditure, taxation and all relevant matters of that nature in a spirit of social partnership.  We would wish to <Col N="1049" /> discuss our approach with the social partners in the fullest way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The source of my information is reports in the national newspapers today.  Will the terms of the public sector embargo agreed by the Government be made known to the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to reflect on any newspaper, but the Deputy would need to have a more authoritative source for any assumptions he might wish to make about what the Government will do.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If my information is inaccurate, will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government has agreed to impose a public sector embargo or is it just a matter of gossip?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be better if the Deputy allowed the Government to announce its decisions in the normal way rather than ask me to make extempore comments in response to questions. The Government will make any announcements that it has to make in due course.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that any matters being considered by the Government are covered by the Supreme Court's judgment relating to decisions taken by the Deputy's party when in Government because it <Col N="1050" /> did not want to answer some embarrassing questions.  I have nothing to be embarrassed about in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has the worst record when it comes to answering questions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am looking forward to the announcement of the relevant decisions of the Government in this area, but I will not become engaged, despite any pre-Christmas invitations from the Deputy, in speculating about Government decisions.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the Cabinet confidentiality ruling to which he has referred can be invoked with malice and ignored with impunity, that what is wrong here is that we are reading in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> not for the first time, of a solo run by a Labour Party Minister and that instead of slapping the car into reverse when travelling at 30 miles per hour we need less of the gear crunching economics from the Minister for Finance. Deputy Quinn, and more strategic planning in the way in which public sector pay and numbers are determined?</P>

      <P>Much extraneous matter is being injected into this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has been a late convert to the principle of social partnership although this is welcome. After three runs of social partnership does he agree that there is a need for a sharper focus on employment and taxation which ought to be the main issues in the negotiation of any new programme? Will he confirm in the House <Col N="1051" /> rather than through the pages of a national newspaper that a public service embargo is to be introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be best to draw the Deputy's attention to the full reply I gave in response to the question from Deputy Kitt in which I dealt with the matter of employment in some detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach remember the time when he hated the principle of social partnership?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That should be the principal focus in any social partnership approach.  It is clear that the main social problem facing this country is the lack of employment although there has been tremendous growth in the past year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a fairy story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Kitt that the matter should be addressed and it will.  I have answered the second part of Deputy O'Rourke's question already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 6, inclusive, together.  I met the Prime Minister of Spain and current President of the European Council, Mr. Felipe Gonzalez, in Dublin on 4 December last. The meeting was part of the tour of EU capitals undertaken by the Spanish Prime Minister in preparation for the European Council in Madrid on 15 and 16 December next.</P>
      <P>At the meeting Prime Minister Gonzalez briefed me on the agenda for the Madrid European Council and his objectives for the Council.  He confirmed that the main agenda items at the Council will be the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference including the report of the Reflection Group, economic and monetary union, employment policy and the future enlargement of the Union.</P>
      <P>At the meeting, I set out the Irish priorities for Madrid laying particular emphasis on the issues of employment policy, the fight against drug trafficking, the importance we attach to a successful Intergovernmental Conference and the need for the Council to agree the Reference Scenario for the introduction of economic and monetary union.  The groundowrk in regard to the latter has been laid by the ECOFIN Council and I anticipate that the Madrid European Council will adopt the Reference Scenario charting the way to the commencement of the final stage of European Monetary Union with effect from 1 January 1999.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1053" /> The report of the Reflection Group is being submitted to the European Council and will be considered in the context of the discussions on the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  I believe that the report of the group represents an important input to the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.  It is very satisfactory from Ireland's point of view.  While the Reflection Group was not a negotiating forum the group's report clarifies the issues which are likely to arise at the Intergovernmental Conference and sets out a number of options for consideration by the conference itself.</P>
    <P>Finally, I have received a copy of the joint letter from Chancellor Kohl and President Chirac to the President of the European Council in relation to the Madrid Council.  This letter concentrates mainly on the 1996 Intergovernmental Conference.  In a number of respects it echoes the ideas in the Reflection Group report, notably the need to bring the Union closer to its citizens, to prepare the institutions of the Union for the next round of enlargement and to strengthen the internal and external security of the Union.  The detailed consideration of how to address these challenges will be for the Intergovernmental Conference itself. The joint letter will be an important input to the discussions on the Intergovernmental Conference at Madrid.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted the Taoiseach had meetings with these individuals because it presents the only opportunity to ask questions.  I again object to the Taoiseach transferring all the questions on Northern Ireland.  It is difficult to believe that Deputy John Bruton, the champion of openness and transparency is behaving in this way.  In the context of the Madrid Summit will the Taoiseach support the development of closer links between the Western European Union and the EU.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter to which the Deputy referred in the latter part of <Col N="1054" /> her question will be discussed at the intergovernmental conference which will probably not commence until March.  Obviously all such proposals will be considered in the context of that conference. I do not expect we will go into detail in Madrid on matters of the kind referred to by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>The fudging is not good enough.  Various signals have been given by different members of the Government on this matter and I would like the Taoiseach's view on it.  Does he support the development of closer links between the Western European Union and the EU?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the Jean Monnet lecture in UCC in which I set out in some detail Ireland's approach to those matters, which is similar to statements made elsewhere by the Tánaiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to refer me to a lecture I did not attend.  This is the national Parliament and the Taoiseach is accountable to the House.  I am entitled to ask a question and get a reasonable answer rather than be referred to some lecture which I did not have an opportunity to read.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reference to the Western European Union in these questions.  I have set out my position in some detail.  Ireland's view is that <Col N="1055" /> in general we should move forward on a number of tasks that can be conducted short of an article 5 commitment under the Western European Union Treaty. There are a number of other areas of common action Ireland can consider which are not covered by article 5 but where we can join in common actions of a peace-keeping nature in conjunction with other members.  Policy-making of the Western European Union in terms of foreign policy is influenced greatly by the policy-making decisions taken in the European Union.  There is already a very close working relationship between the two institutions.  The Western European Union Treaty will expire within two to three years and obviously the question will then arise of whether a new Western European Union Treaty will be negotiated or whether that should be subsumed into some other instrument.  That is a matter upon which there is a wide range of views among member states.

As we are approaching the run up to the commencement of Ireland's Presidency, will the Taoiseach indicate the themes that should be brought forward during our Presidency?

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Reflection Group did exactly what it was asked to do.  It was asked to outline the problems that exist and need to be solved at an Intergovernmental Conference.  It did that.  It was not intended to be a negotiating group.  If it attempted to be such, it would have operated outside its brief. The Deputy's criticisms of the Reflection Group are not justified in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy asked what would be the priorities of the Irish Presidency. Admittedly it is somewhat early days to answer that in a definitive sense, but I will outline my view of the Irish Presidency priorities in general terms.  The European Union has become distanced from its citizens.  That is reflected most clearly in the difficulty experienced in a number of member states in securing ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. Failure in one case to ratify it and a close result in another are not related to the content of the Maastricht Treaty, but to a sense that Europe is being taken for granted.  It has major achievements to its name, but they are being taken for granted by people at this stage.  People would only engage with them again if those achievements were at risk.  I refer particularly to the Common Market, the absence of conflict within Western Europe and the tremendous social advances in many countries, including equality, which have been achieved as a result of EU law and the respect for human rights all over Western Europe.  However, that has not tended to engage the enthusiastic support of Europe's citizens.  To address that subject Europe needs to become an institution that is not simply market driven, but one that is also value driven. We need to have truly European values reflected in all the actions of the Community. The Union will not win full potential support among its citizens if it <Col N="1062" /> presents itself as an institution for making micro-economic decisions in regard to a variety of matters, regardless of how important they may be to the people involved.  There is a need for Europe as an institution to engage public support for the political, democratic and social values it seeks to realise as an institution.  It is important that the emphasis should be on the wider picture of the role of Europe as an institution expressing certain social and human values rather than simply on its economic efficiency which is undoubted.</P>
    <P>During the Irish Presidency we will wish to give expression to that in the way we run our business.  We will wish to deal expeditiously, effectively and in a fair manner with the Intergovernmental Conference which will represent a large part of our work.  We will also be dealing with the question of moving towards economic and monetary union. In the second half of next year we will deal with issues regarding relationships with Eastern Europe, particularly with Russia in the aftermath of the Russian presidential election.  That will be a major focus of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>It is important that the European Union should be seen to be an institution that can act on issues such as crime and drugs which, unfortunately, touch virtually every family in the European Union in one way or another.  That relates back to the earlier point I made about the need for Europe to be close to its citizens.  I accept these are areas where member states have jealously guarded their individual international prerogatives.  That is the case in regard to the difficulties in securing ratification of the EUROPOL Convention, a simple one, which has been held up by one member state which does not accept the role of the European Court of Justice on that matter.  If Europe is to be close to its citizens and to express those democratic and human values inherent to the European construction, it must be capable of taking action in areas such as crime and drugs, which have a strong transboundary dimension but which <Col N="1063" /> also directly affect citizens in their daily lives.</P>
    <P>Broadly speaking, those are the priorities I see for the Irish Presidency in the second half of the year and I hope we will be able to fulfil them.  Obviously, as time goes by we will be seeking to refine them in greater detail and work out the exact instruments needed to give effect to them.  We will be acting as one member state in conjunction with all the others and we will not be able to do everything we would wish.  This is a co-operative exercise.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his lengthy reply.  I asked about the priorities of the Government and it is clear from the Taoiseach's reply, probably because the Reflection Group is not moving in a positive direction and the fact that all his colleagues in Europe are saying nothing will happen on that issue other than moving it on during the Irish Presidency, that is the reason he played down the intergovernmental conference in his lengthy reply.  Clearly, the vision being spelled out by the Taoiseach is in direct conflict with the Economic and Monetary Institute.  What it is trying to achieve, following the Maastricht guideline of economic and monetary union, is a narrow definition of how Europe should move forward from an economic point of view and the single currency.  It does not relate to any great degree to issues affecting people and the EMI acknowledge that.  Do I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that he does not believe that the statements from the EMI on European Monetary Union or the principles of the intergovernmental conference, as already set out, are priorities for the Irish Presidency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with the underlying assumptions in the Deputy's questions, for the following reasons.  First, I am not playing down the intergovernmental conference. However, if most members of the public were asked about the intergovernmental conference they would not have <Col N="1064" /> any possibility of answering because they would not know.  If we are to get European citizens to support the European project we must present what Europe is doing in the sense of values and political objectives rather than bureaucratic instruments.  I regard the Intergovernmental Conference as merely a means to an end and it is important that the citizen should understand what the end is.  The end is a truly democratic Europe where people feel part of decision-making.  It is very important that we present in our Presidency &mdash; which will give us an opportunity to present the European idea to a wider public than is possible for us in the normal course &mdash; the end we want to achieve rather than talking constantly in terms of Intergovernmental Conferences, QMVs, CEECs and so on. That is a very important consideration that should inform the way we debate Europe.  Let us concentrate on what we are trying to achieve and what we are trying to do for our citizens rather than be constantly drawn back into this discussion about instruments, bureaucratic procedures and so on which, though important, are subsidiary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To come to the second part of the Deputy's question, I do not agree with him when he seems to imply that there is a conflict &mdash; he even used the words `a direct conflict&rdquo;&mdash; between the single currency and the wider social and human objectives in Europe.  My view is that stable currencies lead to low interest rates and stable currencies and low interest rates lead to more investment. More investment leads to more jobs and more jobs lead to a better social position for everybody.  The creation of a single currency for Europe is a social project which, if achieved, will improve the well-being of European citizens.  It will make travel and transactions within the European Union much easier but it will also contribute to making Europe a zone of monetary stability which, in turn, will make it a zone of low interest rates, high investment, high employment and good social outcomes.  I do not believe we should <Col N="1065" /> present the European single currency as some sort of banker's charter or something designed for the benefit of the financial sector or the financial world.  It is not.  The European single currency is being advanced for the social purposes it can achieve.  Part of the problem in debate about Europe and part of the reasons for alienation of people <i>vis-à-vis</i> it is that Europe's activities are not presented in terms of the beneficient social outcomes they create.  In my outline of the Irish Presidency's priorities at this early stage I hope I have done something to redress that imbalance.</P>

      <P>Thank you for the additional time.  If the Taoiseach gets an opportunity at one of the sessions over the weekend, I am sure his colleagues would be interested to hear what he just stated.  I think they believe the Irish Presidency will actually fulfil what the other 14 countries would like to do. Obviously, it is not the Taoiseach's priority.  The purpose of the intergovernmental conference is to look at the structures and how the ordinary people in Europe will be cared for over the next ten years and the procedures that will be followed.  I hold the view that the people in Europe understand that quite well.  Because of a number of amendments to the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty the people had an opportunity to reflect on it.  They are also clear on the issue of enlargement.  Whether there will be 15, 20, 25 or 30 countries is an issue that will have to be resolved either during the Irish Presidency or directly afterwards. Everybody understands the funding issue for the future under the Regional and Social Funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if I have not communicated what I am saying to the Deputy.  Of course the Intergovernmental Conference is important but it is a means to an end.  The end which it is seeking is a Europe which will engage the full hearted support of its citizens.  I believe, as I have said already, that the Intergovernmental Conference must be informed by certain values.  It must not simply be an exercise of negotiation of interest only to insiders who know all about the various treaty provisions and the various ruses and advances that can be made by one country at the expense of another.  If we approach the Intergovernmental Conference on that basis, we will have more problems with the next ratification process than we had with Maastricht.  For the construction of Europe there has to be that wider vision of what Europe is seeking to achieve. That is a view I advocated strongly at the Majorca informal summit with my colleagues.  It is a view which, I believe, is widely shared by my colleagues and it is a view which must inform the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.  It does not mean that the detailed work does not need to be done but it should be informed by a wider social view of what Europe is supposed to achieve.  I expect that that would be a view that would command widespread support in this House.</P>

      <P>That is an issue which, I am sure the Deputy is well aware, was raised in the context of the negotiations on the Maastricht Treaty, it is an area I support.  It is important, for the reasons I have already given, that Europe should be seen to be more than simply an economic zone, that it has a wider role in regard to the promotion of democratic values and human rights.  I compliment the work of the Council of Europe in this area since its foundation in 1949.  It is easy to take the work of the Council of Europe for granted because it is part of the furniture of Europe but a part that we could ill do without.</P>

Given that we are commemorating the 150th anniversary of the Famine, will the Taoiseach ensure there is a focus on the developing world?</P>

      <P>The answer to both questions is &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.  I agree we should do everything possible to continue the constructive role the European Union has played in promoting the peace process. It is very important to show not only in financial terms but more importantly in political terms that there is support in the wider European Union for the work being done by many people in regard to the peace process in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also agree with the points made by the Deputy about overseas development aid.  This is an area where the European Union can do more than it <Col N="1068" /> has done in the past.  Strictly speaking, this is not a matter which will come up for discussion at the Intergovernmental Conference.  However, it will be dealt with in the financial perspectives, the next task to be undertaken by the European Union after the completion of the Intergovernmental Conference. Obviously the Government will continue its policy of supporting improved European contributions in the overseas development area, with particular emphasis on Africa.</P>

      <P>A strategy statement was prepared in my Department last year as an initial response to the Strategic Management Initiative.  The statement is at present being revised to take account of subsequent developments, including the policy commitments in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> I am happy to confirm that it is my intention to publish a document in the new year setting out the results of our work in this area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The statement to which I referred is part of a process tied into the Government's policy agreement. The Minister of State, Deputy Avril Doyle, has special responsibility for the SMI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The preparation of the statement involved consultation with departmental staff and local authority staff.  Even <Col N="1069" /> though it is an internal document which is part of a process, the structure of it is as follows: to analyse the strength and weaknesses of the Department, to examine the opportunities offered and the threats posed by the external environment in an effort to ensure that we provide a better service to the public, to set out a mission statement for the Department on its overall objectives and to give a brief description of further work which needs to be done to develop the process within the Department.</P>
    <P>A further document entitled &ldquo;Divisional Strategies &mdash; Key Activities and Targets&rdquo; has also been prepared.  It comprises a detailed action programme to achieve objectives set out in the statement, together with target performance indicators etc.  Other SMI related activities in the Department include the establishment of a training and development co-ordinating committee, a review of the Department's information publication activities, a review of arrangements to consult and get feedback from clients, customers and other people with whom the Department does business and preliminary consideration of the relevance of formalised quality systems such as ISO 9000 and the Q mark to services provided by us to the public, for example, housing grants, driver testing etc.  This ongoing process is our contribution to the overall Government process. Like other Departments, I hope to be in a position to publish a comprehensive statement on the initiative during 1996.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to differentiate between the two processes.  The first is a strategic management initiative for the Department and this has primarily a departmental focus.  This involved consultation but not of the type to which the Deputy referred.  The next step in <Col N="1070" /> the process will be a strategic management initiative for local authorities and semi-State bodies.  Some local authorities are already preparing for this but it is envisaged that it will not happen until the Civil Service end of the initiative is finalised, which I hope will be during the first half of 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to divisional strategies and the initial statement.  In regard to the feedback from customers, were local authorities included?  I understand there was little or no contact between the Department and local authorities in regard to the process?  Is the Minister saying this consultation will take place during the next few months?</P>

      <P>The process is ongoing. Last year a strategy statement was prepared in the Department by my predecessor but I am not sure what consultations he engaged in.  This is only part of a process which will involve discussions with the management and representatives of the elected membership before it is concluded within my Department. There will be much more detailed engagement between the Department and members of local authorities in the development of a strategic management initiative for local government.</P>

      <P>There is no mechanism available to me, nor would it be desirable or practicable <Col N="1071" /> to introduce a mechanism, to restrict access to accommodation in the private rented sector to any particular categories of housing need to the exclusion of others.  I am, however, aware of the Deputy's concern that aspects of the social welfare code may encourage persons to leave the family home and move to private rented accommodation, thereby putting additional pressure on the supply of accommodation available. These concerns have been brought to the attention of the Department of Social Welfare by my Department.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister have statistics on the number of single people under 21 or 25 years in receipt of State help in the form of a rent supplement or tax relief and who live adjacent to the town or city in which their parents live?  During September or October last year the previous Government set up a group to review the guidelines on rent supplements.  Earlier this year the Minister confirmed that this group was still engaged in this work. What submission did the Department make to the group in regard to these young people and is the work of the group nearing completion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for the Department of Social Welfare.  There is a commitment in the Programme for Government to transfer responsibility for mortgage and rent supplements to local authorities.  The work of the committee, on which the Department is represented, is nearing completion and I hope a report will be submitted shortly. I share the Deputy's concerns about these young people and it is important to ensure that we support families in every way possible.  This concern is shared by the Government who has taken practical steps in this area.  We must take into account that many young people leave home for valid and practical reasons and that there will always be this kind of mobility.  As I do not have direct responsibility for rent supplements I do not have the statistics <Col N="1072" /> requested by the Deputy.  The issue is important and I will look seriously at the recommendations of the Department of Social Welfare.  I would like to proceed with the transfer while ensuring that changes in rent supplementation do not increase artificially the demand for housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not outlined her Department's submission to this review group.  I do not know which Department provides the secretariat to the review group but I had thought the Departments of the Environment and Social Welfare were equally involved on this issue.  The Minister of State mentioned the Government's commitment to family values but one would question this in the light of certain unemployed people being denied social welfare entitlements when living in the family home but being eligible for them when they leave home. This is an enticement to leave home. These unemployed people have good accommodation at home and should live there.</P>
      <P>Have both Departments an equal say on the review group or is there an ideological viewpoint that 18 and 19 year olds should leave the family nest?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not dream of advising 18 year olds or 19 year olds to leave the family nest &mdash; I have enough difficulty keeping charge of my own 17 year old and 18 year old at home without advising anybody else.  The Deputy is aware that the Department of Social Welfare and not the Department of the Environment is responsible for rent supplementation.  The Department of the Environment, however, has a presence on the review group and has a very real interest in this issue.  We raised this issue at that committee because of our concern about its implications for housing policy and family structure.  At the end of the day, young people may determine for very good and practical reasons to leave home.  The Deputy, <Col N="1073" /> while making his point on social housing, did not say that young people staying at home can qualify for a payment of £25 a week.  This is not the impression he gave.  I am not the Minister for Social Welfare and I do not have responsibility for rent supplementation.  Quite clearly we have an important input into the work of the committee.  That committee is now coming to completion and will report to the Minister for Social Welfare. There is a commitment also in the Government programme which will follow from this committee report and it is logical to proceed with this policy in relation to the work that has already been done by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that those living at home who are entitled to nothing get nothing but if entitled to benefit will get £25. However, if someone who is entitled to nothing leaves home he is then entitled to £62 and a rent allowance of between £30 and £35.  That is a huge inducement. Let me ask again if the Departments of Social Welfare and the Environment are equal partners on this committee?  The Minister for Social Welfare is the party leader of the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and she should be able to sort it out with him.  When will this committee finalise its work which has been dragging on? Will the Minister of State use her influence with her party leader to have the review group finish its work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>At the risk of repeating myself, the Department of Social Welfare established this committee.  Its report is imminent and I certainly look forward to it being finalised.  The committee has been sitting for quite some time but it has had to assess a major question.  I want to pursue as quickly as possible the transfer of responsibilities to local authorities but it has to be done in a way that is informed.  This committee does very valuable work and I am very satisfied with the advice that the <Col N="1074" /> work is virtually complete and that the report is imminent.</P>

      <Quest>if he intends to undertake an appraisal of road safety promotion in this country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[18603/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated publicly that it is my intention to have a full assessment of road safety promotion carried out as soon as possible.  The assessment will relate also to wider aspects of policy which affect safety on our roads.  In addition, it will examine the roles of the organisations involved, and the possibility of involving new bodies both at the national and local levels, with a view to ensuring that the best possible results are achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that he no longer can afford to be complacent about this issue because in the first nine months of this year 315 people were killed on our roads, the majority of whom were young people?  Is he satisfied that the national roads safety campaign, which is costing the taxpayer £1 million per year, is achieving its aims and effecting significant road accident reductions?  If not, what changes does he propose the body ought to make in its future campaigns?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject entirely the notion that I am complacent about the disturbing road accident figures.  In the first six months of this year, road deaths were down 16 per cent on the corresponding figure of last year.  That has been the trend in the past number of years.  We had three very bad months during the summer and I drew immediate public attention to it.  I instructed the safety authorities, the Garda Síochána and my own Department to analyse these figures and to come up with the reasons the summer months were so bad.  Based on that we will broaden the <Col N="1075" /> analysis to see what other action can be taken.  I have indicated already publicly that I plan a number of initiatives.  I have already announced the development of a voluntary register of trained driving instructors so that we can improve both the quality of the instructor and the quality of the trained driver. I have announced a review of the driving test which will be implemented next year and will increase the level of knowledge of theory required to pass the driving test.  I have announced also that the NRA will be carrying out a comprehensive speed survey on the national route network.  I have announced a new comprehensive traffic signs manual to be launched for the guidance of local authorities so that we can have clarity in relation to road signs.  I have announced the launch of a manual relating to low cost remedial measures for accident black spots so that we can target resources at areas that are a cause of concern.  Finally I have announced the introduction of comprehensive traffic management regulations which will come into force.  It is the most significant initiative on road traffic for some time.  I reject the assertion of complacency. A death on the road is a death too many.</P>
      <P>Within the past ten days I launched the Christmas road safety campaign.  I have already contacted the Minister for Justice to ensure that enforcement of the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts is a matter not only for implementation during the Christmas period but for all year round, thus demonstrating our desire that we work constantly to reduce the number of accidents, fatalities and injuries on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>While accepting that the Minister has put a package of measures in place I question how soon its implementation will begin to show results. Apart from the deep human tragedy involved in road traffic accidents, will he accept that such accidents now cost this country annually approximately £800 million, about half the annual health <Col N="1076" /> budget we vote in this House?  Is the Minister making additional funds available to local authorities to enable them improve their road signage programme since it has been demonstrated in the United Kingdom that a significant reduction in the number of road accidents there resulted from better, more modern and up-to-date road signage and markings?  Is the Minister making such resources available here because, if not.  I predict there will not be an improvement on that aspect of his programme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I look forward to the Deputy's support of the Estimates to increase the amount of money available to local authorities to enable them cope with their road improvement programmes. Last year I published subventions for the non-county roads system which were the highest on record.  I know a good deal of remedial action was taken by local authorities on the non-national roads system to improve road safety.  Signage is a matter of concern to me, which is why I have issued instructions that a new comprehensive traffic signs manual be issued to ensure uniformity of traffic signage next year. The National Roads Authority, this year, also commenced upgrading traffic signage on all major routes, beginning with the N1 and N2, which will constitute a rolling programme of allocating significant resources to improving signage. I accept the importance and value of road markings and signage.  Specific allocations of resources have been made available at national and local levels to achieve improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister has to hand an analysis of the main factors that led to the most recent increase in road accidents, will he bring it before this House so that we can ensure that his remedial package is targeted specifically at drivers most at risk?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The analysis I have already received, although limited in scope because I wanted it very quickly, <Col N="1077" /> shows that the most consistent factor in road accidents is excessive speed, that pedestrians and motor cyclists accounted for a disproportionately high number of fatalities and that a significant number of young road users were also killed.  We are looking at those facts to ascertain how we can target our programme effectively to improve on statistics. One obvious objective will be the campaign to make pedestrians and motor cyclists more visible.  Signage and road markings will be part of that programme.</P>
      <P>Finally, improvement of the driving skills of the younger driver &mdash; which unfortunately is disproportionately represented in the accident statistics &mdash; will be achieved through an improvement in driver testing skills in co-operation with the Insurance Federation.  A credit of some description is being negotiated for young drivers, or indeed older ones, who for the first time undertake a prescribed number of validated instruction courses.  All of this will be a comprehensive package on which I shall keep the House fully informed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 42 and 93 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Direct annual Government expenditure on environmental research was just under 2 per cent of the total research and development budget of £91 million <Col N="1078" /> for all sectors in 1993.  Environmental research and development as a percentage of total public R and D budgets varied from 0.5 per cent to over 4 per cent in OECD countries generally in 1991, the latest year for which I have statistics.</P>
    <P>The Government programme includes a commitment to improve financial supports for research on the environment.  Specific funding is now being provided in this area under the environmental monitoring and research and development sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services, 1994-99.</P>
    <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has published a discussion document on a national programme and priorities for environmental research.  In launching the document, I recognised the need for, and value of, investment in environmental research and development, and the importance to a country with limited means of making maximum use of the resources and expertise available. The Environmental Protection Agency, in accordance with its statutory responsibility for environmental research co-ordination and its administration of the relevant operational programme funding, is well placed to secure the best use of resources.  I will keep the level of financial supports under review as the agency further develops its role in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the State contribution of 2 per cent of the total investment in environmental research for all sectors is a miserly amount and belies the commitment of his Government to improving our environment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not.  I will give the House the figures for comparable countries to ours.  For example, as indicated in the reply we contribute 2 per cent to environmental research; Japan invests 0.5 per cent of its total research budget in the environment; France 0.7 per cent and the United Kingdom 1.7 per cent.  The House will <Col N="1079" /> observe that the level ranges from a low of 0.5 per cent to a maximum investment of 4.1 per cent in the case of the Netherlands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In this respect I do not consider it a good idea for us to compare ourselves with countries such as France or Japan.  I am interested to know what is the figure for Germany. Surely in a country such as ours, on which so many jobs depend on a clean, green image, we should not compare ourselves with countries such as France or Japan.  We have very much more to lose or gain by investment in research into environmental protection and in clean technologies.  We should not cite the levels of investment in countries such as Japan and France as constituting the norm or basis on which we shall decide how much we will invest in environmental protection.  Will the Minister give the House a guarantee that that investment figure will be revised upwards in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a continuous review and new funding mechanisms are being put in place.  Before giving the House details of those mechanisms, I would like to know why Deputy Dempsey feels we should compare ourselves with Germany and not with France.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Germany is one of the leaders in producing clean environmental technology.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree with that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>We strive to spend money effectively but we cannot expect to have the resources to allow us compete with Germany.  We might more readily compare our investment level with that of Canada where it is 1.6 per cent, or with Austria &mdash; which regards <Col N="1080" /> itself as a very pro-environment country &mdash; where the comparable figure is 1.8 per cent.  There are new funding mechanisms now available to us.  The Environmental Protection Agency is administering the research and development sub-programme of the Operational Programme for Environmental Services 1994-99 which provides for expenditure of some £5 million on two separate measures, namely, environmental sustainable resource management and cleaner production.  Five research projects under those headings are already under way and details of contracts for an additional six are being finalised.  Certainly I want to maximise the levels of money available for environmental research generally, as I did when I served in the Department of Health.  I substantially increased the moneys available for health research which was of benefit to an economy like ours.  We should not play down our significant achievements by saying we are not doing well enough if we do not equal the best.  We should accept that, compared to many well placed economically advanced countries, we are doing quite well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>My approach to this matter is philosophically different from that of the Minister.  We should aim not just to be good but to be as good as the best.  I have been trying to get information from various bodies, including the Department of the Environment, on a particular clean technology process, for reducing waste and have been unable to find anybody who has done research on it here.  Nobody seems to have information on the process of vitrification, nor is anybody looking for that information.  My understanding is that if it were introduced here &mdash; and there are people interested in introducing it &mdash; it would cut down on the amount of landfill sites we need.  My point is that we do not have the information we need, and we should have it.  Our commitment to environmental standards and their importance to our economy mean we should be spending more not less, in <Col N="1081" /> percentage terms, than countries like Germany.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy says about the availability of and research on a particular technology.  We cannot research the same range of subjects as the more developed economies which have a factor of many times ours in money terms to spend on research. We have to target our research and we do that very effectively.  We get much better value for the money we spend on research here than they do in virtually any other country.</P>
      <P>The Environmental Protection Agency has a new competence in evaluating and administering research.  I invite the Deputy, if he has queries, to direct them to the Environmental Protection Agency.  If he gets no satisfaction, he may direct his queries back to me and I will raise them with the Environmental Protection Agency.  My objective is, first, to maximise the total resource available for environmental research here and, equally, to get the best value for that relatively small resource, as it is bound to be in an economy the size of ours.  That is the overriding principle I would bring to bear in my administration of environmental research.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that polluted watercourses are one of our greatest environmental problems? Has there been any contact between the Department of the Environment and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry in regard to a study carried out in Monaghan with INTERREG funding, none of the recommendations of which has been implemented?  It seems that what is everybody's business is nobody's business between the Department of the Environment and the Department of Agriculture.</P>

      <P>Although I share a constituency with my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, I think he is well able to account for his <Col N="1082" /> own administration of the REPS programme. I have had discussions with him on co-ordination of our efforts.  For example, an investment programme from the sanitary services provision of my Department will be dovetailed with a targeted investment programme under the REPS programme from his Department so that we can take a water catchment overview of investment.  It will mean I am not solving, through investment in waste water treatment, part of a problem that is not being cleaned up on the agricultural side.  That level of co-ordination is ongoing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>The final report of the Dublin Transportation Initiative (DTI) which I launched last August sets out an integrated transport strategy for the greater Dublin area.  In addition to significant public transport improvements and some limited road development, the recommended measures include parking restraint, truck management measures, environmental traffic cells and traffic calming arrangements.  The Dublin Transportation Office was set up on a statutory basis last month, with a steering committee which will be responsible for co-ordinating and monitoring implementation. In addition, there will be a director of traffic for Dublin who will have overall operational responsibility and a range of specific functions in the traffic management field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1083" /> I am satisfied that the DTI strategy, which has been endorsed by the Government, and the implementation arrangements decided on, represent the best possible package of measures to resolve the traffic and transportation problems of the Dublin area.  It is the intention that implementation will be pursued vigorously, with the support of the funds allocated for the purpose in the Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-99.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>What is the DTI strategy? I have seen no improvement in Dublin traffic which has worsened in recent times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>I will arrange for a copy of the DTI final report to be sent to the Deputy.  It is probably the most comprehensive analysis of the problems of Dublin traffic ever undertaken.  It certainly involved the greatest consultation process ever undertaken on any subject, and includes detailed analysis of the opinions of motorists, pedestrians, road users of every kind.  The strategy involves a number of measures, including the completion of the ring road around Dublin, traffic calming measures within the ring road system, the building of the light rail system, details of which will be announced today by my colleague, the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, the building of strategic bus corridors, extension of the DART, the co-ordination of traffic under a single director of traffic for Dublin and the creation of a particular office, the Dublin Transportation Office, which will have a variety of statutory controls to deal with all the issues that impinge on good traffic management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is all very well for the 21st century.  I would like to know what plans, if any, the Minister has to deal with traffic in the next few years.  Is he prepared to entertain measures such as banning heavy traffic and machinery <Col N="1084" /> from city centre streets during rush hours?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>The role of the new director of traffic &mdash; who will be appointed in the first part of next year, not in the dim and distant future &mdash; will be to take responsibility from the Garda Síochána for the operation and augmentation of the traffic warden system, the on-the-spot fines system and the tow away services in Dublin, to look at the introduction of wheel clamping, be responsible for the implementation and enforcement of parking restraint policies, including the prosecution of on-the-spot fines, and to deal with all traffic management measures, including matters about which the Deputy talked. Rather than making the decision in the Custom House, we have a very detailed strategy that has been worked on for a number of years, which has Government approval, which has engaged all the sectoral interests involved in traffic in Dublin, including the local authorities who are representative of all those strands of interest.  That is the correct way to go forward.  I am determined to push very hard because I recognise that if we do not implement the broad-ranging strategies outlined in this document, we will allow the city of Dublin to choke, and that would be in nobody's interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the DTI report.  It will have a positive effect, but not until the next century.  What will the new director of traffic do in regard to the traffic to Dublin Port next year from Stena Sealink?  The Minister's colleagues in Government climbed over each other in their haste to tell everyone in their constituency the good news that Stena Sealink will operate from Dublin Port.  There will be chaos in the city as thousands of trucks converge on the port.  This is an example of the NIMBY syndrome.  The hands of the new authority will be tied.  The DTI proposals will not come into force for many years and in the meantime there will be traffic <Col N="1085" /> chaos.  I appreciate the Government is tackling the problem but this will have a negative effect on what it is trying to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>That is being investigated but I am sure Waterford will not turn business away in the interim.  This is a growing economy.  One third of the population is in Dublin and the volume of traffic will increase.  That is why we are investing £120 million in a new port access tunnel from Whitehall, details of which are being finalised.  Nobody can wave a magic wand.  An assessment has been carried out and there is significant European Union and domestic funding that we are willing to commit to projects such as the port access tunnel, road building, the light rail system, extension of the DART, strategic bus corridors, better access for pedestrians, cycle lanes and making it more difficult for traffic to choke the city by making public transport more accessible.  This cannot be done overnight but we are committed to achieving it as soon as possible.</P>

When will the director be appointed? The Minister's colleague made an announcement on light rail today.

      <P>I want to achieve an effective implementation process.  We have come a long way in 12 months &mdash; the transportation office is up and running, the chairman of the steering committee has been appointed and I have sought nominations from the local authorities and others in relation to the monitoring committee.  I agree that we would like something to happen instantly but we cannot achieve that. We have the resources to implement the various proposals and will do so as quickly as possible.  I do not have a closed mind on banning certain categories of traffic at specified times.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister say that.  A competent body stated recently that there is more pollution as a result of bad transport policies than there is from cars.  Does the Minister accept there is a strong argument for banning certain categories of through traffic from the city centre and from suburban estates rather than putting resources into dealing with the matter when the damage has been done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Mr. Howlin Mr. Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Howlin</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes one has to argue different points of view depending on the question.  There are questions on the devolvement of powers to local authorities and I am sure I will be asked if I intend to allow local authorities to make decisions.  They have the power, in consultation with the Commissioner, to prohibit access to streets, <Col N="1087" /> if they so determine.  It is a matter for them to decide.  Is it more appropriate for the Minister to make the decision or should it be left to the local elected representatives? The local authorities have power to do this under the Road Traffic Act and that is the preferable way to deal with the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister referred to light rail.  Does he accept that there is an imbalance in phase one and that it does not do anything for the northside of the city?  There will not be any facility to offload people from the inner city to the northside of the city. Will the Minister condemn phase one as it is unsatisfactory?  The DART runs to Howth.  The light rail system must take the needs of the city into account.  Why does phase one not have one arm to the north and one to the south instead of two arms to the south?  As regards the director of traffic, are there experts in his party on this and could the making of such an appointment pose a problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What is wrong?  Why the delay?  On what date was this report commissioned and what was the target date at that time?  Newspaper reports as far back as last February referred to the report as being in draft form and one had the impression it would be available by St. Patrick's Day.  Who has been sitting on the report?  The Minister of State has informed us it is at &ldquo;final draft stage&rdquo;.  Does that mean that she did not like what she got and sent it back to be changed?</P>
      <P>The Minister was asked some time ago about the usual assessment of homelessness and she replied she was waiting for the ESRI report.  The delay in finalising this report is a device to cover up and excuse not going ahead with the assessment of homelessness.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESRI, which is a reputable organisation, was commissioned to carry out this report.  I look forward to its publication which I expect will be by the end of this year.  It is completed and I hope it will be published soon.  It is a major report and I will <Col N="1089" /> remind the Deputy of its extent.  The objectives of the research were broad and included the nature of housing need; the extent, urgency, acuteness and duration of that need; the most appropriate and efficient response; the procedures in local authorities; the trends in social housing needs; and, the promotion of a better informed public debate.  In effect, everything to do with housing need was considered in the research.  It will be useful for us to have that body of work in order to improve and develop housing policy.</P>
      <P>I presume the Deputy is aware that the assessment for housing need will be carried out in March 1996.  The assessment for homeless people will be carried out in a way which will give us, as far as is possible, accurate information. Inevitably, it will be difficult for us to get a 100 per cent accurate figure for homelessness because of its nature and the mobility of the homeless.</P>
      <P>I expect a more accurate picture from local authorities with regard to this assessment.  It is important to get an accurate picture.  The last assessment was carried out in 1993 and the figure was disputed by the voluntary sector which came up with its own figures.  Its figures, of their nature, cannot be accurate as they were largely based on the experience of the voluntary bodies and anecdotal evidence.</P>
      <P>I want to ensure that the assessment of housing need in relation to homelessness is as accurate as possible.  I will require local authorities to have a thorough examination of the situation in the field.  I have treated homelessness seriously and the review of the plan for social housing which we published earlier in the year enabled us to meet our responsibilities in regard to the increased programme of house building, increased measures with regard to the capital assistance schemes and the other benefits, and the provision of voluntary bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The newspaper report in February which gave the impression <Col N="1090" /> the report would be finished in a number of weeks quoted an ESRI official. With regard to the assessment of the homeless the Minister refers to the local authorities giving proper data.  Would it not be best to have an independent body, such as the ESRI, do the next assessment rather than have the local authorities do it?</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that some of the voluntary bodies were unhappy with the data the last time and unhappy with the definition of homelessness.  The local authorities did not all interpret the 1988 Act in the proper way.  Would it not be better to have an independent body carry out the assessment?</P>
      <P>I am concerned about some aspects of the report.  It is indicated that in future allocations will have to be based on the new realities of the housing situation.  It seems to be suggested that traditional cases might be sidelined and those who would be housed in the future would be today's emergency, for example, whoever arrived off the boat or train on any given morning.  The Department has insisted that the local authorities do away with the two years residency clause whereby one had to have been living in Dublin for two years to get a house.  The suggestion now is that whoever arrived on the train on any given morning will get the best house available. That would be a kick in the teeth to those who have been on the waiting list for many years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Local authorities have a lot of experience in that regard.  The <Col N="1091" /> real issue is to ensure that local authorities are liaising with the voluntary sector and, thereby, getting the full information they need to make the assessment.</P>
      <P>With regard to its commitment to housing the Government can be judged on its results.  There has been a considerable increase in commitment to and funding for the housing programme. There is much activity around the country and it is addressing a real housing need built up over some time. The previous Government also made a commitment on which we have expanded.  There is a backlog on housing lists.  The needs have to be clearly defined but we have to keep in mind the genuine needs that have to be addressed.</P>
      <P>I assure the Deputy we will be responsible in relation to our obligations in providing for housing need. This report is a research document: it is not what determines housing policy of itself as that responsibility is mine and the Department's.  Housing policy will be informed and enhanced by having this research at our disposal.  I am glad the ESRI has been able to carry out such an important task.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister took pride in the Government's record in relation to homelessness and I would not try to dent that pride.  Does the Minister accept that more comprehensive integrated policy measures need to be put in place to target the problem of homelessness? This set of measures needs to take account of preventative measures, immediate response measures on a 24 hour basis and well managed emergency accommodation.  Does the Minister accept that those elements as part of an integrated package for homelessness are <Col N="1092" /> vital to address the problem?  Does she accept they are not in place at present and what is she prepared to do about it in the short to medium term?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizMcManus" hpid="Ms McManus Ms McManus">
      <NameTxt>Ms McManus</NameTxt>
      <P>Our ability to produce the review earlier in the year was an important factor in addressing some of the major concerns articulated by the voluntary sector.  I pay tribute to that sector's provision for homeless people as it has done tremendous work.  I have completed a tour of all the hostels in the Dublin region, where the bulk of homeless people are, and I am impressed by the work carried out by the various voluntary bodies but the need for greater co-ordination is clear and it would be welcomed by the voluntary sector.  Considerable public funding is spent on provision for the homeless and rightly so. In European terms our record is quite good and we must keep improving it. Co-ordination is necessary to ensure we are targeting and meeting that need in the most efficient and desirable way.  I am taking the matter seriously.</P>

What action does she propose to take so that she will have a much more integrated approach with the health boards, for instance, who are likely to have far more statistical data on homelessness than local authorities or the Department of Social Welfare?

      <P>I am raising a matter which is of national rather than local importance.  I request the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, to take immediate steps to have the wild boar herd recently imported into this country urgently tested for all known exotic swine diseases, particularly diseases such as Teschen disease and trichinella which are prevalent in eastern bloc countries, namely Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. There could be a serious national problem for the Minister's Department because of the lack of discipline.  The Minister should advise his veterinary section to be vigilant at ports of entry for imported stock as it is known that no veterinary inspector would have been present in Rosslare on Wednesday last, 6 December, at 6 p.m. when the imported stock in question arrived by ferry.  If the Department had not been alerted&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No.  For the last week, this side of the House has sought an opportunity to debate the Book of Estimates for 1996 which the Government completed last Thursday night.  From previous experience Members will know it takes three days for the book to be ready after it is agreed, which means the Government would have the Book of Estimates today or, at the latest, tomorrow.</P>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach give some time to discuss it this week?  We have received a draft Order of Business for the week which does not allow an opportunity to discuss the 1996 Estimates; the Appropriation Bill is to be taken without debate; and there was an attempt to take the joint communiqué on Northern Ireland without debate, but that has been changed.  It has been the practice in this House for many years to have a debate either on the Appropriation Bill, the draft Estimates, or the Estimates in their final form.  Before this side decides whether we oppose the Order of Business, I ask the Taoiseach for a debate on this issue during the week.</P>

      <P>I am surprised to hear that it took 11 days to print the Estimates.

      <P>Deputy McCreevy's question requires an answer.  It has come to the Opposition's attention that on the papers surrounding the Supplementary Estimate there is a note that the money is not required for 1995.  It has always been the practice that money voted by this House, or an Oireachtas Committee, related to the year it was passed.

This is a device to increase the Estimate for this year by £60 million, which will be paid into a special account and will not be expended until next year.  It has taken £60 million out of the Estimates for next year, which represents 0.5 per cent.  This is a fraudulent accounting device.

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;7.&mdash;From the date of operation of this Act, a judge sitting in any Court shall be addressed as `Bhreitheamh' or `Judge'.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There is a typographical error, the amendment should read: &ldquo;As and from the date of the coming into operation of this Act, a judge sitting in any Court shall be addressed as `a Bhreitheamh' or `Judge'.&rdquo;.  It was Shakespeare in one of his more romantic moods who said that a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>That has a certain amount of merit, but from the Circuit Court up a judge is normally referred to by counsel as &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo;.  Symbolic vestiges of what one might describe as old Victorian decency have no place in post colonial Ireland.  The time has come to express the view that this is a young Republic in a new Europe and that the addressing of a judge as &ldquo;my Lord&rdquo; is now arcane, belongs to a different age.  We do not have nobility or lords, in so far as there are lords my understanding is that they are attached to the British House of Lords.  In those circumstances this amendment should be accepted by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is noteworthy that in section 6 the Minister proposes that the Supreme Court would be constituted of the President thereof, namely, the Chief Justice, who is described in this section as An Príomh-Bhreitheamh.  Section 6 (2) (b) states that ordinary judges of the Supreme Court shall be styled as Breitheamh den Chúirt Uachtarach.  In those circumstances there is a solid reason that in future judges would be <Col N="1220" /> referred to as &ldquo;a Bhreitheamh&rdquo; or &ldquo;Judge&rdquo;.  That would be much more prudent and appropriate to the Irish Republic than any terminology which refers to nobility, which is a relic of our colonial past.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the spirit of the amendment.  In the equality provisions in the Constitution there is reference to not conferring titles of honour or nobility on citizens, but the Courts Act of the 1960s provided for a mode of address.  The reason I am particularly moved to support Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment is that there are a number of women judges in our courts and they find themselves in the peculiar position where barristers call them &ldquo;her lordship&rdquo; or &ldquo;her ladyship&rdquo;&mdash; one High Court judge stated that she wants to be referred to as &ldquo;Judge&rdquo;.  The time has come for this matter to be regularised, but I suggest that the proper place to do so in the rules of the courts.</P>

      <P>I support the amendment. As Deputy O'Donoghue said, lords disappeared from Ireland in 1922.  After a great struggle, we managed to get rid of some of the archaic dress in the courts and what we are trying to do here is get rid of the archaic language.  There is an onus on the Minister to explain why she refuses to accept this eminently reasonable amendment.  I take Deputy McDowell's point that this change may be made in the rules of court but we should take the opportunity to do so here in similar circumstances as the mode of dress has been changed.  If the Minister does not take on board the amendment I would be intrigued to know the reason.</P>

      <P>It reminds me of the old expression that you should get your retaliation in first, and the Deputy is good at getting in ahead of what I am going to say.</P>
      <P>I accept the principle behind the amendment, to ensure that with the passage of time the procedures of the court are modernised.  A number of steps have been taken in this Bill and previous legislation to make such changes, but I am not convinced it is appropriate to deal with the amendment in this primary legislation.  As Deputy McDowell said, that is a matter of procedure that comes within the responsibility of the rules committee, which is made up of judges and others.  The Superior Court Rules Committee includes the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the Master of the High Court, two practising barristers and two practising solicitors.  Rules made by various committees provide for the modes of address of judges in the Superior Court, Circuit Court and District Court.  I am satisfied that if judges wish to change their mode of address they could put forward suitable proposals to the rules committee in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wonder what we would think if somebody outside this House decided we should change our title.  I think we would want the Committee of Procedure and Privileges to consider the matter.  There are probably people outside this House who think the very civilised rule of bowing is a little out of date.  We do not normally bow to each other in normal relationships with <Col N="1222" /> people, but Members are obliged to show respect for the Chair.  It is not appropriate for Members to deal with this matter in primary legislation.  I have no doubt this debate will be brought to the attention of judges who may consider the customs and practices in the courts and perhaps change the terms of address themselves.  There is merit in what Deputy O'Donoghue said.  I recommend that he raise the matter with the working committee on the courts and make judges aware of his views on how they should address each other.  The remit of that working group is to consider such issues.  I do not believe it is appropriate to include the provision in this legislation.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her reply but I fundamentally disagree that the matter should not be legislated for.  Surely it must be accepted that this House has responsibility in the final analysis to give a lead in such matters. It has been my experience that the rules committee to date has not decided to implement changes such as this, nor am I aware of any proposal brought before that committee to discuss the issue.  In those circumstances I believe the relevant provision should be inserted in the Bill.</P>
      <P>Under the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act, 1961, to which I referred in the context of section 6 (2) of this Bill, the style by which the Chief Justice and ordinary judges of the Supreme Court are to be known is specified in Irish.  I see no difficulty with this House deciding, as an expression of its independence and mature and sovereign place in the world, that our judges would be addressed in appropriate Irish or, if they so prefer it, English terminology. I would have thought that would be an important symbolic act in the context of a new young Ireland which is emerging ever more strongly in a new young Europe.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 8, to delete lines 30 to 33 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo; `judicial office' means an office being the office of Chief Justice, ordinary judge of the Supreme Court, President of the High Court, ordinary judge of the High Court, President of the Circuit Court, ordinary judge of the Circuit Court, President of the District Court or judge of the District Court.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment was discussed in great detail on Committee Stage and I do not intend to devote much time to it, but other Members may have different views.  The effect of the amendment provides that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board should recommend persons for appointment to all judicial offices, including the positions of Chief Justice and president of the various courts.  The Minister for Justice rejected a similar amendment on Committee Stage.  It is difficult to understand why an amendment such as this would be rejected.  If the argument is advanced with any degree of cogency that the appointment of judges to the various courts should be recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, it is difficult to understand the logic of excluding from the remit of that board persons who may be appointed president of those courts or Chief Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some judges might not like their peers to make recommendations to Government in respect of their suitability for appointment to the position of president of a court or Chief Justice. It is difficult to understand why such an individual is obliged to go before that board to be appointed a judge in the first instance.  It might be considered that eminent judges might not be inclined to go before the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board for fear that they might not be recommended for the presidency of a given court or the position of Chief Justice.  Conversely, and with equal cogency, the <Col N="1224" /> argument can be made that an eminent barrister working in the Law Library might not be inclined to go before that board because he or she would be aware that its composition would have been considerably widened and colleagues might learn that the board did not recommend that individual's appointment. To quote Shakespeare, if a barrister of long standing, earning a substantial sum of money were &ldquo;to do the State some service&rdquo;, that barrister would not like word to spread to colleagues that he or she had failed for the fourth or fifth time to be recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.</P>

      <P>The recent two appointments must have slipped by the Minister.  If we go down the road of judicial appointments being recommended by a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and the requirement that all those who wish to become judges must go before that board which recommends appointments to the Minister, it does not seem logical to exclude the appointment of presidents of the various courts or the position of Chief Justice from the remit of that board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Considerable time was devoted to a similar amendment on Committee Stage.  Under the 1994 Bill the appointment of presidents to the various courts was excluded from the remit of the Judicial Appointments <Col N="1225" /> Advisory Board, but Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment seeks to include them within the remit of the board.  On Committee Stage I said that it was appropriate that individuals applying for the position of president of one of the various courts should not have to go before the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.</P>
      <P>The Government will be guided by section 23 of the Bill which obliges the Government to have regard for the suitability of serving judges when appointing persons to fill these high offices. Like politicians, the work of most judges, with the exception of cases held in camera, is open to public scrutiny, criticism, praise and the glare of the media.  The public can assess if judges are suitable for the high office of president of the court in which they serve.  It is not appropriate that such individuals should be obliged to go before an advisory board as many of them will have gone through that procedure to become judges.  A barrister or solicitor who is appointed a judge must go before the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. Judges who are considered for the position of president of the various courts of Chief Justice will have gone through that procedure when their appointments were recommended by the Government of the day to the President.  It is not appropriate that judges should go before the advisory board for such senior positions.  The Government should retain the initiative to consider the suitability of serving judges for those high positions.  Deputy O'Donoghue has not said anything to change my mind in that regard.  Despite the speed with which the earlier Bill was prepared, it was decided that it was appropriate that appointments to such high offices should not fall within the remit of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In case Deputy O'Dea speaks on this, I retaliate by saying that I could not anticipate what decisions might have been made if the earlier Bill had gone to Committee Stage.  I can only respond to what Deputy O'Dea said on Committee Stage that almost everything that <Col N="1226" /> was included in the earlier Bill that his party wishes to include in this one seemed to be up for grabs on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

      <P>I outlined the logic of the matter and explained that what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.  As the Minister has decided not to accept this amendment, the only logical conclusion I can draw is that she is not satisfied with the concept of a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. If it is not appropriate for individuals being appointed to the position of president of one of the courts or Chief Justice to go before a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and such individuals are to be appointed by the Government without recommendation, I draw the conclusion that the Minister and the Government suspect that it may not be the best idea for barristers seeking judicial appointment to go before that board for fear they may be rejected and that decision would be the subject of common gossip and, in some instances, a matter of ridicule, even of a jocose sort.  As the Minister will not accept the amendment, I withdraw it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 9, to delete line 3.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 seeks to delete the Attorney General from a position on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  Amendment No. 4 suggests that the chairman of the Law Reform Commission should be a member of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. In general terms, this amendment had already been explained on Committee Stage.  My view and that of my party was that it is not desirable to have the Attorney General, who is an <i>ex officio</i> member of the Cabinet and the first law officer in the land, as a member of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, first, for the reason that he is a member of the Cabinet and, secondly, his independence is being interfered with where judicial appointments are concerned.  It would be preferable if the Attorney General were to advise the Minister and the Government on the suitability of the members recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  I do not think he can do this with the same degree of independence if he is excluded from the board.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 11 is merely consequential in that it would provide that there would then be no need for the Attorney General to withdraw from the board if it was considering whether the should be recommended for appointment as a judge by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  In general terms it is not desirable that the Attorney General be a member of the board.  I have explained the reasons and I leave it to the Minister to reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Donoghue's amendment.  The Minister should take this last opportunity to have a careful look at the change proposed in this amendment and the onus is on her to explain the reason she is taking the President of the Law Reform Commission off the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  She did not answer that question on Committee Stage. <Col N="1228" /> There is an onus on her to state precisely the reason she proposes to appoint the Attorney General to the board.  To my knowledge that was not explained to anybody's satisfaction on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Donoghue said, I am sure the Minister will consult the Attorney General, when a person has been recommended for appointment by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, when she is making her final decision.  From that point of view it is totally inappropriate that he should be on the board which submits the list in the first place.  In the ludicrous situation where the Attorney General is interested, there is a provision stating that he must step aside from the board. If he steps aside from the board and is not appointed he participates in the debate relating to other appointments. This will not make for a good relationship between the Attorney General and his other colleagues on the board.  I suspect the real reason the Attorney General is replacing the President of the Law Reform Commission on the board is to make up a part of a Government block of four, 40 per cent of the board, which would recommend not fewer than seven people to the Minister.  The Minister is well aware that where 40 per cent of any board represents a particular interest it can ensure when submitting not fewer than seven names, that any desired name goes forward.  That is the object of the exercise.  The Minister should examine this carefully and tell us the reason she considers the President of the Law Reform Commission is not a fit person to be a member of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and the reason the Attorney General should be a member of that board, particularly when he has another function in relation to giving advice when the Minister or the Government of the day are making their final decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was correct in saying that, in principle, the Deputy does not have any worry about lay people on the board, he is just worried about how they might be appointed.  I remind Deputies, as I did on Committee Stage, that during the aborted Second Stage of the original Bill, the then Minister, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, in view of what many people said that they felt the advisory board was overloaded with legal people &mdash; judges, barristers, solicitors &mdash; but nobody with any other aspect to bring to the consideration of recommending names for judical appointment, wisely, said she would be open to considering that point on Committee Stage.  I considered that point.  I did not have a Committee Stage then because the Bill died.  I believe the points made then were valid and reasonable and I have taken them on board in accordance with a good tradition in this House where there was a general feeling that the board would be strengthened by having lay people on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members will recall that on Committee Stage I strengthened the appointment of those people by indicating the <Col N="1230" /> type of experience and knowledge they would need to be considered.  I reject the allegation by the Deputy that it might live up to his expectations.  It is wrong for Members to automatically assume that the names of the lay people I would bring to Government for consideration for appointment to the board would be of low calibre, of a particular persuasion or no persuasion.  Members should deal with the issue rather than anticipate who those people might be and their particular affiliation.  That is how I do my job.  I ask Members to respect that I will not be necessarily bound by the words of Members opposite who say that, automatically, I must appoint three party people to the board.</P>

I have no idea of the politics of a number of people I have appointed to various working groups, etc.  I have asked various bodies to appoint people, some of whom may well be the biggest supporters of the Deputy's party.</P>

The time has come for members on all sides to respect people for the job they might or might not do based on their qualifications for doing that job.  Everybody in this country should vote.  If you persevere you will find a political persuasion somewhere, it may be very deep.  The appointment of three lay people to the board is a step forward and will strengthen the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Attorney General has been appointed to the board.  This is not because the President of the Law Reform Commission, even now or in the future, may or may not be a suitable <Col N="1231" /> person.  It has no relevance to suitability. I have decided I would like to have the Attorney General on the board for precisely the reason Deputy O'Donoghue highlighted.  The Attorney General will bring the information back to the Cabinet when it is considering the recommendations of the advisory board.  It is right and proper that Office of the Attorney General, who is the senior law officer of the land, should be involved in the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  Although the Deputies have prefaced all their remarks by saying they are not saying this about the present Attorney General, it makes me wonder whether they are drawing an inference&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This section should stand as it is.  We had a detailed discussion on the matter and it is appropriate that the Attorney General should be on the board.  It is also appropriate that there is an opportunity to appoint people who are not judges, barristers or solicitors to assist the advisory board in its work.</P>

      <P>It has become clearer following the Minister's reply that the Attorney General should not be on the board.  She stated that it was necessary for the Attorney General to be on the board so that he could subsequently advise her.  It now appears that the Attorney General will not only sit at the court of first instance but that he will also be the court of appeal.  This is undesirable for the reasons I have stated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the three persons to be appointed by the Minister, nobody has objected to the appointment of lay people to the board.  That is a figment of the Minister's imagination.  Rather we <Col N="1232" /> are dealing with the motivation behind appointing three lay people to the board.  It is clear that the Government intends to appoint these three people and the Attorney General to the board to give it, in effect, a 40 per cent shareholding.</P>

      <P>Given that the Bill proposes that at least seven names should be submitted to the Government by the board for consideration for judicial appointment, it is evident to anyone with any sense that the intention is to make absolutely sure that the names the Government wants appear before it.  In that context, anyone who believes anything else is living in fantasy land.</P>
      <P>The interesting point is that when the Bill was originally framed in November 1994 the Labour Party had a considerable input into it.  It trumpeted and heralded on the streets that this Bill would ensure transparency and openness in regard to the appointment of the Judiciary, regardless of the fact that under the 1937 Constitution this was a sovereign duty of government anyhow. The aim was to give the impression that the appointments board would be entirely independent.  In that context, it did not refer to the three people who would be appointed by the Government or to the Attorney General.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>One wonders what happened during the past year.  My suggestion is that inasmuch as the Bill was an urgent imperative one year ago, the Government worked flat out for one full year to make absolutely sure that it would take that length of time to produce this urgent imperative minimally revised in a most intriguing way. By including these provisions the Government will have a 40 per cent shareholding in the appointments <Col N="1233" /> board.  This board will not be independent and nobody could believe otherwise.</P>
      <P>If the Minister had said not more than three persons would be appointed by her and that one of these would be the President for the time being of the Chamber of Commerce of Ireland or the President for the time being of the Vintners' Federation of Ireland then she would have no difficulty in convincing Deputy O'Dea or me that the intention was to ensure there would be a lay input.  However, it is clear that this is about a lay political input.  Bolstering this point of view is the fact that not only will 30 per cent of the board be appointed by the Minister but the Attorney General, an <i>ex officio</i> member of the Cabinet, will also be appointed, bringing the Government's shareholding to 40 per cent.</P>
      <P>I have nothing against the Attorney General &mdash; the present Attorney General is one of the finest legal brains of his or any other generation &mdash; but the Government is playing politics with this board and Bill.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 5:</P>
      <P>In page 10, line 28, to delete &ldquo;at least seven&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;not less than three and not more than five&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister originally suggested to the House that the names of not more than ten persons would be submitted by the appointments advisory board for appointment to the Judiciary.  This was subsequently changed to at least seven names.  Under the original November 1994 Bill when the Labour Party was in Government with Fianna Fáil and following the famous meeting at Baldonnel it was proposed that the judicial appointments advisory board would recommend not fewer than three persons and not more than five persons. The idea at that time was to give some autonomy, limited though it had to be by the Constitution, to the appointments board in making recommendations to the Minister.  It must have been perfectly clear to the Tánaiste and the Labour Party that if one extended the number of names which could be submitted to the Government then one would negate to a large extent the effectiveness and autonomy of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know what changed between November last year and December this year but we now have the extraordinary situation where the judicial appointments advisory board must submit at least seven names.  I stress that the board is not being asked to submit for recommendation not more than seven names, but rather is being told to submit at least seven names.  Given the Government's 40 per cent shareholding on the board this means that the board could decide to submit seven, 77 or 777 names.  On one occasion the Minister for the Environment on the recommendation of this House sent each local authority a list of the applicants for lottery funding from their county requesting it to prioritise and return the <Col N="1235" /> list.  The lists were returned but I do not recall that they were prioritised.</P>

      <P>I am beginning to wonder if the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board will operate in the same way.  Will it decide in the final analysis that it is best to send the Minister for Justice at least seven names or in effect the names of all applicants?  There is nothing in this Bill preventing the board from doing just that.  If the board does so, what is it all about?  We have a broadened board that can recommend many names to the Government.  Guess who then makes the choice &mdash; the Government.  With the changes that have been introduced during the past year one gets the feeling that the Labour Party, in particular, has decided that political expediency is the better part of valour.  Having made that decision, the Bill has been changed to the point where theoretically this Judicial Appointments Advisory Board effectively could be called a charade.  Its autonomy is gone, the Government holds a 40 per cent stake in its membership and every name that comes before it can be sent on to the Government for appointment to judicial office.  It is difficult to understand that in the context of the 1994 Bill.  I think the Minister should tell the House why the figures were changed from &ldquo;at least three and not more than five names&rdquo; to &ldquo;at least seven names&rdquo;.  One might as well have said at least 100 names or at least one because the board is left with the discretion &mdash; and perhaps it might consider it its obligation &mdash; to send as many names as it wishes to the Government for appointment to the judicial office.  This makes no sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendments I have tabled are the original provisions but it appears to me that the story got lost in the telling as far as the Labour Party is concerned. At some point, quite when I do not know, the Labour Party changes its mind and decided it was not such a good <Col N="1236" /> idea after all to allow the board to take part in the selection process, that it would be better that the Government retain that discretion for itself.  Labour party members did not turn up to debate this Bill, except one Minister who turned up briefly on Committee Stage, and they are not here this evening.  That is extraordinary when one considers the Labour Party believed this legislation to be imperative in November 1994.  What is even more extraordinary &mdash; mind boggling, in fact &mdash; is that the powers of the board have been so broadened that it does not appear to exist any more.  That is the extraordinary political acrobatics that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs appears to be able to exercise on the high wire of political life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has made much of the provisions of the earlier Bill and accused us of wanting to insert in this Bill things we did not include in the earlier Bill.  One measure in that Bill was a proper filtering system for the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. The 1994 Bill stated quite clearly that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board should recommend not less than three and not more than five names for consideration for appointment to the Bench.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment introduced originally by the Minister specified that the board would have to recommend not fewer than ten names.  Under the 1994 Bill the totality of what was required of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was a list of names, not fewer than three and not more than five.  Under this Bill it is proposed that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board send two lists, first a list of everybody who has applied and, second, a list of not less than ten names for consideration.  The Minister in an effort to delude us reduced the number from ten to seven, but that of course makes a difference because it states &ldquo;not less than seven&rdquo;.  Not less than one, not less than seven or not less than ten all means the same thing &mdash; the <Col N="1237" /> number of names the board is empowered to send to the Minister is unlimited. I can envisage many situations where the second list could almost be as long as the first list.  As Deputy O'Donoghue rightly says, there is hardly any point in compiling the second list.  The board will follow the example of the local authorties in relation to the allocation of lottery funds.  Once the form is filled out properly it will send it on.</P>
    <P>The one obstruction to the Government in taking total control lay in the fact that if the Government had somebody in mind for appointment and wanted him to go through the charade of applying to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board it would have a problem if the person had not applied in the first place but section 14 (2) (d) provides that the board can alert persons to the vacancy and to send their name in for consideration.  This is not a proper filtering system for judicial appointments but a transparent effort by the Government to retain total control of judicial appointments.  If the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is required by law to send forward not less than seven names and the Government of the day controls 40 per cent of the board, is it not obvious that it can ensure the name the Government wants is sent to it?  This is a charade.  There is about as much honesty to it as the Government's set of accounts for 1996 which is a transparent scam.</P>
    <P>I say to the Minister and to the Labour Party, whose members are absent, that this will not wash.  I said on Committee Stage that it will change nothing and will please nobody but one can be absolutely certain that it will not fool anybody either.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments. We had a comprehensive debate on this issue on Committee Stage.  The point needs to be hammered home to the Minister that the elaborate procedure we are putting in place does not appear capable of achieving the real objective of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1238" /> We have already criticised the fact that the Government has a 40 per cent veto, through its 40 per cent control over its nominees to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  In insisting that the number of candidates should be not fewer than seven &mdash; that is the number of names being submitted by the board to Government &mdash; for appointment to judicial office, the Minister is removing any power that should properly reside in this newly appointed board.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage the Minister made the case, rather unconvincingly, that to reduce the list of candidates from three to five would unduly restrict the Government's discretion whereas I thought that was what we were about anyway, removing political influence from judicial appointments.  When it comes to the point, the Government cannot withhold that control and by maintaining a large number of candidates and packing the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, it is merely maintaining the <i>status quo</i> whereby it appoints whomsoever it wants to judicial office.</P>
    <P>This means that we are attempting to enshrine the <i>status quo</i> in our laws rather cynically.  The Government will continue to examine this list of seven candidates and the advisory board that will have submitted that list will have been reduced to the status of an elaborate postbox for potential candidates. The Government is not making any real attempt to evaluate, select or filter any of those candidates.  In fact it will have no power because those seven names submitted are too many and will allow the Government too much discretion to give any credence to the premise that this board will be exercising any depoliticising influence on the judicial appointments system.</P>
    <P>For that reason I support Deputy O'Donoghue's amendments which go to the heart of the absence of any real Government commitment to change the <i>status quo</i> and highlight his indictment of the Government, that it is merely copper-fastening the <i>status quo,</i> without <Col N="1239" /> any commitment to change the perception and/or reality that politics is linked intrinsically to judicial appointments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have gone through these provisions line by line and the same arguments have been repeated.</P>
      <P>I refute the allegation of what has been described as packing.  Any Attorney General, the senior law officer of this land, should not be referred to in this House as someone who is packing a board or would influence or suspend his judgment in a task such as this, or not advise the Government or not behave in a proper manner <i>vis-à-vis</i> a judicial advisory board.  I am sorry to have to refute that again, but that is the way Members' comments come across through their use of words like &ldquo;veto&rdquo;, &ldquo;packing&rdquo;, of 40 per cent control and so on.  Even if there were to be a vote taken at a meeting of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board at which the Attorney General and the three lay members ganged up &mdash; to repeat the kinds of expressions used in this debate &mdash; to push the name of a person to a vote, 60 per cent always will win over 40 per cent.  The way Members are portraying very eminent people performing that task, leads me to be thankful that I am not a barrister or being considered for appointment to judicial office, because if so, I would be highly insulted at their comments.</P>
      <P>They must remember they are talking about the Chief Justice, the Presidents of the High Court and Supreme Court, contending that those eminent people would be party to some kind of chicanery, packing or some such exercise not befitting their office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>That type of political point-scoring is quite distasteful. Indeed, Deputy O'Donoghue knows better than most other Members that, <Col N="1240" /> under our Constitution, the Government must advise the President on such judicial appointments.  No referendum has been held to change that practice. This board can be no more than advisory, as it was in 1994 and will remain so.</P>
      <P>Members argue for the submission of three to five names as opposed to seven proposed in my amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I might add that, even if the three to five continued to obtain, the Government would not be obliged to accept any of those candidates; it could make another selection.  Irrespective of the number of names presented to it, if it deemed it proper, the Government could select another candidate for appointment where there might be a need in a court for a given type of experience.  All of those factors must be taken into account by a Government in making any judicial appointment.</P>
      <P>Indeed the way Members argue leads me to conclude that perhaps the manner in which some parties or some Members made such appointments in the past is really what concerns them.  I am informing Members of the requisite limitations on this board under the Constitution. I should not have to lecture eminent lawyers, three of whom are present, and another Member who has legal training but, as she said, has not practised at the Bar or as a solicitor.  I cannot go against the constitutional imperative on the Government in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier Deputy O'Donoghue argued that solicitors and barristers might be slow to submit their names in the belief that their colleagues would know, might laugh at them &mdash; I think that was the expression he used &mdash; or ridicule them. If this board wishes to nominate and recommend more than seven names to Government, it should be able to do so. It has been suggested that up to 770 names may be submitted but everybody knows there will not be that number of applications for any judicial appointment, nor will there be that number of <Col N="1241" /> recommendations to Government.  The board will have to consider the names of candidates, or of those with whom they consult or invite to submit their names under whatever procedure it decides and, thereafter other factors such as whether any of them is fully qualified for appointment.  On occasions applicants may believe them to be qualified but their service as a solicitor or at the Bar may have been broken.  In such circumstances, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board will have to be satisfied that the requirements of section 5 (2), as amended, of the Courts (Establishment and Constitution) Act, 1961 are met in the case of any appointment to the High Court or Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>Nobody said this board will have power to make judicial appointments and it would be wrong of me or anybody else to pretend that that was the case or was its objective.  This is an advisory board and that is all it can be under the Constitution.  Some Members say that seven nominees are too many and suggest it would allow the Government greater discretion than it should have.  I might point out that three to five nominees gave the Government of that day all the discretion it needed.  If the Government do not consider any of the three to five nominees suitable for appointment and/or submission to the President, it can select another candidate. We must remember that the appointment of judges does not take place in a vacuum.  On the advice of that board, and in accordance with the needs of any vacancy, the Government must decide on and advise the President of the most suitable candidate.  Whether Members like it or not, that will be the task of this advisory board and was its task in November 1994 whatever the political background to its establishment, to which I was not privy.</P>
    <P>This will allow for names to be recommended to the Government and the remainder of the names to be given to the Government so it can see the range of names.  I believe that is what Deputy O'Donoghue is looking <Col N="1242" /> for by saying that barristers would be shy of putting their names forward.  This gives them a chance to be considered.  I have said it over and over again and I am sorry to have to say it again, but it is an advisory board.  I am not dressing it up as anything more than that; nor, indeed, did the last Government.  It is an advisory board due to the imperatives of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>I fully accept the Minister's statement that it is the duty of the Government, in accordance with the Constitution, to make judicial appointments.  I have made that point on numerous occasions, including in this House during the 1994 discussion on the Bill.  However, the 1994 Bill, in so far as these amendments were concerned, provided that at least three persons and not more than five persons would be recommended to the Government for judicial appointment.  That, quite clearly, circumscribed the discretion of the Executive and the Government to a certain extent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>To a certain extent it did, for the reason that it is also provided in the Bill at section 16 (8) that notice of an appointment to judicial office should be published in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and the notice shall, if it be the case, include a statement that the name of the person was recommended by the board to the Minister pursuant to the section. Effectively, if an individual recommended by the board was appointed, the Government would be obliged to publish in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the fact that the person it appointed was recommended by the board.  If the person appointed by the Government was not recommended by the board, there would be no reference to the board in <i>Iris Oifigiúil.</i> To that limited extent there is no doubt that the Government's discretion was circumscribed.  Only between three and five persons could be recommended by <Col N="1243" /> the board.  If the Government went outside of that, everybody would know that the Government had not appointed one of the people recommended by the board.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of this Bill the board must recommend at least seven, and it can recommend as many as it wants.  This means that under the broadened powers agreed to by the Labour Party during the year, the Government can appoint anybody it wishes.  The logic of that is that, because the board is empowered to advise the Government of as many names as it wishes, and irrespective of where on the list a person recommended by the board may or may not have been, there will hardly be an occasion when it will not be stated in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> that the individual was recommended by the board.  In those circumstances it makes perfect sense to say that the circumscribing to a limited extent of the discretion of Government in the interests of openness and transparency in the area of judicial appointments appears to have been abandoned by the Tánaiste and the Labour Party during 1995.  I can guess at the reasons, but it is not for me to give them because the jury is not here but out on the street, and I think the people have a fair idea what all this is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Constitution, it is the sovereign duty of the Government to make judicial appointments.  It could be argued that the 1994 system, under which up to five persons could be recommended and that the individual had applied to the board had to be stated if he was appointed, could alone have led to it becoming the convention for the board's nominee to the Government to be appointed.  It is also conceivable that that could have been the custom. It is even conceivable that that custom could have become law, but that would have been unconstitutional.  It is not a matter for me to decide on, but in fairness to everybody and in the interests of the transparency and openness the Tánaiste heralded and trumpeted last year, it must be made clear <Col N="1244" /> that this is nothing less than a charade. It is one of the biggest jokes ever to be passed through this House because its powers have been negated to the extent that the judicial appointments board might as well not exist.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 11, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;17.&mdash;(1)  The Minister shall, in appointing persons to the Board pursuant to section 13, subsection (2) (c), ensure that not fewer than one of the persons so appointed is a woman and not fewer than one of the persons so appointed is a man.</P>
      <P>(2)  In recommending to the Minister the names of persons for appointment to judicial officer pursuant to section 16, the Board shall ensure that not fewer than one of the persons whose names are so submitted is a woman and not fewer than one of the persons whose names are so submitted is a man.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of gender equity was raised on Committee Stage, not only in relation to the list of names which will be sent to the Government by the judicial advisory board but also in the context of the <Col N="1246" /> board's composition.  The participation of women in the administration of justice and at senior levels of decision-making on such a board is vital.  The Minister was warm and generous in her commitment to ensure, as best she could, that one of the appointees to the board, which is the gift of the Government, will be a woman.</P>
    <P>It is important that gender equity is enshrined in the legislation.  My amendment requests the Minister to include a requirement that there should be one woman on the panel appointed by the Minister to the board.  On Committee Stage all the Minister could do was assure me of her commitment to address the gender issue and I hope she is in a position to give a firmer response now.</P>
    <P>The second part of my amendment is to ensure that gender equity is addressed when the names of candidates for judicial appointment are sent to the Government for consideration. There should be one woman among the seven names, assuming a suitably qualified woman is willing to serve.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage the Minister was unsure of the relevance of a recent decision of a German court on the capability of the Government to enshrine such a section in the legislation.  I requested the Minister to come back to the House with the considered views of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform on this issue.  Under the present system, with all its faults women have been appointed and I want to ensure they are not forgotten in the new procedures we are putting in place.  It is a modest but important proposal.</P>
    <P>We often forget gender equity in many of our deliberations.  We must be vigilant.  The Government is committed to equality in making appointments to State boards and it is appropriate for the Minister to enshrine gender equity in this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Deputy's amendment.  In general, I am not impressed by a system that imposes quotas for any purpose.  I prefer to believe things can be achieved without <Col N="1247" /> quotas but there are occasions on which we try to ensure that the principle of equality is not just recognised in name but in reality.  There should be provision in law that those who consider people for appointment to the Bench maintain the modest balance that is requisite in what the Deputy proposes.</P>
      <P>There is a danger that at some point the board may have an all male list.  The Government of the day might want to appoint a woman to the Supreme Court. There would be the unfortunate circumstance in which a woman would be appointed to the Supreme Court and it would be recorded in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> that she had not been recommended by the Commission.  She would be a second class citizen just because her male colleagues on the Commission left women out of the equation and the Government stated it wanted to redress the balance. To avoid that evil, which would be a terrible burden for a woman judge to carry, the list should always include a woman.  Then no one could point the finger at a particular woman judge and say she had been appointed because of her sex, not her judicial temperament.</P>

      <P>I support this amendment.  I do not believe a person should be appointed to any position unless he or she is capable of doing the job.  It has been established that there are many capable women who would make excellent judges.  A woman should be included in the composition of the board and if a woman applies she would, without question, be recommended.</P>
      <P>I strongly believe it is important there should be gender balance not just on the board but also in the courts.  Every Government has, where possible, decided to appoint lady judges where they were capable of taking up those positions.  They have all done the bench proud by their contributions to date in whichever court they have sat.  I support Deputy O'Donnell's proposals.</P>

      <P>On Committee Stage I <Col N="1248" /> promised to return to this matter. Deputy O'Donnell indicated she would resubmit her amendment.  I note she has added to the amendment with a provision that the Minister, in making the appointments of the lay people that nobody wants&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment proposes that if they are to be there we may as well have a say about them &mdash; it is a case of getting one's retaliation in first.</P>
      <P>I understand Deputy O'Donnell's objective in the proposal but I am advised there are serious legal and constitutional difficulties raised where the Legislature attempts to impose quotas on the memberships of boards such as this and also where a board is instructed by statute to recommend persons for appointment based on their sex.  At present there is a Government decision which advises Ministers to be cognisant of the fact that they should attempt to have 40 per cent representation of men and women on a board.  However, it is not a statute.</P>
      <P>There is a case in Europe which gives rise to concerns about instructing a board by statute to appoint somebody based on sex.  The case involves a German national, Mr. Kalanke, who applied for a job for which he and a women were found to be suitable.  German law dictated that if two people were equally qualified for the same position and women were under represented, that is under 50 per cent in a particular employment, then if one of the two suitable people was a woman the job must be given to her.  The man in question took a case to the European Court of Justice and it ruled against the position in German law.  That decision only became available in the last couple of weeks and it is still being considered as to its implications in bringing in legislation in this country which would oblige a person to be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a complex area of law.  A question arises as to whether a gender based <Col N="1249" /> quota policy is compatible with our Constitution in seeking to achieve a balance in appointments to boards, such as an advisory board.  That may depend on the ability of the State to justify that classifications by gender serve important objectives of the Government and must be substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.  It is possible that the purpose of a discrimination based on gender might be recognised as an important Government objective.</P>
    <P>One of the difficulties with the amendment &mdash; I refer to subsection (1) &mdash; is that a person's gender would be the determining factor in making a choice between prospective appointees to the board so as to meet a quota.  In subsection (2) of the amendment the inclusion of a person in the list of recommended names submitted to the Minister would depend not on their suitability for appointment based, for example, on their experience or qualifications &mdash; although they may have been considered &mdash; but the final point of arbitration would be whether the person is a man or a woman.</P>
    <P>Any attempt to provide a quota based on sex on the advisory board or in respect of the candidates whose names may be submitted by the board would have to be consistent with the Constitution, particularly with Article 40.1 which enshrines the principle that all citizens as human persons shall be held equal before the law.  Therein lies the difficulty of declaring by statute that somebody must get a position because they happen by a fact of nature to be born male or female.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that an invitation which I may accept?</P>
      <P>Article 40.1 enshrines the principle that human persons shall be held equal before the law.  It is a strong possibility that providing for mandatory quotas based on sex would conflict with that principle.  Therefore, any affirmative action of this type would have to come within one of the two exceptions provided for in that Article.  The first is differences of capacity.  God forbid anybody would suggest a women or a man would be appointed because their capacity was lesser or greater.  The second is differences of social function. I am sure Deputy O'Donnell would not like to take the course of deciding that a woman should be appointed because of differences of capacity or social function.</P>
      <P>I would not attempt to give a learned and detailed legal argument.  Far be it from me to do so in the presence of those in the House who could do it better. I am satisfied there are sufficient serious doubts about including such a provision in the Bill.  I understand the spirit behind the amendments but I do want to put into statute a provision about which I have a doubt as to whether it will stand up.  I would only do a disservice to the appointment of women, which Deputy O'Donnell wishes to ensure with her amendment.</P>
      <P>I assure the House I will have regard to the gender quota on the appointments of the lay people when I am nominating them.  Although I cannot oblige them by statute I will also bring to the attention of the nominating bodies, the Law Society and the Bar Council, the need to have regard to gender balance when making their nominations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>They are only allowed one nominee each.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, they have one each. I cannot do anything about the presidents of the courts as they are all male at present.  I hope a time will come when one of the presidents will be female and <Col N="1251" /> their appointment will not be made simply on a gender basis.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Equality and Law Reform reminds us all when vacancies on boards arise of the objective of having 40 per cent men and women.  I will be taking that into account in recommending those names.  The matter of providing for quotas on boards such as the advisory board and requiring boards to recommend persons based on sex raises issues of law which require careful and detailed consideration.  In light of the case I have highlighted we should move with caution.  I do not believe they can be addressed in the manner which this amendment proposes.  They are matters which are being considered by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform and they may be addressed in legislation when these issues have been teased out.  Separate legislation may be introduced to make that a necessary requirement if it is so considered.</P>
      <P>There have been improvements in the gender balance in a number of professions. I recently had reason to look at the gender of people going into a number of the professional courses in universities.  It has changed greatly since I was in university in the early 1960s, when the full extent of females doing science was about a dozen lay women and half a dozen nuns.  There are not quite yet 50 per cent men and 50 per cent women in veterinary and engineering courses but there has been a sea change in how those professions are approached by female students and career guidance teachers in schools. There have been great improvements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other difficulty, which I also raised on Committee Stage, concerns subsection (4), which deals with cases where fewer than seven persons inform the board of their wish to be appointed or the board is unable to recommend at least seven persons.  The board is then required to recommend the name of each person who has informed the board of his or her wish to be appointed. If there are only three such persons and they were all male or all female, the <Col N="1252" /> board would be prohibited from making any recommendation.</P>
    <P>While I have great sympathy and support for what Deputy O'Donnell is endeavouring to do, in view of the legal uncertainty about putting a provision like this into a Statute I regret I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that while there is sympathy and support for the motivation behind my amendment, it appears to be the sum total of what the Government offers in response to the gender issue on the appointments board and in the names sent for evaluation and consideration for judicial office.  On the basis of the Minister's outline of the present law, it is alarming that even minimum gender rights cannot be enshrined in legislation, according to the constitutional points raised today.  I ask for a written copy of the consideration of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform on this issue, because the arguments proffered by the Minister for Justice appear to drive a coach and four through any effort we might make to address the gender issue and ensure minimum gender rights in our deliberations on any law we might put on the Statute Book.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister compared this to the German case, saying it was a cause for doubt about the possible inclusion of such a quota on this list of names.  The circumstances in question here are quite different from those of the German case.  In the latter instance, the person was definitely &mdash; or definitely not &mdash; going to get the job.  In this case, all we are ensuring is that a woman's name is included on this list of names which are getting through a type of obstacle course &mdash; there is no obligation on the Government to appoint that person because as we have seen there is no obligation on it to accept any of the names put forward by the board.  The comparison drawn and fears raised by the German case do not apply to my proposal because all it asks is that if a women is as qualified as her peers, willing to serve and has put forward her <Col N="1253" /> name, she should be included in the list of seven.  There is no obligation on the Government to appoint her or any of those nominees.  This is a different consideration from that which applies in the German case.</P>
    <P>I am sorry the Minister has not been able to offer anything by way of gender equality in this section.  I will consider changing my proposed section 17 (2) to read that the board &ldquo;shall endeavour to ensure that not fewer than one of the persons whose names are so submitted is a woman and not fewer than one of the persons whose names are submitted is a man&rdquo;.  The Government might accept that a board should at least endeavour to respect and vindicate gender rights at this point in the Bill &mdash; this would be a reasonable acknowledgement of the point.</P>
    <P>The Minister may realise that the sympathy and support she offers me are no substitute for including a provision in this legislation which would enshrine and vindicate gender equity.  It would be a shame to allow this Bill to go through without some recognition by Members that there is a need to ensure more women end up at the top of the profession and do not remain in the infantry, as is the case at present.  The number of women entering both legal professions is increasing &mdash; they make up about half of new entrants every year.</P>
    <P>It is a shame that the Government does not see fit to act on its stated commitment for the promotion of women to high office.  It must address the gender imbalance which runs through our State systems and boards.  It is committed to the 40 per cent rule for State boards.  I believe this Minister will honour that commitment in the appointment of lay members to this board but that does not mean a future Minister for Justice will be so inclined.  It is imperative that a stronger commitment to gender equity be included in this Bill before it is passed.  By the time it arrives in the Seanad the Minister may have seen her way to including the objectives of my amendment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;32.&mdash;(1)  Where a person (in this section referred to as the accused) has been sent forward for trial to the Circuit Court, the prosecutor or the accused may cause an application grounded on affidavit <Col N="1257" /> to be made on his or her behalf to the High Court for the transfer of the trial of the accused to the Central Criminal Court and if the High Court is satisfied that it would be manifestly unjust not to do so, the High Court shall grant the application and the decision to grant the application shall be final and unappealable.</P>
    <P>(2)  Provision shall be made by rules of court for the giving of notice of intention to make an application under subsection (1) of this section and the grounds on which such an application should be based.</P>
    <P>(3)  Where&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  two or more accused are sent forward for trial to the Circuit Court and it is proposed to try them together, and</P>
    <P>(b)  an application by one or more but not all of the accused under subsection (1) of this section be granted,</P>
    <P>an application without notice to the accused by the prosecutor to the Judge who granted the application to have the trial of one or more of the remaining accused transferred to the Central Criminal Court shall be granted.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Regional circuit courts have a habit of transferring criminal trials to Dublin because accused persons, more often than not, feel they can delay their trials by coming to Dublin and for some strange reason in some instances they believe they will get a more lenient sentence. That has the effect of not just delaying the criminal trial concerned but of also clogging up the courts in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I realise the present provision is an attempt to ensure that cases will be heard on the circuit where the crime was committed or where the accused resides unless it is manifestly unjust to do so.  The amendment merely transfers the matter to the High Court and the Central Criminal Court because there might be a tendency for Circuit Court <Col N="1258" /> judges to transfer the case to Dublin, which would not be desirable.  The Minister indicated on Committee Stage she was prepared to look at this matter later on in the context of different legislation. I accept her good faith on that matter.</P>

      <P>In page 20, to delete lines 44 to 48 and in page 21, to delete lines 1 to 51.</P>
      <P>Section 46 empowers the superior court rules committee or the Circuit Court rules committee to make rules requiring any party to a personal injuries action to disclose to the other party expert reports, names and addresses of witnesses, statements of items of special damage and other items of evidence.  The rules may impose a sanction for non compliance, including termination of an action.  The section introduces the unusual and undesirable concept of applying different rules of evidence to personal injury and non personal injury cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is felt that the entire section may offend against the concept of the administration of justice in public courts and that it may interfere with the evenly balanced rules of evidence.  There is a view that it is unnecessarily pro defendant and that an injured party should be entitled to have his experts give evidence on his behalf without that evidence having been disclosed to the other party in advance.  Apparently, similar provisions in other countries have led to the front loading of legal fees and costs, where counsel have been engaged, along with additional experts, in advance of the disclosure of reports. It is also felt that it would lengthen proceedings with arguments being made in relation to each item disclosed.  It is argued in some quarters that the section <Col N="1259" /> would prolong hearings, involve additional expense for litigants and erode plaintiffs' rights.</P>
    <P>I understand the Minister's objective and I appreciate the idea is to shorten actions and make them less expensive. Nonetheless, it is the considered view in some quarters of the legal profession that the Minister may, by setting out to achieve these objectives, only succeed in defeating them.  Will she clarify the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This section, as with all the other sections was cleared by the Attorney General's Office so I have no worries about its constitutionality or legality.  However, I listened to the Deputy and I accept this is breaking new ground.  That is one of the reasons I decided to move cautiously in this area and not to set out in the primary legislation exactly what documents ought to be disclosed and which might be admitted in evidence.  This provision confers the powers on the superior and circuit court rules committees to make the rules on these matters.</P>
      <P>My intention, as the Deputy recognised, is to speed up the hearing of personal injuries actions which take up a considerable amount of court time.  I indicated on Committee Stage that there are three year delays in some personal injuries actions.  I am confident we can leave this issue in the hands of the rules committees which are comprised of eminently qualified jurists.  For example, the superior courts rules committee includes the Chief Justice, the President of the High Court, the Master of the High Court, two practising barristers nominated by the Bar Council and two practising solicitors nominated by the Law Society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to this provision came from the fact that in 1991 the Attorney General established a working party on increased efficiency and reduced costs in High Court personal injuries actions.  The working party was comprised of representatives of the Bar Council, the Law Society and the Irish Insurance Federation.  It made a number of recommendations which are the <Col N="1260" /> basis for this section.  I am using this opportunity to put those recommendations into legislation.  Members will recognise and accept this is an appropriate time to do so and to move cautiously in this way.  Notwithstanding the case made by Deputy O'Donoghue, I recommend leaving this section in the Bill.</P>

      <P>If it is to be provided in Irish law that barristers should not wear wigs in court then, quite clearly, judges should not wear wigs in court either.  There is no sanction provided for in this Bill if a barrister wears a wig in court.  The only conclusion to which I can come is that a judge, who would wear a wig, would hold a barrister wearing a wig in contempt of court, which would be an extraordinary and ludicrous situation.  I indicated on Committee Stage that I do not have a hard line either way on this matter but I do not want to see unhelpful contradictory provisions in Irish law.</P>

I do not have strong views on this issue. However, as a barrister I spent 20 years of my life wearing a wig when I did not need one and I have now reached the stage when I feel cold on top.  The matter is not of great significance.</P>
      <P>We owe a debt of gratitude to those who raised the issue.  It should be the law that barristers should not be required to wear wigs if they do not wish.  We should not tell people what to do in such matters.  We do not instruct county councillors to wear robes.  We do not tell academics what to wear at conferring ceremonies or nurses or matrons what to wear in hospitals, even though most of those services are funded by the public.  Amendment No. 20 strikes a fair balance between compulsion and common sense and does not require a person to do something he or she may not wish to do.</P>

I am one of the older variety of barristers, a hazard type barrister rather than an academic brighter than bright one, like Deputy McDowell.  Why should we throw away the wigs?  For various personal and vain reasons I might wish to retain the wig, but that could not be further from the truth.  I do not have any hang-ups one way or the other about wearing wigs.  I fail to understand why the Legislature should hand out edicts on what professional people should wear.  The Minister should accept Deputy McDowell's amendment which will receive universal approval.  In these politically correct times, why not leave the matter optional?  Why should we tell people to wear wigs or, for that matter, not to wear them?  If people want to wear wigs they should be allowed do so and if they do not so be it.  The Legislature should not interfere with an arm of the Judiciary in this manner.  I support Deputy McDowell's views.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Health and the agencies operating under its aegis, such as the Blood Transfusion Service Board, have a task like no other Department or agency.  If the Department of Health or any of its agencies were to get it wrong, lives would be put at risk.  Unfortunately, that is what happened in the <Col N="1265" /> hepatitis C controversy.  A State agency operating under the control of the Minister for Health made a fundamental error: it ignored its own procedures and about 1,500 people are now paying the price.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board did not just get it slightly wrong, it got it alarmingly wrong and many thousands of lives were put at risk.  Instead of being held liable, senior management received golden handshakes to leave. The staff who remained had to face the public, take the flak and deal with the consequences of the controversy.  They received no compensation even though they had to stand in the firing line.</P>
    <P>The lump sums and generous terms to the two executives who left were granted by the Minister, Deputy Noonan.  Given that he showed such generosity, one would have expected him to show even greater consideration for those whose lives have been destroyed by the affair, but the strange thing is that the only ones being punished by the State for this scandal are those who received the contaminated blood and blood products.</P>
    <P>At every turn in this controversy they have been double crossed by the State. The Minister has sought to minimise the compensation they will receive by blocking their right of appeal.  He has strung them out in negotiations and after making promises to get them back into talks he failed to deliver on those commitments.  He is now forcing a flawed strategy on these vulnerable people.</P>
    <P>For those who are not familiar with this controversy let me trace the background to it so that they can see the injustice which has been done.  This scandal began for most of those infected with anti-D immunoglobulin, a blood product which is routinely administered and given without consent to rhesus negative blood group mothers.  This product has been administered in Irish maternity hospitals since the early 1970s to prevent rhesus incompatibility in new born infants.  It is an extremely important product which has prevented <Col N="1266" /> death and serious illness in thousands of infants in Ireland since its introduction in 1970.  It is ironic that a product which was designed to save infants is the one which had led to so many lives being put under threat now.</P>
    <P>Anti-D was manufactured from 1970 to 1994 in Ireland by the Blood Transfusion Service Board which is under the control of the Minister for Health. Women receiving plasma exchange treatment during pregnancy were a particularly rich source of antibodies for the production of anti-D.  Plasma from one such women was used to produce anti-D between September and November 1976.  She then became jaundiced and the board ceased using her plasma. She tested negative for hepatitis B and appeared to make a full recovery after a few weeks.  The board then decided to recommence using her plasma in the anti-D programme.</P>
    <P>In 1977, the board was notified of six women who had developed clinical jaundice some weeks after receiving anti-D immunoglobulin.  Samples from these cases were sent, as we now know, to Middlesex Hospital Medical School where they tested negative for hepatitis B.  In accordance with normal practice, Middlesex Hospital retained samples for further testing should additional tests become available at a later stage.</P>
    <P>Hepatitis C was first described in 1989.  Previously it had been described as hepatitis non-A, non-B because its characteristics had not been adequately identified.  An internationally accepted test for hepatitis C was developed in 1991 at which time the board commenced testing all blood and plasma donations for the virus.</P>
    <P>In December 1991, Middlesex Hospital used the new test for hepatitis C on the archived samples from the 1977 cases of jaundice.  It tested samples from one plasma donor and three recipients of anti-D.  It also tested archived samples of batches of anti-D which had been used in 1977.  Evidence of hepatitis C was found in some of the samples and in December 1991 the hospital wrote to the board alerting it to the problem.  The <Col N="1267" /> letter was acknowledged but no further action was taken until 1994, nearly three years later.</P>
    <P>Early that year a research study found a disproportionately high incidence of hepatitis C in female rhesus negative blood donors.  Further investigation found that these women had given birth in 1977 and were given anti-D at the time.  More samples from 1977 were sent to Middlesex for testing and found to contain hepatitis C.  The board than withdrew its anti-D product.</P>
    <P>The report by the expert group investigating the board concludes that the probable source of the infection was the plasma exchange patient who developed jaundice in 1976 and whose plasma was used as a source of anti-D in the period immediately preceding the onset of her jaundice and again after she had recovered.</P>
    <P>The expert group further notes that the board had clear standards governing the selection of ordinary blood donors and the male donor panel for anti-D production.  In both cases the board's standards prohibited the use of donors with a history of infectious hepatitis or jaundice of unknown origin, but it did not apply those same standards to the 1976-77 female plasma exchange patient. Her plasma would not have been accepted if the rules had been adhered to.  The board broke its own rules with devastating results.</P>
    <P>The board also committed a serious omission when it failed to act upon the Middlesex Hospital letter of 1991.  Had it acted then the infected product could have been withdrawn two and a half years earlier.  Over 1,000 mothers contracted hepatitis C from contaminated blood products, a serious and potentially life threatening virus for which there is no effective cure.  Half of these women have the full virus while more than a dozen children of the mothers and some partners have also been infected.  More than 500 others have been infected with hepatitis C through blood transfusions &mdash; people who thought they were getting a new burst <Col N="1268" /> of life with a transfusion of blood were being infected with a serious virus. These include women at childbirth, children who received transfusions, car accident victims, those who received transfusions during serious operations and those with rare blood diseases.  Haemophiliacs and Kidney dialysis patients have also been victims of this virus.</P>
    <P>According to the virus reference laboratory at University College Dublin, up to 75 per cent of those infected with hepatitis C develop chronic hepatitis. Hepatitis C is a most uncertain disease for which there is no known treatment available.  The type of hepatitis C contracted by most of those affected through anti-D is the least responsive to te standard interferon treatment.  About one in five patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection develops cirrhosis of the liver.  Those with hepatitis C antibodies continue to undergo testing and it is not known how many of these have a hidden virus which current tests cannot discover.</P>
    <P>Hepatitis C infection is associated with several diseases not directly related to the liver.  Side effects experienced include rheumatoid arthritis, extreme fatigue, eye problems and auto-immune diseases.  Hepatitis C is often a silent disease and many patients do not know they are sick until faced with possibly irreversible liver damage.  Hepatitis C infection almost universally recurs in a newly transplanted liver.</P>
    <P>The hepatitis C nightmare is one of the worst in the history of the State.  It is a nightmare because it was the health system that caused the disease which infected healthy people.  The State's negligence in the affair takes many forms.  Through the Minister for Health, it granted to the Blood Transfusion Service Board a manufacturer's licence for the production of anti-D.  Such a licence should be granted only if the Minister is satisfied with the suitability of premises, equipment, staff, manufacturing operations and arrangements for quality control, record keeping, handling, storage and distribution.  There are many reasons to believe that some of these <Col N="1269" /> requirements were not met by the Blood Transfusion Service Board between 1975 and 1994.  Earlier this year the Bains report was published on the questionable storage conditions at the Blood Transfusion Service Board, yet no Minister for Health in that time revoked the licence or ordered an investigation into conditions at the Blood Transfusion Service Board.</P>
    <P>Given that fact and that the State was directly responsible for this nightmare through its negligence, one would have expected it would have made every effort to be fair to the people who endured much suffering and trauma. However despite the commitment in the programme for renewal to give them fair treatment, these people have been treated with contempt by the State and at every turn have been double-crossed by the Department of Health.</P>
    <P>There is a catalogue of mistreatment in this case.  The Government insisted on carrying out only a limited look-back study to discover who had the virus.  As I said last week, that was the minimalist approach.  It seems the Department of Health's agenda was to find as few victims as possible.  The Minister for Health ignored all the calls for a full study involving doctors until he was forced by public political pressure to undertake such a study.  In the look-back study and the later full research project, the Department of Health identified people who possibly received infected blood or blood products but have since died.  The cause of their death was probably the medical condition for which they were hospitalised, but the Department of Health did not even contact their relatives to check whether that was the case.</P>
    <P>The catalogue of mistreatment does not stop there.  When negotiations were still ongoing the Minister for Health unilaterally announced the setting up of an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal to hear applications, even though that was the last thing the representative groups wanted.  The Minister for Health promised to put in place a comprehensive counselling programme, but as many as ten counties <Col N="1270" /> still have no such service.  Even where the service was provided it met with strong criticism: some people were questioned about their lifestyle, ear piercing, tattoos and so on.  The Minister put forward a comprehensive health package, which I welcomed personally and on behalf of my party.  I hope that will result in a significant improvement in the counselling service.  It took months of tough talking to eventually persuade the Department of Health to commit to pay for the promises of quality health care, which is no more than the victims justly deserve.</P>
    <P>The Government's failure to provide a statutory tribunal to hear cases is unacceptable.  The <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal has been criticised by the gropus acting on behalf of victims.  Both groups have serious reservations about the Minister's proposals.  In recent days the Minister has been on the hard sell for his proposals.  He and his officials made a number of questionable statements &mdash; for example, they have likened this tribunal to the Stardust tribunal.  I think the Minister will agree there is a massive difference between those two cases. First, the Stardust ballroom was not a State agency and the State was not the negligent party.  Second, there were fewer people involved in the Stardust tragedy and the number of deaths and injuries could be determined relatively quickly.  On the other hand hepatitis C can be a silent killer, with many years elapsing before the full effects are felt.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to present the demand for a statutory hepatitis C tribunal as an attempt to have a second beef tribunal but that is way off the mark.  Nobody wants a re-run of the beef tribunal, least of all hepatitis C victims. The groups representing victims have agreed to set all legal fees and define procedures in advance of a statutory hepatitis C tribunal.  The Attorney General must surely have a role to play in this regard.  In that way there could be no slippage or dragging out of cases. The evidence with hepatitis C is relatively cut and dried compared with the beef tribunal.  An expert group has <Col N="1271" /> examined the issues and given its findings. At any tribunal there would not be a major re-run of all matters with each case.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed during his hard sell of the proposals that no Government could back out of the tribunal.  The document I have simply states that it will continue indefinitely.  I do not know what idefinitely means in legal terms but I am sure it is not a watertight expression.  There is nothing in the proposals to stop a Government ending the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal.  The Minister claimed the courts would prevent a Government from abolishing it.  How can he be so certain the courts would make such a decision?  How can one Government commit future administrations to spending programmes?  In 30 years time how many of us will be sitting around the Cabinet table or will even be Members of the House?  The tribunal should be established by statute.  As proposed by the Minister it has no permanence in law.  The only commitment is that it will continue indefinitely until a Government decides otherwise.</P>
    <P>There are many other problems relating to this matter.  On the surface a key attraction of the Minister's proposal is that it entitles victims to a provisional award.  That is a payment scheme which would allow a victim to receive compensation in the event of deterioration of his or her health.  Because hepatitis C is so unpredictable, a provisional awards scheme is vital.  On more careful examination of the proposed tribunal one discovers that the gloss quickly loses its shine.  Under the scheme a person may opt for a provisional award but it may be denied to him or her.  The tribunal may, at its discretion, give a final lump sum and the claimant has no means of appeal against the tribunal decision.</P>
    <P>Another major problem with the tribunal relates to the presentation of medical evidence.  Under the scheme a claimant may seek to have his or her doctor give evidence at the tribunal, but there is no guarantee the tribunal will agree to that.  Given that hepatitis C is <Col N="1272" /> such a terrible condition with many different side effects, claimants must have the right to bring their doctors to the tribunal and be confident the doctor will be heard &mdash; the tribunal should have power to compel doctors to atttend.</P>
    <P>The Minister told the groups they have the right to judicial review.  That is not stated in the document.  I do not know if a right of judicial review always exists in law even under an <i>ad hoc</i> system. It is a point of law and perhaps the Minister would clarify it?  It would be better if a member of the Government did not present as absolute something that may be uncertain.  It is misleading and some could interpret it as the Minister trying to trick the victims of this State disaster into accepting a half measure.</P>
    <P>There are other major difficulties with the proposals put forward by the Minister.  In his document on health care he proposes to establish special hospital wards for those with hepatitis C.  While I see some merit in that proposal, it creates great difficulties for those who have contracted hepatitis C but have not told their employers of their condition and want their plight to remain confidential.  What would happen to confidentiality if an employer visits an employee in hospital and finds her in a special ward named &ldquo;Hepatitis C&rdquo;? The person will be stigmatised and her right to confidentiality will surely be breached.</P>
    <P>In the tribunal document the Minister puts those who contracted hepatitis C from blood transfusions at a major disadvantage in making claims.  He requires those making claims to prove on the balance of probabilities that they contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion.  That is relatively easy to prove in the case of mothers who can produce their children or birth records, but it is far more difficult to prove for those who had blood transfusions.  Their medical records in hospitals or in the Blood Transfusion Service Board may be incomplete, they could be lost or destroyed.  I gather some hospital <Col N="1273" /> records were lost when some Dublin hospitals amalgamated.  I gather also that some hospitals have a policy of destroying records after 25 years.</P>
    <P>Records may not exist in the case of people in their mid-30s who received blood transfusions as children but who have not received any since.  A problem may also arise regarding the chain of evidence.  A person who contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion may identify the batch of blood received and pass on that information to the Blood Transfusion Service Board which, in turn, may identify the donor. However, it may transpire that the donor did not give blood after 1991 when testing for hepatitis C was introduced. The Blood Transfusion Service Board cannot say conclusively that the donor in question was the source of the infection.  That donor cannot be ordered to have a test so the chain of evidence is broken.</P>
    <P>The group representing those victims of blood transfusions have sought that the term &ldquo;balance of probabilities&rdquo; be dropped and replaced by more acceptable terminology.  If possible, that should be done, especially if the Minister is committed, and I believe he is, to giving equal treatment to all those infected, whether through blood transfusions or through anti-D treatment. From an initial glance many of these points may appear minor in the overall framework, but taken together as the sum of the parts, they indicate the Minister's scheme is flawed.  He would be better to go the statutory route.  He should introduce legislation as a matter of urgency to achieve this.  If he continues to refuse to go that route, I would like him to say hence why a statutory tribunal cannot be established.  If his argument relates to legal costs, that, is not an issue as they can be agreed in advance.  I accept there is not a simple solution to this problem and that the Minister has made considerable headway. I also accept that it will be a very expensive controversy, but given that he has gone such a long way down the road <Col N="1274" /> with the groups, would it not be better for the Minister to go the last mile?</P>
    <P>The groups feel they have been treated in a patently unfair manner, especially given the Government's commitment in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to pay fair compensation.  If the Minister continues to reject the groups' concerns, this affair could end up being a case of penny-wise and pound-foolish for the State.</P>
    <P>If the Minister maintains his position &mdash; and given the level of opposition to his <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal &mdash; there is a danger that all these cases will end up going to the High Court.  Once there, there will not be agreed fees and the State will be liable for all the costs.  A hepatitis C case is already before the High Court.  I am sure no one will process a case through the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal until the outcome of the High Court case is known as the ruling there will be a benchmark.  The <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal may be set up by the Minister, but it is likely to be idle until there is a ruling on that High Court case.</P>
    <P>I seek clarification from the Minister on the number of claims he expects will go before the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal by the end of this month and on how many he expects the tribunal will have made a determination by the end of this year. From earlier discussions in this House today, the impression was given that £60 million is required in this financial year to pay claims.  I understand from the Minister and I believe he told me the truth in response to parliamentary questions tabled last month, that he did not expect any claims to come before the tribunal because it would not be fully functional before the end of this year and, therefore, no payments would be made until 1996.  That was my understanding of the position when we discussed this matter in the debate on Estimates last week.  As the Minister is aware Government and Opposition parties were prepared to pass any Estimates necessary to compensate these women this year.</P>
    <P>In an effort to get the groups back into negotiations the Minister promised <Col N="1275" /> to give the groups representing victims everything they wanted, but not on a statutory basis.  The groups stepped aside from their demand for a statutory tribunal in an attempt to find a solution, but is now appears the Minister deliberately strung out Positive Action and Transfusion Positive which acted in good faith by stepping aside from their demands and did not show the same good faith in the negotiations.  Even though the groups stepped aside from the demand for a statutory tribunal during the negotiations, they still believe that is the way to proceed in the absence of an overall agreement.</P>
    <P>The Minister raised the political stakes in this controversy by proceeding without the agreement of victims.  It is a rash decision, especially given the commitments by various members of Government parties to the groups representing the victims.  It must be recognised that all the victims have been infected due to the negligence of the State.  The Government could pay a high price for the Minister's intransigence in this affair and his unwillingness to go the extra distance.  I appeal to the Minister at this late stage to carefully examine the possibility of taking the statutory route to ensure that in 30 years' time whoever will have succeeded him, will not have an opportunity to lay aside the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal now on offer, without the matter coming before this House.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this motion. I commend our spokesperson, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, for bringing it before us.  While it has been established that many women have been infected by blood products and realise they may face grave problems in the future, it is unfortunate that the number of women who have an uncertain future has not yet been established.  At least 60,000 women have been given anti-D products by the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  This problem is a new experience and tests which establish the type of infections transmitted are also new. <Col N="1276" /> We do not know if hepatitis C is the only infection involved or what new virus, of which we are presently unaware, may be detected in time.</P>
      <P>The physical problems are greatly compounded by the uncertainty of the future and the Minister has an onerous duty to ensure that the future of these women is protected in the best way possible.  That is why the sentiments expressed in the motion are so important to women, not only in a practical sense but in a psychological sense. Not only must we give medical help and every support to those affected, we must also reassure women that their health in this context will not be sacrificed for a paltry few pounds or because a Minister will not go the extra mile to give them what they need and want.</P>
      <P>These demands are made by the people most affected.  While I congratulate the Minister in going as far as he has, I am extremely disappointed that he has not seen fit to concede the statutory tribunal being sought by Positive Action.  This seems to be the classic &ldquo;Yes Minister&rdquo; case of establishing priorities which suggest that people should not be given what they want but what the Minister feels they should have.  I cannot see the Minister's logic in his approach to this problem.  While on the one hand he gives the clear impression that he is anxious to do all that is necessary to relieve the distress of the women who have had major problems, not of their own making, thrust on them, he still baulks at the one guarantee that these women desperately want and need: continuing security.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister for Health suggesting he will still be around in ten or 20 years' time to look after them?  Even the Minister cannot be this optimistic.  While he may be willing to give guarantees, the women who face an uncertain future would like, and are entitled to, better guarantees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>Now is the time to make provision for them.  We and the group who represent the women consider that the best way to achieve this is through a statutory tribunal.  I do not know why the Minister is dragging his feet on this.  If it is an administrative difficulty he must slash through the red tape; if it is pure bloody-mindedness on the part of the Minister then those suffering women should be made aware of that.  If, on the other hand, his reluctance is due to economics and penny pinching &mdash; which I believe it is &mdash; the Official Report of 13 March 1991, Volume 406, No. 4, column 1116 states:</P>
      <P>The Minister must realise that further delays by the Government will rightly be seen as a cynical act. Not only will it deny these people the right to some comfort during this stressful time but it will significantly reduce the possibility of compensation being awarded to the families of those people who have died.  The Minister must clearly demonstrate to the House that he is not making such a callous calculation as the potential for savings to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>That statement was not made about this problem or during this dispute.  It was made by Deputy Richard Bruton, Minister for Enterprise and Employment, during the debate on compensation for haemophiliacs on 13 March 1991.  If the principle was right then, it is right now. I ask the Minister to concede that these disadvantaged people need a statutory tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us be clear about this.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board is an organ of the Department of Health.  It would be shameful of the Minister to try to shirk his duty to women, whom this body failed.  The Minister could as easily concede liability in a court of law as to a tribunal of his appointment which <Col N="1278" /> would make a trip to the court by claimants, who wish to go down that road, a great deal easier.  There is ample precedent for that.  However, the awards granted there would not be in accordance with what the Minister has in mind under this tribunal.</P>
    <P>In clause 8 of the Minister's scheme of compensation headed &ldquo;Awards of the tribunal&rdquo;, the Minister states:</P>
    <P>In calculating an award the tribunal may take into account any statutory or non-statutory benefits which the claimant has, or will become entitled to, or has received, or will receive as a result of the condition which gives rise to the claimants claims.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to work out what it means. I admit I am suspicious of it.  I saw on a British television programme recently where claimants in another context came away with a net £1 after various clawbacks had been made.  It would be dreadful if that hapened here.  I am not suggesting the Minister would be guilty of such an action but it again underlines the necessity of having everything made clear at the beginning and providing as much permanence as possible.</P>
    <P>If we look back to the thalidomide affair or any other crisis caused by a commercial concern, the Government, rightly, would pursue such companies to discharge their responsibilities fully. When the duty rests with the Minister to provide for the needs of these victims he must do so.  In anything as important as the health of a sizeable number of the citizens of the State, we have an obligation to provide what is best for their need in the longer-term.</P>
    <P>While I accept the <i>bona fides</i> of the Minister in what he has proposed, he has not convinced me that these women should settle for less than their due. Because of the long-term nature of this problem and not knowing how benign future Ministers or regimes may be, we have to give the solution to this problem as much permanence as possible.</P>
    <P>Under the Minister's proposal, his arrangements could be terminated at any stage whereas the work of the statutory tribunal could only be terminated by the Oireachtas.  I do not understand, <Col N="1279" /> much less accept, the Minister's arguments that a statutory tribunal would be &ldquo;more formal, less flexible, unwieldy, subject to greater delays and with potentially substantial legal costs&rdquo;. There is no drawback in the Minister's list which he, as Minister, cannot solve. I can only conclude that his motives in denying these women their moral rights are based on financial considerations and choosing the easy way out.</P>
    <P>The Minister has seen fit to cast the amount of compensation, or so it seems at £60 million.  This is disgraceful and indicative of his cavalier attitude to the problem.  If he has learned anything it should be that this scheme must be open-ended.  This is the core of the problem.  We do not know, and the Minister cannot know, what is down the line and he cannot close off any option in this regard.</P>
    <P>A man came to me a couple of weeks ago and was distraught because his wife is suffering from complications as a result of contaminated blood products. She has had a reasonably lengthy history of hospitalisation since and this will continue for the foreseeable future.  She is hospitalised at least every two weeks for varying periods.  Can the Minister even begin to quantify the level of compensation to which this woman is entitled?  I accept her medical expenses will be taken care of but what about the other elements of her suffering?  There is the pain, trauma and inconvenience to herself and consequently to her family; the loss of time with her family and the psychological loss and deprivation involved.  There is the uncertainty of the future with an unquantifiable sentence over her head and the complete destruction of all her expectations of life.  In other words, her life has all but been ruined.</P>
    <P>What financial value can the Minister put on that?  What kind of award would a court make if such a case came before it in the normal way?  Let us be penny-pinching about it and say it was a paltry £200,000.  Take a simple mathematical example.  As I said earlier, 60,000 women have been given suspect blood and are exposed to some degree of risk. <Col N="1280" /> If only 1 per cent of these women proved to have long-term difficulties that represents 600 women.  If, on the other hand, the Minister has provided an absolute maximum of £60 million one does not need a degree in mathematics to work out that only 300 women will be compensated, and that is probably the least he could get away with.  The Minister's calculations are flawed.  His approach is shameful and his attitude to a very stressful and traumatic situation is lacking in compassion.  Women deserve better.</P>
    <P>While the Minister may appear wholly reasonable in holding out the carrot of relatively trouble free compensation, the price of acceptance, which is the waiver of any future right to claim, will be too high.  This will have the inevitable consequence of forcing people to the superior courts for a vindication of their rights.  It is not proper that the Minister should formally decide that the compensation he proposes to make should be on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis.  If he was generously picking up the pieces from the actions of a third party his actions would be commendable but the responsibility rests clearly and solely with him and to designate his remedial action <i>ex gratia</i> is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The motion reflects the needs and the wishes of the victims represented by Positive Action, who have suffered enough as a result of short comings of the State and shows the way forward which the Minister should take.  I commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick-East):</i> I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, being of the view that&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i) the Amended Scheme of Compensation published by the Minister for Health on 1st December, 1995, which will continue indefinitely as an alternative to court proceedings will <Col N="1281" /> serve the best interests of persons who have contracted Hepatitis C from Human Immunoglobulin Anti-D, blood transfusion or other blood products; and</P>
    <P>(ii) the proposals set out in the Health Care Document published by the Minister for Health on 1st December, 1995, in relation to the long-term health care needs of persons diagnosed positive for Hepatitis C provide statutory guarantees in respect of the future provision of health care services,</P>
    <P>approves the Amended Scheme of Compensation and the Health Care Document published by the Minister for Health on 1st December, 1995, copies of which have been sent to each Deputy and placed in the Dáil Library on 11th December, 1995.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to move the Government's amendment to the Fianna Fáil Private Members' motion on the scheme of compensation for certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C.  I welcome the opportunity to outline to the House the Government's firm commitment to fair compensation and to meeting the long-term health care needs of those who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or blood product.  There is a serious responsibility on Members to ensure that people with hepatitis C listening to the debate do not have their anxieties and concerns increased by inexact information or statements which are not in accordance with the facts.  I compliment Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn for sticking, by and large, to the facts but unfortunately I cannot pay the same compliment to her young colleague.</P>
    <P>When the possible link between the anti-D product and hepatitis C was brought to the attention of my Department in February 1994 the immediate concerns were the protection of all future recipients of anti-D product, the identification of risks for mothers who received the anti-D product in the past and the provision of counselling and <Col N="1282" /> treatment for women who test positive for hepatitis C.  The first objective was met by the immediate introduction of a new virally inactivated anti-D product to all maternity hospitals and units while the second objective was met by the launch by the BTSB of the national blood screening programme for anti-D recipients.  The third objective was achieved by the provision of special consultant staffed clinics for those persons diagnosed positive for hepatitis C under the national blood screening programme.</P>
    <P>A total of 57,764 women who received anti-D between 1970 and February 1994 have been screened under the national blood screening programme and 973 have screened positive for hepatitis C antibodies, of whom 463 have tested positive for the virus.  Under the targeted look-back programme, 217 living recipients have been traced to date, 174 persons have been screened for hepatitis C antibodies and 146 of these have been screened for the hepatitis C virus.  Sixty-three of these persons have evidence of continuing hepatitis C infection.</P>
    <P>It is not true that the targeted look-back programme is minimalist or was introduced in response to public pressure. Several of the statements put on the record by me indicated that we would follow this strategy and the hepatitis look-back programme being currently undertaken targets recipients of blood transfusions prior to 1991 by tracing the past donations of donors now identified with evidence of hepatitis C virus following the administration of anti-D and who subsequently became blood donors.  The look-back programme also included donations given prior to 1991 by donors identified as hepatitis C positive following the introduction of routine screening of blood donations in 1991.  In addition, the Blood Transfusion Service Board has asked a pathologist and other medical practitioners to advise it of patients with a diagnosis of hepatitis C where blood transfusion may have been the source of the infection. When a potentially infectious donor is <Col N="1283" /> identified by this route their previous donations are also included in the look-back programme.</P>
    <P>The targeted look-back programme has two phases.  The first phase has identified, and will continue to identify, donors who have tested positive for hepatitis C, the product, whole blood, red blood cells, platelets or plasma, the hospital to which the product was issued and the recipients.  The second phase will trace the recipients with a view to offering tests.  Phase two of the programme is well under way and contact is being made with recipients through their general practitioners with a view to assessment and obtaining blood samples for testing for hepatitis C.  The programme will identify those people who are known to have received a potentially infected blood transfusion. It, therefore, offers a screening test for hepatitis C to any individual who has received blood or blood products from donors who are potentially infected with the hepatitis C virus.</P>
    <P>This is not a minimalist programme, rather it is unprecedented in its scope. Even though similar problems have arisen in other countries, no similar programme has reached this stage of advancement.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn was incorrect to say a minimalist approach was adopted, it was slip shod or forced on us.  This programme was always part of the strategy and it was introduced as soon as possible on the basis of the information available to us. I know the Deputy did not intend to mislead the House by saying it is minimalist but it is very important to ensure that the facts are put on the record.  We do not want to raise anxieties based on wrong information.</P>
    <P>Under the optional screening programme which I announced in early September, 6,024 persons have come forward for testing.  To date 30 of these persons have tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies while 12 have tested positive for the hepatitis C virus.  I wish to express the Government's deep concern and compassion for recipients of <Col N="1284" /> anti-D and other blood products who have been infected with hepatitis C by virtue of exposure to the blood product. I wish to state clearly that my Government colleagues and I are committed to ensuring the ongoing availability of the highest quality health care for these people.  I assure them that I fully appreciate their anxieties and concerns for their future well-being.  I hope the Dáil will agree that the open and generous way the Government has addressed this issue is evidenced in the health care services programme and the amended compensation scheme.</P>
    <P>I wish to outline the health care services I am putting in place through my Department, the health boards and the acute hospitals and which, as Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said, have been welcomed by Members on all sides of the House and the two organisations negotiating on behalf of affected people. Substantial progress has been made during the past year in meeting the many complex and varied needs of those persons who have contracted hepatitis C. This has been made possible by a process of consultation between my Department and Positive Action, a support group for anti-D women and their families, and Transfusion Positive, a support group for blood transfusion recipients and their families.  Many of the concerns about future health care arrangements expressed by Positive Action and Transfusion Positive have been addressed and these are now reflected in the health care document and the amended compensation scheme forwarded to both groups on 1 December last which I have circulated to all Members.  The special health care programme involves an extensive range of services in the following areas: primary health care services, secondary health care services, a special research programme and a statutory monitoring body.</P>
    <P>Enabling legislation which will be published on 31 December next will allow for the following services to be provided free of charge and without a means test for certain persons who have <Col N="1285" /> contracted hepatitis C: general practitioner services, including prescribed drugs and medicines; dental, ophthalmic and aural services; independent counselling services; home help services and home nursing services.  Today the Government cleared the text of the legislation which will be published as soon as the printing arrangements are made.  The legislation will be brought before the House as early as possible after the Christmas recess.  I hope all parties will give these arrangements the kind of parliamentary permanence they have requested by supporting the legislation.</P>
    <P>On the question of secondary health care services, treatment for those who test positive for hepatitis C is provided at special consultant staffed clinics at the following six designated hospitals: St. James's Hospital, Dublin; Beaumont Hospital, Dublin; Mater Hospital, Dublin; St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin; Cork University Hospital and University Hospital, Galway.  The treatment involves both out-patient and in-patient services as required.  On Committee Stage Deputy Flood asked why the services were confined to these hospitals. The expertise available dictates the locations.  I would like a facility in Limerick but unfortunately the expertise is not there at present.  The above hospitals have provided the services and will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>The treatment, including prescribed medication, is provided by the public hospital service free of charge.  In 1994 a sum of £1.8 million was allocated to the six designated hospitals for the provision of these services and £1.98 million was allocated for them this year.  It has now been agreed that specific funding will be provided in the Book of Estimates each year to ensure the consolidation and maintenance into the future of high quality hospital in-patient and out-patient services for persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or blood product, including the anti-D product.</P>
    <P>The secondary care element of the health care services includes provision <Col N="1286" /> for access to in-patient and out-patient treatment, non-payment of hospital charges, appropriate staffing levels and arrangements for staff training, equipment for hepatitis C units, anti-viral therapies and therapy initiation programmes, liver transplantation, treatment outside of Ireland where necessary, liaison between the hospital service providers and prompt referral to clinicians for conditions associated with hepatitis C.  The treatment services will also be available to children and partners who are hepatitis C positive.</P>
    <P>I am arranging with the Health Research Board for the establishment and funding of a special programme of research on hepatitis C, including research projects into hepatitis C as it relates to persons infected through the use of anti-D.  Funding will be provided to enable this special research programme to commence early in 1996.</P>
    <P>Under the powers conferred on me by the Health Acts 1947 and 1953, I will by order before 31 December 1995, establish a statutory consultative council to advise me on matters relating to hepatitis C.  The functions of the consultative council will include the monitoring of health and counselling services for persons with hepatitis C; the making of recommendations on the organisation and delivery of services for persons with hepatitis C; publication of information on hepatitis C; and liaison with the Health Research Board on the special programme of hepatitis C research projects. The membership of the council, which I will be appointing, will include representation from Positive Action and Transfusion Positive.</P>
    <P>The health care programme which I outlined was specifically designed to further copperfasten the Government's commitment to meeting the future health care needs of persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or blood product.  I am sure that Deputies will agree that the Government's proposals are fair and generous and will meet the genuine concerns of those who have contracted hepatitis C in relation to the continued <Col N="1287" /> provision of high quality health care in the future.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noticed also that they are either being enacted in statute with the Bill to which I referred which will be published shortly or already covered by statute under the health Acts, such as public provision in hospitals, or covered under regulations or orders statutorily based on sections of the health Acts.  The arrangements for the ongoing health care needs of persons with hepatitis C are being put on a permanent basis, which is a major issue in this House.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to the compensation scheme in detail.  The Government in its policy document &mdash;<i>A Government of Renewal</i>&mdash; included a commitment to fair compensation for women infected by the hepatitis C virus from anti-D.  Earlier this year, the Government decided to establish, as a matter of urgency, a tribunal which will assess compensation on an <i>ex-gratia</i> basis in respect of anti-D recipients who are infected with hepatitis C antibodies-virus and the partners and children of these women who are also infected with hepatitis C antibodies-virus.</P>
    <P>I published the scheme of the compensation tribunal on 20 June 1995, a copy of which was circulated to every Member of the Oireachtas.  On 12 September 1995 I announced the Government's decision to extend access to the tribunal to include those who had contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or blood product.</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate of £60 million which was discussed in committee and which is before the House is in relation to the estimated 1996 cost of meeting the compensation awards likely to be made by the tribunal.  It is, of course, accepted that all awards made by the tribunal will be funded from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>There was never any doubt about what we were doing in committee last week &mdash; we were making a provision for the estimated costs of compensation through the tribunal in 1996.  I also <Col N="1288" /> made it quite clear that I was setting up the tribunal immediately and that the £60 million would cover the administrative costs in 1996.  Certainly, some of the administrative costs have already been incurred in 1995 on salaries, premises and so on.  I do not think the tribunal, which we will set up next Friday, will have handed down any awards by the end of the year, but I made that point clearly last week on committee. However, it is true that if we had reached agreement on the tribunal when it was published during the summer, significant awards would have been made this autumn because much less lead-in time is needed for a tribunal rather than the High Court to make awards.  In response to Deputy Kenneally, it is on record that there is no question of a cap on £60 million.  The £60 million is an estimate of what we may spend next year but the liability, no matter what it is, will have to be met next year, the year after and if it costs more than £60 million next year, I will be coming into the House with a Supplementary Estimate to cover the extra costs.</P>
    <P>At the end of September, Postive Action published a draft Bill which encompassed many issues relating to compensation and health care issues. The Government's position on a statutory scheme and the question of an admission of liability by the State was made clear by me on a number of occasions to Positive Action and in this House.  The Government's position was set out in detail by me also in a letter I sent to all Members on 13 October and at the end of October, Positive Action agreed to my request to enter further discussions.</P>
    <P>During November further extensive consultations and negotiation with Positive Action and Transfusion Positive took place with my Department and many of the concerns expressed during the negotiations have been addressed and are reflected in the amended compensation scheme, a copy of which has been circulated to all Members.  It is not true that there was foot dragging by the <Col N="1289" /> officials of my Department.  My Department's senior officials worked late into-the night and at weekends and members of Positive Action and Transfusion Positive can vouch for several meetings held outside normal office hours.  At the risk of embarrassing my officials it is worth noting that the Civil Services grades entitled to overtime are limited and all senior officials do not get anything extra even if they work all night.  There is no recompense for civil servants at the senior level involved in this work for working weekends or at nights and a small bit of appreciation is appropriate now and again.</P>
    <P>The scheme of compensation approved by the Government offers numerous advantages as opposed to court proceedings.  The advantages for tribunal applicants include speed, informality, flexibility and privacy; negligence need not be proved; the right of court action is preserved unless and until an award is accepted; proceedings before the tribunal are not excluded from judicial review.  I reiterate that proceedings before the tribunal are not excluded from judicial review.  As I said in reply to a question from Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, the proceedings of the tribunal may be reviewed judicially if we want them in a positive rather than a negative way.  The concept of a provisional award, which is not available in Irish law, allows a claimant to return to the tribunal for future specified, unexpected consequences of the hepatitis C infection.  This is a particularly important option for claimants given the uncertain nature of the infection; the scheme is optional and imposes no disadvantage.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the tribunal which prevents persons from taking their case to the High Court.  There is nothing in the tribunal which prevents persons from rejecting an award if they think it is inadequate and then proceeding to the High Court.  The intention in setting up a tribunal was to provide an alternative to the High Court.  The High Court provides a statutory way in which to process compensation claims.  It was as <Col N="1290" /> clear as crystal at the start that the alternative would be informal and non-statutory. We did not need a statutory scheme because the statutory route to dealing with compensation claims is through the High Court.  It is important to stress the concept of a provisional award as this is not available in Irish law, it is in English law, and is not available in the High Court.  I repeat it would not be possible for me either legally or politically to bring in a statutory scheme to provide for provisional awards in respect of persons to whom the tribunal will apply as I would be forced into extending it across the range of compensation claims.  Members know the length of time it takes to draft legislation and then to secure its passage through this House.  Deputies will appreciate that if we had to extend a statutory tribunal that can make provisional awards and payments by instalments, it would apply to every case of compensation that goes through the courts whether as a result of a motor car accident or falling into a pothole.  Deputies will appreciate that one of the primary reasons I am not going the statutory route is that I can provide a much better facility to those who are claiming compensation by going the non-statutory route.  It is very difficult when acting in the best interests of persons involved to be accused of being slipshod, penny-pinching, uncaring and not taking people's views into account.  There is none of that; I have no doubt that this is the direction to follow and it is in the interests of applicants.</P>
    <P>I should say also that I have a responsibility to members of Positive Action and Transfusion Positive.  My primary responsibility is not to members of any particular group but rather to individuals who have hepatitis C or antibodies.  It must be left to individual choice whether to take one route or another; I must offer individuals that choice after the conclusion of appropriate negotiations.  I cannot hold up a scheme indefinitely which is to the benefit of so many individuals who must <Col N="1291" /> also be given a right to process their claims.</P>
    <P>As I said, a tribunal based on a statute would present many technical difficulties &mdash; I mentioned one &mdash; if it were to encompass many of the benefits I highlighted.  Of its very nature a statutory tribunal would also be more formal, less flexible, unwieldy, subject to greater delays and would carry potentially substantial legal costs.  We are all familiar with the issue of costs <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry.  I am not contending that this tribunal would be a replica of that body.  I am saying that the legal profession, above all others, knows how to charge and how to devise schemes carrying legitimate charges if it can render them complicated.  Being aware of the amount of money being claimed for the production of a Private Members' Bill, I would advise Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn that, based on her work as Opposition spokesperson on Health, she is worth approximately £250,000 annually if she were paid the same rates.  Let us call a spade a spade. I am not going to be placed in the position in which a proportion of taxpayers' money &mdash; which we are dedicating to process legitimate claims, through which we want fair compensation to be paid to persons involved &mdash; may be frittered away, with several millions of pounds expended on many totally unnecessary processes.  That is the cost issue and there is no saving to be had by following the compensation or High Court route in terms of compensation.  This compensation cannot work unless the tribunal pays the equivalent High Court rate because, if they attempt to pay a lesser rate, people will be advised that that rate is not on a par with that of the High Court, awards will be refused and claimants will resort to the High Court.  That is why we are taking this route.</P>
    <P>With regard to the permanence of the Government's compensation scheme, Positive Action has sought a statutory tribunal on the basis that a statute would guarantee the permanence of <Col N="1292" /> such a tribunal.  A statutory scheme offers no such absolute guarantee of the permanence of a tribunal, as every Member knows, because any Government can change any statute drawn up by itself or any of its predecessors.</P>
    <P>However, there are a number of safeguards against the abolition or future amendment of the Government's scheme to diminish the rights of applicants to the tribunal.  These include: the terms of any award made under the Government's scheme would be enforceable before the courts; and any abolition or future amendment of the Government's scheme to the effect of diminishing the rights of applicants to the tribunal would be subject to judicial review.</P>
    <P>The following are the amendments to the scheme which the Government has approved following on my consultation with Positive Action and Transfusion Positive: (i) the scheme has been extended to include transfusee claimants who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies/virus; (ii) the children and partners of transfusee claimants who have been diagnosed positive for hepatitis C antibodies/virus are also included; (iii) the purpose of the scheme has been extended to include that the scheme shall continue indefinitely; (iv) the State will not rely on the Statutes of Limitation so that no claimant by virtue of those statutes may lose their legal right to initiate proceedings against it because of making a claim to the tribunal; (v) the discretion of the tribunal to hear oral evidence has been extended; (vi) the making available of medical and other expert reports to claimants is explicitly incorporated in the scheme; (vii) a claimant to whom an award has been made by the tribunal shall be awarded the legal costs and expenses associated with the claim; (viii) the time within which claimants must apply to the tribunal has been extended from three months to six months; (ix) in the case of minors and persons of unsound mind, the claims can be made within six months of the cesser of their legal disability; and (x) the <Col N="1293" /> reports of the tribunal shall, in so far as is practicable, not identify any claimant.</P>
    <P>On the preservation of legal rights the scheme to compensate certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C does not provide for an appeal against the award made by the tribunal.  However, if a claimant is not satisfied with the award made, it can be rejected.  It is open to such person to initiate proceedings or continue proceedings in the courts.  By making an application to the compensation tribunal, a person's legal right to pursue a case arising from the same circumstances is not in any way diminished.  In any event, if an appeal system from the award made by the tribunal was to be included in the scheme of compensation such would be an appeal to the High Court.  As I stated, a person's legal right to pursue a claim in the courts is preserved in the event that a person rejects an award made by the tribunal.  While not a formal appeal, whenever someone rejects an award, he or she will still have recourse to the High Court, which means it has the same effect.</P>
    <P>On the question of oral evidence, the discretion of the tribunal to hear such has been extended beyond what was contained in the original scheme published by the Government in June last. While the tribunal will rely primarily on written medical reports, having considered such reports, it may notify the claimant that oral evidence of some or all of such reports will not be required. However, upon receipt of such notice, the claimant may inform the tribunal in writing of any reasons he or she considers that such evidence should be heard orally and the tribunal, having considered such reasons, shall notify the claimant of its decision to receive such evidence orally.  If it refuses to hear such evidence orally, it will have to be sure that it acted in accordance with the rules of natural justice.  If somebody does not like such a refusal, their legal representative can appeal it for judicial review. This means that a claimant's position is preserved in the manner in which we <Col N="1294" /> have structured this compensation scheme.</P>
    <P>The discretion of the tribunal in relation to provisional awards was inserted in case an applicant chose a provisional award when a lump sum award clearly would be in his or her best interests.  The Government considered this necessary, lawyers in Ireland not being familiar with the concept of provisional awards which are not available in Irish law.  In English law, the courts have discretion in relation to making provisional awards when a claimant chooses to apply for such an award.  The Government considered it to be of benefit to applicants that the tribunal should retain its discretion in this regard.  That provision was incorporated deliberately, not in the interests of the Government, the Exchequer or the Department of Health but rather in those of the applicants in case that lawyers, unfamiliar with the provisional award system &mdash; as they all are in Ireland because it does not exist &mdash; would advise an applicant to proceed in a certain direction which would not be in his or her best interest.  The tribunal will oversee that provision.</P>
    <P>In the generality of cases, whenever somebody applies for a provisional award the tribunal will agree but a very small number of circumstances could arise in which somebody was badly advised to apply for a provisional award when they should have gone for full and final settlement.  For example, if somebody is advised to opt for a provisional award in circumstances in which the medical prognosis shows that their state of health will not change, there is no point in opting for a provisional award because they would be cutting themselves short and would be much better obtaining a larger award in full and final settlement; that is all that is involved there.</P>
    <P>The tribunal will be presided over by a very senior judge of the Supreme Court.  It is not as if we were appointing people who did not understand compensation issues; that is the manner in which it will work in practice.  It is very <Col N="1295" /> frustrating when some provision, included for the benefit of applicants, is turned around and used as a stick with which to beat me, as Minister, as if I were endeavouring to subtract from their rights whereas I am endeavouring to give them additional ones.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the many concessions which I have outlined, Positive Action has in recent days reasserted its demand for a comprehensive statute dealing with compensation or, as a possible alternative, sought further concessions which have already been the subject of extensive negotiations.  The Government considers that no further concessions can be made.</P>
    <P>Many of the concerns expressed in relation to the Tribunal make it quite clear that there is a degree of misinformation and misunderstanding about the compensation scheme.  A number of these concerns are misplaced.  I would strongly suggest that individual claimants discuss their particular circumstances with their solicitor.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to formally establish the compensation tribunal later this week.  An announcement will be made in this regard and application forms will be made available to potential applicants. I have every confidence that the compensation scheme will operate successfully, thus ensuring that the Government's commitment to provide fair compensation for those persons who have contracted hepatitis C from blood products or blood transfusion will be honoured.</P>
    <P>The House will agree that this has been a long and difficult process for everyone involved.  I am sure that the House will also agree that the comprehensive health care package, taken together with the amended compensation scheme, represents a clear demonstration of the Government's commitment to providing an extensive range of high quality health care services into the future and fair compensation for these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. D. Wallace Mr. D. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Moffatt.  I am very happy to support the motion.  It is both sensible and timely and I fervently hope it receives the full support of all sides of this House.  Before commenting on the specific proposal before us it is appropriate to briefly consider the nature of the current hepatitis C problem.  A large number of people, mainly women, have become infected by the virus as an accidental consequence of receiving medical treatment.  Some of the affected people have contracted the virus as a result of receiving contaminated anti-D vaccination which was administered to protect the health of the child.  Most of the other victims of the use of contaminated blood products have been recipients of blood transfusions, usually received either as a consequence of surgery or as part of therapy for a blood related disorder. A much smaller group of victims consists of either partners or children of people directly affected through the anti-D vaccination or as a result of receiving contaminated blood products. While any episode of illness is unfortunate and to be regretted it is particularly upsetting when the problem occurs in the manner suffered by the vast majority of those currently presenting with hepatitis C infection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It goes without saying that all those infected by the virus have the full sympathy of each Member of the House and the community at large.  Sympathy alone, however, is neither sufficient nor adequate support for those people.  In particular, we in this House must take every step to ensure that two further levels of support are provided.  We must be sure that the most comprehensive and advanced possible level of treatment is made available to each person affected by that condition.  This must involve support at both hospital and at community level where appropriate.  All necessary diagnostic facilities must be proved to ensure that the medical condition of each patient is accurately assessed on a regular basis.  If there is evidence of deterioration in a patient's condition, it is vital that all necessary <Col N="1297" /> treatment is immediately available.  We must take all possible steps to ensure that the most recent reliable international findings regarding optimal patient therapy are immediately taken into account in this regard.  The patients and their families have suffered enough already.  It is vital that they now have the security and peace of mind which comes from knowing that the very highest possible level of care is automatically available to help them deal with their infection.  As well as providing comprehensive medical assessment, monitoring and treatment facilities, it is equally important that the patients and their families receive the highest possible level of counselling support to help them deal with their situation.</P>
    <P>On a somewhat brighter note it must be acknowledged that much has been achieved to date in dealing with this unfortunate matter.  A reasonably effective screening programme has been initiated to help identify to the greatest possible degree those directly affected by the use of contaminated anti-D vaccination. Similarly, a system has been put in place to identify possible victims of the use of contaminated products in blood transfusions.  The Department of Health has invested significant resources in its treatment centres around the country.  All these steps have made a positive contribution to the situation and it is important to acknowledge the wholehearted efforts of people from a range of sectors, including health care administrators, medical and nursing staff, laboratory personnel and counsellors.  There is no room for complacency, however, and a sustained programme of planning, assessment and inmplementation is required if the matter is to be dealt with effectively.</P>
    <P>There is another level of support which is equally vital to those affected by the accidental use of blood products contaminated with the hepatitis C virus. That involves the provision of a proper level of compensation to each and every person.  It is vitally important that the process of providing such compensation be carried out in the most effective and <Col N="1298" /> considerate manner possible.  It is only correct that the Minister should approach this matter in a deliberate and prudent manner on account of the major liability which has accrued to his Department because of this disaster, but most fair-minded people would have to agree that more than enough time has gone by to allow the Minister to develop a comprehensive and satisfactory compensation system to deal with the concerns of all those involved.  The matter came into the public arena in February of 1994, yet we are still awaiting the conclusion of a fair and equitable agreement on compensation.  This is simply not good enough for the many people whose lives have been turned upside down through no fault of their own.</P>
    <P>The Minister now has an urgent moral duty to take all possible steps to remove any remaining blocks in the way of a full settlement.  The patients and their representative groups are fully entitled to insist that any mechanism adopted to deal with the matter is both fair and secure.  While substantial progress seems to have been made in relation to the fairness of the proposed tribunal, a further decisive step is required to ensure the security of any agreement.  This requires that the proposed provision be placed on a full statutory basis.  The motion before us is designed to provide such security.</P>
    <P>At this stage it is imperative that the matter be brought to a final conclusion since delay in various forms has from the outset been a major source of aggravation to those involved.  I sincerely hope the Minister and the Government parties take this opportunity to provide a satisfactory working environment for the tribunal which is to begin its proceedings at the earliest possible time.</P>
    <P>I would again like to place on the record my full support for the concerns and needs of those affected by this unfortunate episode in the medical history of this country.  While some may argue that the original use of infected anti-D vaccination could not reasonably have been avoided because of the simple fact that the hepatitis C virus was <Col N="1299" /> unknown at that time, it must be agreed that an early opportunity to react to the problem was missed.  Consequently patients' treatment has started at a somewhat later date than would otherwise have been the case.  Against such a background it is vital that this House acts energetically and decisively to assist the victims in every possible manner.  A clear-cut opportunity in this regard is placed before the House tonight with this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn on tabling this motion.  Ever since the hepatitis C issue became a problem here, she has followed it up relentlessly.  In doing that she has taken great care to look at how women, men and children have been affected by this problem.  The Minister has also done his bit; he has looked at it continually and improved matters. Unfortunately, to date his best effort has not been good enough from the point of view of the people involved, especially people who have been infected and their representative groups, Transfusion Positive and Positive Action.</P>
      <P>The main stumbling block at the moment is the question of an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal versus a statutory one.  Despite what the Minister has said, his reassurances have not been sufficient to placate those people who are still worried that the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal is simply a tribunal for now.  What will happen down the road?  Hepatitis C is a peculiar problem. We think we know all about it, but we do not.  Even the experts do not know what the end result of hepatitis C may be for quite a number of patients, some of whom were infected but cleared the virus out of their system, some of whom still have the virus in their system, and those whose livers are damaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hepatitis C saga should never have happened.  Mistakes were made at the Blood Transfusion Board and the State is liable for the consequences of those mistakes.  Anti-D immunoglobulin was supposed to protect women in <Col N="1300" /> future pregnancies from rhesus disease, but unfortunately the product itself was infected and many of the women who were given it have since experienced problems with hepatitis C.  The virus was also transmitted through contaminated blood.  The first problem facing the Government was to get rid of the contaminated product, which was done speedily.  The Minister initiated a programme of blood testing, etc., to discover how many people were infected. He moved the goal posts on a number of occasions and improved the programme. However, people were not happy with it and the programme was improved.</P>
    <P>We know the extent of the problem but treatment is a different matter. Despite blood tests, liver biopsies, etc., it is not satisfactory.  Interferon may help temporarily and stop the process for a time but it is not a cure.  Those who are infected do not know what will happen to them.  They may experience general ill-health, liver damage which may be chronic, chronically active, active or result in the complete breakdown of the liver system.  In such cases the only treatment is a liver transplant. Even if one has a liver transplant hepatitis C may not be cleared out of the system and may affect the transplanted liver.  That is why Positive Action is so worried about the long-term effects of hepatitis C and the <i>ad hoc</i> system the Minister has put in place.</P>
    <P>Will ongoing treatment be available for such people in ten or 20 years' time? People are not concerned primarily about compensation but about their health.  How will it be looked after today, tomorrow and in the future?  The Minister has not answered that completely. He stated the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal will look after those who are infected and ensure compensation is paid. However, they are not convinced and neither are we.  If we were, we would not have tabled this motion.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated he is setting a number of health services in train.  He has broken it up into primary and secondary health care services, a special <Col N="1301" /> research programme and a statutory monetary body.  Much of that is pious aspirations.  Has he negotiated free treatment with general practitioners? Has he told the health boards what extra provision will be made in the budget for these new programmes?  The Minister spoke about dental, aural and independent counselling services.  These services are overcrowded and there is often a long waiting list.  The Minister said he will guarantee these services will be available but no specific provisions have been made with the health boards to ensure that the programme will be in place when it is required.  Home help and nursing homes are other areas that must be examined.</P>
    <P>The Minister made provision for people in need of tertiary care in St. James's Hospital, Beaumont, St. Vincent's, Cork University Hospital and University College Hospital, Galway. Many people alluded to the fact that there is not anything available in Limerick. If it had been possible I am sure the Minister would have a programme fully operational in Limerick.  However, there are not many hepaticologists and the service must be provided in the hospitals where they operate.</P>
    <P>Will the services be available?  One such service is access to in-patient and out-patient treatment.  That is available if people are prepared to wait.  Most people are exempted from hospital charges.  As regards appropriate staffing levels and arrangements for staff training, how will staff numbers be increased if there is an embargo on staffing in health boards?  There is a problem in the Midland Health Board.  How will the Minister provide the extra funding? There is a great difference in the service provided by various health boards, one may provide a good service, another a mediocre one and a third a service I would rather not mention.  Those are the problems facing the Minister.</P>
    <P>Although he is making a great effort those infected with hepatitis C are not happy with the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal.  They want something in writing, on a statutory basis, that will outlive this and <Col N="1302" /> other Governments so that in 30 years' time children who are affected today by hepatitis C will have statutory rights. The Minister should explain a number of elements of the programme he has in train, especially in relation to liver transplantation treatment outside Ireland.  This may not be a big factor because, fortunately, we have good hepatologists and liver transplant provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>This is in response to a matter raised by a well respected GP in the Dundalk locality, Dr. Mary Grehan, who from time to time has given us the benefit of various studies and analyses she has carried out in relation to a considerable practice in the Dundalk area.  On previous occasions she has brought forward data which caused concern to her and other GPs in the area.  I raised in the House over two years ago issues of concern that had been brought to my attention by Dr. Grehan and others.  It is my recollection a commitment was given that some examination would take place but it has not.</P>
      <P>This week Dr. Grehan has produced a further study in relation to what she considers disquieting trends in her practice. The study carried out showed a much higher than average vitamin and enzyme deficiency in the town.  The Minister should give a commitment that his Department will look at the figures produced and will put in place, as previously promised, a multi-disciplinary study of the issues being examined by Dr. Grehan and another doctor in the practice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not wish to be alarmist but the data produced by Dr. Grehan would lead one to suspect there is something amiss and it needs to be investigated. The results from the study of 300 <Col N="1303" /> patients show that 39.6 per cent had vitamin B12 and alkaline phosphate levels below acceptable levels.  She further found from a preliminary analysis of another 700 people that there were similar trends in that regard but they needed to be looked at in more detail.  The doctor said that vitamin B12 deficiency is usually associated with poor nutrition and with patients in the 70 years and over category; people who would normally be disadvantaged, perhaps elderly people at the lower end of the income scale.  Apparently, according to the doctor's data, this phenomenon has appeared in a range of patients at all levels of society, people who would have a very healthy diet normally.</P>
    <P>It is a matter which, according to Dr. Grehan, has subsequently manifested itself in congenital considerations.  She suggests that it needs to be looked at in greater detail by the Department.  A study must be undertaken in relation to births in the area to see if these deficiencies are being passed on.  The root cause of the deficiency should be sought and examined by the Department. There are suggestions that it may be related to a deterioration in the environment.  I do not know if that is the case and I do not wish to be alarmist in relation to a matter that could dramatically affect my constituency.</P>
    <P>The Department needs to study the matter.  The Minister should undertake that a broad-ranging study will be carried out, encompassing parents and new born babies, to see how the phenomenon is manifesting itself.  There are some figures which might lead one to suggest there is a higher incidence of deformities in this area.  The Minister must take this matter seriously.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware of the study being conducted by a general practitioner in the Dundalk area.  I have noted the recent media comments on the study regarding possible vitamin and enzyme deficiencies in some patients. However, I am advised that the data <Col N="1304" /> available to date is of a preliminary nature. The study has not yet been published or made available to the Department of Health.</P>
      <P>The media reports have raised the possibility of an environmental health problem.  However, the Deputy will be aware of the extreme difficulties involved in conclusively demonstrating a link between unusual clusters of illness and any environmental factors.  I assure the Deputy I will have the research study examined very carefully as soon as it is completed and published, and any further investigation considered necessary will be carried out.</P>

However, I have visited it and seen the dedicated nursing care expertly given to the babies there, and to say there is not such a unit is to play with words.  It has evolved over the last four years and has played a vital role.  The infants can be brought to Dublin by ambulance but that takes time and a few minutes can mean the difference between life and death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I visited the unit last September and spoke at length to parents who were sitting with their infants.  It was of great comfort to them that a unit providing such care was available in Mullingar. The Department and the Midland Health Board are not taking this issue seriously.  I understand the Midland Health Board made an arrangement last May with the nurses organisation that it would give proper staffing to the unit. That fell through because of an embargo on public service recruitment. The Midland Health Board now says <Col N="1305" /> some of the extra staffing which it and the INO is looking for may come from the unit.  The Minister may say that if the health board prioritises the neonatal unit he has no difficulty but the board does not have the funds to do that.</P>
    <P>Over the years the MHB has been a good manager.  When I was in the Department of Health for three months I met the chief executive officer and chairman of each health board, we went through all the budgets and I presented the Estimate for the Department in that period.  It struck me that the MHB was the most careful health board with its money &mdash; it comes within or close to its budget each financial year &mdash; yet health boards which overrun their budgets get the same <i>pro rata</i> allocation as it does. It may be that because the board is such a good manager it does not get any special treatment.</P>
    <P>I will not stray into the issue of industrial relations within the Midland Health Board as there will be other debates on that.  I am here to speak about the neonatal unit.  I do not agree there has never been such a unit there &mdash; I visited it three months ago, so it did exist.  It is a matter of public record in the INO annals that staffing commensurate with the work being carried out was promised.  That fell through because an embargo was placed on recruitment. The issue has raised its head again and has been cynically used by the MHB and Department of Health.  The Minister will say that if the MHB prioritises it can have the nursing staff and put them into the unit.</P>
    <P>There are three general hospitals in this vast area &mdash; I am concerned with a small unit which is a valuable and valued resource.  I ask the Minister to ring-fence special funding and staffing for the neonatal unit in Mullingar General Hospital.  I pay tribute to all those who nursed and cared for young babies there.  We pay lip service to being prolife and to care of children, infants and families &mdash; this is a chance to put what we all believe into practice and to give it proper funding.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for giving me some of his time.  The paediatric unit in Mullingar general hospital opened in 1990 and since then a tremendous level of care has been developed within it.  It provides excellent care for new-born babies and those in extreme difficulties.  A neonatal unit has evolved and developed quite slowly over the past four years &mdash; the nucleus of such a unit exists there at present.  We are happy to have that unit in our area and hope it can be nurtured and developed. The Midland Health Board is the only one in the country without an official neonatal unit and this must be put right. I ask the Minister to use his good offices to liaise with the MHB to ensure a proper neonatal unit is established in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamPenrose" hpid="Mr. Penrose Mr. Penrose">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Penrose</NameTxt>
      <P>I too thank the Minister for sharing his time.  I stress the importance of the neonatal unit to Mullingar General Hospital and ask the Minister to instruct the Midland Health Board to ensure the continuance of this important facility.  It has served a role in the provision of crucial maternity services in the MHB area and particularly for the people of Westmeath.  The MHB must immediately set about giving priority to the provision of the necessary complement of staff so that the neonatal unit is allowed to continue to provide the excellent care and services it has to date, to which we have become accustomed and which has been in existence since 1990.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Midland Health Board has been extremely prudent in controlling its budget and has often paid the price for this prudence.  Many steps were taken by the board over the last decade but these do not appear to have been rewarded.  I ask that an extra allocation <Col N="1307" /> be made available to it so that the staff may be provided.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am pleased to have this opportunity to outline the arrangements which have been made for the development of paediatric services in the Midland Health Board area and, in particular, to provide details of the developments at Mullingar General Hospital.</P>
      <P>The development of the paediatric unit at Mullingar hospital has taken place in the context of a major upgrading of paediatric services generally in the Midland Health Board area.  The unit at Mullingar is one of two consultant-staffed paediatric units which have been established at Portlaoise and Mullingar general hospitals during the past ten years.  Both these units provide a broadly similar level of care for new-born infants in conjunction with the maternity units at those hospitals.  The level of care required by new-born infants can vary considerably, depending on the condition of the child. This can range from routine post-natal care to extremely specialised neonatal intensive care, requiring a dedicated unit under the direction of a neonatologist and possibly requiring the involvement of other paediatric sub-specialists.</P>
      <P>In common with most other paediatric units around the country, the highest level of neonatal care is not provided at Mullingar or Portlaoise.  However, the level of service provided at Mullingar caters very well for the vast majority of cases which present there.  This is reflected in the small numbers of new born babies transferred from Mullingar to the more specialised units.  A similar level of care for new-born infants is provided at Portlaoise and the criteria for the transfer of children to other units are similar to those which apply at Mullingar.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The paediatric unit at Mullingar will continue to provide the agreed level of service for which funding and staffing was provided when the unit was established in 1990.  Should the Midland <Col N="1308" /> Health Board wish to consider expanding the service to include a higher level of neonatal care, the matter will be examined having regard to its overall priorities for development of acute hospital services in the Midland Health Board area and the accepted criteria for the development of specialised neonatal services.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I confirm there is no question of closing any facility associated with the paediatric or maternity units at Mullingar.  The issue which the Deputy raises concerns the level of specialist care to be provided and I have explained that the agreed level of service will be maintained.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have to remind the House of the two vicious attacks on the elderly in Galway on Sunday night last, 10 December.  It is important, however, to put on the record that the two men were savagely attacked in their homes and were found only yesterday afternoon, after a terrifying ordeal.  It is known that masked raiders terrorised the two elderly men. They were both beaten and the raiders threatened to set them on fire.  The men were tied up and left abandoned in their homes for over 16 hours before they were discovered and taken to hospital. Gardaí in Galway believe the two crimes were linked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local community, with citizens the length and breadth of the country, are rightly stunned and frightened by the extent and ferocity of these vicious attacks on two extremely defenceless citizens.  Attacks on the elderly shock us all but these were shameful in their ferocity. Everyone in the House will agree that attacks such as this are not only intolerable but unacceptable.  We &mdash; and more particularly, the Government and the Minister for Justice &mdash; must not let such attacks become the norm.  They are getting more prevalent and must be stopped.  The cold, damp and darkness <Col N="1309" /> of winter time is bad enough for our elderly friends and neighbours but to add the fear and apprehension of attack is intolerable.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the escalating crime problem time and again in this House, I have continued to put forward measures, which have fallen on deaf ears, to address the problem.  We all owe a great debt of gratitude to our elderly citizens and they continue to play an important role in society.  Fianna Fáil has &mdash; on many fronts and over many years &mdash; a long and proud tradition of care for the elderly.  It is and must be the duty of every Member to put measures in place which enhance, protect and safeguard our elderly citizens. The message must go out very clearly to those who perpetrate those crimes that they will go to prison and stay there until they have paid their debt to society; they must be made an example of to others who might be of like mind. The major problem seems to be the availability of prison spaces.  Until such time as sufficient prison spaces are avilable, hardened criminals will perpetrate these crimes and will not serve the sentences which they should.  This encourages others of like mind who might feel that they too will get away with a soft punishment.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the neighbourhood watch scheme and community policing need to be enhanced.  The Minister for Finance should ensure in February 1996 that the elderly are given a subvention for burglar alarm systems in their homes, akin to the medical alert system. Purchasing these systems does not require a great deal of money but the elderly find it difficult to so do on meagre pensions.  The time has come for the elderly to be subvented in order to protect them in their homes.  If an elderly person is living alone, or with other elderly people, they should be given a subvention by the Government to provide a sufficient alarm system in their homes to protect them in times of emergency and difficulty, as occurred in the tragic cases in Galway on Sunday night.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice.  I take this opportunity to condemn in the strongest possible manner the attack which took place over the weekend in Loughrea.  It is a matter of concern to all right minded people that senior citizens can be subjected to such cowardly attacks.  I have no doubt that the Garda will do everything within their power to bring those responsible to justice.</P>
      <P>The problem of attacks on elderly people is not a new one.  As many Deputies will remember, such attacks first came to public prominence in the winter of 1984.  At that time, there was a series of attacks against elderly people living in isolated rural areas.  However, following determined action on the part of the Garda there was a significant and sustained reduction in the incidence of such attacks.  Whereas in 1984 there were 432 attacks in cases where the injured party was aged 65 years or more and living in a remote area, this had declined to 177 by the following year.  In 1993, the last year for which I have a figure, 80 such attacks were recorded by the Garda.  This is not to imply that we have any reason for complacency.  On the contrary, as the attacks in Loughrea demonstrate, one such attack is one attack too many.</P>
      <P>For this reason, the Garda continue to take all possible steps to minimise such attacks.  Among the measures taken by the Garda are: patrolling of areas deemed to be at special risk and the operation of checkpoints and carrying out spot checks on suspect cars. Also, they are visiting elderly people who might be at risk regularly to reassure them of Garda support and also advising them of ways of improving their personal safety and the security of their homes.  A list of such persons is maintained at local Garda stations for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another measure is working closely with voluntary agencies involved with the elderly.  For example, the Garda work closely with Muintir na Tíre in the community alert scheme which plays a <Col N="1311" /> vital role in the prevention of attacks against the elderly.  In this regard, there are 45 such schemes, covering 9,718 households, in the Galway East/ Roscommon Garda Division and 23 schemes, covering 6,236 households, in the Galway West Division.  In addition, the community policing scheme for rural areas, which was put into place in 100 rural stations in September, 1991, has enabled the Garda to spend more time on operational duties, including visits to the elderly.</P>
    <P>For her part, the Minister for Justice takes this problem very seriously indeed.  Recently, she met with the National Federation of Pensioners Association and heard from them at first hand about their concerns.  She has also met with Muintir na Tíre and initiated a review of the community alert scheme.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that protection of the elderly is a priority and will continue to be so.  The achievements of the Garda in dealing with this type of crime are proof of this.  I know Members will join me in expressing the hope that those responsible for the attacks in Loughrea are apprehended as soon as possible.  I apologise to Deputy O'Donoghue for the absence of the Minister for Justice who is unavoidably detained.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - BSE Incidence.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment. The Irish beef trade, recently hit by savage cuts in export refunds, is now doubly threatened.  BSE has been detected 160,000 times in the British herd.  Enormous publicity has attended this disease and concern has been dramatically heightened about the human variant of that disease, Creutzfeld Jakob disease.  The decision by some school authorities in the UK to take beef off their menus is a particularly dramatic issue which has had some effect on consumer opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> The immediate challenge to the Government is to ensure that Irish beef is not dragged down by problems with the British product.  A 20 per cent drop in UK beef consumption means £50 million lost in Irish exports.  In contrast to the 160,000 cases in the UK, there have been just over 100 cases in Ireland, all of which have been dealt with by a total extermination of the herds affected.  It is evident that, in the long run, a quality programme which guarantees total traceability is required.  The Minister must, as a matter of national importance, institute a system of grading and traceability.  Some weeks ago, the same issue of who will pay was raised during the debate on the sheep crisis.  The reality is that everyone is now paying dearly for the absence of a system of traceability.</P>
    <P>What is required, but is sadly lacking, is a long-term vision of where we will be in ten years' time.  The Minister was engaged last week in a desperate fire brigade measure.  If he continues this policy of <i>laissez faire,</i> the Irish beef industry will be forever the victim of any and every scare, real and imagined.</P>
    <P>The crisis, which has the potential if not properly dealt with to demolish our export markets, comes at a time when the beef trade has already been hit by accumulated and substantial reductions in beef export refunds.  I recall the Minister saying a few weeks ago that the reduction in the export refunds would not in any way affect the price of cattle. However, anyone selling cattle this week knows the reality.</P>
    <P>The combination of all these factors will be fully felt in the spring, if not earlier. In 1996 there will be a worse scenario of circumstances for the Irish beef trade.  There is an onus on the Minister to exercise leadership.  A major distinction has to be made in the consumer markets between any problems which exist in relation to indigenous beef in Britain and the extraordinary measures we have taken to ensure BSE is not a factor in the Irish national herd.</P>
    <Col N="1313" />
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Cowen for raising this issue because I share his concerns about the implications for Irish beef producers and processors because of the situation in the UK market.  BSE concerns have been a recurring feature of the beef trade since the disease was first diagnosed in the 1980s.  BSE is a highly complex subject and the lack of full scientific knowledge of the disease has resulted in a number of unjustified scares regarding beef in general which can be difficult to counter.</P>
      <P>The position is that Ireland has a very low incidence of the disease &mdash; there have been 13 cases this year and only 112 cases since 1989 out of a population of 7 million cattle.  This compares to Britain where there have been 57,000 cases out of a population of 12 million cattle.  Nevertheless, a comprehensive range of control measures has been put in place to isolate and eliminate the few cases which have occurred here.  These controls include the compulsory notification of the disease and the destruction of affected animals under official supervision. We are the only country in Europe which depopulates the entire herd where there is one outbreak</P>
      <P>The import of meat and bone meal from the UK, including Northern Ireland, is prohibited as is the feeding of such meal to ruminants, namely sheep and cattle.  I pay tribute to the former Government who in 1990 put in place these controls.  The food chain here is not in any danger.  Imports of cattle from the UK, other than minor exceptions, are prohibited by the EU, while imports of meat products from the UK are subject to strict controls.  Ante and post mortem examinations are carried out by qualified veterinarians to ensure that there is no possibility of suspect BSE animals getting into the food chain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These controls go beyond what is required by scientific evidence or by international organisations.  They are aimed at ensuring that BSE does not again gain a foothold in Ireland and, as <Col N="1314" /> importantly, serve to reassure consumers and our international customers that the reputation of Irish beef as a safe and quality product continues to be upheld.  These controls have stood up to rigorous scrutiny and Irish beef continues to be exported to more than 60 countries worldwide. Indeed Irish traders have been very successful in expanding their exports, particularly to continental markets, in recent years.</P>
    <P>It must be stated that the recent difficulties in the UK are not based on the emergence of new scientific facts.  This underlines my earlier point that unjustified fears can only too easily be whipped up.  Nevertheless the position is that once concerns have been raised, all beef consumption on a particular market is affected.  A similar position occurred last year when the German market reacted to BSE related concerns and other similar cases have occurred across Europe.</P>
    <P>It is very important to take action to restore confidence on the UK market and to increase beef consumption there which will be to the benefit of all producers, including Irish producers.  The situation in the UK is currently under review.  Consultations have been initiated with An Bord Bia and the beef industry.  Senior officials at my Department had discussions with officials from both those organisations last night.  A number of initiatives aimed at restoring UK consumer confidence in beef through an appropriate promotion campaign are under consideration.  It is also proposed that a co-ordinated campaign should be targeted at the UK multiple chains which market Irish beef to fully explain the safety of our product. Assistance and information will also be provided to individual traders and buyers. The timing of a concerted campaign on the UK market will of course be crucial and this needs to be considered carefully in conjunction with the relevant agencies.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged that the UK continues to be a very important outlet for our beef and I intend to take every opportunity to address the matter that <Col N="1315" /> has arisen.  Exports of our beef to the UK are worth £120 million per annum. I would welcome suggestions from Deputy Cowen and other members of the Opposition on how we can distinguish our beef, but we do not want to give rise to retaliatory action from the British authorities.  Our beef was never a safer product.  The stringent controls on depopulation, the ban on the feeding <Col N="1316" /> of meat and bone meal to cattle and other measures, including tighter veterinary surveillance, that we have put in place give me absolute confidence in assuring the Irish and British public that there is no danger associated with the consumption of our beef.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 92 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a high level of ongoing contact and co-operation between the road authorities here and those in Northern <Col N="1094" /> Ireland.  This process has been enhanced on foot of the peace process and there have been a number of significant developments in the last 12 months.</P>
    <P>A little over 12 months ago, more than 110 cross-Border roads were subject to closure orders and physically impassable.  This position has now been substantially reversed following close co-operation by both administrations. These roads are now open to traffic, save for a small number where extensive physical works are required.</P>
    <P>In relation to wider aspects of road development, I met my Northern Ireland counterpart, Mr. Malcolm Moss MP, in February last within the framework of the Anglo-Irish Conference.  In relation to the Newry-Dundalk route, we agreed a two-stage approach.  On foot of this, short-term measures have been developed to improve the safety of the existing road and a report on the steps necessary to implement these is being finalised; immediate and speedy implementation will be pursued.  For the longer term, we agreed that a study should be undertaken of route options to meet long-term transportation needs. Following agreement on a brief for this study, advertisements were placed in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 8 November last seeking proposals from interested consultants and a joint application for assistance towards the costs of the study has been lodged with the European Commission.</P>
    <P>A Joint Project Board is undertaking a review of plans for the future improvement of the N2/A5 Dublin-Derry Route, taking account of work planned and completed near major towns such as Omagh and Strabane in the North and at Aclint, Bloomfield-Castleblayney, Corlatt, and North Road, Finglas in the South.  Good progress has also been made in relation to Aghalane Bridge on the Dublin-Enniskillen-Donegal route; agreement on a new bridge and necessary road works has been reached and work is expected to commence in 1996.</P>
    <P>In relation to the European Commission's proposed Trans European <Col N="1095" /> Road Networks (TENS), joint co-operation and a common approach has been adopted and, on foot of this, four important cross-Border routes have been included in this network.  In addition, the Cork-Dublin-Belfast route has been included in the group of first priority projects identified in the conclusions of the European Summit in Essen in December 1994.</P>

However, replies from 86 authorities indicate that there are 1,850 bed spaces available in hostels, of which 876, 326, 80, 103 and 65 are in the County Boroughs of Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway, respectively.  Information is not available in the Department on the number of persons who sought hostel or emergency places in the years from 1900 to 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Measures already taken to improve the accommodation situation for homeless people have ensured that there is no basis for assuming that homelesseness is at a serious level in Ireland.  These measures include the expansion of the <Col N="1097" /> local authority housing programme from 1,000 `starts' in 1992 to 3,900 in 1995 which benefits approved applicants, whether homeless or otherwise, for local authority housing; increased capital funding for voluntary bodies providing housing accommodation, a substantial part of which is accommodation for homeless people; the increase from 80 per cent to 90 per cent in the level of recoupment by my Department to local authorities in respect of expenditure under section 10 of the Housing Act, 1988 on accommodation for homeless people; and the provision of an emergency hostel, now operated by the Salvation Army at lower Grangegorman, Dublin.</P>
    <P>An after-hours referral service for homeless people in Dublin, Kildare and Wicklow who are seeking accommodation outside normal opening hours came into operation in November 1993. A freephone service is provided outside the opening hours of the homeless persons' unit of the Eastern Health Board and covers the hours of 5 p.m. to 1.00 a.m. from Mondays to Fridays and 10.00 a.m. to 1.00 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays.  I have no proposals at present to expand this service but, if any other housing authority considers that a similar service is necessary in their area, I will be prepared to consider any proposal they make.</P>
    <P>While I am generally satisfied with the progress being made in relation to the provision of accommodation for homeless people, I will be keeping the situation under close review.</P>

      <P>It is my policy, as far as is practicable, to accede to requests from representative organisations to discuss matters for which my Department is responsible.  It would not, of course, be possible to accede to all such requests; each is considered on its merits.</P>
      <P>As regards the Automobile Association, I received a letter dated 1 November 1995 from the managing director seeking a meeting to explain the association's position on tolling and to present the results of market research commissioned by it.  A detailed response issued to the association on 24 November pointing out, among other things:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll by-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors is vested in the National Roads Authority under Part V of the Roads Act, 1993;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that before a toll can be imposed on any road, there are comprehensive procedures which must be complied with including the making of a toll scheme, the giving of public notice, consultation with local authorities and the submission of the scheme for the approval of the Minister;</P>
      <P>&mdash;that where there are objections, a public local inquiry must be held before a decision is taken on the scheme, and that the AA and any other interested person or group would then have an opportunity to make its views known on the particular proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The letter to the association went on to say that, as I have a quasi-judicial function in relation to toll schemes, it would not be appropriate for me to discuss or comment on possible tolling proposals for individual roads or categories of road, or to offer any other comments which might be regarded as prejudicing the future exercise of this function.  It concluded by indicating, that for the <Col N="1099" /> reasons outlined, I could not accede to the request for a meeting to discuss the NRA's tolling proposals but that if the association wished to present the results of its research, a meeting for that purpose with my special adviser could be arranged.  I understand that such a meeting is to take place later this week.</P>
    <P>I believe that the response to the association's request for a meeting with me was the correct one, in the particular circumstances.</P>

      <P>The basic discretionary block grant to Cork Corporation for the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads stood at £810,000 in the years 1991-1993 and was increased to £1 million in both 1994 and 1995, an increase of over 23 per cent.  In addition, a grant allocation of £200,000 is available to the corporation this year for two projects under the EU co-financed scheme, bringing their total grant allocations for non-national roads to £1.2 million in 1995.</P>
      <P>The exceptional grant payment of £1.944 million in 1985 to Cork Corporation does not give a realistic picture of the true level of State grants to the corporation over the last decade and cannot legitimately be used as a benchmark to assess payment for subsequent years. The 1985 total included payments of £1.477 million under a special grants scheme available at that time and a discretionary grant of £517,000.  Allowing for inflation over the last decade, the 1995 discretionary grant allocation to the corporation represents an increase of about 46 per cent on the corresponding 1985 figure.</P>

      <Col N="1104" /> In 1995, £214 million is being provided by the Exchequer to the National Roads Authority for the improvement and maintenance of national roads &mdash; £191 million for improvement works and £23 million for maintenance and management of the network.  This total is an increase of 10 per cent on the corresponding 1994 provision and I believe it to be a reasonable one having regard to competing pressures on available resources.  The maintenance and management element of the overall provision is up by 8.5 per cent on the figure for 1994.</P>
    <P>The strategy and financial plan set out in the Operational Programme for Transport, 1994-1999, provides the framework within which the allocation of grants to individual projects on both national primary and national secondary routes is determined by the National Roads Authority.  The Authority has commenced a major study to assess long-term national road development requirements, including an assessment of maintenance requirements.  The study will take up to two years to complete and will permit objective assessment of funding requirements for subsequent years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 39 and 98 together.</P>
      <P>The Government strategy document &ldquo;Recycling for Ireland&rdquo; provides that local authorities should have an active role in the development of waste recycling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities will be supported in this enhanced role by way of the provisions of the Waste Bill, 1995, and by the new grant assistance for waste management planning and recycling which is <Col N="1110" /> being made available under the waste management sub-programme of the operational programme for environmental services.  Details of this grant assistance will be published very shortly and applications will be invited from interested local authorities and private sector operators.</P>
    <P>Since 1989, my Department has provided 92 grants to a total value of £2.1 million from Exchequer funds under recycling grants schemes.  A small number of further grant payments is anticipated before end-1995.</P>
    <P>My Department has already been active in promoting increased recycling activity by local authorities, for example through a seminar on waste management organised for senior local authorities officials in October 1995.  This promotion of recycling will be continued.</P>

      <P>A programme to improve energy conservation in local authority housing is being developed by my Department in consultation with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  The programme will, in particular, address the problem of low thermal efficiency of some local authority dwellings.  The needs of the elderly will be specially considered in this context.  The context of the programme must recognise that securing improvement, in a structural sense, to houses which have low thermal efficiency would require the commitment of considerable resources.  In the current situation of limited finances and other pressing priorities in relation to <Col N="1111" /> housing, it will be necessary that the programme rely on securing implementation of relatively inexpensive good practices which can contribute to increased thermal efficiency.</P>
      <P>The thermal efficiency of certain local authority dwellings is being upgraded as part of major structural works carried out under the Remedial Works Scheme.  I have also allocated funds, under the housing management grants scheme which I introduced this year, to assist South Dublin County Council carry out a pilot project to promote the effective use of energy in two local authority estates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for the Environment, I avail of all appropriate opportunities to promote at international level the Government's concerns about the risk to the environment from nuclear installations.  I most recently did so at the EU Environment Council on 6 October and in the context of the ECE Ministerial Conference, <i>Environment for Europe,</i> held in Sofia from 23 to 25 October.  On these occasions, I emphasised that risk of nuclear accidents is rightly perceived by the European public as a leading environmental concern, but that current policies were not sufficiently responding to this concern by proper application of the precautionary and other environmental principles now well established for non-nuclear activities. While accepting that the preponderance of concern in this area related to nuclear facilities in Central and Eastern Europe, I pointed out the deep concern of the Irish public in relation to the operation of the Sellafield installation, <Col N="1112" /> including the THORP plant, and as regards the disclosure earlier this year of a serious incident at the Wylfa plant in Anglesea.  I also restated at the Environment Council the Irish Government's position on the need for de-commissioning of UK Magnox reactors.</P>
      <P>These interventions are part of a consistent Government approach to the question of nuclear risk, on which both the Taoiseach and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications have also recently made representations to their UK counterparts.</P>
      <P>I act as Chairman of the Ministerial Committee on Sellafield and the Irish Sea set up by the Government to progress policy on nuclear issues.  In addition to the actions outlined by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in his replies of 12 October 1995 to Questions Nos. 11, 17, 18 and 27, and to Questions Nos. 15, 19, 30 and 80, the committee is keeping in touch with the work of the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Transport, Energy and Communications which are investigating the feasibility of amending the EURATOM Treaty to place greater emphasis on health, safety and environmental aspects.  The committee is also involved with an initiative taken by the Department of the Marine, within the International Maritime Organisation, seeking to strengthen the present code of practice governing the carriage by sea or irradiated nuclear fuels.</P>

      <P>While the information sought <Col N="1113" /> is not routinely compiled in my Department, some details of requests for information were collected in 1994 for the specific purpose of reviewing the first year of operation of the regulations. The review, published in April 1995, indicated that 43.8 per cent of requests were responded to within one month.  A further 31.4 per cent were responded to within two months, which is the statutory time period specified in the regulations. Because the information was received in the form of percentages over set periods, it is not possible to derive an average response time.</P>
      <P>Arising from the findings of the review, and from Government commitments to improve access to information generally, I have made a commitment to improve the regulations, including reducing the period for response to requests to one month, as a general rule. Amending regulations are being finalised at present.</P>

Decisions on planning applications are a matter for the local planning authorities and, on appeal, for An Bord Pleanála and I have no power to give directions as to how such applications should be dealt with.  My Department is, however, preparing guidelines in relation to these masts for the guidance of planning authorities and developers.

      <P>The shortfall in the estimate for staffing in the Office of the Attorney General is attributable to a combination of factors; viz. (a) the take-on of additional staff in the Chief State Solicitor's Office to deal with the volume of claims for compensation for deafness being made by former and serving Defence Forces personnel, (b) insufficient provision in the original estimate for the cost of pay increases in 1995, (c) the full-year cost of an assistant secretary and assistant principal officer seconded to the Office of the Attorney General from the Department of Justice as part of the reorganisation of that Office and (d) a number of promotions of staff within the Office arising from the recommendations contained in the report of the Review Group on the Office of the Attorney General which was published on 21 February 1995.</P>
      <P>The shortfall in the estimate for fees to counsel is attributable to the fact that accurate estimation in this demand-led area of expenditure is difficult.  Expenditure is determined, in the main, by such factors as the number of court actions to which the State is a party in any one year, the length of the cases and their complexity.</P>

      <P>I have no proposals to introduce the tax relief sought.  I would like to point out that parents with children in third level education, even those ineligible for the <Col N="1121" /> higher education grants scheme, already benefit from the very considerable financial asistance which the State provides for third level education.  The 1995 budget contained a number of further significant measures of direct benefit to the parents or guardians of third level students.  The measures include the phasing out over two years of fees, beginning with the current academic year, for third level undergraduate students in publicly funded colleges and to abolish fees for post leaving certificate courses.  Provision has also been made for tax relief on fees paid to approved private colleges in respect of approved courses from the academic year 1996/97.</P>
      <P>An income tax concession of the sort proposed would not only involve a substantial cost to the Exchequer but would, inevitably, be bound to generate many similar claims from other taxpayers for tax relief on a variety of personal expenditure.  The consequential loss to the Exchequer would mean that considerable revenue would have to be found elsewhere to maintain services.</P>

      <P>The following is a full list of the places where smoking will be prohibited or restricted under new regulations which I will be making shortly and which will come into effect on January 1 next.  Bingo halls are included among the wide range of entertainment facilities in which smoking will be prohibited.</P>
      <P>Smoking is a major cause of cancer and cardiovascular disease which the health strategy identified as the two main causes of illness and premature death in the country.  The new controls on smoking will contribute to reducing the incidence of smoking and exposure to passive smoking.  Promoting a smoke-free environment is an important safeguard in protecting public health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Places where smoking will be prohibited: the circulation space including stairways, escalators, lifts, corridors, landings and concourse areas, as well as offices to which the public has access and conference/meeting rooms within buildings or premises (other than hotels) which belong to, or are in the occupation of the State, or a body, established by or under an Act of the Oireachtas; any part of a pre-school, creche, play-group, day nursery or other service which caters for pre-school children, any part of a primary or secondary school (including the school yard), save that smoking may be permitted where specific facilities, other than classrooms or recreation rooms, are provided for staff to smoke; any part of the buildings of third level educational institutions, <Col N="1124" /> except licensed premises therein and in specific facilities other than classrooms, lecture theatres or recreation rooms provided for staff or students to smoke; the kitchens and food preparation areas in hotels, restaurants, cafes, snack bars, retail and licensed premises in which food is stored or prepared for human consumption; the retail, storage and food preparation areas in supermarkets, grocery stores and butchers premises; waiting rooms in railway and bus stations; the auditoriums of cinemas, theatres, and of premises which are purpose built or adapted for the holding of concerts for public entertainment, specific areas (including playing areas and circulation space) within premises which are used for the playing of bingo and bridge; the indoor spectator and games areas in sports centres and the games area in ten-pin bowling alleys; State-owned art galleries and museums, public libraries; child care centres, hospitals, nursing homes, long stay geriatric homes, maternity homes, centres for the mentally handicapped and for the physically handicapped and other health facilities such as residential and day care centres other than psychiatric hospitals, except where specific facilities are provided for staff to smoke; doctors' and dentists' waiting rooms, and retail pharmacies; public access areas in banks, building societies and other retail financial agencies, public access areas in hairdressing salons and barber shops; the DART and Arrow train services, in taxis and hackney cabs, all public service vehicles owned or operated by Bus Éireann and by Bus Átha Cliath, privately owned transport vehicles used by the public which have a seating capacity for eight persons or more and which are engaged in the transport of persons for financial reward.</P>
    <P>Places where smoking will be restricted: psychiatric hospitals &mdash; whatever size is deemed appropriate by the hospital management; two-thirds of the seating area in trains (other than DART and Arrow), aircraft, passenger ferries, and the Arrivals and Departures areas in airports and harbours; restaurants, <Col N="1125" /> canteens, cafes and snack-bars &mdash; at present, and until May 1, 1996, the size of the no-smoking area is at the discretion of the management.  From that date, the area will have to be either &mdash; at least one-half of the seating area or &mdash; at least one quarter of the seating area where the health board is satisfied that the ventilation or air filtration system is adequate to prevent the circulation of tobacco smoke into the no-smoking area.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): The emergence of multiple antibiotic resistant bacteria over the last 20 years has become one of the most serious threats to the control and successful treatment of infection. MRSA is the commonest of these bacteria encountered in this country and the development of measures to ensure its control has been a major priority both for individual hospitals and for my Department.</P>
      <P>Infection control in general is a matter which is always afforded a high priority and in order to deal with the specific problems presented by MRSA, an expert committee was established to draw up guidelines for its control.  The committee has now completed its work and I am happy to inform the Deputy that the guidelines drawn up by the committee, together with an information leaflet for all health care personnel, will be published by my Department later this month.  I am confident that these guidelines will be of great assistance to all those involved in the task of infection control.</P>

I announced during the summer my commitment to a capital programme over the next few years which will improve and expand long-stay health board care facilities for the elderly in each of the eight health boards.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibility for ensuring the adequacy of general practitioner services for medical card patients rests with the chief executive officer of the relevant health board.  Since 1985 there has <Col N="1129" /> been an increase in the number of GMS doctors from 1,486 in December 1985 to 1,657 at the end of June, 1995.  In that period the average number of patients on each doctors panel decreased from 877 to 776, an average reduction of over 100 patients per panel.  I have no evidence that there is an insufficient number of general practitioners in the GMS.</P>
    <P>Following an agreement between the Department and the Irish Medical Organisation, a group consisting of officials from the Department and the health boards together with representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation and the Irish College of General Practitioners, has been established to review the operation of the current arrangements for GMS entry.</P>
    <P>Correspondence has recently been received from the National Association of Independent General Practitioners regarding this issue which is under consideration in the Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. Currie)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 82 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The number of alleged child abuse cases reported to the health boards in <Col N="1130" /> 1995 is not yet available to my Department. Preliminary figures for 1994 indicate that over 4,600 child abuse cases were reported.  However, it will be some time yet before the number of cases of confirmed abuse is known.</P>
    <P>I propose to circulate in the Official Report the following table setting out the number of reports of child abuse reported to each health board in 1993 and the number of such cases where abuse was confirmed.  In total, some 4,110 reports of alleged child abuse were received by health boards in 1993 of which 1,609 were confirmed.</P>
    <P>The earliest annualised child abuse statistics available in my Department relate to 1979.  The number of alleged cases of child abuse reported in 1979 was 136 of which 75 were confirmed. The number of cases reported in 1984 was 479 of which 184 were confirmed.</P>
    <P>My Department does not collect information on the number of allegations of sexual abuse of adults, as the investigation of such cases is primarily a matter for the Garda.</P>
    <P>The procedures followed by the health boards in investigating allegations of child abuse are in accordance with the guidelines issued by my Department in 1987.  In addition I recently launched guidelines for the &ldquo;Notification of Suspected Cases of Child Abuse between Health Boards and Gardaí&rdquo; which amend the 1987 guidelines in relation to the circumstances in which the health boards and the Garda are to notify suspected cases of child abuse to each other and in relation to the consultations that should take place between both agencies following a notification.</P>
    <P>In response to the recommendations of the Kilkenny Incest Investigation report, the boards are taking steps to improve arrangements for the assessment and management of child abuse cases, with particular importance being attached to co-operation and co-ordination between the hospital and community care services of the health services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): It is my intention that the first phase of the programme will commence as soon as possible and will cover the Eastern, North-Eastern and Midland Health Board areas.  It will target 120,000 women in the age cohort 50 to 64 which represents 50 per cent of the national target population.</P>
      <P>As I have pointed out on previous occasions, the development of a comprehensive population register is a necessary first step in expanding the programme.  To this end, officials of my Department are currently in consultation with the Department of Social Welfare with a view to the compilation of a population register for breast screening purposes.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the decision to proceed on a phased basis is guided by the need for the achievement of acceptable compliance levels among the target population; on-going evaluation of the programme from a quality assurance perspective; and availability of the necessary clinical expertise to conduct the programme.</P>
      <P>It is vital that the phased introduction of the breast screening programme should take cognisance of these critical success factors.  In this regard, my Department is liaising closely with the pilot programme personnel and other relevant agencies to agree the operational details, including a start-up date for phase one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to put in place a national management structure which will oversee the programme.  This structure would be representative of all <Col N="1134" /> appropriate clinical disciplines, including general practitioners.  It will be primarily a matter for the management group to make detailed recommendations on the role of each discipline in implementing the programme.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): As part of Comhairle na nOspidéal's recent review on consultant manpower in Cork, submissions were made to comhairle for additional staff in a range of specialties, including medical oncology.  Comhairle na nOspidéal has accepted the need for a medical oncologist in Cork.  In accordance with the recommendations of the comhairle report, all new consultant posts for Cork fall to be processed through the pan-hospital structure, in consultation with management of the agencies concerned.</P>
      <P>Once this process has been completed, I will then be in a position to consider an application for a consultant oncologist in the context of competing priorities for development funding and available resources within the acute hospital sector.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I am glad to have the opportunity to acknowledge the important role which the City of Dublin <Col N="1135" /> Skin and Cancer Hospital, Hume Street, has played in the provision of dermatology services in the Dublin south-east region.  I would like to put on record that I do not accept the impression conveyed in the remarks, attributed to the hospital's medical director, that the conditions in Hume Street hospital are below acceptable standards.  The hospital management have confirmed that the statement does not represent the collective views of the board, management or staff of the hospital.</P>
      <P>I wish to advise the House that in the past two years, the Department of Health has approved capital grants for Hume Street hospital totalling £185,000. These grants were in addition to the hospital's annual revenue allocation which is in excess of £1 million and represent a significant contribution towards the maintenance of the hospital's infrastructure.</P>
      <P>In relation to the continuing provision of dermatology services at Hume Street hospital, the hospitals involved in providing dermatology services for the Dublin south-east region are at present jointly reviewing the organisation of these services on a regional basis.  The outcome of this review will provide a valuable input to policy for the further development of the services in the Dublin south-east region and I look forward to seeing the results of this work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): In accordance with the policy set out in the health strategy, it is my intention that an accessible and comprehensive family planning service will be developed in each health board <Col N="1136" /> area.  To this end, I have provided specific funding in the current year to enable health boards to develop comprehensive family planning services.  General practitioners, as part of their normal professional activities, provide a wide range of family planning services and the role of the general practitioner in this area has been fully recognised by the health boards.</P>
      <P>As regards the designation of specific general practitioner posts to carry out specialised family planning services, a policy document has already been circulated by the Irish College of General Practitioners in this respect and it will be open to health boards to deal with and fund any service deficits which they identify, including skills deficits, in the context of the implementation of their service plans.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I fully support the establishment of blood transfusion committees in hospitals.  The Blood Transfusion Service Board is willing to assist these committees in preparing guidelines for blood transfusion practices and is prepared to offer advice on an individual basis to the chairpersons of such committees should they desire to avail of it.  The Expert Group Report on the Blood Transfusion Service Board, published in April 1995, made the following recommendation &ldquo;it is crucial for the Board's medical staff to develop closer day to day links with the haematology <Col N="1138" /> departments of Irish hospitals&rdquo;.  Following this recommendation, two consultants from the Blood Transfusion Service Board established formal links with a major teaching hospital and it is hoped that formal links for a third consultant in Cork will be established in the near future.  The consultants at the Blood Transfusion Service Board have put together a series of talks on blood transfusion practices and are considering presenting these talks at venues around the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): There are no statistical data on the number of people misusing ecstasy but reports available indicate that the level of abuse is increasing and is of major concern.  This is also borne out by the increased number of seizures made by the gardaí and Customs services.</P>
      <P>The uncertainty as to the precise formulation of the ecstasy drug taken can present serious difficulties in the treatment of abusers.  I am satisfied, however, that all boards are well equipped to deal with the medical problems caused by ecstasy.</P>
      <P>My priority with regard to the misuse of ecstasy is to put extra resources into primary prevention, through education and awareness campaigns.  Information and education are the most important weapons in the fight against the misuse of drugs.  Young people need to be informed of the dangers of ecstasy, but they also need to be equipped with the skills to avoid turning to drugs as a means of coping with life.  The preparation of a media campaign to be launched early in the new year, is also at an advanced stage in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> My Department will continue to cooperate with other Departments and voluntary agencies on the development of educational resources, and on awareness campaigns.  It is hoped that this positive approach towards attitudes and behaviour will prevent young people from resorting to drugs or other substance abuse, including the abuse of ecstasy.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> The Medical Council has statutory responsibility which it exercises through its fitness to practise <Col N="1140" /> committee to inquire into the conduct of a registered medical practitioner on the grounds of alleged professional misconduct or on the grounds of unfitness to practise by reason of physical or mental disability.  The council has indicated that inquiries convened by its fitness to practise committee are heard in private. It has, however, further indicated that legal advice is being sought on this in light of the ruling of the European Court of Human Rights.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> The Medical Council's ethical guidelines for doctors state that, if a doctor has a conscientious objection to a given line of treatment for a patient, he/she must refer the patient to an appropriate colleague.

      <P>In relation to the general medical services scheme, a participating doctor is obliged by contract to provide services, or arrange to provide services, for all patients on his/her panel.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 88 and 89 together.</P>
      <P>My Department sanctions the increase in subsistence allowances paid to officer grades employed in the health boards.  The date of implementation of new rates has, to date been January 1 of the reference year.  However, as these allowances are also applicable in other public sector employments, where they, in fact, originate, it should be noted that sanction for the payment of these rates would have been issued retrospectively to the health boards in many cases.</P>
      <P>The rates of daily subsistence in respect of the years from January 1980 to date in 1995 are set out in the following table.  The allowances quoted relate to absences of 5-10 hours, payable to officer grade employees of health boards.  There are no formal provisions for the payment of subsistence rates to non-officer grades.  However, in the case of the ambulance service, local arrangements in a number of boards, including the South Eastern Health Board, allow for the payment of the officer rates to those non-officers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of payment to other non-officer grades does not generally arise, but where it does, these are catered for by a range of appropriate allowances.  In the case of tradesmen, vehicle drivers and general operatives in <Col N="1142" /> the South Eastern Health Board specifically, the following arrangements apply:</P>
    <P>All of these grades are paid the Department's approved subsistence rates for officer grades, when they are absent from base for a period in excess of five hours.  One variation on this arrangement is in the Wexford area where tradesmen and general operatives are paid a meal allowance (known as the eating-on-site allowance in other regions).  Vehicle drivers in Wexford have been paid the Department's approved officer rate with effect from 1 January 1995, arising from local staff/management discussions. Payments for subsistence are made monthly on the basis of claims received.</P>

      <P>: Under the essential repairs grant scheme, the local authority may, in appropriate cases, meet the full cost of the necessary works.  In addition, in the case of a local authority house, the local authority may undertake necessary adaptation works to meet the needs of a disabled person at no cost to the applicant. Under the scheme of improvement works in lieu of local authority housing, <Col N="1149" /> a local authority may carry out necessary improvements to a house as an alternative to providing local authority accommodation; in such cases, a small charge related to the cost of the works and the household income may be made similar to a differential rent.</P>

      <P>Each local authority is responsible, as the housing authority for its area, for the planning, initiation and construction or acquisition of housing for people assessed as in need of such accommodation and unable to provide it from their own resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's programme of 7,000 social housing &ldquo;starts&rdquo; a year is a significant commitment towards meeting housing need.  In all, it is expected that the housing needs of some 9,500 households will be catered for under the programme in 1995, rising to over <Col N="1150" /> 10,000 next year.  It is a matter for individual housing authorities to develop to full potential the various social housing measures available to them as a contribution towards meeting the particular housing needs of their areas.</P>
    <P>The available information on the various categories of housing need by household size for each housing authority is set out in Part VIII of my Department's annual housing statistics bulletins for 1991 and 1993, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.  While the published information does not distinguish lone parent families, it is a fact that they constitute a growing element in housing needs in recent years.</P>
    <P>I have directed local authorities to undertake the next assessment of the need for housing accommodation on 29 March 1996.  This will include up-to-date information on household size of people included in the assessment.  The results of the assessment will be published in the Housing Statistics Bulletin in due course.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 116 and 128 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Post-primary teachers who reside away from home while attending an in-service course may be paid an overnight subsistence allowance of £19.91 in the case of block release courses in remedial education and £12.07 in the case of <Col N="1155" /> other courses.  Lunch may also be provided at certain in-service courses.  Travel allowances are also paid.</P>
    <P>Since it was first introduced in the early 1970s, the overnight allowance payable was intended as a contribution towards post-primary teachers' expenses when participating in in-service. The allowance has been increased on a number of occasions over the years.  The adequacy of the amount of the allowance has been raised with my Department and is currently being considered.</P>

      <P>The amount of tuition time given by the visiting teacher to each individual child is dependent upon the needs of the particular child and the visiting teacher's case load.</P>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department is in the process of appointing an additional visiting teacher for the Dublin area.  This will bring to 38 the total number of visiting teachers catering for children with special needs; 14 of these teachers cater for children in Dublin and surrounding areas.</P>
      <P>The visiting teacher service is just one of the support services available for pupils with special needs.  Pupils with learning difficulties are also supported by the remedial and resource teacher services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Earlier this year, as part of my <Col N="1156" /> Department's on-going response to the need for additional support teachers, I allocated a further 10 resource teacher posts to the primary sector with effect from September, 1995.  This brings the total number of such posts in place to 36.  Two of these resource teachers cater for the needs of children with learning difficulties on the north side of Dublin.</P>
    <P>This allocation is in addition to the 55 remedial teacher posts allocated for the 1995-96 school year.  There are now 1,188 remedial teacher posts in the primary sector, of which 368 are located in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The report of the special education review committee made a number of recommendations concerning additional teacher resources in order to assist children with special needs who attend ordinary primary schools.  My Department is pursuing implementation of these recommendations as resources permit.</P>

      <P>Earlier this year, my colleague Minister of State, Deputy Currie, announced a range of proposed developments aimed at improving residential services for children in need of care or in conflict with the law.  The measures in question included a proposal for further development of the Finglas Children's Centre.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Government very recently approved the scheme of the Children Bill, 1995.  This Bill proposes a comprehensive update of the Children Act, 1908 which currently governs the operation of facilities such as the Finglas Children's Centre.</P>
      <P>The proposed legislation will establish the framework within which the centres for young offenders will operate in the future.  The planning and development of future provision in these centres must therefore have regard to the requirements likely to arise from the new legislation.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the authorities in the Finglas Children's Centre have recently submitted detailed proposals for the upgrading and refurbishment of the centre. These proposals will be fully taken into account as part of the wider planning process now under way.</P>

      <P>Accordingly, my Department will be consulting with the colleges of education in the light of the provisions in the White Paper and the experience of the present post-graduate course which comes to an end in June 1996.</P>

      <P>Factory prices for all grades of cattle have fallen slightly recently as a result of a number of factors, most notably the uncertainty surrounding the level of export refunds to third countries, the impact of the BSE scare on beef consumption in the United Kingdom and the reduction in demand for cow beef in France. However it should be recognised that cattle prices have been at satisfactory levels this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have made it clear that in my view the lower refunds should have only a limited effect on cattle prices over the next couple of months because the bulk <Col N="1175" /> of the trade in that period will be conducted with the help of refunds which were fixed at the higher levels.  Nevertheless, I am concerned about the longer-term implications of the lower level of refunds and I will continue to press the Commission to have refunds fixed at more realistic levels at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 157 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The importation of pigs from other EU member states is governed by Council Directive 64/432/EEC, as amended, which sets out very strict conditions for such trade, including requirements that the pigs have tested negative for certain diseases and are accompanied by a health certificate issued by an authorised veterinarian in <Col N="1177" /> the member state of dispatch.  The requirements of the EU Single Market preclude me from establishing animal health conditions over and above those set out in this Directive.  For this reason, I am unable to direct that such pigs be held in any particular part of the State following importation or to make compulsory a voluntary code of practice adhered to by the majority of pig producers in the State.  However, checks are being carried out on the consignment in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Trade in Animals and Animal Products) Regulations, 1994.</P>
    <P>The Deputies should be aware that the National Pig Health Council representing the interests of the pig industry has issued a code of practice in relation to the importation of pigs into Ireland.</P>
    <P>The code of practice, a voluntary code, sets out measures to further protect pig herds from the introduction of disease.  I fully encourage the adoption of such codes in relation to all livestock imports and encourage all importers to abide by them.</P>
    <P>In the case in question I have been informed that the importation of the wild boar was accompanied by certain but not all of the additional guarantees recommended by that code.</P>

The relevant EU regulations provide that in the case of production other than cattle, sheep, horses and goats, the compensatory allowance shall be proportional to the area farmed, less that devoted to the feeding of livestock.  In other words the compensatory allowances for deer would be based on the forage area exclusively devoted to deer farming and our proposals have been drafted along these lines.</P>

      <P>Overall the process could take about nine months to complete and it is envisaged that the successful partner will have been identified by the middle of next year.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1183" /> The issues raised by these questions is a day to day matter for the companies involved.</P>
    <P>However, if the Deputy is referring to the Exchequer liability in respect of pre-vesting day pensions, the position is that the Minister for Finance has agreed arrangements to deal with this liability to both the Telecom Éireann and the An Post Superannuation Funds.  This involves the Exchequer reimbursing the funds on an ongoing basis for all outlay in respect of employee service given in the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs pre-1984.  In addition, interest is paid on the liability incurred to the funds to 1994 of approximately £250 million in the case of Telecom Éireann and approximately £200 million in the case of An Post.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that information concerning the companies superannuation schemes is given in note 21 of the Telecom Éireann annual report and accounts for the year ended 30 March 1995, and in note 20 of the annual report and accounts for An Post for the year ended 31 December 1994, copies of which are lodged in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 169 and 171 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current employment levels in Telecom Éireann are seriously out of <Col N="1184" /> line with other national telecommunications operators and are not sustainable in a future competitive environment.</P>
    <P>The question of the level of reduction in job numbers and how and when they will be achieved is a matter for the management of Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>The achievement of sustainable levels of employment and increased productivity and lower tariff levels in Telecom Éireann will undoubtedly have positive employment impacts elsewhere in the economy.  It is becoming clear that an information based economy will thrive.  The rebalancing of telephone charges in 1993 and the introduction of volume discounts contributed to over 2,000 jobs being announced by the IDA in telemarketing and back-office operations. This could be the tip of the iceberg. I cannot be specific as to numbers, but I believe that they will be substantial.</P>
    <P>In the case of An Post, a detailed review of the company was undertaken at my request, by independent consultants, Price Waterhouse.  The report has recently been completed and has been accepted by the board of An Post as a framework for the future of the company.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in the report are being considered in detail by the board and it would be inappropriate to comment on the matter before the board has completed its consideration of the report.</P>

      <P>Aer Rianta has a statutory mandate under the Air Navigation and Transport Act, 1950 to manage Dublin Airport as my agent.  An integral part of the responsibility of the company in carrying out its mandate is to ensure the safe and efficient operation and development of the airport.

    <P>I understand from Aer Rianta that in the present case, Aer Rianta has not appealed to An Bord Pleanála on the grounds that the land in question is required for airport expansion purposes. <Col N="1186" /> The appeal is based on a number of grounds, including the need to control development in the vicinity of the airport to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the airport.</P>

      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 173 and 174 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I did not ask for or receive a report from the Board of Córas Iompair Éireann after it had considered the resolution by the Joint Committee on <Col N="1187" /> Commercial State-sponsored Bodies calling on the board to reinstate immediately it's property sub-committee. I understand that the resolution was conveyed directly to CIE by the Secretary of the Joint Committee. However, I am aware that the matter was addressed in a letter from the CIE group secretary to the Secretary to the Government, following the Government's decision of 17 November 1995 to seek the resignation of board members. I understand that the letter outlined the board's reasons for refusing the joint committee's request and indicated, at its meeting on 15 November 1995, that the board had unanimously confirmed its decision of 6 September 1995 that the reinstatement of the property sub-committee did not seem appropriate or necessary.</P>
    <P>At their meeting on 17 November 1995 the Government decided that they no longer had confidence that the board of Córas Iompair Éireann as a whole could function in an effective manner and resolved to restructure the board. The basis for that decision was set out fully in my replies to Questions Nos. 3 and 33 on 22 November last.</P>

      <P>The Tourism Angling Measure of the Operational Programme for Tourism provides for total investment of almost £19 million in the development of the tourism angling product over five years. I have already announced 34 projects, involving total expenditure of some £4 million, under this measure.</P>
      <P>Indicative investment of almost £4 million in the Border region, including the Cavan/Monaghan area, has been provided for under the Tourism Angling Measure.  The extent to which this indicative investment is realised will depend on the number, eligibility and quality of projects submitted.  While specific projects in the Cavan-Monaghan area have not to date been finalised, I fully expect that there will be investment in that area in future tranches of projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board and the Department of the Marine have responsibility for the administration and implementation of the Tourism Angling Measure.  The Central Fisheries Board is responsible for the day to day administration of the measure with the Department having overall responsibility for its implementation.  All applications for funding under the measure are subject to detailed technical, operational, management and financial assessment by the Central Fisheries Board.  I will ask the Board to advise the Deputy directly about applications on <Col N="1195" /> hand in relation to projects in the Cavan/Monaghan area.</P>
    <P>Scope for significant investment in the Cavan/Monaghan area, and in the Border region generally, also exists under the Fisheries Measures of the INTERREG Programme, 1994 to 1999, under which £2.5 million has been made available, and under the recently announced Programme for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>A number of inland fisheries projects submitted under the INTERREG Programme are undergoing evaluation at present while arrangements for the administration of inland fisheries measures under the Peace and Reconciliation Programme are being discussed at present.</P>

    <P>In addition to the above projects approval has been given for a major £2.3 million protection scheme at Bray, Co. Wicklow.  Work on site will commence in 1996.</P>
    <P>All the works being aided by the Department of the Marine have been identified by the various coastal local authorities as priority works.  As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of the Marine sought details of the local authorities priority proposals in order to identify works to be undertaken under the Coastal Protection Measure of the Environmental Services Operational Programme 1994-99.  A number of these priority projects have been aided this year and that process will continue each year till the end of the Programme in 1999.</P>
    <P>However, I must caution that the total value of the priority works identified by the coastal local authorities exceeds the £5.2 million available under the Programme.  Therefore, it will not be possible to undertake works at all the locations identified.</P>

      <P>A fishery harbour development programme in respect of 1996 is being prepared by my Department at present. The proposals for Adrigole Pier, Beara, County Cork, are being considered in that context.</P>
      <P>I should caution, however, that funding for fishery harbour development under the Fisheries Operational Programme is very limited and that only projects which can demonstrate a significant potential return from the fisheries perspective will be successful.</P>

      <P>I have no plans for setting up any scheme of this nature.</P>
      <P>The protection of private property and the mitigation of damage to it from any source are primarily matters for the landowner.  At present the only moneys available for coast protection works are £5.2 million under the Environmental Services Operational Programme 1994-99. As they are inadequate for dealing with all eligible projects to protect public infrastructure, I am continuing to seek additional funding for this purpose.</P>
