      <P>As Members will appreciate, there are a number of items to put to the House.  Let us try to expedite matters.  Is the proposal that the Dáil shall sit later than 8.30 p.m. tonight and business be interrupted not later than 10.30 p.m. satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Are the proposals that Nos. 6 and 7 shall be decided without debate and that any division demanded on No. 6 shall be taken forthwith satisfactory and agreed?</P>

      <P>Item No. 7 relates to the formal procedure to allow various Estimates discussed in committee during the past week or two to be debated in the House.  As the House is aware from an issue we raised yesterday, all Members of this House and the Seanad&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were possible to pay compensation to hepatitis C victims before Christmas, all Members of the House would approve such an Estimate, but that is not the case.  A tribunal has not been established and State liability for such costs has not been ascertained. Item No. 7 raises the question of whether the £60 million in question may be deferred to the 1996 Estimates.  It is our view that for legal and technical reasons it would be incorrect to do that. I asked the Taoiseach to check the position yesterday.  I am aware the Government has informed journalists and others that such a procedure occurred on three previous occasions, one relating to liability for An Post pensions from 1984.  That claim is incorrect as the pay claims for a number of years were <Col N="1320" /> paid to the individuals concerned in the relevant year.  Regarding the Aer Lingus case raised by the Government with journalists in 1993 the Minister for Transport and Communications, Deputy Cowen, introduced the Air Companies (Amendment) Act, 1993 to provide for money to be included in legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided to establish a tribunal to administer a special scheme to compensate those affected by hepatitis C. It was agreed to create a special fund so that the tribunal will be established and will commence its operations this year. There is nothing hidden about this.  It is perfectly appropriate to establish the fund to underpin the body being established in the same year.  That was made known to the Opposition by the Minister for Health, most recently in committee last week when the Opposition did not raise any objection to this procedure. They supported it and probably wished we had gone further in this regard.  It is strange that the Leader of the Opposition who was a former Minister for Finance should accuse the Government of fraud yesterday when he engaged in the same procedures when he was Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I will refer to the record.  Seventy million pounds of public sector pay arrears scheduled for payment in 1993 were brought forward by the Minister for Finance into 1992. Forty four million pounds of NTMA savings were carried over to reduce Exchequer debt service costs in 1993; in other words money saved in 1992 was carried forward into 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In his rant this morning the Taoiseach said we accused him of fraud yesterday.  The fact is that what the Taoiseach did yesterday, and what he is trying to justify today, was not done before.  In respect of the examples he quoted of An Post liability, Aer Lingus &mdash; which was covered by legislation &mdash; and the various pay issues, the money was paid in the relevant year. What the Taoiseach is doing, and for which the Minister for Finance is guilty, is against the wishes of the Department of Finance.  It is against the rules governing the Comptroller and Auditor General to be involved in deceit on the 1996 expenditure.  The Taoiseach is suppressing the 1996 expenditure and putting money into a tribunal which has not been set up.  It is legally and technically incorrect to do this and it was not done in the past.</P>
      <P>What the Taoiseach said about the National Management Treasury Agency is absolutely incorrect.  In respect of the An Post liability, the Labour Party Ministers were totally in agreement with what was done.  In accordance with section 4 of the Air Companies (Amendment) Act, 1993, on this week two years ago the Department of Finance and the Comptroller and Auditor General stated that money could not be brought forward to 1993 and pushed to 1994 without legislation.  Does the Taoiseach stand over his argument?  If the Taoiseach wants the £60 million carried forward why will he not introduce legislation? Why was I advised and why did the Comptroller and Auditor General force me on that occasion to bring in legislation?</P>

In fact the largest increase in public spending in recent years occurred when the Progressive Democrats Party was in office with Fianna Fáil.  The fact of the matter is that the Deputy's record and that of her party, so far as keeping public expenditure under control, is so deplorable that this is one subject on which the Progressive Democrats should maintain, in its own interest, a decent silence.  So far as the Deputy's question this year is concerned I would like to tell her that the provision is being made this year to establish a tribunal. We are putting aside the money this year to meet the liabilities of the tribunal that is being established this year.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is long known to be an advocate of proper debate in this House.  During this one hour debate on these Supplementary Estimates, by my rough calculations, the expenditure of £111 million will be passed.  That is altogether separate from the £60 million Supplementary Estimate for Health and the various other Supplementary Estimates of last week.</P>

      <P>If we vote for No. 34, we are restricting debate today on £111 million additional expenditure to one hour.  That is not a proper manner in which to conduct our business.  The detailed breakdown of the individual figures under various headings is not known on this side of the House because they could not be published until leave to introduce the Estimates was granted about ten minutes ago.  It is very unfair to the Opposition to have the debate now without knowing the <Col N="1333" /> contents of those Estimates and have them passed when there may be an endeavour to push through another £60 million at the last minute.</P>

Perhaps we can take up the matter in the next session.  We will have only a limited debate on this issue today which we have to accept as better than nothing.  The Taoiseach should give consideration on the resumption of the Dáil for a full day's debate on Northern Ireland as many Members would like to express their views on a range of issues, not just the communiqué.</P>

We have sought a <Col N="1339" /> debate on Northern Ireland since the beginning of October.  There are many issues which could be discussed such as cross-Border co-operation and community matters.  Three or four Members usually contribute on Question Time and other Deputies do not have an opportunity to speak.  Will the Taoiseach allow a full day's debate on the North at the beginning of the next session so that Members who do not have an opportunity to ask questions at Question Time or contribute to the debate on the communiqué will be accommodated?</P>

At least 12 men in small boats involved in fishing activities, whether as fishery officers or fishermen, have died along this stretch of coastline in recent years. There are two Government commissioned reports relating to fisheries in that area: first, the Kirwan report on the Ballycotton disaster not yet published, and second, the salmon review body report.  I ask the Government to publish the Kirwan report in the near future and for a debate in the House on both reports.

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be discussing the Supplementary Estimate for Vote 40 &mdash; Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>A Supplementary Estimate of £19 million is necessary on the Social Welfare Vote for 1995.  This is the extra amount required in the period up to the end of this year to meet additional costs arising in my Department.  The effect of this additional amount will be to increase the published Estimate for my Department to £2,473.9 million.</P>
      <P>The reason for the Supplementary Estimate is essentially to part-fund the cost of this year's Christmas bonus which was paid last week to all long-term social welfare recipients.  The bonus payment this year amounted to 70 per cent of normal weekly payments with a built in minimum payment of £20. Over 1.25 million people have benefited from the payment, that is, 755,000 recipients and their 500,000 dependants.</P>
      <P>The full cost of this year's Christmas bonus is £40 million but only some £36.5 million of that amount is proper to the Social Welfare Vote.  The balance of the bonus costs relates to health allowances and community employment participants and is borne on the Votes of the other Departments concerned. However, not all of the £36.5 million is required in the Supplementary Estimate as projected savings in the Vote for 1995 will amount to £17.5 million.  This has the effect of reducing the requirement for the purposes of the Supplementary Estimate to £19 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will now detail the main areas in which savings and excesses occurred. In summary, savings arose through income from PRSI contributions being higher than expected and through reduced expenditure on pensions as a result of <Col N="1354" /> the number of recipients being lower than expected.  On the other side, an increase of 12,000 in the original live register forecast for 1995 and higher expenditure on our employment support services account for the excesses.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £6.7 million is required to meet the Exchequer's share of the cost of operating the social insurance fund out of which all social insurance benefits and pensions are paid.  This is a net sum which takes account of excesses in some areas being offset by savings in other areas.</P>
    <P>The social insurance fund is the cornerstone of our social welfare system. It operates on a tripartite basis with workers, employers and the State all contributing their share.  It provides necessary protection for over 1 million workers in times of illness, unemployment, survivorship, occupational accidents and when they reach pension age. Since 1988, it has provided security of pensions for 120,000 self-employed people and their survivors.  The Government is committed to the maintenance of the social insurance fund and to its future development in the interests of those who pay into it and those who draw benefits from it.</P>
    <P>The 70 per cent Christmas bonus to social insurance pensioners cost £16.3 million this year and a further £17 million is required to meet the higher cost of unemployment benefit payments as a result of the numbers being higher than originally estimated.  Those excesses have been partially offset by an increase of £15 million in income from PRSI contributions over what had been originally provided for and savings in contributory pensions of £11.6 million as a result of lower numbers of recipients.  This leaves a net additional requirement of £6.7 million to be provided as part of the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <P>The balance of the requirement in the Supplementary Estimate arises from social assistance payments which are funded entirely from the Exchequer. The main elements are additional spending of £10.7 million on unemployment assistance arising from the <Col N="1355" /> Christmas bonus paid to the long-term unemployed and the higher live register forecast which I already mentioned; additional spending of £9.2 million on our employment support services as a result of higher numbers participating on the back-to-work allowance scheme and students' summer jobs scheme; additional spending of £1.5 million on lone parent's allowance arising from the cost of the Christmas bonus for these recipients, which is partially offset by lower numbers than originally anticipated, and additional spending of £3 million on supplementary welfare allowance as a result of increased costs of rent supplements and provision for recoupment of certain administration costs to health boards.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, responsibility for the National Social Services Board was transferred from the Department of Health to my Department with effect from 1 June 1995.  As the funding arrangements were not settled in advance of the original Estimates being finalised, a token provision of £1,000 only was provided in the published Estimates. The funding position has since been regularised and the Supplementary Estimate includes an amount of £970,000 which represents the cost to my Department of funding the NSSB since 1 June 1995.</P>
    <P>An additional sum of £1,050,000 is included under this heading to fund grants of £1 million to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and £50,000 to Protestant Aid.  I am delighted that the Government has found it possible to make these special allocations at this time of the year in order to meet the very heavy demands that are made on the services of both organisations.  I wish them both continued success in their very important work.</P>
    <P>The sum of the additional spending which I have just detailed has been reduced as a result of miscellaneous savings during the year in a number of areas, amounting to £14.9 million and due primarily to lower than expected payments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> As I indicated earlier, the net effect &mdash; after taking account of the excesses and the savings which I have detailed to the House &mdash; is a Supplementary Estimate of £19 million.  This is the amount I am asking the House to approve. I emphasise, however, that even taking account of the Supplementary Estimate, the amount of the revised Estimate for 1995 does not do justice to the overall level of social welfare spending today. Total social welfare spending this year will exceed £4 billion, exclusive of the £200 million being provided to cover the cost of equal treatment payments. Of the £4 billion, the Exchequer will contribute almost £2.3 billion, employees £445 million, employers £1,200 million and the self-employed £85 million through pay-related social insurance.</P>
    <P>We spend almost £11 million on social welfare every day, £77 million for each week of the year.  In doing so, we provide a weekly payment to around 800,000 people which in turn benefits almost 1.5 million people when adult and child dependants are taken into account.  The £11 million a day paid includes £2.9 million in payments to elderly and retired people, £2.9 million a day in payments to unemployed people, £1.2 million a day to the sick and disabled and £3.4 million a day on family income support including widows, widowers, lone parents, carers, child benefit and families at work on low pay and other miscellaneous allowances. There is an additional sum of £0.6 million for administration.  I commend this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is totally unsatisfactory Government procedure to vote through the House an amount of over £110 million &mdash; the sum of the Supplementary Estimates we are discussing today &mdash; in a one hour period.  If the controversial £60 million which was put through last week and various other Estimates which were debated by the committees are added to that, at least £180 million has been voted through as additional expenditure for 1995. That <Col N="1357" /> constitutes about 2 per cent additional spending in 1995 over 1994.</P>
      <P>In the debate last year on the Book of Estimates, I pointed out that the Government would not be able to meet its then self-imposed guideline of a 6 per cent increase from 1994 to 1995, as was evident from a very learned article published by a former Taoiseach, Dr. Garret FitzGerald, who put the matter into perspective.  Comparing like with like, it was obvious at that stage that the Estimates for 1995 would be 10.9 per cent up on 1994.  The Minister stated in the Programme for Government that the Estimates would stay within an 6 per cent increase.  However, the additional Estimates being put through today, and those put through last Thursday, constitute an additional 2 per cent.  According to the Minister's figures, the increase from 1994 to 1995 was not 6 per cent but 8 per cent and, comparing like with like, it is in the order of over 13 per cent.</P>
      <P>In 1995 the rate of inflation was approximately 2.5 per cent. An increase in public spending of 13 per cent is five times the rate of inflation.  Any business run on that basis would eventually go to the wall, irrespective of whatever economic fortunes befell it.  Provision must be made for the day when the wheel turns the other way and when very severe pain will have to be endured.  I pointed out that self-evident economic fact during my first time as spokesperson on finance and I repeat it today. If we are not prepared to learn from the mistakes made by all Governments in the past, we are heading into the abyss from which we once came.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason I feel so annoyed about this type of financial management &mdash; as evident from my contributions during the past two days &mdash; is that I honestly believe that when the necessary financial medicine has to be administered to the people again, they will not accept it. They did so on a previous occasion on the understanding that no Government &mdash; or a succession of Governments &mdash; would ever again be as irresponsible. We will pay a heavy price when EU <Col N="1358" /> funds run out, the economy turns the other way and some Government has to introduce very severe corrective measures which will have an exceptionally deflationary effect on the economy. Not alone will we pay an economic price, as I said many years ago, there will not be a cohesive response from the people as there was in the past because they will say that the chance was frittered away.  That is why I am taking such a strong stand on this issue regarding the public finances.</P>
    <P>My second point relates to the controversial £60 million of fraudulent accounting practice on behalf of the Government.  Last week, during the Supplementary Estimate debate at the Select Committee on Social Affairs, the Minister for Health devoted most of his eight page introductory speech to all the other matters relating to hepatitis C.  In two sentences on page 6 he stated:</P>
    <P>The Supplementary Estimate of £60 million is in relation to the estimated 1996 cost of meeting the compensation awards likely to be made by the tribunal.  It is, of course, accepted that all awards made by the tribunal will be funded from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, or the good civil servant who wrote the speech on his behalf, covered themselves by saying that it is for 1996 expenditure.  It is not in accordance with Irish Government financial procedures to provide moneys on an accruals basis &mdash; it cannot be done.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the point raised by our leader about the article in today's issue of <i>The Irish Times,</i> which I am sure resulted from a briefing by a Government spokesperson.  The comments on the salary issues, which were repeated by the Taoiseach this morning, are incorrect. Those moneys were accounted for and paid on the last pay day in the relevant year.  The liability in respect of An Post arose as a result of the break up of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs under the 1984 Act. Those liabilities had accrued to the extent that the trustees of the post office <Col N="1359" /> workers' pension fund had signalled to various trade union officials and to the Government that they were not prepared to wait any longer and that the Government would have to provide funding, as laid down in legislation.  The previous Government used proceeds from the tax amnesty to increase the fund.  These were known liabilities and the Minister can verify this by examining the Government decisions and regulations of that time.</P>
    <P>The comments on Aer Lingus in this morning's article are also incorrect.  As pointed out by the leader of my Party, in December 1993 the Comptroller and Auditor General insisted that the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, bring before the House the air companies legislation to deal with the matter.  The Minister for Finance would not have been in a position to accrue the sum he wanted to unless it was provided for in legislation. The Minister can verify this by examining the legislation.</P>
    <P>If we travel along the road of hocus-pocus accounting we will diminish our reputation.  It is amazing that politicians often appear bemused by the fact that the public does not have great regard for us.  It is irresponsible actions such as this that give us bad publicity.  As the Government was caught with its hand in the till in respect of £60 million, it should own up and plead insanity rather than try to defend the indefensible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The House reached a low point in public and political rhetoric today when the Taoiseach attempted to say that in providing the £60 million out of this year's Estimates in respect of next year's payments he was doing a favour for the women infected with hepatitis C.  The Taoiseach also stated that he was lending credibility to the tribunal by allocating £60 million now.  That is a shabby piece of deceptive rhetoric and marks a low point for the Government, particularly for the Taoiseach who to my knowledge has never before spun such an obvious fantasy to the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1360" /> As yet there is no accrued liability to the women infected with hepatitis C. Not one of them can go to Government Buildings and say she is owed money. The only way compensation can be measured is through a tribunal or a court.  Therefore, it is wrong to suggest there is accrued liability to these women, although there will be such in the future. It was wrong, therefore, to set aside £60 million out of this year's Exchequer funding for next year's liabilities.</P>
    <P>If we set up special accounts, provide money in one year to meet the following year's liabilities and go down the slippery slope of attacking the public financial arrangements, we will never stop. There is no £60 million or special account.  The £60 million exists only on a piece of paper in an official's drawer in the Department of Finance.  As Deputy Harney stated this morning, we must borrow approximately £1 billion for State expenditure this year.  There is not a surplus of £60 million in a shoe box which is being paid into an account for this purpose.  The State's overdraft is being divided into two funds and it has been stated that a payment is being made from one of those funds into the other and that this is an expenditure in this year.  Nothing could be further from the truth. It is a brazen political lie to suggest that a single penny is being provided for the women concerned in 1995.</P>
    <P>It is also a grave discourtesy to the members of the tribunal to suggest that they need the credibility of this political stunt to enhance their status.  It is an insult to Mr. Justice Egan, a retired Supreme Court judge, and the other persons who will compose the tribunal to say their credibility will be enhanced by such a blatant political trick.  There is no question of the tribunal even considering its first case in 1995.  I do not believe application forms are even available. If a person cannot make an application in 1995 it follows that a payment cannot be made in 1995.  It is a low point in political life when a Taoiseach states he is doing this to lend credibility to a <Col N="1361" /> group of people he has asked to administer the tribunal.  That is not the case. He is trying to shore up his credibility which has been blown apart on this issue.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Social Welfare stated that the social insurance fund was the cornerstone of our social welfare system.  Social insurance expenditure is on a pay as you go basis, there is no fund.  It is an accounting figment in the minds of those in the Departments of Social Welfare and Finance.  The Minister stated that he wants to continue the social insurance fund which is funded in part by PRSI contributions from employees, the self-employed and employers.  That hypothecated taxation should not be differentiated from other forms of taxation.  The social insurance fund is funded by direct or indirect taxation. I do not make a distinction between PRSI, PAYE or levy contributions. They are all wage deductions and have the same function.  It does not make a whit of difference to employees whether their income tax is increased by 1 per cent and their PRSI is decreased by 1 per cent or <i>vice versa.</i> It does not make any difference to what such people are entitled to or to what they will receive at the end of each week or month.  A legitimate distinction cannot be made between PRSI and taxation.</P>
    <P>In recent days we have been told that the Government received a report to the effect that every unemployed person costs the State more than £10,000 per annum directly and that £2.3 billion is being poured into keeping the unemployed in welfare payments.  This is Ireland's system of human set aside.  We are putting a vast amount of money into this area and creating a liability in that these people do not participate in the economic life of the State.  That is unjust.</P>
    <P>With these Supplementary Estimates, depending on which definition one chooses and the sleight of hand one excuses, as happened on the last occasion when the Minister for Finance presented his budget, the real increase in current spending this year is at least <Col N="1362" /> 10 per cent, and possibly, up to 13 per cent.  Those are the facts although the Government stated it would confine such increases to 6 per cent.  I agree with Deputy McCreevy that the political credibility of our entire parliamentary system is now in question if the public can see that firm commitments can be avoided by accounting and economic trickery and political chicanery.</P>
    <P>Public spending must be brought under control.  One of the biggest elements is public sector pay.  I have never met a public servant who wants more and more by way of gross increases in his pay.  I have often met public servants who want their gross pay to be kept at its present value, but want more and more by way of take-home pay.  If we are to go down the road of negotiating a new understanding to control public service pay, we must concentrate on take-home pay.  Tax reform must be a central element of any new initiative.</P>
    <P>There is something radically wrong in a country where 57 per cent of the extra earnings of a single person earning well below the average industrial wage is confiscated by the State; where employers cannot get employees to take up jobs because of the disincentive effect of high taxation, high employment taxes and the difficulties experienced in giving up welfare entitlements; where a married man with four children earning £9,000 per annum, living in a local authority house, paying differential rent and in receipt of family income supplement, taking the cost of getting to work into account, would be worse off if his salary was increased to £14,000 per annum.  If there is something radically wrong with our approach to unemployment and taxation, something radical must be done to put it right.</P>
    <P>The last budget was not radical, it changed the values of bands and allowances by approximately 3 per cent in real terms.  All the indications are that next year's budget will be another exercise in fudging and funking the real issues confronting society and that the Government has given up on the fight <Col N="1363" /> against unemployment and intends to do nothing more than spend the remaining months of its period in office freewheeling and preparing for the next election, looking after its separate constituencies, but failing to confront the fundamental problems facing society and the economy.</P>
    <P>I regard the Supplementary Estimate presented by the Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; and the debate &mdash; as examples of precisely what is wrong with this country.  Items are put before us with virtually no examination.  Under the Constitution this House is supposed to examine the Estimates for expenditures and receipts at the earliest possible point in each financial year.  We find ourselves at the 59th minute of the eleventh hour of this financial year in terms of parliamentary time considering Supplementary Estimates presented solely for the purpose of concealing from the public that the projected increase of 6 per cent in public spending to which the Government claimed it was committed last January may be breached without anyone noticing it.</P>
    <P>If there is any accountability in economic life, today's shabby exercise by the Taoiseach, in hiding behind the fate of the women who have contracted hepatitis C in order to justify sleight of hand, in which Supplementary Estimates are being railroaded through the House without any adequate examination and the complacent speech of the Minister for Social Welfare about the expenditure his Department is undertaking without any commitment to find radical solutions to the unemployment problem and to taxation reform bodes ill for the next year which I hope will be the last in the life of the Government.</P>

      <P>In placing this token Supplementary Estimate before the House I am seeking to use the Marine Vote as a vehicle to consolidate the progress made in recent years in the development of the shellfish sector of the aquaculture industry.  In addition, I am seeking to position the <Col N="1364" /> Salmon Research Agency so that it can provide the maximum support in future to the improvement and development of salmon and sea trout fisheries.</P>
      <P>The first component of the Supplementary Estimate seeks to allocate £400,000 to the shellfish aquaculture sector.  The shellfish industry is a young industry with enormous potential.  The total amount of shellfish farmed has tripled since 1980.  Most of this has been due to the development of the Pacific oyster and rope mussel farms, which together currently employ 1,574 on a full and part-time basis.  Over half of existing farms were set up since 1987 and the pace of start-ups has accelerated in recent years.  I want to maintain and build on that progress.</P>
      <P>I am seeking to allocate £300,000 to oyster cultivation because a substantial number of oyster farmers engaged in the cultivation of Pacific osyters experienced unprecedented levels of mortalities in 1995 seed inputs, because of the unusually hot summer weather and high seawater temperatures.  Aid will allow affected growers to restock farms and help to restore production potential, thereby protecting jobs on the farms affected.</P>
      <P>Losses experienced by growers because of the abnormal seed mortality levels, excluding husbandry and labour costs incurred during pre-mortality growth, are estimated at £750,000.  Loss of sales at today's market prices for the 1997-98 market seasons, if seed is not replaced, is estimated at £5 million.  As continuity of supply is the key to developing and maintaining markets for oyster growers, non-replacement of seed inputs immediately would result in a catastrophic disruption in market supply in future years.</P>
      <P>The effects of exposure of oyster seed to warm weather conditions can be mitigated and preventive measures and refinements in methods of culture are being researched by my Department's Fisheries Research Centre and the industry to prevent a recurrence in future years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1365" /> The industry will have to bear a share of the losses as part of the normal commercial risk associated with farming-husbandry operations.  State assistance up to a maximum of 50 per cent of the cost of replacement seed is proposed under the emergency aid scheme.</P>
    <P>A further £100,000 is sought to implement key elements of the report of the Task Force on Biotoxin Contamination and Monitoring.  Following discussions with the Irish Aquaculture Association this group was established by my predecessor in March 1995 to assist in the search for remedies to the unprecedented toxicity problems arising from contamination of rope-grown mussels commonly known as red tide. The contamination resulted in prolonged closures of farms and restricted harvesting arrangements with consequent adverse economic impacts on growers and markets alike, particularly for the rope mussel industry in the south-west region.</P>
    <P>A key recommendation of the task force is a proposal for the introduction of an emergency aid scheme for the industry to restore industry confidence and protect employment.  However, financial assistance is only one element of a range of measures designed to combat the biotoxicity problem.  In addition, the report has recommended the introduction and implementation of a new marine biotoxin action plan. Key components of the plan include: an enhanced national monitoring programme for biotoxins covering all the main shellfish growing areas in Ireland; harmonisation of biological testing methods at EU level and strengthening of early warning systems in order to minimise disruption caused by harvesting restrictions and closures.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the implementation of the initiatives funded by this Supplementary Estimate will help to restore industry confidence, maintain consumer and market confidence in the high health status of Irish shellfish and assist in maximising the production and employment capacity of this important native industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1366" /> The Salmon Research Agency of Ireland is a national agency under my Department for research in relation to salmon and sea trout.  It conducts and assists in conducting scientific and field research for the purpose of improving, developing and extending salmon and sea trout fisheries in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The agency has in the past funded its research from commercial activities, in particular the sale of salmon smolts. However, the combined effect of a collapse in smolt prices and the wiping out by disease of the agency's commercial stock in 1992 left the agency with losses and greatly depleted reserves.</P>
    <P>With the help of increased Exchequer funding, sponsorship from the ESB, EU funding, contract research and the sale of salmon ova, the agency has fully recovered from the effects of these losses. However, the agency is constrained by a lack of capital for necessary reinvestment and the £66,000 additional funding proposed will assist in these efforts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The sole purpose of Supplementary Estimates is to provide for essential and unforeseen expenditure that has arisen during the course of the year and requires retrospective sanction by the Dáil.  Six of the Supplementary Estimates before us involving relatively minor amounts totalling £3.6 million fall into this category.  It is totally out of order, illegal and improper to propose a Supplementary Estimate for moneys not required in the current year.  I draw attention to the standard title at the top of every Supplementary Estimate in question, the amount required in the year ending 31 December, 1995 for the salaries and expenses of the office of the Minister for Health and certain services administered by that Minister and by that office. The £60 million Supplementary Estimate is not required this year as no additional liabilities will be completely processed or determined by the tribunal before next year.  It is dishonest and an attempt to deceive the Dáil to say that the moneys are required in 1995, the <Col N="1367" /> basis on which Supplementary Estimates are passed in the House.  It is deeply ironic that the parties that were supposed to be the champions of openness, transparency and accountability should attempt this subterfuge in order to make their 1996 spending overruns look better.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Health, the Minister for Finance and the Government have been caught red-handed cooking the books, pretending that they are more or less achieving their financial target of an average 2 per cent annual increase in current supply services expenditure. The underlying increase is likely to be in the order of 3 per cent when this additional £60 million is taken into account.  The figures for this year, which are way over target, will be made worse by this decision.  The Government was warned about this by a former Taoiseach, Garret FitzGerald, in an article written in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 25 March this year.  He said the best thing the Government could do now would be to very quickly alter this uncharacteristic piece of creative accounting which is much reminiscent of some of Fianna Fáil's budgetary manoeuvres in the early 1980s.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been alleged there are precedents for what happened in this House today, but I reject that.  The explicit legislative sanction of this House was obtained in the Air Companies (Amendment) Act, 1993, to provide an equity input into Aer Lingus immediately EU sanction was received. It could not be paid at the time as there was no EU sanction for it.  On checking the position with the Department of Finance and the law officers of this State we were advised that the provision would have to be included in the Act. Section 4 of that Act provides that in addition to the shares held, funds were to be held as appropriate by the Minister for Finance in the holding company, and by virtue of section 3 the Minister for Finance may subscribe for further shares to an amount not exceeding £175 million.  This Government has not <Col N="1368" /> attempted to deal with this issue in the same manner, the legally proper way to proceed and one which would not have created difficulty.</P>
    <P>We tried to point out this error to the Taoiseach yesterdy but he decided to row in with the camouflage and claimed things are perfect.  If we had tried to provide for a similar arrangement in air transport without special legislation the Government apologists would have had a valid point.  In other cases moneys were paid out in the year in question in respect of exact liabilities already established. That has always been the case.</P>
    <P>The Government has breached its targets for the second year running by a wide margin and is anxious to conceal that fact from the public and the financial markets, a fundamental difference from what happened in previous years. Disregard and abuse of proper financial procedures should not be allowed proceed without correction.  I have written to the Comptroller and Auditor General about this matter.  I appeal to the Government to withdraw the £60 million Supplementary Estimate which is totally unjustified and an unnecessary sleight of hand.</P>
    <P>The Government has been shown to be incapable of sticking to financial targets which it set.  The strength of the Fianna Fáil Government during its eight years in office is that it managed to stay within its financial targets in every year. That example is no longer being followed. Nobody will be impressed by the bluster of the Taoiseach and the Govenment about its caring attitude to hepatitis C victims.  The victims are far from satisfied with the <i>ad hoc</i> measures proposed by the Government and debated by my colleague Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn. This Supplementary Estimate will not ensure that one victim will be paid a day earlier than has been provided in the 1996 Estimates.  If the Government were seriously concerned about the matter the normal practice would have been to introduce a token estimate of £10 or £1 million if it considered payments would have to be made.  I call on the Minister for Health <Col N="1369" /> to withdraw this Estimate in the interests of good government and honest and straightforward dealing in respect of national finances.  If he does not the Government will be judged and will pay the price for its actions.</P>

      <P>Total gross expenditure in 1995 for the education group of Votes is projected to be on target or to show a small saving.  The Supplementary Estimates for which I am seeking approval are required mainly to offset the effective delays in receiving payments from the European Social Fund due to my Department as appropriations-in-aid in 1995.  They are also needed to increase the payments to the local authorities in respect of higher education grants as well as to provide extra amounts for other subheads which show excesses over provision in 1995.</P>
      <P>Vote 28 relates to second level and further education and subhead G relates to payments to local authorities in respect of superannuation charges payable in respect of former staff of vocational education committees.  An increase of £2.8 million is sought to provide for increased numbers of persons retiring from the vocational education committees.  Subhead L relates to second level schools, building grants and capital costs.  An increase of £3.8 million is sought to meet extra costs incurred in this sector to meet increased accommodation needs.  Vote 29 relates to third level and further education.  In relation to payments to local authorities in respect of higher education grants under subhead A1, I am seeking an additional £13.8 million to meet the cost of grants paid by local authorities in 1995.  Subhead A5 relates to grants and supports to trainees and European Social Fund aided programmes.  An increase of £3.7 million is sought to cater for increased numbers.  Subhead J relates to grants for the National College of Industrial Relations.  An additional £0.3 million is sought to cater for increased participation in the college's programmes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> The Supplementary Estimates also have regard to certain savings in specific subheads in the two Votes concerned and have been configured to reflect these savings.  The supplementary amounts for which I am seeking approval are for £13.6 million under Vote 28 relating to second level and further education and £31.8 million under Vote 29 relating to third level and further education.</P>
    <P>Most of the amounts sought are attributable to the delays in receipt of European Social Fund money. That will be received in January 1996 at the latest. Delays of this nature occur almost every year and accounting procedures for Government Departments require that Supplementary Estimates be taken in these circumstances to enable a Department meet its commitments in the current year.</P>
    <P>Educational measures aided by the ESF are designed to develop the capacity of Ireland's education system to contribute more effectively to social and economic well-being.  The key contribution of education to economic and social prosperity is fully recognised by the European Union and the Union has invested very substantially in Irish education, recognising it as the crucial factor in promoting Ireland's development.</P>
    <P>ESF funding contributes to the improvement of the quality of education and training.  This involves, for instance, the provision of resources for the most comprehensive programme ever undertaken in in-careeer development for teachers at all levels of education and for the development of comprehensive national certification for vocational education and training.  The recent establishment of Teastas represents a major landmark in this regard.</P>
    <P>The Structural Fund programme underpins the value of education and training to the creation of social cohesion and economic prosperity.  The range of measures supported is clear recognition that the acquisition of skills among people is at least as important a <Col N="1371" /> source of social and economic transformation as more traditional forms of capital accumulation.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to make up for the moneys expended in the year for which there is no money available this year.  Today we have an extraordinary situation which is totally unsatisfactory. Apparently the Minister for Finance will not come to the House to explain the overall Supplementary Estimate. Three or four Ministers will give an outline of their Estimates and reveal what is behind the figures.  That is the important part.  They will tell us where things went wrong and where adjustments are needed in the expenditure this year, as the Minister for Education has just done.  That applies to only four out of 20 Votes.</P>
      <P>A great deal of the surplus expenditure during the year will not be revealed here in detail.  In this debate we got a listing in respect of the 20 Votes which amounts to over £200 million.  We have only five minutes in which to debate expenditure of £200 million; one minute in which to debate expenditure of £40 million, without hearing the contributions of Ministers who are presenting the extra demands.  That is totally unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>The Government will have to get back on track or we will be in serious trouble.  I remind the House that Fianna Fáil returned to office in 1987. During the years 1988, 1989 and 1990 the Estimates were presented in October and November and it was possible to see and discuss them in detail.  We must get back to that system, whereby we can see in advance the Estimates for the following year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has attempted to avoid discussion on the forthcoming Estimates by publishing them next Monday when the Dáil is going into recess on Friday.  That may now be changed and we may be able to get a brief, hurried look at them and to <Col N="1372" /> debate them next Tuesday.  This is most unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>Today there was more deception.  The Taoiseach was seen here trying to bluster and cover up what is clearly a deception in accounting terms and to delude himself into believing that he was open and accountable, which he was not.</P>
    <P>The Government began the year with an unprecedented, massive surplus, with a great opportunity to improve the position of those who depended on social welfare, those suffering from disabilities and other groups in society who need assistance and support.  Not only did the Government not give that support, we had the lowest social welfare increases in 30 years at 2.5 per cent across the board, but at the end of the year we have to provide extra moneys to cover the mismanagement by the Government under 20 Votes during the year.  At the beginning of the year, the Government decided to raid the social insurance fund to the tune of £60 million, a net £50 million, for other purposes.  This was the sleight of hand.  Instead of addressing the issues and providing the funds directly and openly, the moneys in the social insurance fund were taken out.  It was made clear in the House that that was happening.  Having succeeded in bringing the social insurance fund into a surplus for the first time since it was introduced, the Minister for Social Welfare informed us it is in the red at the end of the year by £6.7 million.  That does not augur well for the worker, the employer and those who contribute to the fund because it was raided this year and has been left in a weakened position. The Minister for Social Welfare informs us that the social insurance fund is the cornerstone of our social welfare system.  It is the cornerstone of our social insurance system, which is a major part of our welfare system and we are undermining it.</P>
    <P>It is clear from this Supplementary Estimate that the Government has failed in that 12,000 extra people per week have become unemployed.  That is the reason other Ministers should put their figures before the House so that <Col N="1373" /> they can be seen and judged here.  The Government commenced with a surplus and decided to take moneys from the social insurance fund.  Under pressure from the Democratic Left Party the Government adjusted the books in other ways.  We have had much discussion on the issue this morning.  At the end of the day, the bottom line is that the Government is cooking the books in relation to next year.</P>
    <P>Confidence in the Government's ability to handle the State's finances is being eroded.  The glue is coming unstuck and the tail is begining to wag not one but two dogs.  The growth and the prospects are good but the drift has already begun.  The Government must get back in line for the forthcoming budget but I wonder whether it has the ability to do that.</P>

Bíonn iomaíocht ghéar ann go hidirnáisiúnta don infheistíocht seo agus is cúis sásaimh a fheabhas a d'eirigh leis an Údarás i 1995 san obair seo.</P>
    <P>Maidir le deontas tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht is cosúil go mbeidh ardú beag ar líon na n-iarratas i mbliana.  Chomh maith leis sin tá níos mó cásanna scrúdaithe ag foireann cigireachta mo Roinne agus réidh le n-íoc, rud a fhágann go mbeidh £240,000 sa bhreis ar an Mheastachán ag teastáil chun na híocaíochtaí sin a dhéanamh roimh deireadh na bliana.  Ba é £1,499,928 an caiteachas tithíochta i 1994 agus, leis an Meastachán Forlíontach seo, beidh figiúir comparáideach £1,500,000 i gceist i 1995.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Scéim Labhairt na Gaeilge, ba é £349,060 an caiteachas a bhí i gceist i 1994. I mbliana d'eirigh le foireann <Col N="1376" /> stiúrthóireachta mo Roinne níos mó iarratais a scrudú ná mar a measadh agus ní leor an £340,000 a cuireadh ar fáil don Scéim sna Meastacháin agus tús na bliana.  Meastar anois go mbeidh £30,000 sa bhreis air sin ag teastáil chun na híocaíochtaí ar láimh a dhéanamh roimh dheireadh na bliana &mdash; caiteachas iomlán de £370,000 i 1995.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In page 5, lines 26 to 31, to delete <Col N="1378" /> all words from and including &ldquo;a quantity&rdquo; in line 26 down to and including line 31 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;gas at an annual rate that is not less than the rate of 25 million standard cubic metres per annum to a single meter installation for consumption by a single customer, the Board may make such an offer to that person, including an offer to transmit gas at a rate that is greater or less than the rate to which the request relates (but not less than the annual rate aforesaid).&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage I indicated that I was considering bringing forward an amendment on Report Stage to insert a threshold of 25 million cubic metres of gas per annum on a single site for the granting of third party access, TPA. That is the purpose of the amendment. The matter of appropriate thresholds is too important to be left to secondary legislation and should be incorporated in primary legislation, in this Bill.  The threshold I am proposing is the one in the draft EU directive concerning common rules for the internal market in natural gas.  This threshold would potentially open up 75 per cent of BG's annual gas deliveries to third party access.  This represents a very significant step.</P>
    <P>My first priority in regard to the development of the gas industry must be to ensure that BG remains a vibrant and viable State body which is in a position to continue to provide a first class supply to its customers.  It must be remembered that BG built up the gas industry and that while it is very successful the industry is still immature in comparison with most other continental gas industries. BG has invested heavily in the development of the industry.  For example, the 1994 annual report shows that the net book value of its investment in pipeline systems on 31 December 1994 was £386 million.  BG must be given a chance to reduce its debt from its current level of £208 million to a manageable level when it has to import all its gas requirements from the UK on <Col N="1379" /> the depletion of the Kinsale-Ballycotton field which is expected at the end of the decade.  In all the circumstances, the threshold I am proposing is the most reasonable and I cannot, therefore, accept amendments Nos. 2 or 4.</P>

For the benefit of Deputy Treacy &mdash; and I appreciate his genuine interest &mdash; 25 million standard cubic metres is a more accurate measurement of the gas coming through a pipeline. The number of therms will vary with the quality of the gas whereas cubic metres is a more accurate measurement, but 25 million standard cubic metres is approximately nine million therms.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 5 proposes that all TPA will be the responsibility of the national energy regulator. As Deputies are aware, the Government is committed to the establishment of an independent energy regulator. The issue of regulation of utilities is currently being examined in my Department. I am sure Deputies realise just how complex this whole matter is. There has been a veritable avalanche of literature on the subject in the past two to three years alone, and the holding of conferences on the topic has almost become an industry in itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me highlight just some of the <Col N="1382" /> major issues to be addressed in that context: should the regulator be an energy or utilities regulator?  What is to be the method for appointment and funding of the regulator?  Should the regulator be a commission of more than one person? There is also the issue of appeals, not to mention the matter of the appropriate method of controlling prices.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a regulator will represent a watershed in the development of the sectors concerned.  It is imperative, therefore, to get it right.  My Department is currently examining the whole area of regulation and legislation will be brought before the House to establish a regulator.  Against that background, I could have decided that all matters relating to TPA should be handled by a regulator and waited for the introduction of the legislation establishing that office.  However, that would have entailed delaying the introduction of TPA.  Judging by the comments of Deputies on TPA, they would not want me to wait, nor do I want to wait.  The time is now ripe to take this significant step in the development of the gas industry.  I deem it best to proceed as proposed in the Bill.  The Bill provides that, in the event of a dispute between BGE and the applicant for TPA as to the terms or conditions, the matter may be referred to the Minister.  The Minister, or his nominee, would then determine the dispute.  When a regulator is appointed over the energy sector, the entire issue of regulation of the sector will be handled by the regulatory authority.</P>
    <P>The issue of appeals from the decisions of the regulator would more appropriately be considered in the legislation establishing that office.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 5.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a compilation of various amendments proposed to ensure absolute legal protection for decisions taken.</P>
      <P>The provisions of section 25 will enable the State to make an investment of £30 million in Bord Na Móna, which I welcome.  I hope the Minister of State will clarify whether the European Union has agreed to that investment and, if not, give the reasons therefor and when it is likely such approval will be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past, when the private sector <Col N="1385" /> proposed to engage in certain energy production here, Bord Na Móna often objected whereas now there is an objection on the part of the private sector to an investment in Bord Na Móna.  In addition, an international company proposes to invest in an energy project in County Mayo, the county of birth of the Minister of State present and the constituency of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Jim Higgins.  I understand that Bord Na Móna, with officials of the Departments of Transport, Energy and Communications and Finance, are holding up a ministerial decision to approve funds already sanctioned by a semi-State body which will lead to the creation of jobs in an area which is barren, comprised of vast boglands, with little or no opportunity of creating alternative employment. We cannot allow circumstances to prevail in which the State and its resources are used to protect a semi-State organisation while, on the other hand, that same organisation, aided and abetted by public service officials, would deprive international investment in the private sector.  We need competition and a level playing field.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and hope the Minister will ensure that that project is not held up any longer.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I reiterate the point made by our party spokesperson on Committee Stage, the bottom line is that we are still a long way from having a national coherent energy policy and the Bill does little to remedy that deficiency.  Much of the energy industry remains Government-owned.  Therefore, it is fair to say that our problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> energy policy stem from our more general problem of managing the overall State sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Five years ago the Culliton Review Group stressed the importance of having a coherent national energy policy within our overall industrial development programme.  To date I am not sure much heed has been paid to what Culliton said about competition, yet it is essential to ensure that private and <Col N="1386" /> industrial consumers obtain their supplies at the most competitive price.  Ultimately, the State will have to clearly specify its role in the energy sector whereas at present it endeavours to fulfil the somewhat contradictory roles of owner and regulator of industries in the energy sector, which is not sustainable in the long-term.  The Government must promote competition within the energy market; that is difficult to achieve while it remains a controlling shareholder in the monopolies in the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I never cease to be surprised that, as soon as former officeholders are out of office, they contend that everything they did not do when in office has become very urgent and immediate.  I apply that criticism to Deputy Molloy who served in that portfolio for a long time and did very little about these issues.  In fairness to Deputy Treacy, he had begun that process within the term of office of the last Government and made considerable progress.</P>
      <P>I thank Members for their constructive approach to this Bill, which has been in gestation in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications for some years.  Deputy Molloy had put together bits and pieces of it, on which more work was done by Deputy Noel Treacy.  I thank them for their efforts in its preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reiterate the importance of the energy sector to our economy overall since State investment in our energy infrastructure amounts to some £5 billion and energy imports represent approximately 3 per cent of GNP, the final energy demand bill, at approximately £2.5 billion, representing 10 per cent of our gross national product.  The <Col N="1387" /> energy sector is a very dynamic one where the forces of change are very strong.  Major developments include restructuring the ESB, a new peat-fired power station and the completion of the Ireland-United Kingdom natural gas interconnector.  We must also acknowledge that European Union proposals for the electricity and gas sectors influence the shape and structure of the overall energy scene.</P>
    <P>In reply to the question raised by Deputy Treacy, the European Union Commission has two months within which to take a decision on State aid for Bord Na Móna and we shall ensure that the £30 million will be made available to it.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste, the Minister for Social Welfare and I had a very constructive meeting on Thursday last with an Alliance Party delegation headed by Dr. John Alderdice.</P>
      <P>We discussed all aspects of the current situation in Northern Ireland and agreed to continue to maintain close contact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1388" /> The Government in particular welcomed the support of that party for the twin track approach to substantive all-party talks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree with the view expressed by Dr. John Alderdice after his meeting with the Government that all-party talks will only take place before the British general election, if there is an election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe that is necessarily the case.  I have no information as to the date of the British general election and would not wish to comment on it.  The position is that, in agreement with the British Government, we are providing for a firm aim of commencing all-party talks at the end of February, and we have provided in the twin track approach a way of overcoming some of the roadblocks to starting those talks at the time specified with the participation of all the relevant parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach believe that the commencement of those talks is dependent on the findings of the international commission on arms decommissioning, and is it dependent on parties accepting the commission's findings?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously the findings of the international body will be extremely important.  It is well known that different views about the timing of decommissioning of arms are at the heart of the difficulties in getting all the parties around the table at the same time.  Clearly the report of the body will be very helpful in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach discuss with Dr. Alderdice the widespread concern about the hard-line statements of the British Government and the Secretary of State in particular, in effect belittling and marginalising the work of the international commission by continually insisting that it has no role in finding a compromise?  Will he agree that such statements, of which there was <Col N="1389" /> another yesterday by the Secretary of State, are a discourtesy to Senator George Mitchell and to President Clinton?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Taoiseach did not discuss that matter, I have no doubt that he discussed the matter of North-South co-operation and North-South institutions with Dr. Alderdice.  Dr. Alderdice has continually stated at the forum that he has no particular difficulty with North-South institutions and all his statements on that matter are very constructive.  Is the Taoiseach aware that a Northern Minister, Baroness Denton, clashed with the Tánaiste at a conference this morning where she challenged the whole notion of North-South institutions, in direct contravention of the Framework Document? Will the Taoiseach be taking the opportunity, either at his meeting with Mr. Major next week or with the Secretariat, to bring up the matter of such an attitude by a British Minister?</P>

      <P>It is bad enough that questions are ruled out of order when they are tabled, but when they can be asked the Taoiseach will not answer them.  Will the Taoiseach give me the views of Dr. Alderdice on North-South institutions and the Framework Document which, I have no doubt, was discussed at the meeting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not for me to go into any detail on the position of the <Col N="1390" /> Alliance Party on the Framework Document. We did not concentrate in particular on the Framework Document at this meeting.  We had meetings with the Alliance Party closer to the time of the publication of the Framework Document at which that document was discussed in greater detail.  I am very anxious to ensure that there is a strong North-South strand in any settlement of this long-standing problem in Northern Ireland.  We recognise strongly that the North-South dimension provides part of the necessary reassurance to Nationalist-minded people in Northern Ireland that their allegiance, their sense of uniqueness, their sense of values are institutionally recognised.  The North-South dimension is extremely important in that regard.  To balance that, it must also be said that the east-west dimension is important from the perspective of the Unionist community.  What we are seeking is an arrangement that respects the allegiances, loyalties and values of both communities.  It is very important in the context of all public statements that may be made that that should be understood.  That underpinned the thinking behind the Framework Document.  It underpins the approach of the Irish Government to North-South co-operation.  We regard it as important in itself.  We also regard it as important in the institutionalisation it gives to respect for the values, loyalties and allegiances of the Nationalist community. It has two dimensions, and it is important that those two dimensions should be understood by all who comment on the topic.  This is not exclusive. It does not preclude or in any way take from the institutional recognition that is also owing to the Unionist community in terms of their allegiances which must also be accommodated and valued.</P>

      <P>In his discussions with Dr. Alderdice and his party, did the Taoiseach cover the area of Dr. Alderdice's views and the fact that he is able to continue to work adequately at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation <Col N="1391" /> without difficulty prior to decommissioning whereas the Unionist parties continually say they could be intimidated were they ever to take up their seat at the forum as long as there has been no decommissioning of weapons? Dr. Alderdice has put his view forward consistently and positively on a number of occasions.  Did the Taoiseach flesh that out with Dr. Alderdice and, if so, does anything arise from it that he could usefully say to Mr. Trimble and his colleagues about their participation in the forum during 1996?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Dr. Alderdice and the Alliance Party were very strong in their affirmation of the value of the forum and the way it afforded them an opportunity to talk to parties with whom they would not previously have had the same level of day to day contact.  Interestingly, they expressed regret at the low level of coverage of the activities of the forum in the media in Northern Ireland and felt that the importance of some of the positions that were being taken at the forum by all parties was undervalued and underestimated in Northern Ireland because of lack of coverage of what was happening at the forum.  They made that point strongly.  As far as the Unionist Party is concerned, as the House will recall I made strenuous efforts when in Opposition in support of the Government to try to get the Unionists to take part.  Apart from supporting the Government in the House I made personal approaches to all the Unionist parties urging them to take part in the forum.  I regret they did not do so then and I continue to regret that they are not doing so at this juncture.  They would not lose anything in terms of their constitutional rights from having the confidence to take part in the forum. However, I respect their decision.  The Unionist Party is an autonomous political party and while we can offer advice as to what is in its and its constituents' best interests we must respect its decision.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that many of the reasons given by the Unionist parties for refusing or being unable to participate in the forum 14 months ago have been removed?  The main obstacle was that the ceasefire was in operation for only a few weeks.  Now that these obstacles have been removed does the Taoiseach agree we should call on them as members of the forum to reconsider their position in 1996 and participate in constructive dialogue, mainly with people from Northern Ireland?  At the last eight meetings our discussions were with members of the communities represented by the Unionists and SDLP.  We have moved away from the phase we were in between October 1994 and March 1995.  Does he agree they should reconsider their position?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Ahern when he states things have changed since the announcement of the forum.  We should ask the Unionist parties to have the confidence to take part <Col N="1393" /> in it.  They have a case to make and should do so wherever they get an audience. They will have an audience at the forum, not necessarily one that will agree with what they say but a respectful one.  The Unionists should take part in the forum in whatever way they think appropriate &mdash; as full members or in any other way.  The circumstances have changed and the forum is making a serious effort to understand the problems of the community represented by the Unionist parties.</P>
      <P>The forum is not in the conventional sense a negotiating body and does not prejudice people's positions when making their views known before it.  They are not asked to negotiate their positions but to discuss them.  Any justifiable self-respecting political philosophy should not fear having its case made in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach and my party leader are correct when they say the position has changed.  The British Government now sends representatives to the forum.  The British Ambassador attends, as do members of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body who were at first reluctant to do so.  It is incumbent on us all, particularly the British Government, to urge Unionists to attend.</P>
      <P>Some time ago Dr. Alderdice gave an interview on RTE radio in response to unhelpful comments which had been made by the leader of the Unionist Party, Mr. Trimble, regarding the contact made by the Taoiseach with Mr. Trimble.  Does the Taoiseach agree with the view expressed by Dr. Alderdice in that interview that Mr. Trimble and his party were going back on progress made a number of years ago when they came to Dublin and discussed various issues which they are now reluctant to discuss with the Irish Government?</P>

      <P>It is not necessarily the best way to achieve the result we wish for.  It is not our function to lecture any other party.  Naturally I wish to see the Unionists take a more forthcoming approach to finding a settlement in Northern Ireland.  Those whom the Unionists represent will benefit from any settlement.  They will gain as much, if not more, as representatives of the Nationalist community and should be more forthcoming in reaching out to and meeting representatives of that community.  We must recognise that lecturing them on what they should do is almost as counterproductive as their lecturing us on what we should do.  Frequently such behaviour has the opposite effect to the one intended.  That is a factor which a sensible and reasonable person, such as Deputy Ahern, will fully understand.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to all three questions is &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  We did not discuss the Government's submission.  We discussed the fact that the Government would make a submission but not its detail.  The submission has not yet been made but will be made shortly.  It is not our intention to publish it.  The body can do its work best by taking confidential evidence and taking oral elaboration of that evidence in a confidential setting.</P>
      <P>The risk attendant on the publication of one submission is that it would invite the publication of all other submissions and the work of the commission would then become simply a facility for the recitation of long known, long held and, potentially, rigid positions.  The approach of the body in taking confidential submissions would be more appropriate.  Our view on maintaining the confidentiality of our submission is not directed to any concerns we might have about the content of our submission, but rather to the wider consideration of the more effective nature of confidential proceedings in general.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach) Niamh Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decision on the funding of initiatives in the White Paper, <i>Charting Our Education Future,</i> is as set out in my foreword to the White Paper.  It states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will aim to provide, during its period of office, the <Col N="1396" /> resources for the development needs identified in this White Paper, within the framework of the budgetary parameters set out in the <i>Government of Renewal</i> policy document, including the acceptance of the Maastricht Treaty convergence conditions.  The amount which can be made available in any given year will have to be decided by the Government in the context of its financial position and its other public expenditure priorities at that time.</P>
    <P>In making observations on the resource aspects of the White Paper, the Department of Finance did not produce detailed, comprehensive multi-annual cost projections, which would take account of all the variables on which future costs will depend.  To attempt to do so would have been a very difficult, if not impossible, task and indeed would be of questionable value.  Government approval of the White Paper was contingent upon adherence to the Maastricht Treaty criteria, in accordance with the Government's fiscal policy objectives. The allocation for education would have to be settled each year.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in my reply to Deputy Martin on 28 September 1995, I do not intend to publish a cost framework or series of cost projections for the White Paper.  Any such exercises would not be very meaningful, and would not contribute to the implementation of a White Paper which is setting the agenda for planning our education system into the next century.  As I indicated previously, it is important to point out that many key changes in the White Paper will not involve additional resources. Rather, they involve the establishment of rights, responsibilities, roles and functions to create a modern framework for the management of the education system. In this regard, I am giving priority attention to the tabling and enactment of legislation.</P>
    <P>In his reply to Deputy Michael McDowell on 19 October 1995, my colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, confirmed that he participated in <Col N="1397" /> the process of consideration by the Government of the White Paper and that this process included consideration of its cost implications.  The Minister correctly pointed out that proposals to implement specific aspects of the White Paper reform programme must be accompanied by detailed costings as and when they come before the Government for approval.  Costing exercises for proposals that might have resource implications in the future are contingent on a range of variable factors, such as the timescale within which proposals are implemented, the outcome of discussions or negotiations with concerned interests and expert advice on the detailed implementation strategies.  As the Minister for Finance pointed out, the cost of education measures are determined to a large extent by pay costs, which in turn reflect numbers employed in the sector and pay rates at any given time.  In this context he indicated it would be neither useful nor appropriate to comment on what the cost elements might be into the future and I agree.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is extraordinary that on the third occasion on which the Opposition has sought basic information prepared by the Government in relation to the costings of the White Paper it has been met with another refusal.  Is the Minister aware that her colleague the Minister of State, Deputy Eithne Fitzgerald, has circulated the heads of a Bill for the freedom of information legislation which will provide individuals with the right to examine official Government documents and that it has been approved by the Government? This morning the Taoiseach confirmed that it would come before a committee of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In such circumstances how can the Minister justify withholding this important information which would be useful to the conduct of the debate on education?  How can she justify this secrecy and the deliberate withholding of this information?  It is not a question of its being appropriate or useful but <Col N="1398" /> whether the Opposition and the public have a right of access to this information. I reject the Minister's proposition that we do not have that right.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a matter of secrecy.  It is a matter of fact about what was done.  This is the third time I have had to deal with the costing proposals for the White Paper which the Deputy imagines were done page by page.  In itself, that would be an unusual practice associated with any White Paper.  The Minister for Education and the Government agreed to the publication of the White Paper and the costing constraints were those listed in the foreword to it.</P>
      <P>The costings of the White Paper, which seeks to chart the future of education into the next century, were not done on a page by page or issue by issue basis.  It might have been easier for me or future Ministers if funding had been secured into the next century but that is not the practice.  The White Paper sets out the framework for the annual budget and future budgets, and all the other areas of rights and responsibilities which do not include a Department of Finance input but include input from many other Departments, none of which would feature or have featured in the publication of Government documents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>It was confirmed to the House that cost implications were considered and a cost framework was produced by the Department of Finance in relation to the White Paper's proposals. In the context of the freedom of information legislation the Ombudsman will be the person to whom the public will be entitled to appeal.  He called recently for an end to the culture of secrecy that pervades our public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had to table five parliamentary questions requesting the publication of various reports dealing with education matters, including this issue.  Does the Minister agree she is now in charge of the most secretive Department in Government and that she is one of the most secretive Ministers in the history of the State?  She seems to have to be <Col N="1399" /> forced into publishing information which is vital for the public.</P>
    <P>Given that the National Education Convention produced costings for the proposals which came within its remit &mdash; they came to around £470 million &mdash; why is the Minister not in a position to give an approximate costing for the proposals in the White Paper?  Why are we not in a position to have an implementation strategy for the next five years?</P>

      <P>This is the third time I have had to tell Deputy Martin there is not a step by step proposal or finance framework to the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I challenge the Deputy to bring to my attention White Papers prepared by this or previous Governments where this information is detailed.  It may have been easier for me and other Ministers for Education if a White Paper agreed by the Government was published and in which the future budget was negotiated. However, there are five reasons why this is not done in White Papers. First, the Government reviews annually the resources required for each Department, including the Department of Education. Second, the Government, through the White Paper, established a systematic and comprehensive framework to annually review the needs and priorities of Departments, including my Department.  Third, part of the White Paper evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of policy implementation.  In <Col N="1400" /> the case of education, I suggest it has strengthened the case for the Department of Education budgeting its funding year by year.  Fourth, consideration must be given to the overall context of the economy in which one negotiates an annual budget for each Department. Fifth, it is important to remember that within the White Paper key changes to create a modern framework for the management of the education system will not involve resources but rather rights, responsibilities, roles and functions.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware that the work of teachers involves a considerable input outside strict class contact hours.  I appreciate and value the extent of the commitment by many teachers, both in and out of school, to their work as educators.</P>
      <P>In the case of primary teachers their daily class contact time is 5 hours and 40 minutes, less a half hour recreation, for 183 days of the year.  In the case of second-level teachers class contact is a maximum of 22 hours per week and schools operate for 167 days of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The salary levels of teachers and the structure of the teaching week acknowledge that time is needed outside of the classroom for a teacher to fulfil her or his role.  This is a matter which is relevant to the ongoing discussions between my Department, the teacher <Col N="1401" /> unions and the managerial bodies in the context of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
    <P>I am aware of newspaper reports that the Irish National Teachers' Organisation carried out a survey regarding time spent by its members on school-related activities outside their formal teaching duties.  My Department has not yet received a copy of this survey.</P>
    <P>The role of the teacher has been clearly articulated in the consultative process leading to the White Paper, including the National Education Convention. In the circumstances, I consider that a survey such as that suggested by the Deputy would have little to add to an understanding of the teacher's role.</P>

      <P>I tabled this question because in every school staff room there is considerable anger at the manner in which the &ldquo;time in school&rdquo; circular was introduced, accompanied by hints, nods, winks and leaks from various people to the effect that teachers were not doing their job or had a short week.  Teachers now feel there is a lack of appreciation of the effective and important extra-curricular activity in which they engage, such as the provision of drama, sport, debating activities, school tours and other activities outside school hours. The shabby introduction of the &ldquo;time in school&rdquo; circular damaged the traditional voluntary commitment by teachers, undermined their professional integrity and damaged their morale.  Is the Minister still intent on rigidly adhering to a &ldquo;clock in, clock out&rdquo; mentality which, if pursued further, will ultimately end in the ruination of a valuable resource to the education system?</P>

      <P>In that circular, we secured the school year and established the length of the school day.  We did not add one moment to that which was already negotiated in the Department of Education.  The circular confirmed the minimum number of days teaching per school year &mdash; 183 out of 365 days in the case of primary schools, 167 out of 365 days in second level schools.  It defined the duration of a full day and a half day. It emphasised the role and responsibility of managerial authorities and &mdash; most importantly &mdash; the need to keep parents informed well in advance of the school calendar.  It referred to some six days available to schools for school related activities outside teaching days but stated that this matter was relevant to the ongoing negotiations under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>

In the ongoing negotiations will the Minister make provision for payment to teachers in the future for time they put in outside of their class contact hours?  Will they be entitled to claim for that?</P>

      <P>The circular was issued by the Department of Education. For the information of parents in particular, it established the school year and the length of half days and full days. It referred to the six extra days available in the school calendar which were not subject to the &ldquo;time in school&rdquo; circular and relate to the extra time the Deputy suggests one should acknowledge. However, that is subject to talks on the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i></P>
      <P>Far be it from any Minister for Education to question the professionalism of the teaching profession.  In common with other professions, the class contact time is not the measurement used in how we remunerate teachers.  We know that like other professionals they must work outside the classroom to ensure their position as professionals will meet the high standards they set themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The &ldquo;time in school&rdquo; circular imposed nothing new.  It repeated the length of the school year and the school day for the benefit of the managerial bodies and school workers and asked that parents in particular would be informed well in advance of the calendar of their local school year.  I assure the Deputy that the circular will be implemented.  There were some initial difficulties about school transport and school openings and as we said to the schools at the time we would deal with them on a one to one basis for particular difficulties which arose last September. We know they will not arise next September because the detail of the circular is available to all as they start next January to timetable the schools for September 1996.  I consider that I should give them that assurance rather than one by the Deputy to take little or no <Col N="1404" /> notice of what is contained in circulars issued by the Department of Education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Ms Bhreathnach)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>I share the Deputies' concern about the level of maintenance grants and I am committed to improving the situation according as resources become available.  Third level student support involves a significant expenditure commitment in the Estimates for my Department.  In 1995 the provision for student support amounts to nearly £100 million.  In 1994 and 1995 I increased the level of the maintenance grants in line with inflation.</P>
      <P>The abolition of undergraduate tuition fees was funded by the removal of covenant tax relief.  Extending free fees to cover additional categories of students is estimated at a cost of £18 million.</P>
      <P>I hope that at a future time, as resources become available, it will be possible to provide more Exchequer support for third level undergraduate students attending courses at night or on a part-time basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend <Col N="1405" /> to continue to ignore the recommendations of the de Buitléir report?  Is it not true that de Buitléir said it is not efficient to substitute public expenditure on higher education for existing private expenditure?  I wonder why the Minister ignored that.  De Buitléir emphasised the importance of horizontal equity by treating people in the same situation in the same way.  What difference does the Minister see between the situations of night and day students which would justify different treatment? Has she not made a totally arbitrary decision in this regard?  If the Minister could not afford to provide free fees to all undergraduates, what criteria did she use in making her decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to put the de Buitléir report in context.  It was commissioned to advise me on funding the third level sector as I shared with other Deputies some sense of scepticism as to whether the large sums of money involved were being administered in a fair and transparent way.  There were many recommendations in that report and on more than one occasion in this House I detailed recommendations which we have taken on board.  Since the report became available to me, the abolition of third level fees was introduced as a Government decision.</P>
      <P>The abolition of income tax covenant relief was very important in terms of funding undergraduate tuition fees because it was through that relief that the vast bulk of people, particularly in the higher tax bracket, were funding their children through university.  It became very evident, given the expansion of that tax relief, that by abolishing it one could level the playing pitch for all undergraduate students and allow all access to our universities and third level institutions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to night and part-time students, I am already on record as saying that I have no difficulty with their case but it is a matter of priority and funding.  I met a delegation from the night students' campaign and I saw the recent surveys by USI.  I hope to be in a <Col N="1406" /> position, as Minister, to open the doors of all our educational institutions from early start to post graduate level. However, I am sure that the Deputy, particularly given the party of which she is a member, will appreciate that there are priorities which must be dealt with in a proper manner, given the State's resources.  Many night and part-time students are funded by their employers, although others are not.  It is a slightly different challenge but I do not have a philosophical objection to it.  It is a matter of priorities and one which will be dealt with by Ministers for Education as sufficient resources become available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I should answer the question as the Minister did not. What has she done about the de Buitléir report or has she ignored it?  The answer, of course, is &ldquo;yes&rdquo; which is much simpler than the long non-answer which we just received.  I am concerned about equity in education.  Is it not the case that if the Minister had ensured that those who could pay did so, she would have had the option to extend the free fees scheme &mdash; if that is the way she wanted to go &mdash; to night students?  Her handling of this and her decisions have been arbitrary.  We now have an inequitable system operating at third level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Deputy that the question she tabled does not mention the de Buitléir report. She asked me if I had plans to increase the level of maintenance grants for third level students, I said I am concerned about the level and hope to improve it as resources become available.  She asked if I had reconsidered my decision regarding the extension of the free fees scheme to night students and I explained that while I did not have any difficulties with it, I had priorities such as ring-fencing for undergraduate fees the funding saved by the State by the abolition of covenant tax relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy and I have different philosophies about those who can afford to pay.  I have never asked the credentials or the socio economic class of those <Col N="1407" /> who enter first and second level and I believe that our educational institutions should be open to all.  In that spirit, the Government decided to ring-fence the income from the abolition of the income tax covenant relief and make it available for the payment of undergraduate fees. A Minister in any Department has to make resources available on a prioritised basis.  The Deputy has already secured from me a comment about my concern about the level of maintenance grants, which was the subject of her question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Minister was aware that my question in relation to the de Buitléir report was a supplementary question.  Is the Minister not aware that practically every commentator has said that the way to establish equity in our system is by proper funding at primary school level?  She can open all the gates she likes of third level colleges but she knows that many of our children will never have a chance of getting near them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the Deputy is referring to the question submitted by Deputy Clohessy on an increase in the level of maintenance grants for third level students.  I hope she will convey my answer to her party colleague because I think I have already answered the question.  I would welcome a specific question on the investment which this and the last Government made in primary education.  Since I arrived in the Department of Education, there has been an increase of 7 per cent in those staying in the second level system.  Unless those across the community avail of second level education, they cannot seek to avail of third <Col N="1408" /> level.  We have set a target of 90 per cent of second level students completing their leaving certificate and we are very much on target.</P>
      <P>That resulted from not only targeting second level education but out of a concern for the primary sector.  While I do not want to take up the time of the House on that matter in replying to this question, I would welcome an opportunity to spell out precisely the investment in primary education in the past three or four years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has a definite and positive policy towards the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.  Education boards will be obliged to implement this policy.</P>
      <P>Education boards will have advantages when dealing with the Irish language, for example, their location in proximity to the schools and to the communities which they will serve and each board will be empowered to establish committees and-or specialist groups to advise and assist it, as appropriate, in the implementation of policy.  This makes it clear that education boards will be empowered to service Gaeltacht and all-Irish schools properly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, the plans and operations of the education boards will be subject to the review and scrutiny of the Minister and Department of Education. Any board which is not making proper provision for the teaching of Irish can be statutorily directed to do so.  It is my policy that proper provision is made for <Col N="1409" /> the Irish language in all schools.  I would be concerned that the establishment of a separate board for Gaeltacht and All-Irish schools would diminish the status of the Irish language in the areas and activities of the other boards and would diminish the effectiveness of the teaching of Irish in other schools.  I do not want to ghettoise the teaching of Irish or Irish-medium schools.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I do not propose to establish a separate board for Gaeltacht and all-Irish schools.  However, I intend to have discussions with the interested parties in order to explore the ways in which the special needs of Irish medium and Gaeltacht schools can be met in the context of the regional boards.  I am more than prepared to develop and consider proposals which will address the particular concerns of the organisations which have sought a special board for Irish-medium schools.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister understand the degree of scepticism among those involved in teaching the 32,000 children in all-Irish schools both inside and outside Gaeltacht areas?  They are extremely sceptical of the Department's capacity to provide a proper service to enable them carry out their work effectively. One can understand this scepticism when the leagan Gaeilge of the White Paper on Education has not yet been published.  The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht simultaneously produced the White Paper on broadcasting in Irish and English.  The word &ldquo;Gaeltacht&rdquo; is not even mentioned in the White Paper on Education. Therefore, one can understand the demand by the various bodies for the provision of a special education board to service special schools that teach through the medium of Irish. Does the Minister understand the scepticism that exists?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are Gaeltacht schools in five of the education board regions, Donegal, Mayo, Kerry, Cork, Waterford and Meath.  There are 124 recognised all-Irish schools in more than <Col N="1410" /> 32 counties.  If Gaeltacht and all-Irish schools were under the remit of one board the philosophy underpinning the need for an education board would be lost.  A region catering for Gaeltacht and all-Irish schools would not have geographical integrity.  Efficient and effective administration of the service would be difficult to achieve and would be no different from the remote administration provided by the Department of Education, which is the subject of much criticism for its delivery of the education system.  Awareness and sensitivity to local needs would be difficult to achieve.  The concerns of the children in the Cois Fharraige school might be different from those in Scoil Lorcáin in my constituency.  The contribution of local communities is important to the richness of the education board and if we do not involve them in the education system it might become expensive and time consuming to effectively co-ordinate the boards.</P>

I will finish with the words &ldquo;beidh mise ag éisteacht&rdquo;.  I will be ag éisteacht and will respond to concerns about in-service training and so on, issues that are different when dealing with lán Gaelach or Gaeltacht schools.  The philosophy underpinning the need to establish education boards is to bring the education system nearer the community of the region.  Is it easier for communities in, say, Connemara, Donegal or West Cork to communicate with an establishment on the eastern seaboard or with regional education boards?  The education system would not benefit from the setting up of an education board to deal with the Irish system of national and secondary education. It would be a sorry day if the richness and contribution that all-Irish and Gaeltacht schools have to offer was lost to other schools at regional level by taking them out of the administration of education at regional level.  When I deal with the matter in much more detail in the Seanad I will be delighted to make <Col N="1412" /> my speech available to my colleagues opposite.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that the biggest problem people living in the Gaeltacht face is being denied a range of basic educational services because of the absence of a board to monitor the provision of such services?  I am sure the Deputy sitting behind the Minister will fill her in.  This is of common interest across the Gaeltacht irrespective of political allegiance.  Speech therapists ask the parents of children with speech difficulties to speak to them in English because of the lack of Irish speaking speech therapists.  One such therapist was appointed by the Western Health Board recently.  There are no psychological services through Irish or text books available for our children. Neither is there a panel of teachers capable of teaching through Irish.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is a need to establish a board to ensure these services are provided and to provide memoranda for all-Irish schools?  Does she agree that all-Irish schools are entitled to avail of such services?  Every regional board which, in the main, provides services through the English language has failed to meet its obligations to native Irish speakers.  Does the Minister accept that this experiment will fail and that the minority will be swamped by the majority and we will be fighting the <Col N="1413" /> same battle for the next 50 years?  It is time that the demands of the people living in Gaeltacht areas were listened to.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy's proposition.  There is a need to deliver educational services through the regions to meet the needs of everyone in the community, including those attending all-Irish schools and adult education courses and students with special needs.  There is a responsibility on each board to ensure that these needs are met.  This responsibility will be underpinned by statutory provision. In the area in which the Deputy grew up people now have a choice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>For the Minister's information, I grew up in Ballsbridge in Dublin 4.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a massive increase in the number of lán Gaelach schools along the eastern seaboard. If the Deputy grew up at my end of the wood and took his holidays at the other end, he would know that the needs of lán Gaelach schools along the eastern seaboard are different from the needs of schools in Gaeltacht areas.</P>
      <P>In relation to the regional education boards, it would be sad if all-Irish schools, special education services and education services for travellers were excluded.  One is engaged in a process of ghettoisation if one suggests that a particular sector or segment should be administered centrally.  That is what the Deputy's proposal means if one takes it to its logical conclusion.  If that were done, the philosophy underlying the regional education boards would not be developed.  The needs of the entire community can be met through the regional delivery of educational services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was delighted to be in a position to provide recognition to a great number of lán Gaelach schools which have much to offer under the remit of a regional education board rather than as a separate sector without seeking a cross-cultural input which can be made where a community meets its plurality of needs <Col N="1414" /> whereby one has different schools for different communities.  It would be sad if all-Irish schools were separated from the mainstream administration of educational services.  This would run counter to the <i>raison d'être</i> of regional education boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>The people asking for such a board to be set up are the people providing a service through the medium of Irish in Gaeltacht schools and Gael scoileanna.  It is regrettable that a question had to be tabled in the Dáil and a motion in Seanad Éireann to get the Minister to state that she would meet the groups involved.  That is a sad reflection on the democratic process in which we are engaged.  It seems that these groups are unable to meet the Minister with ease or regularity to discuss issues of concern to them.  Deputies Coughlan and Ó Cuív have articulated eloquently their sense of frustration.</P>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that this debate highlights the gap which exists in the provision of services to this sector in terms of the provision of proper textbooks, in-service teacher training through Irish, Irish tapes, panels of substitute Irish teachers and resources? Given that little attention was paid to the teaching of Irish in Gaeltacht schools in the White Paper on Education which has never been produced in Irish, the scepticism, frustration and anger is well merited.  This calls for action on the part of the Minister.  This could include the establishment of a special unit within the Department of Education in the intervening period to meet these needs and to pull all the various strands together to have a more focused policy on the teaching of subjects through Irish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>This discussion began in Dublin Castle and those who teach subjects through Irish in Gaeltacht and lán Gaelach schools participated. I have indicated to the different groups involved that I am prepared to meet them to ensure their needs are <Col N="1415" /> met.  A commitment is given in the policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to protect the Irish language.  I carry a certain responsibility to meet this commitment.  It is not intended, however, to establish a separate board to meet the concerns expressed.  If one reads the White Paper, having listened to the dialogue at Dublin Castle, and examines the criticism expressed about the centralisation of the delivery of educational services, one will see it was never envisaged that the needs of the Irish speaking community, special education services or services for travellers or other communities would be met through the establishment of a separate board.</P>
      <P>What was being done relates to the philosophy underpinning the establishment of the board, that the community's total needs in lán Gaelach schools, special schools and adult education and traveller education will be met and delivered on a regional basis, and the board would be statutorily obliged to deliver such services.  When the Irish edition of the Paipéar Bán is published, I will give the Deputy an autographed edition of it as I did in the case of the English edition.</P>

      <P>Tá mé an-bhuíoch den Aire.  Ar a laghad bhí sí an-deimhneach leis an bhfreagra más freagra diúltach féin a bhí ann.  Ach sin ráite ba mhaith liom an cheist seo a chur ar an Aire.  Has the Minister consulted experts, for example, Institiúid Teangeolaíochta, regarding the likely effects of her proposals and whether they will be delivered in relation to the Irish language? Will she explain why it has been necessary to set up a body like Údarás na Gaeltachta to deal with the Irish language on a regional basis if it could be dealt with on a geographic basis?  Will she agree that difficulties in catering for a linguistic difference is totally different from addressing the needs of other groups as difficulties have been encountered in servicing the needs of linguistic minorities worldwide?  Such service can <Col N="1416" /> only be provided if the people serving the group have competency in the language concerned.  Did I correctly understand the Minister to say that the bilingual services will be provided by the staff in the various boards to service all Irish schools in their areas, even if there is only one such school in the area?  The Minister knows as well as I that bilingual staff will not be provided for the boards in all the areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Eamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>As in the case of Údarás na Gaeltachta, one board staffed with the necessary skills could be provided for all Irish schools.  Will the Minister agree that not only is there a demand for all Irish education from schools from Scoil Locháin to Leitir Mealláin and from Gweedore to An Rí in Port Lairge, there is also a demand for a similar structure in the Six Counties. This is an ideal opportunity to establish a board in the Six Counties and one in the Twenty six Counties to deal with the provision of Irish language education for the Thirty two Counties. That is the demand of the sector.  If we are serious about bottom up delivery of the service, that should be taken on board.</P>

      <P>Deputy Ó Cuív referred to Institiúid Teangeolaíochta and linguistic skills, an area in which I have a particular interest.  I would not like to ignore ongoing discussions between officials and the Department of <Col N="1417" /> Education and various branches and organisations concerned with the Irish language, particularly the ongoing discussions at inspectorate and chief inspectorate level.  I said in my reply that I would meet those concerned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Coughlan highlighted a number of issues of concern that should be dealt with on a national level.  She referred to text books and in-service courses, facilities which should be available and administered.</P>

      <P>I am listening to the debate in this area.  I am aware of the meeting in Carraroe.  I have come to a different conclusion from that reached by those who expressed concerns.  We would lose out very badly in the enrichment of the full education system if we were to proceed along the lines advocated by Fianna Fáil.  I am committed to the establishment of regional education boards which would meet the needs of communities.  I do not consider them administrative type boards.  I suggest that Deputy Ó Cuív is seeking an administrative board, which is not the underlying philosophy behind the education boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in previous replies, I accept the general principles and recommendations set out in the Report of the Special Education <Col N="1418" /> Review Committee.  The report contains some 230 recommendations.</P>
      <P>Very substantial progress has been made since the publication of the report in October 1993.  An additional ten psychologists have been appointed.  The pupil-teacher ratio has improved and the special capitation rates paid in respect of all pupils attending special schools and classes were more than doubled in 1994.  For children attending special schools for the severely emotionally disturbed, the rate increased from £132 to £341.  A total of 150 child care assistants were newly appointed to special schools.  Twenty-seven teacher-counsellors, 241 additional remedial teachers and 23 additional resource teachers have been appointed to ordinary national schools to assist them in dealing with pupils with special needs.</P>
      <P>My understanding and view of the required needs of pupils with emotional and-or behavioural disorders are broadly in line with those expressed in the Report of the Special Education Review Committee.</P>
      <P>There are now 13 special schools for emotionally disturbed children, 11 in Dublin and one each in Kilkenny and Galway.  Last September I sanctioned a new special class in County Clare for pupils who are emotionally disturbed.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the recommendations in the committee's report, the &ldquo;Interdepartmental Co-ordinating Committee on Services for Young People with Special Educational Needs&rdquo; has been established.  The committee will consider the future arrangements required for the identification and assessment of pupils with emotional and-or behavioural disorders and the educational, psychological and psychiatric supports required by these pupils.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for her lengthy reply.  Will she indicate the total number of recommendations in the report of the Special Education Review Committee, the number implemented and the timescale applying to the implementation of the outstanding recommendations? Did the Minister have to <Col N="1419" /> cut back on provisions to meet the identified needs of services in that area?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 230 recommendations in the report and they have been accepted by the Department. I have a resumé and what has happened in respect of them.  The committee recommended a change in the description of emotionally disturbed pupils to pupils with emotional and-or behavioural disorders.  It recommended the introduction of a standard system for classifying disorders and that has been taken on board by an interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on services for young people with special needs which will agree arrangements regarding the identification and assessment of the pupils.  That committee is monitoring progress of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not indicate the number of recommendations that have yet to be implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 230 recommendations in the report.  In my reply I gave detailed information about pupils with emotional difficulties.  If the Deputy wishes I can give him more general information on this area.  He specifically referred to emotionally disturbed children.  The report recommended a pupil teacher ratio of 6:1, that has not yet been met, but I have been able to reduce the pupil teacher ratio to 8:1.  The report made recommendations regarding capitation for pupils.  For example, a number of students in the primary school system were penalised in terms of the award of capitation grants as they did not move on to second level. The capitation grant for such children has been increased from £132 to £341.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pupil-teacher ratio has been improved.  Additional psychologists have been appointed so that children can be assessed early.  There is a co-ordinating committee and this is an area in which I have a particular interest.  I would be surprised if the Deputy was suggesting I had ignored some area. <Col N="1420" /> There has been much investment since I assumed office such as the appointment of 29 resource teachers, 241 remedial teachers, 27 teacher counsellors and 150 child care assistants.  The children in the category about which the Deputy asked are among those who are benefiting.  In regard to the pupil-teacher ratio, we have gone some way to meeting the recommendation.  The provision of 150 child care assistants is particularly important.</P>
    <P>I established an interdepartmental committee to ensure the implementation of the recommendations is monitored. Full implementation of the review committee's recommendations was costed at approximately £56 million. When we examine the 230 recommendations it will be possible to produce a breakdown for the Deputy.  I am satisfied that those involved in this area of education have welcomed my acceptance of the report and have in their schools and communities witnessed my commitment in a practical and positive way.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept that one of the great difficulties experienced by parents of children who are emotionally disturbed is the lack of facilities to have those children assessed?  Due to a lack of a proper school psychological service there are long delays, in some cases of up to three years, in having children assessed.  This is a source of frustration to the parents. What will the Minister do about it?</P>

      <P>Having heard that concern expressed on a previous occasion it would be appropriate to remind Members that we have employed extra psychologists for the psychological service in the Department. Formal identification of children with needs usually involves assessment not only by a psychologist but by a psychiatrist, about which Deputy Callely asked.  We have responded to waiting lists by providing extra psychologists. With the Department of Health we offer a greater range of assessment appointments.  There are cost concerns but the additional ten psychologists will deal with the waiting lists.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann welcomes the launch of the &ldquo;twin track&rdquo; process by the Irish and British Governments, calls on all relevant parties to co-operate fully in both tracks and approves the terms of the Joint Communiqué agreed by the Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, T.D., and the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, M.P., on 28 November, copies of which were laid before Dáil Éireann on 5 December 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1560" /> This motion, in requesting Dáil Éireann to approve the terms of the joint communiqué, will enable the requirement imposed by Article 29, sub-article 5.2, of Bunreacht na hÉireann to be met.  That provision of the Constitution provides that the State shall not be bound by any international agreement involving a charge on public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>A charge on public funds will arise by virtue of the joint communiqué as a result of the establishment of the international body to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue.  The international body is to be funded jointly by the Irish and British Governments.  It will have offices in both Dublin and Belfast and its Dublin office will be in Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>On 29 November last the Taoiseach and I had the opportunity of informing the House on the joint communiqué issued the previous evening.</P>
    <P>The need to meet the provisions of the Constitution provides another welcome opportunity to address the House in some detail on the significance of the agreement reached by the two Governments two weeks ago.</P>
    <P>The immediate reason for the motion before the House is the establishment of the international body which involves a charge on public funds.  The membership of the body is now complete with the agreement of Mr. Harri Holkeri of Finland and General John de Chastelain of Canada to join the Chairman, Senator George Mitchell of the United States.  On behalf of the Government and people of Ireland I reiterate our appreciation to these distinguished individuals, all of whom bear heavy burdens in their own countries, for agreeing to serve on the body.  They bring an impressive array of political, diplomatic and peackeeping skills and experience to bear on an issue which has threatened to impede progress to the all-party negotiations which are essential to a resolution of the Northern Ireland problem. I do not underestimate the scale of <Col N="1561" /> the challenge facing them.  They deserve the gratitude of us all for being willing to begin their work in the cause of peace at short notice and under pressure of an extremely tight deadline.</P>
    <P>I also want to express my thanks to the Governments of the United States, Finland and Canada for their readiness to endorse the appointment of their nationals to the body and to provide additional personnel to assist the members in their task of independently assessing the decommissioning issue. The international body has already begun this work with an informal meeting of the three members in New York in the past few days.  Practical arrangements for the establishment of its Dublin office have been put in place by the Department of Justice.  The first formal meetings of the body will be held in Belfast and Dublin from 15 to 18 December.  I understand that it will meet in Dublin on 17 and 18 December. The body has already been in contact with relevant parties and has issued an open invitation to the public to submit written submissions.  The Government will make a submission to the body at the meeting in Dublin.</P>
    <P>I need not remind the House that the present peace is an unprecedented opportunity for all of us on this island. Anyone who has visited Northern Ireland &mdash; and it is good to know that peace has brought such a welcome influx from this part of Ireland &mdash; will know that a great burden has been lifted from the shoulders of the people there. That mood was well caught by the jubilant crowds who turned out to welcome President Clinton and to celebrate the peace with him.</P>
    <P>It is vital that this unprecedented opportunity is not squandered.  The overriding need is to consolidate the present cessations of violence through a lasting and honourable political accommodation. To do that, we must foster the qualities of hope and trust.  Hope is needed to reassure the people of Northern Ireland, of this island and more widely that the nightmare of violence will never return and that only the <Col N="1562" /> values of peaceful democratic process will determine our future.  We must also reassure those who have been persuaded to abandon violence that a genuine and meaningful political process is open to them and that the interests and aspirations of their community will be given no less importance and attention within that process in conditions of peace than in conditions of conflict.</P>
    <P>We must reassure all the people on these islands who want to see negotiations and a settlement in place that the two Governments are living up to the pledges they made in the Downing Street Declaration and to the vision of the Framework Document to promote a fair and honourable accommodation across all the relationships.  Above all we need to enable people to work constructively for their mutual benefit without compromising the essential principles or the long-term aspirations or interests of either tradition or community.</P>
    <P>The greatest obstacle to the realisation of these hopes is the deficit of trust, reflecting a long and bitter history of confrontation and violence.  Trust is needed to enable all the parties to embark on the necessary process of negotiation and growth of trust will be necessary to bring those negotiations to a successful conclusion.  That was why the Government felt such deep concern at the prospect of a stalemate which it feared might arise from the strongly opposed positions which emerged, subsequent to the cessations of violence, on the question of the decommissioning of weapons.  We saw a grave danger that the momentum of the peace process would be dissipated in a sterile and circular argument as to whether decommissioning came through political progress or political progress through decommissioning.  Instead of seeing these as somehow conflicting goals we felt they should be seen as complementary to each other.  Instead of a negative standoff we sought to create a positive interaction between them.  For that reason we developed the policy of the <Col N="1563" /> twin-track approach in the hope that progress could be made in both areas in parallel.  After a period of intense and difficult negotiation, and with the very benign interest and support of the US Administration, both Governments reached agreement on the terms of the twin-track approach in Downing Street on 28 November.</P>
    <P>Apart from paying tribute to its distinguished membership the key point I wish to make about the international body, is that it is invited to present an independent assessment of this issue and is expected to consult widely.  The communiqué invites it to address certain specific or technical aspects of the decommissioning issue.  We hope, however, that in pursuing its consultations and drawing on the representations made to it the body will form its own judgment on the overall context and conditions in which progress towards decommissioning can best be achieved.  As we see it, the obstacles to decommissioning lie not so much in the technical or legal issues to be resolved as in the creation of a context which would make voluntary decommissioning achievable in practice.  We hope that the report of the body will advance the agenda on this point and suggest ways in which the co-operation necessary for this goal can be achieved on all sides.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any doubt, the Government is firmly committed to securing the decommissioning of all arms and material held by organisations who formerly resorted to violence in pursuit of political ends.  This is consistent with our unwavering position that a resolution to the Northern Ireland problem must be sought and established exclusively by peaceful and democratic means.  We wish to see new agreed political structures within Northern Ireland, between North and South and between the two islands so that both communities in Northern Ireland can share fully in the ownership of, and freely give their allegiance to, the structures by which they are governed.  This requires a comprehensive application of the principle <Col N="1564" /> of consent as envisaged in the Downing Street Declaration and the Framework Documents and a political climate free from coercion and from the threat or use of force applied for political ends.</P>
    <P>It is important also to make clear that the current debate on decommissioning has nothing to do with tolerating the possession of illegal weaponry.  Our laws and the actions of our security forces are unambiguous on that point.  Rather the issue is about our efforts, building on the ceasefires and the climate of peace, to persuade those possessing arms which have so far eluded detection in either jurisdiction to decommission them voluntarily in the interests of a better and safer future for all.</P>
    <P>It is well known there is a difference of view between the Irish and the British Governments on this issue.  This difference arises not from any disagreement in principle on the desirability of the earliest possible decommissioning but from a different practical analysis of the conditions in which the paramilitaries will be capable of delivering decommissioning given the historical, psychological and practical factors involved.  If a precondition is genuinely not deliverable, without putting in jeopardy the essential goal of sustaining and consolidating the ceasefires, then insistence on it can only prove counter-productive to the objective being pursued, and we believe an alternative route towards that objective must be found.</P>
    <P>Both Governments are committed to a careful and constructive consideration of any recommendations made by the body.  However, if the body is to properly assess the circumstances in which decommissioning can become a reality and meet the challenge of its mandate generally it must have the fullest co-operation of all the relevant parties.</P>
    <P>The determination of the Government and its predecessor to advance the peace process has been on the clear understanding that Sinn Féin has joined us in an exclusive commitment to peaceful and democratic methods and that it <Col N="1565" /> will use its influence to sustain that commitment and to consolidate the peace. We expect that Sinn Féin will speak authoritatively to the body on the position of IRA weapons and on the issue of how the gun can be taken out of Irish politics.  It will, of course, also be enabled to put forward any wider or particular concerns, as it sees fit, for the consideration of the body.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly stressed, and have done so again in the House today, the importance which the Government attaches to the goal of decommissioning. However, it is important also to keep this issue in perspective.  We know that even total decommissioning of all existing material, however desirable that might be, would not be a reliable guarantee against an upsurge of violence in the future.  We know from our experience the horrors of death and destruction that can be engineered from readily available materials.  We know that, regrettably, weaponry is available on the international black market as never before.</P>
    <P>Decommissiong in isolation amounts only to a decision or guarantee in relation to a particular set of weapons. The broader guarantee that the peace process is irreversible must come from the political process and, ultimately, the underpinning of a negotiated settlement. The real task is to decommission mind-sets and attitudes.  I hope the Republican movement will see in the international body an opportunity to address the genuine and widespread fears that the obstacles to decommissioning are not just about the difficulty of dismantling the past but portend some sinister intention for the future.  The work of the body can be used constructively to give added reassurance to those who fear that the democratic process will be tainted by violence.  Political parties must be reassured that the commitment to the democratic process by former paramilitaries is genuine and irreversible and that the process of negotiation and agreement will be conducted free of the threat or use of force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1566" /> I would recall also that within the communities in Northern Ireland there is a strong sense that the issue of weapons is not the only significant barrier to confidence.  Allegations of continued recruitment and training by paramilitary organisations, the rumoured targeting of individuals, the failure to restore missing bodies to their families, the banishment of individuals from their communities and above all the increasing incidence of brutal so-called &ldquo;punishment beatings&rdquo; are all manifestly corrosive of the climate of trust which is so necessary for the launch and successful conclusion of the substantive negotiations which we all need to see in place.  The humanitarian objections to these activities are overwhelming, but they are deeply negative in their impact on the political process also.</P>
    <P>The agreement reached on the joint communiqué has generated a renewed momentum in the search for a permanent peace.  The visit of President Clinton has given a further and heartening boost to that momentum.  The reaction of the people on the streets of Belfast, Derry and Dublin and throughout this island to this visit sends the clearest signal of all that the work of the international body and the approach of the twin tracks must work.  The people will accept nothing less.</P>
    <P>In his address in this House, in his speeches to public gatherings North and South and in his remarks since his return to Washington, President Clinton has demonstrated that he is a true friend of Ireland and of the United Kingdom.  His continuing interest in the success of the twin track process and that of his senior aides such as National Security Adviser, Tony Lake, and the US Ambassador to Ireland, Jean Kennedy Smith, is a crucial support to all those who will be engaged in the process. It is a reminder to those who would refuse to engage in the twin track approach that the international community too is behind this process.</P>
    <P>I have welcomed the sense of urgency which the members of the body have already brought to their task.  We must <Col N="1567" /> bring a similarly urgent approach to the work of the first track of preparatory talks.  The joint communiqué makes clear that these talks will have an entirely open agenda, allowing any party to raise any issue it wishes.  The Governments have also made clear that they are flexible about the format of the talks as they develop, subject to addressing comprehensively all the relationships across the three strands.  They are determined, however, that they should be intensive and geared to the firm aim of launching all-party talks negotiations by the end of February 1996.  That is an ambitious target, but attainable with goodwill on all sides.</P>
    <P>I am glad that both Governments are investing great urgency in the preparatory talks.  When I met Sir Patrick Mayhew in London on Friday last we reviewed the invitations which we had extended to the parties.  We agreed to intensify our contacts with them and to prepare in various ways the ground for productive bilateral and multilateral meetings.  I have had contact made since that meeting with all the Northern parties with this objective in mind.  I have good reason to believe that these will bear fruit, even if the prospect of meetings is not always as immediate as I would wish.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the leaders of the Unionist parties do not as yet appear to have appreciated the potential of the twin track process.  In President Clinton's eloquent words, &ldquo;engaging in honest dialogue is not an act of surrender, it is an act of strength and common sense.&rdquo; The Unionist community prides itself on these qualities.  I hope and expect that strength and common sense will prevail over fear and suspicion. Indeed, the Unionist community, which has suffered much and has perhaps the keenest sense of threat, has in many ways the most to gain from agreement.</P>
    <P>If we are to reach agreement, then we must negotiate and before we negotiate we must agree on how and on what basis we are to do so.  That is the sole purpose of the preparatory talks.  No <Col N="1568" /> party entering them will prejudice its position on any of the many substantive questions to be resolved.</P>
    <P>The tone of some of the reactions to my invitation to enter into preliminary dialogue has been regrettable.  It offered encouragement to those who doubt the level of commitment which exists to serious dialogue.  There has also been some apparent misunderstanding of the purpose of the preparatory talks and of the basis on which I wrote.  That purpose is entirely consistent, not only with the agreement reached by the two Governments in the communiqué but also with the precedent of the 1991-92 talks.  These talks were convened by both Governments and all of the Unionist parties took part in them.  I hope it will be possible, through direct contact, to clear up these misunderstandings.  In an inter-locking three-stranded process, the Irish Government will inevitably be centrally involved in discussion of North-South and east-west relations, but equally we accept, as we always have, that we will not be directly engaged in discussion of future internal structures, which are primarily for the Northern parties to agree.</P>
    <P>I look forward to discussing these questions, and the many issues relating to the management of the process of negotiations, with the leaders of the Unionist parties at the earliest possible date.  It is vital that instead of polemics we get on with the business of crafting a fair and honourable accommodation.</P>
    <P>At our London meeting the Secretary of State and I also agreed that our officials should examine a number of issues which are likely to be raised in these preparatory talks, on the lines set out in the communiqué.  We shall be reviewing this work at further meetings before Christmas.</P>
    <P>It is encouraging also that the parties themselves in Northern Ireland have intensified contacts among themselves. The joint communiqué emphasises that the two Governments will treat each party on an equal basis and encourage any format for meetings that advances the objective of the preparatory talks.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1569" /> My visit to Belfast this morning was relatively brief and had a primarily economic focus.  Among the vast majority of those I met I found a strong sense that the twin track process is the way forward.  My discussions this morning convinced me too that the launch of the joint communiqué and President Clinton's hugely successful visit have struck a deep chord.  People in their daily lives, business people and trade unionists expect this process to succeed. They demand from us that we make it succeed.  Political leaders would do well to take account of this groundswell of public feeling.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House offers all the parties in Dáil Éireann the opportunity to renew their commitment to the policy of Anglo-Irish co-operation in resolving the problem of Northern Ireland followed by successive Governments.  The bipartisan approach adopted by the Opposition parties, while allowing for constructive criticism, has been of considerable assistance to the Government in the difficult and protracted negotiations which led to the joint communiqué.  I want to fully acknowledge this.  By adopting this motion the House will send a clear message that is united in calling on all parties to co-operate in the twin track process.  This co-operation must be wholehearted, transparent and given in both tracks.</P>
    <P>I commend the motion to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil supports the launch of the twin track approach, as provided for in the joint communiqué of 28 November, and supports the establishment of the international commission and the setting of a date for all-party talks.  It was vital to move forward and salvage the peace process from the rocks of intransigence.  We acknowledge the remarks by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and will join with him in approving the communiqué. I join with him also in thanking Senator Mitchell and his colleagues on the international body.  We all appreciate that these busy people, each of whom bears <Col N="1570" /> heavy burdens in his own country, have taken on the additional task in working to assist us on this island.</P>
      <P>Political deadlock has been allowed develop particularly since the launch of the Framework Document.  One would have thought that those in Government would have appreciated how important it was following 25 years of violence that the domestic process would be seen to produce viable results.  Before the ceasefire the British Government was impatient to launch all-party talks but there has been a long delay.</P>
      <P>Confidence in the peace process in sections of the Northern Nationalist community prior to the Clinton visit had sunk to a low ebb after months of political stagnation.  Disturbing question marks were beginning to be raised about the solidity of the ceasefire.  There was a feeling that the Government was not presenting the Irish case with sufficient vigour and that the British Government and the Unionist parties were laying down terms, with only a limp response coming from Dublin.</P>
      <P>President Clinton by his visit has further internationalised the issue and underlined the United States support for those committed to making progress in the peace process.  My main source of confidence in the future is the fact that public opinion, North and South, overwhelmingly wants to see progress in consolidating the peace.  It is also encouraging that the United States is prepared to continue to act as a strong supporter of the peace process and as the ultimate guarantor of fair play.  As an American columnist put it in the <i>Sunday Times</i> last weekend, President Clinton on his visit to London reinstated the &ldquo;special relationship&rdquo; because John Major agreed to move forward negotiations over Ireland just before the President arrived.  No doubt the strength of the &ldquo;special relationship&rdquo; will assume among other things a British commitment in good faith to organise all-party talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While supporting the twin track process I have some serious reservations about aspects of the communiqué of 28 <Col N="1571" /> November.  I hope it did not represent simply a hasty fudge under pressure of the imminent visit of the United States President, Mr. Bill Clinton, or simply a time-buying exercise designed to move the roadblock up the road.</P>
    <P>I trust the cynical remarks of Simon Jenkins published in the London <i>Times</i> on Saturday, 2 December, do not represent the real British Government agenda.  He said:</P>
    <P>The danger for Mr. Major is that the so-called peace process might now move from stall to forward gear.  Ever since the ceasefire, he has been able to pander to the Unionists' insistence on the IRA &ldquo;decommissioning&rdquo; its weapons, which he and they know to be a nonsense ....  Mr. Major must struggle to re-establish a plausible inertia that will last at least another 18 months.</P>
    <P>I continue to regard it as unfortunate that the Irish Government accepted two potential built-in stalling mechanisms in the communiqué of 28 November.  I do not propose to repeat in great detail arguments I have already made but the last sentence of paragraph 3 of the communiqué we consider to be deeply unwise.  It reads:</P>
    <P>These preparatory talks may also extend to all steps required to establish the necessary circumstances to bring the partners together at the negotiating table in accordance with paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
    <P>That gives the Northern parties a direct say in determining Sinn Féin's eligibility to participate in all-party talks when, under the Joint Downing Street Declaration, it is solely a matter for the two Governments.  As far as the Irish Government is concerned, that issue was determined long ago.  It should be extraordinarily careful about tampering with any part of the basis of the original ceasefires.</P>
    <P>
      <i>De facto</i> the British Government now has no difficulty talking to Sinn Féin on <Col N="1572" /> the same basis as other parties, although the British Prime Minister will not meet Mr. Gerry Adams.  The logical conclusion of all ministerial contact and dialogue between the British Government and Sinn Féin surely is that, after 15 months' ceasefire, Sinn Féin is entitled to participate in all-party talks on the same basis as any other party.  It seems to me that this clause in paragraph 3 of the communiqué positively invites hostile parties to create new preconditions or extend existing ones.  There is already some evidence that is happening.</P>
    <P>The position of the Ulster Unionist leadership is little more consistent than that of the British Government.  For example, Mr. David Trimble had no difficulty meeting a loyalist party a couple of weeks ago to urge them to move first on decommissioning.  If he can speak with loyalists while they still hold all their weapons &mdash; I am not criticising him for doing so since I have been doing so since the beginning of this year &mdash; what is the difference in principle involved in his party speaking with Sinn Féin as the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> has been consistently urging them to do almost daily?</P>
    <P>There is another stalling mechanism waiting in the wings in the event that the international commission on decommissioning is able to achieve any breakthrough, that is the idea of an assembly which receives unnecessary endorsement in the joint communiqué.  Fianna Fáil is not opposed to an assembly as part of a three-stranded agreement encompassing the totality of relationships. We merely object to the idea of bringing it forward in advance of any negotiations or even a commitment to them.  If the assembly idea is accepted &mdash; in which all Unionists parties would participate along with Sinn Féin &mdash; one must ask what was the point of wasting all these months arguing about decommissioning if it will be irrelevant?  I am amazed at the manner in which British political parties are climbing on the assembly bandwagon, assuming that the international commission will fail to resolve the problem before it has even <Col N="1573" /> begun its work.  Already the idea of an assembly has been mooted as a back-up device, whether or not the decommissioning issue is diffused, for further stalling progress to all-party talks.</P>
    <P>The idea of placing three-stranded talks within a Strand I context is unacceptable to Nationalists, particularly when, at the same time, they see the Ulster Unionist Party endeavouring to write Strand II &mdash; the North-South strand &mdash; out of the agenda.  I would like to be assured that a deal or understanding has not been negotiated between the two Governments in relation to an assembly which, taken alone, would represent a considerable advance toward a purely internal solution.</P>
    <P>I find it strange that, while the business community, North and South discuss the island as a natural economic zone for business, the Unionists challenge the whole concept.  I regard it as a serious development that Baroness Denton, a junior Minister in the North, criticised the idea agreed by her Government in the Framework Document &mdash; that of North-South bodies with executive powers.  I hope our Government will make forceful representations about this apparent retreat by a British Minister from the Framework Document, to which they are in honour bound, before negotiations even begin.</P>
    <P>I am puzzled by the Government's relaxed attitude to the attempt to substitute an assembly for all-party talks promised in paragraph 10 of the Joint Downing Street Declaration.  We do not require a bad tempered debating Chamber; rather what we require is all-party negotiations.  More firmness is required of our Government if it is to give the essential leadership that will underpin confidence in the peace process.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are rumours about an electoral college or even an electoral index that would not involve an assembly.  Is the electoral mandate of any of the main five parties in Northern Ireland seriously at issue?  Elections could lead only to a further hardening of positions and the laying down of even <Col N="1574" /> more impossible preconditions.  Would one of the purposes of holding early elections be an attempt by the Ulster Unionist Party to nip the small loyalist parties in the bud?</P>
    <P>I hope the preparatory talks will concentrate on the main task of bringing about all-party talks by the end of February next on the same basis as the two previous rounds of talks held in 1991 and 1992.  As was the case in preparing for the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in September and October 1994, I presume there are many practical questions to be decided about format, venue, agenda and numbers of each of the delegations participating.  I am glad that in their communiqué the two Governments at least firmly endorsed the three-stranded approach, from which I trust there will be no departure.</P>
    <P>I warmly welcome the establishment of the international decommissioning body under the chairmanship of Senator George Mitchell.  My party intends to make a written submission to his body by Friday next.  The purpose of our submission, will be to place the overall decommissioning issue within its political context.  We will conclusively refute the notion that any precondition was built into the Joint Downing Street Declaration, or that it was a considered condition of either Government that they would insist on decommissioning in advance of talks prior to the ceasefire. Given the scale and sophistication of modern-day weapons, we have always seen decommissioning as essential but forming part of a wider demilitarisation of Northern society.  Unfortunately, in the communiqué, the issue of paramilitary decommissioning was segregated from the response of the security forces to continued peace.  We have not argued that paramilitary organisations should be treated on a par with security forces of the State operating within the rule of law, but we regard as a legitimate goal the creation of a normal, civil society in Northern Ireland without <Col N="1575" /> emergency provisions, with a background military presence for emergencies only and with a mainly unarmed police force.</P>
    <P>The only way to approach disarmament is multilaterally.  While the focus naturally is on the paramilitary weapons of the loyalists and IRA, the vast quantity of licensed firearms, approximately 140,000, also remain a threat to peace. No one will forget some years ago when Dr. Paisley and some of his colleagues climbed a hillside to exhibit their firearm certificates.  Legally held weapons can be used for illegal purposes and to threaten the Nationalist population if they continue their legitimate democratic demands.  In this respect, the recent outburst of Dr. Paisley on RTE was not reassuring.</P>
    <P>In the past 25 years there have been a number of very controversial incidents, when members of the security forces acted beyond the rule of law and engaged in, or aided and abetted, terrorism, no doubt often on their own initiative or in collusion with others, with subsequent loss of life.  In many such cases &mdash; especially where the British Army was involved &mdash; justice has not been done nor was it seen to be done.  I should like to see established an institutional mechanism on the lines of the Truth Commission in South Africa, which would establish at least which organisation bore responsibility for killings in all instances where such responsibility has not been clearly acknowledged or established, or what really happened whenever real and independent findings have been suppressed. In this jurisdiction I regard it as particularly important to establish definitively the organisations and agencies responsible for the Dublin and Monaghan bombings of 1974.</P>
    <P>Those involved in or associated with paramilitary organisations have a crucial role to play in the current phase. Indeed, the quality of their contribution in the next phase may help to determine whether it is possible to move on.  Both <Col N="1576" /> sets of paramilitaries are to be commended on the manner in which they have kept their ceasefires.  It compares favourably with many other troubled regions worldwide.  Their original decisions required considerable courage. Of course, we all deplore the inhuman punishment beatings, which highlight the urgency of an acceptable reform of policing and which undoubtedly detract from the political respect accorded both sets of organisations who have most to gain from their cessation.</P>
    <P>Republicans and loyalists alike should seize the opportunity afforded by the establishment of the Mitchell-chaired international commission and make the best possible use of it.  It is time for the initiative to move back from the British Government to the people.  I deplore all those who, by insisting on hardline attitudes and preconditions, narrow the room for manoeuvre and endeavour to marginalise the commission's important functions.  I regard that as a discourtesy to the President of the United States of America.</P>
    <P>The work of the commission has two important aspects, first to extract a guarantee from both sides of their exclusive unconditional commitment to the democratic peace process in their own terminology.  On that basis alone, it would be very difficult for anyone to continue to exclude them.  There is no value in anybody pretending to keep options open when in reality there remains one sane option only, the path of peace and democracy.  To foster lingering doubts on the durability of the ceasefires is politically counter-productive and provides further excuses for inaction, and alibis for others not to treat republicans and loyalists with respect.  The second requirement that might reasonably be sought and complied with is some definite indication of how it is proposed to carry out decommissioning in a verifiable manner, when the time arrives, either as part of confidence-building measures agreed in the course of the talks process, or as part of a negotiated settlement.  We will be <Col N="1577" /> putting forward some concrete suggestions in this area.</P>
    <P>The peace process has hitherto been sustained by the prisoners, among others.  Over the past 12 months the Irish Government has, as promised, approached the issue in a progressive, enlightened and humane manner, and has released many of the prisoners from Portlaoise.  I hope that further steps will be taken by the Government in the next ten days to release most of the remaining politically notivated prisoners belonging to organisations that have upheld the ceasefires.</P>
    <P>The handling of the prisoners issue by the British Government has in contrast been deplorable, and on this issue it is not Unionist opinion that can plausibly be cited as the main obstacle.  I welcome the transfer of Paddy Kelly today, but it is far too late.  A retired British judge recently described the regime being run by the Home Secretary as &ldquo;despotic&rdquo;. Gareth Pierce gave a graphic account to the forum a few weeks ago of the unjust treatment being meted out to long-term paramilitary prisoners in Britain.  I have also had firsthand accounts from Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, who has given good service to this House by his regular contact with and visits to the prisoners. All those who have served more than 20 years, in some cases for offences that fell short of murder, should be released this Christmas without further ado.  The restoration of the 50 per cent remission represents a minimal first step, which must be improved upon. There is a pressing need for the British Government to adopt a completely different and more forward approach.</P>
    <P>I am glad the British Prime Minister, John Major, is coming to Ireland next week.  He has in the past given considerable service to the cause of peace, which we will always respect.  I hope when he comes he will have an opportunity to listen to genuine concerns about the management of the peace process.  We need more generosity and magnanimity and less confrontation.  The commission should be allowed to get on with its work.  There is a need for an improved <Col N="1578" /> relationship between the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister.  The breakthrough in the peace process that came with the Downing Street Declaration and the ceasefire came about because, despite considerable doubts and hesitations, the British Prime Minister was willing to listen to the Taoiseach's predecessor and take advice from him on many occasions.  The stalling of the peace process since early February has come about because, for whatever reason, the advice of the Taoiseach has ceased to be listened to.  I hope the Prime Minister's visit during the week, on the eve of Christmas, will contribute to altering that state of affairs.  We will watch with interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to support the motion proposed by the Government on the joint communiqué and the twin track approach.  Two weeks ago when we discussed the communiqué I wholeheartedly welcomed it.  I said at the time it was the best the Government could have done in the circumstances.  I still believe, on reflection, that is a fact. I do not believe the two Governments could have advanced the process any more than they did in the joint communiqué and in the launch of the twin track approach.  On that occasion I also commended the efforts of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and, indeed, the Minister for Social Welfare, who is deeply involved in this process.  I would like to reiterate those words of congratulation today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the launch of the communiqué and the debate here two weeks ago, there have been a number of significant developments.  First, there was the extraordinary visit of President Clinton. That visit cast a spell of new hope and optimism not just across the Republic but throughout the island.  The scenes outside Belfast City Hall and the Guildhall in Derry were moving and heartwarming. To see the yearning of ordinary people for a continuation of peace was something that genuinely touched everybody who saw it.  That it was the American flag, not the Union Jack or <Col N="1579" /> the Tricolour, that was being waved confirmed for all of us the unifying effect the United States can have in relation to the conflict in Northern Ireland.  They can be and are a force for bringing a people together.  I was very struck during my meetings with President Clinton by his desire to have an even-handed approach; he did not intend to tell the parties in Ireland, either North or South, what to do.  What he wanted to do was encourage and facilitate agreement in an even-handed and balanced way.  I very much support that and I think it is a very positive factor.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear from the scenes in Northern Ireland that ordinary people will show their outrage if any organisation or any faction wants to revisit violence and mayhem on the people of Northern Ireland.  I hope the paramilitaries on both sides take that on board.</P>
    <P>Since President Clinton's visit we have had the IRA statement, the response of the leader of the Official Unionist Party to the invitation from the Irish Government to have preliminary talks, and we have also had a much wider debate than heretofore about the idea of an assembly.  I want to talk about a number of those issues in my contribution today rather than repeat what I said two weeks ago.</P>
    <P>The IRA statement was chilling and depressing.  I suppose at many levels it was really a restatement of their entrenched position, but coming as it did in the aftermath of the Clinton peace mission I found it very depressing indeed.  It is clear that the IRA will not voluntarily &mdash; they may not even be open to persuasion &mdash; hand over the arsenals of guns and explosives in their possession.  It is quite clear from their statement that they regard the suggestion of handing over anything as ludicrous, whether through the front door or the back door.</P>
    <P>I was taken by an article today in <i>The Irish Times</i> written by Vincent Browne who saw some positive features.  On <Col N="1580" /> reflection, there probably are some positive features in the IRA statement, depressing as I thought it was on first reading.  Vincent Browne referred in particular to the second paragraph of the IRA statement where it is stated: &ldquo;We noted that a solution to the conflict would only be found as a result of inclusive negotiations&rdquo;.  He focused in on the word &ldquo;only&rdquo;.  That must mean, and hopefully does mean, that the IRA accept that murder, violence and the use of the weapons of war that they have used for 25 of the last 26 years is not the way to resolve the conflict in Northern Ireland.  In so far as they acknowledge that I welcome it.  They went on to say that the twin track approach was the way forward.  I acknowledge the positive element that that represents as well, and I would like to think we are fair. However, their statement raises various questions about the capacity of Sinn Féin to speak with authority before the Mitchell commission in relation to IRA arms.  That commission must have a very wide remit.  It must deal not only with the issue of arms but also with the issue of punishment beatings and intimidation. Only last weekend members of Sinn Féin went to the Donegal Celtic football team and persuaded them not to play with the RUC.  That kind of intimidation and thuggery must also be part of the agenda of the international commission.</P>
    <P>My party will be making submissions to that commission tomorrow because we were invited to do so.  It is important that all parties who have views about this issue should put forward their views.  My views on decommissioning are quite simple.  In the context of this island I want to see all arms, particularly all the illegal arms, either surrendered or destroyed.  While that is the aim, I accept verification of that process is virtually impossible.  I also accept that it is always possible to make new explosives or acquire new weapons.  In the short-term what the paramilitaries have to do is make a gesture.  What we are talking about is the creation of conditions <Col N="1581" /> whereby all-party talks can be successful, and all party talks cannot commence unless all parties come to those talks or unless we create the circumstances where it would be virtually impossible for parties to stay away.  We have to create an environment where no party will have any just reason to stay away from the talks.  Those circumstances do not exist at the moment.  It is not unreasonable to ask the paramilitaries on both sides to make a gesture to show that they are willing to travel down the road of decommissioning.  We have to ask ourselves if their political representatives are really committed to peace if they are not prepared to travel down the road of getting rid of some of the semtex and weapons of war that they have in their possession.</P>
    <P>I also believe that Sinn Féin in particular may consider giving a solemn declaration.  I have spoken with Unionist representatives in recent days on this matter, and it would be helpful if Sinn Féin were to make it clear that they will not support the use of violence to oppose what the majority in each community in Northern Ireland agree to in the context of all-party talks.  In other words, if the majority of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland and the majority of the Unionist community are prepared to agree to a particular political settlement, Sinn Féin and the IRA will not use violence to oppose that.</P>
    <P>It does not matter if that declaration is put in an all Ireland context for theoretical historical reasons.  The people in the South of Ireland will agree to anything that is acceptable to the majority in both communities in Northern Ireland.  A solemn declaration of that kind which the commission may consider may be helpful as far as moving the process forward is concerned and at least make it possible for Unionist politicians to begin to talk with those who targeted, killed and maimed many of their community over the past 25 years.</P>
    <P>The response of the Official Unionist Party was unhelpful and insensitive.  The Cold War language, describing the <Col N="1582" /> Government of the Republic as a foreign Government, was insensitive to the feelings and identity of the Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  We can move the process forward and have a political settlement only when we have a partnership and consensus in Northern Ireland with which Nationalists and Unionists feel comfortable.  That will only happen if there is compromise.  We cannot have a partnership or consensus unless both sides are prepared to compromise and respect the identity and aspirations of the other community.</P>
    <P>I found David Trimble's Cold War language insensitive.  He is not prepared to enter into discussions with the Irish Government at this preliminary stage and that is unhelpful.  If we look at the resolution of conflicts around the world, whether in the Balkans, South Africa or the Middle East, we will realise that people must talk to each other.  I hope Unionist politicians will come out of their political bunker and get rid of the &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; or &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; approach of the past 25 years.  If there is any lesson to be learned in the politics of Northern Ireland over the past 75 years it is that majoritarianism is not a solution.  We must move away from that if we are to have a genuine political settlement.</P>
    <P>Trust is a two way measure.  We need to create trust on the paramilitary and Sinn Féin republican side by having a gesture in relation to arms.  Equally on the Unionist side we need to hear more sensitive language and a more open and helpful response to invitations from the Government of the Republic which, as far as Nationalists are concerned, represents their point of view and negotiates and works on their behalf.</P>
    <P>The Government was right to ensure that the process and mechanisms established at the launch of the twin track approach provide for everything to be left on the agenda.  That is very important.  We cannot approach the commencement of talks if before they happen we rule out somebody's desired objective.  Just as the Trimble response <Col N="1583" /> was unhelpful so too would it be unhelpful if we were to rubbish the idea of an assembly.  We must keep an open mind.</P>
    <P>However, I worry that in the context of elections in Northern Ireland Sinn Féin would fight them as part of a republican movement that insisted on holding on to its weapons.  We would have a bitter campaign, marked by extremism rather than moderation.  One lesson we can learn is that even the moderates are constantly looking over their shoulder at people who are more extreme.  During elections when people are seeking new mandates they are often forced to adopt a more extreme position than they might otherwise.  If they fight the elections as part of a republican movement that has not handed over its weapons, it will make no difference to the arms issue and at best we would have an ambivalent Sinn Féin at the negotiating table.  I am not convinced that is helpful.</P>
    <P>I know Dr. Alderdice has been persuasive on this matter.  Some people take the view that there will not be all-party talks before the next British election. The process cannot sustain a vacuum of that length.  Something must happen.  Elections to talks may be a political solution to the impasse and we should consider that.</P>
    <P>As regards moving the process forward the mechanism provided in the twin track approach is for the commission to look at the arms issue. Although the Governments will not be bound by its findings I hope all parties will accept its recommendations.  I say that not knowing what the recommendations will be but we would be foolish to ignore an arbitrator's findings.  We should be prepared to accept the recommendations of the expert group.  It is expert not just in terms of personnel.  I join with others in thanking George Mitchell and his fellow members of the commission for agreeing to serve.  We owe them a great deal of gratitude. Much of the expertise in resolving conflicts in other countries will be available to them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1584" /> There is no point in having talks unless we are certain everyone will attend.  By that I mean in particular the Official Unionist Party.  I urge that party to be more open to preliminary talks. If the Government decides to have all-party talks in February there is an onus on those who genuinely want a political settlement to come to the table and put forward their view.</P>
    <P>From my experience of the last round of talks, though I was not present at the end, we need to involve a small representative group of people &mdash; 60 to 70 people will not negotiate a settlement for Northern Ireland.  That is unrealistic. The smaller and more representative the group the better.  If we are to move the talks process forward and have a realistic possibility of having them in February or March it is important that the Government continue to adopt an open approach to everything including an assembly.  If people genuinely put forward their preferred option then it is not helpful to rule it out straight away.</P>
    <P>The talks, if they begin, will create their own dynamic.  If people participate in talks they will be committed to them and we see that at the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.  I do not know what would have happened if Sinn Féin was not a member of the forum for the past year or so.  At the forum, I find that genuinely engaging with those with whom one disagrees can have a positive effect in breaking down mistrust and prejudice.</P>
    <P>I appeal to both sides, the Sinn Féin representatives and the Official Unionist Party, to get out of their political bunkers and not maintain the integrity of their own position.  They should give the talks process and the twin track initiative a real chance.  If they do not, five years from now we will still have the political vacuum of the past 25 years.  The Unionists must realise the enormous positive opportunities that will arise from engaging in dialogue with the Northern Nationalist community.</P>

      <P>The joint communiqué of 28 <Col N="1585" /> November marked a major advance in the peace process and resolved the impasse that had existed for some time. We now have a mechanism for moving forward on the path set out in the Downing Street Declaration.  It allows us as politicians to give our full attention to the political issues arising from the peace process and makes it possible to concentrate on the preparation for all-party talks, which it is our firm aim to commence before the end of February.</P>
      <P>The outlook remains positive &mdash; despite the IRA statement of 8 December.  The IRA was being true to form in that statement, but it did not close any doors that were opened by the ceasefire announcement of August 1994.  Neither, of course, did it open the door to the immediate all-party talks Sinn Féin has been demanding.</P>
      <P>The Republican Movement should take serious note of the national consensus in relation to arms decommissioning. Public support for decommissioning has not wavered since the issue first arose, and last week a national opinion poll showed that three quarters of Irish people believe the IRA should decommission at least some weapons prior to all party talks.  Over half of these &mdash; 45 per cent of the total &mdash; favour complete decommissioning.  This is not to overlook the fact that anyone who knows anything about Irish history will have recognised from the very beginning that the arms question will be one of the most difficult obstacles to overcome on the path to a political settlement and it has proven to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The arms issue has probably been the single biggest problem the two Governments have faced and the pursuit of a solution has taken countless hours of work on the part of political leaders and officials in Britain and Ireland.  The arms stalemate has provided an impediment to progress on a wide range of political issues.  It is clear, on the other hand, that if some progress can be made on the arms issue there would be a real hope that rapid movement could be made on other political issues.  Nobody <Col N="1586" /> underestimates the huge problem facing Senator Mitchell and his colleagues in the international body.  If they are to succeed they will need the good will and co-operation of all sides.  Most of all, they will need a great degree of flexibility on the part of the paramilitaries and the British Government.</P>
    <P>I understand the reason the British Government set out the three Washington `tests' &mdash; the need to establish confidence in those communities that had suffered so terribly at the hands of paramilitaries, that the ceasefires were genuine and that there would be no return to violence.  Surely it is now reasonable for the British Government to accept that rigid adherence to Washington 3 has proven to be an obstacle to progress on other fronts and to say that not only will it accept other alternative approaches offered by the international body that will achieve the same results, but that it will actively assist Senator Mitchell and his colleagues in pursuit of such an approach.</P>
    <P>In the same way, it is unrealistic for Sinn Féin and the IRA to continue to refuse to address the arms problem and to suggest that it can in some way be deferred to put in cold storage until political talks on a settlement have concluded. They must heed the democratic demand of the overwhelming majority of people on this island, expressed through all the political parties North and South other than Sinn Féin, and confirmed in opinion poll after opinion poll, who want to see progress on the arms issue.  They must realise that failure to face the problem will not hasten all-party talks and a political solution, but delay and possibly stagnate the process. The Mitchell body provides a unique combination of political and military experience from three countries which, I am sure, will provide a solution. Rejection by any side of any reasonable formula it comes up with would be an act of gross irresponsibility and make exceedingly difficult the pursuit of the principles outlined in the Downing Street Declaration.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1587" /> The cynicism evident among all paramilitaries in relation to so-called punishment beatings does nothing to create the confidence and trust that are essential to political dialogue.  The level of cynicism is reflected in the description of these beatings by a republican spokesperson as &ldquo;a social problem&rdquo;, and by the apologia offered by a loyalist spokesperson for what he sought to portray as acts of justice sought by the community. Let us be clear what we are talking about.  The punishment beatings and shootings are criminal acts of violence. They are carried out simply and solely as an exercise in paramilitary control and power.  The paramilitaries could make a significant contribution to the peace process if they were to desist from future beatings and put their faith in politics.  This would enhance the prospects for inclusive political dialogue which can be productive only if conducted against a background free of violence and intimidation.</P>
    <P>All parties and politicians have an obligation to ensure that all-party talks take place in the best possible climate. This requires an end to recriminations, threats and ultimatums.  Furthermore, it requires various political leaders to seek to moderate unrealistic expectations, on the one hand, and to stop doom-laden predictions, on the other.</P>
    <P>The tone for productive all-party talks was set by President Clinton when he said in Belfast: &ldquo;Violence has no place at the table of democracy.&rdquo; This was further underlined when he said that &ldquo;engaging in honest dialogue is not an act of surrender: it is an act of strength and common sense.&rdquo; Mr. Clinton's statements during his visit were remarkable for the understanding of the issues they reflected, and laudable for their even-handed approach.  Not alone did he strike the right note, but he got the balance right as well.  The public response to his visit, both in Northern Ireland and in the Republic, proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that the majority of people on this island support <Col N="1588" /> peace and are opposed to any resumption of the armed conflict that cast a shadow over this island for a quarter of a century.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people want peace, and they want a settlement that grants equal rights to all and superior rights to none.  It is for us as politicians, in dialogue with others, to facilitate such a settlement.  Flexibility is required if we are to arrive at our common destination. Realistically, no party will get everything it wants, and the sooner all parties reconcile themselves to this reality the better.  The sooner we get the all-party posturing over and done with, the sooner we can get down to the business in hand.  Of course, some parties are more comfortable with posturing than with politics.  The prospect of a fight to the finish is more attractive to some than the challenge of a political strategy. The politics of grievance and the politics of siege are less demanding than the politics of accommodation.  Less demanding, certainly, and most definitely, less rewarding for society, in particular, the people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>This is the nature of the challenge that faces some parties at this stage of the peace process.  Real courage is called for to meet the challenge &mdash; not the courage to issue defiant statements in the dead of night, but the courage to leave the past behind and take a new approach to the future.  A new approach is necessary when we realise that Northern Ireland has been living through the most protracted conflict in modern Irish history.  This has left a mark on society that ceasefires alone cannot erase.  Trust has to be established and the hurt and anger acknowledged.  The depth of the hurt and anger was evident during the confontations in the summer, while the church and hall burnings show that sectarianism remains an unpleasant fact of life in Northern Ireland.  Time is needed to build trust.  Time will also provide the opportunity to develop and devise a new political culture in Northern Ireland, a political culture that is accommodating and inclusive, not just of different national allegiances and moral <Col N="1589" /> viewpoints, but which also advances the equality of men and women, which is committed to sustainable economic development, and which is committed to a participative democracy in place of the rigid and sectarian thinking that has held sway for so long.</P>
    <P>The joint communiqué has, in President Clinton's words, &ldquo;opened a promising new gateway to a just and lasting peace.&rdquo; The Government is determined that this promise will not be lost to intransigence or obduracy, but that it will be realised to the full.  Common sense tells us that we are embarked on a long and difficult journey.  The last thing we need is back-seat drivers telling us to take this short cut or that short cut, or we will not arrive on time.  We want everyone to play their part in removing road blocks, and in building bridges.  We want all parties to accommodate each other so that all can arrive safely at a settlement with which we can live comfortably.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Contrary to what the Taoiseach said this morning on the Order of Business, at each Whips' meeting for the last four weeks I, as Whip of my party, have requested an opportunity to discuss matters related to the peace process in a full debate and have been refused.  The original proposal in relation to this motion on the joint communiqué was that it would be taken without debate.  At our insistence the Government begrudgingly gave us a two hours debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened intently to what the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, said and was surprised, not necessarily by what he had to say &mdash; much of which I agreed with &mdash; but by what he did not say.  He did not take what was his first opportunity in this House to comment on the letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> last Saturday from the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, who wrote in trenchant terms about what happened in the discussions on decommissioning, putting on the record his recollection of what had <Col N="1590" /> occurred.  The content of the letter suggested that the former Taoiseach knew that if the issue of decommissioning had been made a pre-condition prior to the ceasefires, we would not have had peace on this island for the last 17 months.  He was quite blunt on this point and referred to the much quoted transcript of the Tánaiste's contribution in the Dáil of 15 December 1993, the afternoon of the Joint Declaration, to the effect that the establishment of a permanent cessation of violence meant the handing up of arms.  Deputy Reynolds stated that wording had not come up in prior discussion in the Government and felt the Tánaiste had changed his opinion since then.  He writes: &ldquo;In fact, he has ever since consistently and even trenchantly expressed the opposite point of view.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At another point in the letter, Deputy Reynolds wrote:</P>
    <P>In return for not insisting on such a gesture [of decommissioning, prior to the ceasefire and talks, I was assured that it was accepted by those concerned that the decommissioning of weapons... would be dealt with during the process of reaching a negotiated settlement.</P>
    <P>This goes to the core of the issue we are addressing, the twin-track approach. This side of the House welcomes the fact that the Clinton visit gave the process a new impetus which, unfortunately, had been lacking over previous months.  The visit put in place the dynamic of the twin-track approach, from which one hopes there will be no going back.  However, even since the approach was adopted, there has been some reversing of attitudes.</P>
    <P>In a way, the Clinton visit drew Sinn Féin further into the peace process, as Deputy Reynolds had done previously. When the former Taoiseach shook hands with Mr. Gerry Adams, some people suggested he had done so too soon but it had the effect of bringing Sinn Féin much further into the political process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> As he rightly pointed out, it was always the view of both the previous and present Irish Governments that a unilateral gesture on decommissioning prior to talks is neither politically nor practically realistic.  That is not to say that we on this side of the House are in any way weak on the issue of decommissioning; we have always said it is one of the major points &mdash; perhaps the most important &mdash; that must be addressed in relation to talks.  The Taoiseach was quite blunt about this at the launch of the joint communiqué two weeks ago. He said that in the opinion of him and his Government &mdash; the same opinion expressed in Deputy Reynolds's letter &mdash; it was unrealistic to expect decommissioning would take place in advance. That is the way we should proceed and the reason the twin-track approach was put in place was to examine how Sinn Féin, the Unionists and the British Government could be released from the hook on which they have unfortunately caught themselves.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if Sinn Féin participates it will, in effect, be speaking for the IRA.  I accept there may be a public divergence of views but given what happened in the run-up to the ceasefire, Sinn Féin will have the right to speak on behalf of the IRA and will be able to bring it along.  When the commission meets, one of the first things it must receive from Sinn Féin and all the parties participating on the loyalist side is an unequivocal affirmation that there will be no return to violence.  It is also necessary that a huge amount of detail on the whereabouts of all the arms caches on the island should be given. Further, as our party leader said, there are 150,000 legally held weapons in the Unionist community, not to mention the weaponry and explosives in the possession of loyalists.  There is an imbalance of emphasis on Provisional IRA armaments, when less than a year ago, my home town was subjected to letter bombs and other bombs from loyalists. Just as the prisoners' issue must be dealt <Col N="1592" /> with in an even-handed way, so must the question of disarming.</P>
    <P>Our party leader also referred to the outburst by Dr. Paisley.  While I do not wish to over-emphasise what might have been said in the heat of the moment, when arms certificates were displayed on the side of a mountain some years ago, he undoubtedly told his interviewer that the Unionist and loyalist people would use every means at their disposal and fight to the death against what they saw as the road to a united Ireland.  It is important the issue be tackled on an even-handed basis, which is why this House should encourage all parties to participate in the decommissioning process.</P>
    <P>When I questioned the Taoiseach earlier today, he seemed to think we should not ask him how other parties feel.  This side of the House has pinpointed the change of emphasis which has, unfortunately, occurred in the Ulster Unionist Party, which seems to be concentrating on the internal settlement of the detriment of the North-South link.  It suggests this may not be required any more and that the link should rather be east-west.  We support the three stranded process, as we have always done, and welcome the fact that the Government and the Tánaiste continually refer to that process.</P>
    <P>The UUP is going back on what it originally agreed &mdash; its proposal on the assembly is one aspect of that &mdash; and the Taoiseach and the Government have not been strong enough in rejecting it. They may say they cannot reject it because it would be seen to to be making pre-conditions.  I fully accept that but if greater credence is given to the view that an assembly would be possible without giving equal emphasis to the other strands, it will be detrimental to the process.  I exhort the Government to clarify its position.</P>
    <P>I agree with our party leader on paragraph 10 of the Downing Street declaration, which has been quoted verbatim by the Northern Ireland junior Minister, Mr. Ancram, and by the UUP as the condition for participation in talks.  The <Col N="1593" /> view taken by the previous Irish Government &mdash; and by the current Government until recently &mdash; was that Sinn Féin had fulfilled its requirement in that it had participated in the Forum. As said during Question Time, circumstances have changed even since the start of the Forum, whereby the British Government finally sent its representatives in the shape of its Ambassador and members of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body.  It is important to emphasise that the conditions were created and that those people participated and are, participating.</P>
    <P>I exhort the Ulster Unionist Party, in particular, to participate in the twin-track approach and to give it its full support. <i>The Belfast Telegraph</i>&mdash; which would, to a certain extent, side with it &mdash; asked that it participate in direct talks, whether in private or public, with a party such as Sinn Féin.</P>

      <P>A recent opinion poll indicated that a majority of the public reject the Sinn Féin stance on the decommissioning of IRA arms.  I fully endorse that rejection.  The two Governments, London and Dublin, have made it clear that if an agreement can be concluded they are prepared to take whatever constitutional steps are necessary to accommodate and underpin that agreement.  The IRA, however, is not prepared to take an analogus step.  We have been told for over a year that the cessation of murder cannot be described as permanent because the republican movement is, according to its constitution, obliged to retain the right at all times to resort to arms.  In other words, every other party to these discussions must be prepared to alter its constitution but the republican movement is not prepared to so do.  That fact should be on the record.</P>
      <P>I call on Sinn Féin to stop shifting its ground.  Deputy Ahern seems to have more insight into this than I do.  I would have liked the opportunity to find out more about why.  Sinn Féin told us some time ago that it could not speak for the IRA.  More recently, when the decommissioning argument seemed to be going Sinn Féin's way, it gave us to understand that it could speak on the decommissioning issue for the IRA.  In the last week, however, now that the argument seems to be going against it, Sinn Féin has reverted to saying it can speak authoritatively only for itself. Which is it to be or are we to conclude that on this, as on other issues.  Sinn Féin can only be authoritatively ambiguous?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither Sinn Féin nor the IRA has the right to require a Government to negotiate on troop levels or on the extent to which its police force is armed. No democratic government could possibly enter into an agreement to even conduct such a negotiation and no other <Col N="1595" /> democratic government should give even the most indirect demand that this be done.  That, I hasten to add, is entirely a different matter to a discussion on the brief and organisation of a police force.</P>
    <P>The spectre of a return to violence has been raised in recent weeks.  It should be made clear that some of us see through the rhetoric.  The IRA ceased its campaign of violence for one simple and obvious reason: murder was losing the political battle.  A return to murder would incur immediate and massive political losses for the IRA and their sympathisers, fellow travellers, apologists and mouth pieces, and they know that.  The question has already been raised as to whether punishment beatings are some kind of sick safety valve.</P>
    <P>The peace process would be advanced if politicians and commentators, who should know better, were to stop immediately making utterly irrelevant and spurious comparisons between the process here and recent events in Israel and South Africa.  I am sorry that I do not have the opportunity to make a more connected series of comments but I would like to feel that the views I expressed will be taken into account in the ongoing discussions.</P>

      <P>The main function of the international body chaired by Senator Mitchell is to advise on a method for a verifiable decommissioning and to report whether there is a clear commitment by those holding arms to work constructively to achieve that.  I can understand the view of paramilitary organisations reluctant to hand up their arms.  They can point to history, tradition and examples of conflict in other countries and attempt to justify their reluctance to decommission pending a political settlement.  What they cannot in any circumstances justify is the epidemic of violence giving rise to the enormous number of barbaric beatings now so much part of the scene in <Col N="1596" /> portions of Northern Ireland.  This violence is underpinned by intimidation which is reinforced by continued access to arms.  I say to the IRA, in particular, who have been involved in 159 such atrocities since the creasefire, and also to the loyalists who have been involved in a lesser number, that an end to such barbarity would be clear evidence to the international body of a commitment to decommission.  Acceptance of the rule of the law and respect for human rights will be two main pillars of any political settlement.  Those involved in punishment beatings show continued contempt for both.  Furthermore, they destroy their own credibility in that such heinous activity does not indicate a convincing commitment to exclusively democratic means in the future.</P>
      <P>The twin track proposal envisages talks with a view to bringing all parties together for substantive discussions by the end of February.  Such negotiations have no hope of success unless all parties are prepared to compromise.  I would not expect any indication of compromise at this stage.  On the other hand, it is not helpful of parties in Northern Ireland to retreat further into their traditional &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo; positions in advance of such talks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently, David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, rejected an invitation to talks in Dublin, reiterating the traditional Unionist contention that the Irish Government has no right to be involved in Northern Ireland affairs.  As mentioned in <i>The Economist</i> this week, that argument ignores the reality of Anglo-Irish relations for the past ten years which have been solidly founded on a joint approach to the shared Northern Ireland problem.  I say to David Trimble and the Ulster Unionist Party that they are in a unique position of strength at the moment in relation to the slim majority of John Major's Government in the UK, which is unlikely to continue after the next general election.  Accordingly, they are now in a position to use that strength effectively to achieve much in negotiations. However, they should remember that <Col N="1597" /> the hallmark of negotiating strength is the willingness and ability to compromise to achieve an acceptable settlement at the right time.  I suggest that now is the right time.</P>
    <P>I mentioned that I did not expect any party to compromise on its basic position in advance of substantive talks. There is another aspect of such negotiations which is of concern to me.  Any negotiations in which I have ever been involved, whether of a legal or political nature, have had their chances of success enhanced by being out of the glare of publicity.  One of the difficulties at the moment is that every meeting of consequence in relation to Northern Ireland &mdash; and not just between prime ministers &mdash; is regarded as a summit requiring statements in advance and press releases thereafter.  Such documents are parsed and analysed in a fashion which is not conducive to the achievement of effective results.</P>
    <P>A political settlement in Northern Ireland will be as a result of a long, patient pilgrimage of negotiation and not as a consequence of instant comments or sound bites for television news.  I recommend an approach to the negotiations which would permit the parties involved the space and confidentiality to reach towards one another, directly or indirectly, without prejudice to their basic position.</P>
    <P>In relation to the United Kingdom, I understand that its Government has a slim majority.  This may have certain consequences for its freedom of action. On the other hand, fortune favours the brave and, in relation to the next general election, a successful political negotiation for Northern Ireland is a worthy objective.</P>
    <P>Moves which inflame the passions of even the most moderate Irish person, whether nationalist or unionist, are not helpful.  I refer in particular to what seems to be a deliberate policy by the UK Home Secretary to effectively mistreat prisoners by denying them their rights in relation to release, transfers, medical treatment and visits.  It would be conducive to a political settlement to <Col N="1598" /> have a less reactionary approach by the UK authorities.</P>
    <P>My final message is for the Opposition, particularly Fianna Fáil, and that is that the best prospect for achieving success would be to adopt a bipartisan approach between Government and Opposition.  The Opposition, in particular Fianna Fáil, should resist the temptation to make political capital out of difficulties with the peace process.</P>

      <P>It is widely acknowledged that the visit of President Clinton gave a kick start to a peace process which had all the signs of coming to a standstill.  No other American statesman has been so well briefed on the problems that have bedevilled Anglo-Irish relations for generations.  He came, not as a partisan, but as a genuine honest broker who had already done a great deal to resolve much more complex problems in the Middle East and the former Yugoslavia.  An honest broker is generally accepted as such by both sides and is allowed to proceed with the task of trying to achieve compromise unless, of course, one of the sides happens to be the British Government who insist that the rules are altered to suit its point of view.  That is essentially what happened in this case.  In recent years Britain frequently stressed that if only agreement could be reached in Ireland it would immediately leap to add flesh to its bones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the first time in a quarter of a century I have seen the smiling faces of happy pre-Christmas shoppers in the streets of Derry and Belfast.  This has been brought about, not by any act of the British Government, but by the patient work of many people in Ireland, loyalist and Nationalist, in the past few <Col N="1599" /> years.  Most of the work was done quietly and without publicity and it eventually achieved a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and the loyalist paramilitaries in the autumn of 1994. Both groups made it clear that they meant what they said and 16 months later the guns are still silent.</P>
    <P>In the post Downing Street Declaration period I had occasion to dine with Sir Patrick Mayhew and was impressed by his interest in exploring every possible angle in seeking a resolution to the then raging conflict.  However, the inner workings of sections of the British establishment have always defied logic where Anglo-Irish relations are concerned. I do not doubt Sir Patrick's sincerity. I would give him the benefit of any niggling doubt I have and conclude that he has had to bow to the dictates of whatever mysterious office in London is in charge of throwing spanners in Anglo-Irish affairs.</P>
    <P>I have a strong feeling that Her Majesty's Government would have been much happier if President Clinton had been detained by urgent business in Washington because what he had to say in Northern Ireland did not fit with their scheme of things at this time.  The President's most notable speech was at Mackies in Belfast when he stressed that the risk-takers who had the courage to break with the past were entitled to their stake in the future.  The fact that there was only one dissenting voice to this remark among a very mixed Belfast audience speaks volumes.  However, Sir Patrick, with his colleagues in London, appears hellbent on shutting out the risk-takers for as long as possible by continuing to insist on preconditions that make no practical sense.  This was the first snub to the President.</P>
    <P>The second snub was delivered yesterday by Sir Patrick when he sought to put Senator Mitchell and his two eminent colleagues in what he regards as their proper place.  He told us he would be one of the first people to meet members of the commission when they arrived in Belfast in a few days' time. <Col N="1600" /> He also let us know exactly what he would tell them &mdash; he would remind them that they are there only in the role of advisers and that the British Government would have the final word on decommissioning.  This can only be regarded as a kick in the teeth to the Taoiseach who made it very clear that he had not agreed to the Washington 3 concept when he spoke at the recent Downing Street press conference.  Mr. Major insisted that Washington 3 was carved in stone as far as he was concerned.</P>
    <P>Last week I asked the Taoiseach if he agreed that many politicians in Northern Ireland had lost touch with their constituents in view of the extraordinary sight of 100,000 people from both traditions joined in a demand for peace. He agreed, but added that all politicians probably fall into a similar category from time to time.  In any event, it is time to heed the words of the British Telecom advertisement, &ldquo;It's good to talk&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Northern problem is about people who have a sense of belonging to one tradition or another.  It is surely possible to accommodate both by simply agreeing to the principle of honourable compromise.  Nobody has ever been killed by talking.  In the present circumstances those who refuse to talk are clearly saying that they are incapable of even considering compromise, even if it means risking the lives or well-being of children yet unborn.</P>
    <P>My party has often been accused of thinking only in terms of reclaiming the fourth green field, irrespective of the wishes of Unionists.  I dispute this by stating a few recorded facts.  During World War II, when Belfast was in flames from a massive air raid, de Valera responded without a moment's hesitation to a call for help by sending every available fire brigade over the Border.  He did not ask whether Unionists or Nationalists were in danger, nor was he concerned about the implications of breaching neutrality.  In the 1960s we had the dramatic visit by Sean Lemass to Stormont in a spontaneous <Col N="1601" /> gesture of friendship.  He was not concerned about possible accusations of betrayal by recognising the existence of a Northern Government.  At the beginning of the 1980s Charles Haughey, in negotiation with Margaret Thatcher, laid down firm guidelines which indicated that no settlement of Ireland's problems would be attempted without the consent of Unionists.  On his return to Government in 1987 he played a pivotal role in the behind-the-scenes process I have already mentioned, which was designed from the first day to remove violence as either a means or a threat from the politics of this island. His successor, Deputy Reynolds, immediately took up the torch and brought it to the stage we are at today.</P>
    <P>Those were the actions of leaders of my party and one has only to study his every word to realise that our present Leader, Deputy Ahern, is in the same mould as his distinguished predecessors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing time with me.  Like other Deputies, I am also concerned at the lack of movement in the peace process in the past 15 months.  The joint communiqué created an opportunity for political movement and President Clinton's visit created the environment for rapid political movement, which I hope will be the case.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the lack of urgency on the part of the British Government in the peace process.  I am also concerned that Strand II of the three stranded approach has been put on the back burner.  I am sure all Members would acknowledge that there cannot be a settlement of the Northern problems within the Six Counties, settlement must embrace the three strands agreed in 1981 between Margaret Thatcher and Charles Haughey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the establishment of the international body under the chairmanship of George Mitchell and hope it is successful.  However, the approach must be even handed.  We are all concerned about the amount of weapons in circulation, particularly those used to further <Col N="1602" /> political aims.  It is important that not only IRA weapons but those of loyalist paramilitaries are handed up.  I hope the international body also deals with the question of legally held weapons.  A garda station and an RUC station are located within a seven or eight mile radius of each other in my locality. While there is no uniformed armed garda in the garda station, seven or eight miles down the road in the RUC station the police are heavily armed.  In times of peace, it should not be necessary for police to be heavily armed. Their role should be community policing.</P>
    <P>Apart from President Clinton, another important visitor came here earlier this year, Vice-President de Klerk, and I attended the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation to hear him. We are all aware of the problems experienced over generations in South Africa where two communities were at war.  This resulted in anarchy.  We have watched developments during the past five years with interest, for which President Mandela and Vice-President De Klerk should be applauded.</P>
    <P>In an Irish context, Vice-President de Klerk made two significant points, the first of which was that we should not allow the momentum to slow down.  In South Africa the National Party and the ANC ensured that no obstacle was placed in the way of progress.  Unfortunately, the momentum of the peace process in Northern Ireland has been allowed to slow down during the past 15 months but follwing the visit of President Clinton, I hope it will begin to gather pace.</P>
    <P>On the question of decommissioning, Vice-President de Klerk said that while he would have liked to have done more, if he had South Africa would not have progressed to the point where it is today.  That is a significant message for everyone concerned, particularly for the British Government.  While we would all like to see the international body succeed, it is essential that all-party talks commence, in keeping with the three <Col N="1603" /> stranded approach, to negotiate a settlement to ensure that all the people living on this island can live without fear of violence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak to the motion on the joint communiqué agreed between the British and Irish Governments and congratulate the Taoiseach on this new initiative in the peace process which has restored hope, despite the many setbacks and difficulties.  I congratulate the Tánaiste and his team of officials whose unstinting work is of critical importance in moving the process forward.  The British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, also deserves to be congratulated given the delicate political situation in which he finds himself.  He has shown motivation in getting the process back on track.</P>
      <P>I agree with some of the comments about the British Government and the slowness of its response to certain issues, particularly the release of prisoners. Although progress has been made during the past year in which there has been an absence of violence, it is disappointing that it has been slow.</P>
      <P>Apart from the political talks process, changes are taking place in other areas also.  For that reason I wish to comment on the work of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, raise the question of the emergency legislation in place here and refer to the strong presentations focusing on the need for reconciliation made to the forum by a range of groups which believe that the needs of victims on all sides must be met appropriately and carefully if there is to be true reconciliation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>President Clinton's visit captured the celebration of and wish for peace, North and South.  If there was ever an example of people power, we witnessed it on the streets of Derry and Belfast two weeks ago.  The presentation by Vice-President de Klerk to the forum two weeks ago to which Deputy O'Hanlon referred has reinforced the importance of the international dimension, United States or <Col N="1604" /> South African involvement, or the involvement of key international figures. This makes a difference.  As change occurs slowly, there is a need for such figures to make an input to give us the benefit of their thinking and experience.</P>
    <P>It was extremely interesting to listen to Vice-President de Klerk speak about conflict resolution and the different processes used when the peace process in South Africa ran into difficulty.  We can learn from this.  While the same lessons cannot be learned as the problems are not the same, examining what has happened in other areas of conflict throughout the world can only prove useful.  As we are all aware, it is all too easy for the same old voices and ways to predominate and for the same stereotyped comments to be made.</P>
    <P>It was encouraging following President Clinton's visit to hear a different tone, but we then move backwards with the usual statements from the IRA and Unionist leaders.  In coming months there will be ambivalence while people will engage in the process in different ways and at a different pace.  This is inevitable, but we hope there will be movement.</P>
    <P>It is important that the reaction of a broad range of people involved in the peace process is sought.  We should hear more from women also, both within the political process and in communities. Hilary Clinton's meeting with women activists over a cup of tea in a small cafe is a powerful symbol of the contribution made by women in recent decades in the North.  The work of these women is coming to the fore, which is healthy and useful.</P>
    <P>I am privileged to have the opportunity to be involved in the forum. Sometimes the depth and breadth of its work can be lost.  The contact and constructive discussion between the different delegations, in which there is give and take, are an important marker on the road to reconciliation.  At the end of one year the benefits of this contact and confidence building can be seen.  I hope agreement is beginning to emerge on <Col N="1605" /> broad principles which will prove useful when talks get under way.</P>
    <P>More than 80 groups and 1,500 individuals have made an input to the work of the forum which is encouraging a broad spectrum of people to contribute. Compared to the work of the previous forum, the range of groups involved is much broader and there is a greater injection of contributions from the broad Unionist family.  Contributions have also been made from a more developed voluntary sector.  This shows that there is a wish for peace among a broad range of people on the island and an intolerance of those who will not get involved.</P>
    <P>The work of the forum will act as a useful reference point on the issues when talks begin.  The protection of human rights will be a core issue and the report of the forum will be a useful starting point, as will Professor Bradley's work on the potential of the island economy and the reports on the social history of the Protestant and Jewish communities and the changing demography of the country.</P>
    <P>The report of the committee of which I am a member which identifies the obstacles on the path to reconciliation in the South will challenge the Government and the public to take action on a range of issues to reinforce progress in the health and education areas where we are trying to ensure that more pluralist provision is made, to provide for constitutional change, an examination of the way our own symbols are used and acceptance of the symbols of different cultures.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision of the BBC and UTV to televise the presentation made by Vice-President de Klerk to the forum.  The response of the DUP to this decision was regrettable.  It is hard to understand how a discussion on international conflict resolution could provoke such a response.  I call on the BBC and UTV to consider televising the work of the forum in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The time is right to consider the emergency legislation here.  I have been thinking about this matter for some time <Col N="1606" /> in the context of the discussions on human rights at the forum.  I note that the Irish Council for Civil Liberties recently published a new document on this subject.  The way this emergency legislation is being applied should be assessed.</P>
    <P>The establishment of a truth commission should also be considered.  I have met relatives who have lost loved ones as a result of paramilitary violence and they are anxious that such a commission be established.  I would like the forum to consider inviting experts with experience in this area.  While there are problems with such commissions in that they are not a straightforward mechanism this proposal merits consideration.</P>
    <P>It became clear from presentations at the forum that the maintenance of peace and its extensions into permanence cannot be left to political talks alone.  It is about reconciliation at many different levels and involves all sectors of the communities.  The feelings of those who have lost families and their sense of whether justice has been done will form a critical part of real reconciliation. In that context a truth commission is something that should be considered.</P>
    <P>I regret that there is not more time for Members to contribute to this debate.  I am continually struck by the fact that there seems to be very little opportunity for many Members to contribute to debates on this issue.  It tends to be confined to party leaders and senior Front Bench spokespersons. More opportunities should be available to discuss this issue and to highlight the work we are doing in the forum and elsewhere and the experience of the British-Irish Inter-Parliamentary Body. Devoting more time to debating this issue would contribute to the process and it is something we should seek to achieve.</P>
    <P>I hope the IRA will take note of the findings of a survey announced last week that 75 per cent of people surveyed in the South said that the IRA should surrender arms as a precondition for talks.  That is a clear indicator of the <Col N="1607" /> views of people in this country.  The challenge to the IRA is to enter the democratic process, to acknowledge that it can accomplish much more on behalf of Nationalists by providing a radical new dimension to politics in Northern Ireland.  That is a hard road for its members.  The future will show whether the IRA has the genuine interests of Nationalists at heart or whether by resuming intimidation or violence it will further destroy and polarise society in the North.  If it does that, it will confirm that it serves no interests other than its own.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I share Deputy Fitzgerald's concern about the lack of adequate time to discuss this issue and the need for more Members to participate in debates such as this.  We have asked consistently for a debate on Northern Ireland for the past number of weeks.  I have no doubt that when we resume after the Christmas recess, Deputy Fitzgerald will join with us in a vote on the Order of Business to have a debate on Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>I welcome the launch of the twin track process coming as it does when the peace process has been stalled without talks for 15 months.  In particular, I support President Clinton's involvement in bringing about the breaking of the logjam.  It is a matter of regret that it took that great friend of Ireland, President Clinton, to make a European visit to London, the North and Dublin to bring about a change in attitude.  His planned visit led to a midnight press conference announcing the joint communiqué on the night prior to his arrival.  I will deal with the various faults of the joint communiqué later.  Credit must be attached to it for breaking the logjam and the fact that the twin track approach is up and running.  I publicly thank President Clinton for his involvement in that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to thank Senator Mitchell and his two colleagues who have taken on the task of dealing with the decommissioning issue.  In the short timeframe <Col N="1608" /> available to them, it is welcome that they have got down to work and I ask all sides to co-operate fully with Senator Mitchell, a good and knowledgeable friend of Ireland who has no axe to grind and will adopt an even-handed approach.  The statement issued by the IRA last weekend is regrettable, but I hope it will reconsider its position.</P>
    <P>It is important to remember that as far back as January 1994 it was accepted that decommissioning was necessary, but the peace process and peace secured at the end of August 1994 was brought about without decommissioning being a precondition for talks.  All right-thinking people in this country, and this was reflected in a recent opinion poll, would if the choice was theirs support decommissioning in advance of talks, but the reality is that the goalposts cannot be changed when the game is under way. The IRA and the Loyalists declared a peace and they have maintained it without the guns and bullets since the end of August and beginning of September 1994.  After that peace process commenced the British Government requested decommissioning as a precondition for talks.  It is a matter of regret that this rushed fudge of a communiqué announced on the night prior to President Clinton's arrival has complicated the matter further.  The last sentence of Article 3 of the communiqué indicates a new veto for Unionist parties in relation to who will participate at what stage in talks compared to paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration which made it clear that participation in talks was a matter for decision by the two Governments alone.</P>
    <P>Decommissioning must go much further than decommissioning paramilitary weapons, desirable as it would be to achieve that immediately.  It must also deal with the demilitarisation and decommissioning question of Unionist arms as well as the terrorist arms of the loyalists and the IRA.  In the Unionists hands there are many hundreds of thousands of so-called legally held weapons and they must be the subject of decommissioning also.  They must be taken out <Col N="1609" /> of the equation if peace is to prevail on this island.</P>
    <P>We must strive to achieve a position similar to that in a normal civil society in which there is a small standing army to support civilian authorities.  That can be achieved by the army in Northern Ireland.  It could have a small standing army rather than the position that prevails. Such an army could back up a mainly unarmed police force, such as the one in the Republic.  That is what we should aim to achieve and it is the approach we should adopt in dealing with the decommissioning issue.  The approach should not be single-mindedly focused on terrorist weapons, important as that issue is.</P>
    <P>On the overall question of political progress, it is a matter of regret that the reaction of the people of Belfast and Derry to President Clinton's visit, the reaction to his speech in Mackies, his visit to College Green, the Dáil and elsewhere, particularly the reaction of the hundred thousand people and more who went out on the streets of Belfast to greet him, was not reflected in the response by the leader of the Unionist Party, Mr. Trimble, to the invitation to participate in preparatory talks issued to him by the Tánaiste.  It is a matter of regret that the Unionists would appear to be reverting to Strand I, an internal solution in the North and a relationship between the North and London without recognising that achieving long-term peace on this island requires an all Ireland dimension.  That was recognised by both Governments in February of this year when they signed the Framework Document.  It set out the considered view of both Governments as to how the administration of the North would be advanced in terms of its relationship with the South and its executive functions and the relationship between the two islands, but Mr. Trimble rejected that in his insulting response to the Tánaiste.  Mr. Trimble's view is rejected not only by Government politicians but all politicians in this House.</P>
    <P>In responding to a question on the <Col N="1610" /> Framework Document in the presence of the Taoiseach today, Baroness Denton said that she saw no need for executive powers in relation to functions between the North and the South. This goes against the contents of the Framework Document.  It seems to this side of the House that the British Government and the Unionist party are happy with the peace but are not prepared to involve themselves in the type of meaningful talks that are necessary.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge, as the Tánaiste did in his contribution, that we have approached this in a bipartisan way here, allowing for constructive criticism from our side, but it has helped, as he said, in solving the problem of the North.  Bipartisanship does not mean there cannot be careful criticism.  It is absolutely essential that the Government be firm in its negotiations with all parties, but in particular with the Unionist parties, to ensure that the Irish dimension of the solution to the problems we have had on this island since partition is upheld and fought for tooth and nail.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to conclude this debate.  It is widely acknowledged that the launch of the twin track process by the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, and the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, in Downing Street on 28 November has given a new impetus to the peace process.  However, it is not correct to say the peace process was stalled for the past 15 months.  Very valuable and important work was done. It may not always have had the high profile of last week's launch of the twin track process but there has been significant discussion and networking and a number of important issues have been handled, not only by this Government but by the British Government and, indeed, Northern Ireland &mdash; issues relating to the release of prisoners here, and to the rate of remission.  Contacts were made and dialogue resumed between people who, perhaps, had not spoken to each other prior to the ceasefire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1611" /> The Joint Communiqué has been broadly welcomed.  It is seen as a means of breaking out of the recent impasse and creating a basis for real progress. We now need to build on that to secure what the Joint Communiqué seeks to achieve &mdash; the commencement, by the end of February next, of all-party negotiations directed towards a political settlement based on consent.  Both Governments are committed to achieving that objective.  The Joint Communiqué has not removed the obstacles to all-party negotiations but represents a means of transcending them.  It will require all parties to engage in all aspects of the process in a real and meaningful way.  The twin track process involves two complementary aspects, intended to establish the trust and the confidence that will be necessary to successfully launch all-party talks.  The first track involves the commencement of intensive preparatory talks to secure the launch of all-party negotiations.  They will be aimed at securing agreement on the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda for all-party negotiations for a political settlement based on consent.  Agreement will be a prerequisite to all-party negotiations and the experience of the 1991-92 talks shows the necessity for a clearly understood basis for such talks which will allow all issues to be addressed.</P>
    <P>The other element of the twin track process is the creation of an international body to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue.  That is a matter on which I, as Minister for Justice, have a special interest and in which my Department has been and will be involved in facilitating the work of the international body.</P>
    <P>The mandate of the international body is set out in the Joint Communiqué. All members recognise that its task is a very difficult one and that it arises from a seemingly intractable problem caused by differing views in various parties as to when arms decommissioning should commence.</P>
    <P>Both Governments want to see an <Col N="1612" /> end to the holding of illegal arms by paramilitary organisations in Ireland and would like to see this occur in the morning, if only that were possible. Indeed, Deputy Dukes and others referred to huge public support for the removal of arms from politics.  Republican and loyalist paramilitaries who hold weapons must take cognisance of public opinion and recognise that they can assist the process of dialogue on the political front by showing a willingness to address decommissioning in a real way. This will require a deal of trust and foresightedness on their part as well.</P>
    <P>The remit of the international body, requires it to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue.  Both Government are committed to considering, on its merits, any recommendation the international body makes.  Because of its distinguished composition, independence and international stature, any recommendation it makes will rightly be seen by most people as carrying considerable weight and moral authority.</P>
    <P>The international dimension now being introduced into the equation will, I hope point to new solutions and possibilities for building the climate of confidence and trust required to take the political momentum into all-party talks and transcend all preconditions.  I do not under-estimate the task of the international body.  The short time within which it has been asked to report will undoubtedly add to the pressures and impose a very heavy schedule of intensive consultations on it.</P>
    <P>The international body will have offices in Dublin and Belfast.  In making arrangements for its work in Dublin, great care has been taken to ensure its independent operation.  All the staff and aides employed will come from outside the public service.  The executive staff of the body will control access to the offices.  Naturally, liaison officers have been nominated in the relevant Government Departments to facilitate the work of the body in this jurisdiction and provide any assistance required.</P>
    <P>It has been agreed that operational <Col N="1613" /> costs, other than the cost of refurbishing and fitting-out office accommodation, will be borne equally by both Governments. These costs will accordingly, involve a charge on public funds.  The main costs likely to be incurred are those related to remuneration for members of the body and its staff, travel costs and expenses on hotel accommodation and subsistence.</P>
    <P>Given its operational independence and the nature of its work, it is not possible at this stage to arrive at precise estimates of the body's costs.  It appears however, that the costs which will fall to be met in 1995 are likely to be relatively small and that the bulk of the expenditure will be incurred in 1996.  Based on the information currently available on the body's work programme, a provision of £200,000 has been included in the 1996 Estimates for my Department to meet its cost.</P>
    <P>The task being undertaken by the international body is a matter of the utmost importance, not only for the two Governments and the various parties but for all who are interested in consolidating progress towards lasting peace. We saw that interest in consolidating the progress today in this debate.  The fundamental aim of the twin track process is to consolidate and advance progress towards inclusive dialogue and, with it, lasting peace in Ireland.</P>
    <P>On this note, consolidation of the peace which we all so dearly value, it is appropriate that I should address some remarks directly to the organisations who hold arms illegally and whose co-operation is essential if arms are to be removed from the political equation in Ireland.  They are not being asked to surrender.  We ask them to recognise, that their fellow citizens deeply value peace but that they are concerned for its fragility and will continue to be so concerned until they know, for certain, that those who now hold arms will not resort to their use again as a means of advancing political objectives.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to punishment beatings and threats of intimidation. These actions are not acceptable <Col N="1614" /> to people seeking peace and they must be brought to an end.  Apart from the pain and suffering caused, they add to the concerns to fellow citizens about the fragility of the peace process.  We must ensure that these actions are brought to an end so as to create the climate of trust which will enable progress to be made.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest gifts the paramilitary organisations could bestow on their fellow citizens is to co-operate directly or indirectly with the work of the international body.  Deputies Ahern and Harney and others have urged the republicans and loyalists to take hold of this opportunity, to co-operate with the body and to make submissions.  I welcome the announcement by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats that they will make submissions to the body tomorrow.  It is important that those organisations avail of the opportunity to discuss their views with the international body in tandem with the intensive and proactive approach in the political track.  I hope the aim of inclusive, round table negotiations on Northern Ireland will eventually be realised.</P>
    <P>I thank all the Deputies who participated in the debate.  Some of them referred to the time made available for it.  I would remind them that this issue can be raised during questions to the Taoiseach every Tuesday and Wednesday.  I am glad time has been made available today for a debate on this very important international body.</P>

    <Title>Milk (Regulation of Supply) (Amendment) Bill, 1995: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates) Ivan Yates">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry (Mr. Yates)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for a small but necessary technical amendment to the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Act, 1994, which provided for <Col N="1615" /> the abolition of the Cork and the Dublin District Milk Boards and their replacement by a new National Milk Agency to regulate the supply of milk for liquid consumption throughout the State.  It also paved the way for the sale of the milk boards' ancillary businessess and made provision for the protection of staff interests in this context.</P>
    <P>I would like to make it clear that this Act has worked very well since its implementation in late October 1994.  In mid-November of that year, as part of a staff rationalisation programme preparatory to the sale of the ancillary businesses, some 50 staff were granted voluntary early retirement on terms analogous to those which applied in the public service generally in the 1987-88 period.</P>
    <P>On 5 December an interim board was established to oversee the management of the ancillary businesses and to make arrangements for their sale.  On 30 December last the milk boards were abolished and the National Milk Agency came into being.  In late April and early May of this year the former milk boards' ancillary businesses were sold as going concerns and, on the sales, some 80 staff were transferred to the private sector as employees of the new owners.</P>
    <P>The new National Milk Agency is composed of a part-time chairman and 12 ordinary members.  In accordance with the terms of the Act, the membership includes representatives of milk producers, processors, distributors, retailers and consumers.  The first members of the agency were appointed by the then Minister on the nomination of interest groups for each category of member.  Of the 12, five were producers' representatives, four were representatives of the processors, while consumer, retainer and distributor interests nominated one appointee each.</P>
    <P>Milk deliveries in general follow a highly seasonal pattern.  The peak to trough ratio for manufacturing milk stands currently at approximately 6:1. <Col N="1616" /> The domestic drinking milk market represents in the region of 10 per cent of the total milk produced.  It is an industry which clearly must be supplied all year round and so has evolved a different pricing structure to compensate producers for the higher costs entailed in winter milk production.  The purpose of the agency is to regulate the market in such a way that the consumer is guaranteed fresh drinking milk throughout the year.</P>
    <P>The mechanism by which the agency regulates the supply of milk for liquid consumption involves the registration of all producers of milk for the preparation of drinking milk, of all drinking milk pasteurisers and of the contracts made between them for the supply of milk. With limited exceptions, the Act makes it an offence to sell milk for liquid consumption unless it is prepared from a raw milk produced under a registered contract.</P>
    <P>While the Act provides that the first producer representatives shall be appointed by the Minister on the nomination of producer interests, it goes on to state that &ldquo;in the year of establishment of the Agency&rdquo; the Minister must appoint a day for the election of producer representatives and prescribe the manner of election.  All producers who are registered with the agency on the first day of the month before that in which the election takes place are eligible to vote in this election.  The persons elected must be registered with the agency in order to hold their place as producer representatives.  This provision is, of course, based on the assumption that, in its first few months of operations, the agency will establish a comprehensive register of producers. However, due to start-up difficulties outside the control of the agency, it has not proved possible to register the vast majority of producers in the time available.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, it has not been possible to conduct a legitimate election of producer representatives within the time scale envisaged by the Act.  The most sensible and practical way to regularise <Col N="1617" /> this was to amend the Act to provide that the existing representatives should continue to hold office until sufficient producers are registered to facilitate the holding of an election as provided for under the Act.  Both farming organisations have requested the amendment in order to allow the impasse to be resolved.</P>
    <P>The Act also provides that &ldquo;in the year of establishment of the Agency&rdquo; the Minister shall again appoint processor, distributor, retailer and consumer representatives on the nomination of the relevant interest groups. At this stage the processor representatives must be processors who are registered with the agency.  However, because of the difficulties I mentioned, there were so few processors registered it was impossible to obtain a sufficient number of valid nominations to fill the number of places available for processors in the agency.</P>
    <P>Obviously it is necessary to effect an amendment in relation to the appointment of processor representatives similar to that applicable to the election of producers.  In the circumstances, it is considered highly desirable that the appointment of the other three members should be synchronised with that of the producers and processors, as was always envisaged by the Act.</P>
    <P>It is not proposed to go beyond making the minimum necessary amendment to the Act to allow for deferred elections and appointments to the agency. The agency has been in existence for less than a year and it was set up after widespread and detailed consultation with the dairy sector.  Consultation also took place with the EU Commission before its establishment.  It would not, therefore, be prudent nor do I intend to propose any policy changes to the arrangements now in place.  Accordingly, it is proposed to effect a slight technical amendment to the Act which will provide that the election of producer members and the appointment of all other members should take place not in &ldquo;the year of establishment of the Agency&rdquo; as provided for at present but <Col N="1618" /> as soon as may be practicable in 1996. The Bill has been framed to give effect to this amendment and I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>My party supports this Bill and understands why it has to be introduced before the end of the calendar year.  In October 1994 the then Minister, Deputy Joe Walsh, introduced the Milk (Regulation of Supply) Bill whose main function was to set up the National Milk Agency.  The role of the agency was to ensure that a reliable supply of good quality reasonably priced milk was available to consumers throughout the year.  Its other, but no less important, function was to ensure that liquid milk producers received adequate compensation given the seasonality of production and the need to ensure year-round milk supplies.  The agency was to have a part-time chairman appointed by the Minister and representatives of milk producers, pasteurisers, distributors, retailers and consumers.  The main legislation introduced by the Fianna Fáil-Labour Government last year was supported by the Fine Gael spokesperson on Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Doyle.  The general policy issues underlying the legislation has been the subject of substantial cross party agreement, as has been mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Act, producers and processors are due to sign contracts.  The agency put considerable work into the production of a model contract, acceptable to all parties, which was circulated to dairies in August of this year with negotiations starting immediately with producer groups.  A substantial amount of time was needed to allow producers to negotiate with processors the detail of supply contracts, of which few producer groups had any prior experience.  I recognise that the development of the agency is at a delicate stage.  It is imperative to finalise all supply arrangements so that the agency plays its full role.  However, there is no point in rushing matters now, when with an extra few months at their <Col N="1619" /> disposal, all parties could arrive at an amicable resolution of their own affairs.</P>
    <P>The board of the National Milk Agency comprises five producer and four processor representatives as well as one representative each of distributors, consumers and retailers.  The five producer representatives were nominated by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry earlier this year and were to be replaced by democratically elected representatives by the end of 1995. Because of the delays in negotiating supply contracts between producers and processors, the election date of 22 November 1995 set by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, has proved impossible to keep. Hopefully, he will not find it difficult to have matters resolved before we reach the next date set for the elections.</P>
    <P>The register of contracted producers who constitute the electorate was set up as recently as 1 October last.  On 1 November 1995 only about 40 producers were registered out of an estimated 5,000 liquid milk producers &mdash; progress is slow.  Clearly, an election for the producers' representative in 1995 would offer no democratic guarantees and could be challenged by disenfranchised producers.  I am satisfied that postponement of the election to 1996 is a practical and reasonable response in the prevailing circumstances.</P>
    <P>Up to 10 per cent of all milk produced is for the domestic liquid milk market. There are approximately 40 pasteurising dairies, 5,000 people employed and 4,500 farmers supplying these dairies at an annualised value of £300 million.  It is not an insignificant economic activity. We take for granted the proper distribution and availability throughout the year of such a basic foodstuff as milk.</P>
    <P>I was interested to learn from reading previous debates that our consumption of milk <i>per capita</i> is the highest in the European Union &mdash; I think the New Zealanders are the only people with higher milk consumption in the developed world.  This shows that milk is widely used by people in all income <Col N="1620" /> brackets.  A household survey conducted by the CSO showed that expenditure on milk accounts for 11 per cent or 12 per cent of the weekly household budget &mdash; which is not an insignificant amount of money and this shows how vital a product it is.</P>
    <P>Because the Cork and Dublin district milk boards were deemed to be incompatible with European Union regulations the Government, in consultation with the Commission, came up with the proposal for the National Milk Agency. It is important to know how it is working at this stage.  A levy of just under 1p per gallon was payable under the old arrangements and I would be interested to know the amount payable now.  It was indicated at the enactment of the 1994 legislation that the levy would be considerably less due to the reduced cost structure of this new agency as many staff resigned voluntarily or were reemployed by purchasers of subsidiaries of the district milk boards.</P>
    <P>As and from September 1994 up to 60 per cent grant aid is available for building works and dairy equipment for those who want to provide on farm dairy facilities.  Obviously, this was introduced because of the higher hygiene standards required under various EU directives and milk directives in Ireland.  Many producers who supplied the local town or village throughout the country have gone out of business.  I would be interested to learn the number who have availed of the grant scheme to provide on farm dairy facilities &mdash; presumably for the purpose of being able to continue in business.  Perhaps the Minister will respond to those points in his reply.</P>
    <P>We accept the necessity for this Bill. It shows the difficulties that arise when the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry puts a time limit of 12 months on itself and I am sure it is the last time we will see elections to a board in the year of establishment of an agency on the basis that it is difficult to foresee the delays that might be involved.  In fairness, the 1994 Act has been a success.  I commend all those <Col N="1621" /> who worked on that legislation, but that is no criticism of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The original Bill regulating the supply of milk introduced in October 1994 was welcomed by the Progressive Democrats Party.  As we said then, the Dublin and Cork district milk boards did an excellent job in regulating the liquid milk industry.  However, the way in which they operated was seen as unfair to dairy farmers outside their catchment area and they fell foul of EC competition rules.  The EU decision gave rise to the need for a new body to take over the functions of the district boards and the National Milk Agency came into being.</P>
      <P>A key function of the agency is to ensure that those involved in liquid milk production are adequately compensated for their efforts and that liquid milk continues to command a premium price over milk supplied for manufacturing. Those who know anything about dairy farming realise there is a world of difference between producing for the manufacturing industry and the production of milk on a year round basis for the liquid milk trade.  The two forms of milk production are so different in terms of time, effort and investment involved that they can almost be considered as two separate industries.  Substantial additional costs are incurred in producing liquid milk.  It is right that this should be reflected in the premium price paid to farmers, as it ensures that they put in the necessary effort and investment to ensure a reliable year round supply of high quality drinking milk.  The former district boards fulfilled a useful role in this regard as they operated a system of quality assurance at producer level which laid down demanding standards for all farmers supplying the liquid trade.  The indications are that the National Milk Agency is ensuring continuity in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the time of its establishment all appointments to the National Milk Agency were made by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  This Bill seeks to amend the original Act in <Col N="1622" /> two ways.  First, it provides for the holding of elections among producers to enable them to select their representatives on the agency and, second, for the various other interested parties in the milk industry &mdash; processors, distributors, retailers and consumers &mdash; to submit nominations to the Minister for appointment as members of the agency. Once implemented, we shall have a national milk agency which will be truly representative of all those with an interest in the liquid milk industry.  On the matter of the election of producer representatives, I understand that a full register of producers is not yet available and it would be wrong to hold such an election until a full and accurate register is available.  Accordingly, I look forward to direct elections in which producer representatives can take part some time in 1996.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies Cowen and Keogh for their support of the Bill and their co-operation in taking it at such short notice.  They raised a number of queries on the progress made by the agency since its establishment about which I should like to give the House some details.</P>
      <P>The inaugural meeting of the agency was held on 23 February 1995 and it met on 13 occasions since.  It has a small staff, located in the Teagasc head office on Sandymount Avenue, Dublin 4.  In accordance with the Department's agreement with SIPTU, all staff were recruited from among those of the former milk boards, with the exception of the chief executive, who was recruited by the agency itself and took up duty on 10 July 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to Deputy Cowen's question about the levy, this came into force under Statutory Instrument 253 of 1995, which placed a levy of one-tenth of a penny per litre on all milk produced for liquid milk consumption from 1 October 1995.  The levy is payable on the 28th day of the month following the end of the accounting period which, in this case, is 28 November 1995.  To date <Col N="1623" /> some £387.69 only has been collected. The agency applied for and was given ministerial approval to borrow £100,000 to cover its running costs until levy receipts stabilise.  The annual levy income for the first year should be about £500,000, to take account of establishment costs, reducing to £350,000 in subsequent years when the levy will be reduced to 0.07 pence per litre.</P>
    <P>On the registration of contracts, the agency circulated a model contract in August last to facilitate processors to comply with the provisions of the Act. Some processors adopted that contract while others drafted their own.  Some processors had operated a similar system under the Dublin District Milk Board and, accordingly, were familiar with the concept of registering contracts; others were not, so that a considerable degree of explanation and consultation was necessary and continues.</P>
    <P>On the voluntary staff retirement package in mid-November, some 50 staff in Cork and Dublin were granted voluntary early retirement, those boards having previously become overstaffed, they were losing money.  This facilitated the sale of ancillary business which the interim board oversaw.  In late April last the ancillary business of the former Dublin District Milk Board was sold to Progressive Genetics Co-Operative Limited comprising milk producer representatives on the former board.  In early May the former Cork board business was sold to Pendine Investments Limited, a company in which Progressive Genetics and the South Western Cattle Breeders' Co-Operative and Dairygold each hold a one-third stake.  On the completion of these sales approximately 80 staff who had remained after the rationalisation programme of the previous November moved from public to private sector employment.  So far these sales have gone very smoothly apart from a few outstanding issues.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the election will not be delayed any longer than <Col N="1624" /> necessary.  I am confident it will be held as early as possible in 1996.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Hepatitis C Victims: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn on Tuesday, 12 December 1995:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the commitment given in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to pay fair compensation to those infected with Hepatitis C, condemns the Government for its failure to establish a statutory tribunal to deal with Hepatitis C; recognises that the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal falls short of meeting the needs of those infected, has been rejected by the groups acting on behalf of victims and fails to deal with serious issues such as the right of appeal and the loss of medical records; and calls on the Government to introduce legislation as a matter of urgency to establish a tribunal on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann, being of the view that&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  the amended scheme of compensation published by the Minister for Health on 1st December <Col N="1625" /> 1995, which will continue indefinitely as an alternative to court proceedings will serve the best interests of persons who have contracted Hepatitis C from Human Immunoglobulin Anti-D, blood transfusion or other blood products; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  the proposals set out in the Health Care Document published by the Minister for Health on 1st December 1995, in relation to the long-term health care needs of persons diagnosed positive for Hepatitis C provide statutory guarantees in respect of the future provision of health care services,</P>
    <P>approves the amended scheme of compensation and the Health Care Document published by the Minister for Health on 1 December 1995, copies of which have been sent to each Deputy and placed in the Dáil Library on 11 December 1995.&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to share my remaining time with Deputy McDaid. The hepatitis C problem should never have arisen.  It was caused by contamination of products from the Blood Transfusion Service and subsequently blood transfusions with contaminated viral entity in blood.</P>
      <P>The Minister has taken steps since to take the product off the market and set up numerous entities to solve the problem.  Initially he established an identity process to see how many people were affected with hepatitis C.  From there he went on to see what treatment was available, and organised treatment at GP level, at hospitals and at tertiary centres.  That has progressed quite well. Nevertheless the people involved, Positive Action and Transfusion Positive, are not happy with the progress or with the fact that the Minister is only setting up an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal rather than a statutorily based one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1626" /> The problem is that we do knot now what will happen in the future to the women, men and children who are affected.  Some people will be positive because they had hepatitis C, some will have active viraemia or develop chronic active hepatitis, severe hepatitis, in-stage hepatitis, and some people will require liver transplantation.  These people are not interested primarily in compensation <i>per se.</i> What they want is a continuum of care for as long as it is required.  They are worried that the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal will not give them that guarantee.  The Minister moved the goal posts at various stages, and has improved on his starting position. Nevertheless they are still worried.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMcDaid" hpid="Dr. McDaid Dr. McDaid">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McDaid</NameTxt>
      <P>The outbreak of hepatitis C is one of the recurring nightmares experienced from time to time by most people who have anything to do with the practice of medicine.  Like most professions today, medicine has been greatly enhanced by the addition of high technology to its resources.  However, it is also a science which depends more than most on the application of human resources.  Therefore, it is also one which is subject to human error, and sometimes what might appear to be a small error either in the performance of physical duties or in the correct keeping of records can start a chain reaction which could eventually result in something like the hepatitis C tragedy which is the subject of this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a general rule, someone who makes a genuine error on a rare occasion can be forgiven provided he or she, on realising the mistake, does everything possible to minimise the consequences. This did not occur in the present case.  We are talking here about a State agency which showed itself to be appallingly negligent by ignoring a written warning from Middlesex Hospital that alerted it to the dangers.  This letter was apparently acknowledged when it was received in December 1991, but no further action was taken until almost three years later.  It should be remembered that the warning letter concerned <Col N="1627" /> tests carried out in the Middlesex Hospital on samples which were still in the archives from the time in 1977 when women who had received anti-D Immunoglobulin developed clinical jaundice. These samples at the same time tested negative to hepatitis B which was an indication in itself.  The samples were reclaimed until a new test for hepatitis C was developed in 1991.  The condition had only been first recognised two years earlier, but no reliable test had been available.</P>
    <P>The negligence was in ignoring the warning letter from the Middlesex Hospital in 1991.  The result was that almost three years were lost not just through negligence but through gross negligence.  As was pointed out by my party's Health spokesperson, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, the senior management who were ultimately responsible were rewarded with golden handshakes on being asked to leave.</P>
    <P>I can well understand the dilemma in which the Minister finds himself.  He naturally shudders at the prospect of a repeat of something like the beef tribunal with all its fiscal consequences, mostly in enormous legal fees. However, when I received a letter from the Department last week one line caught my attention immediately.  That line described the proposed tribunal as one which &ldquo;will assess compensation on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis&rdquo; for the victims of the Blood Transfusion Board's negligence. This is, in effect, saying to all these unfortunately people, &ldquo;we are not to blame, nobody is to blame but we will give you a few quid out of the generosity of our hearts.  Are we not leaving ourselves open to legal action further down the road?  I am not a legal expert but I will be surprised if the State does not find itself in the courts on a very sticky wicket on this issue.</P>
    <P>The programme for Government includes a commitment to fair compensation. In the eyes of the law who decides what is fair compensation? When the money is distributed I hope the Minister will categorise patients <Col N="1628" /> according to need.  Some patients had renal transplants and received blood transfusions.  Their condition worsened as a result of receiving contaminated blood and they contracted hepatitis C. Such patients should be the first to be compensated as they have borne the burden of extra medical expenses.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputies Fitzgerald, Shatter, Shortall and Lynch.  We are debating the future of women who have been infected with the potentially life threatening hepatitis C virus through contaminated anti-D.  These women and their families know the nightmare behind the newspaper headlines of February 1994 and must live with the results of the contamination whatever they may be.  I have spoken to some of the women and they tell their story effectively.  It is a sad story of suffering, isolation, frustration, desperation, ill health and uncertainty. My deepest regret is that agreement on full and fair compensation for these women should be the subject of debate in the House.  They have suffered enough and should not have to listen to a debate on their future.</P>
      <P>Sadly agreement has not been reached between Positive Action and the Minister for Health on the payment of compensation.  It is hard to know who to blame.  Positive Action must at all costs protect their future and well being and the Minister trusts that what he proposes is in the best interests of all involved.  I acknowledge that he has encompassed many of the requests made by Positive Action in his proposals to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand there are four outstanding issues on which agreement has not been reached.  One is the provisional awards.  Positive Action believes they should be at the discretion of the claimant whereas the Minister proposes they should be at the discretion of the tribunal. Positive Action is rightly concerned about whether the proposed scheme is intended to be long-term.  It debates how much it can trust the words &ldquo;indefinite tribunal&rdquo;.  It argues that the <Col N="1629" /> proposal should include the right to compel witnesses to attend and secure documents.  However, that is not included.  It is disappointed that the decisions of the tribunal are open to judicial review only.</P>
    <P>Following the debate I hope the Minister will have further consultation with Positive Action and that agreement can be reached on the outstanding matters. The fears and concerns of those involved should be met where possible. I would be satisfied if the Minister agreed to meet representatives of Positive Action again to see if there is any way he could accede to the requests of this serious and hard working group. The debate will be worthwhile if negotiations continue between the Minister and Positive Action.  I am hopeful that agreement can be reached on the few outstanding issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Ahearn's comments.  One of my abiding memories of this health care scandal is being in a room with 700 women who invited a consultant from England to speak to them on the prognosis for their future.  He asked how many of the women present had had a lung biopsy. A large number of women indicated they had such a procedure.  As I drove him to the station afterwards he spoke of his shock at the number of women who had to undergo this difficult and invasive procedure.</P>
      <P>I am not surprised that those in Positive Action and other groups are so tenacious and determined to ensure they get the health care they need because of the uncertainties that surround themselves and their families.  I congratulate it on its work which most of us followed closely.  We know how it lobbied so effectively and informed and supported its members.  I know from talking with representatives of the group that they feel the health care package which has evolved is a good one and deals with the various elements they were concerned with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is concerned to provide proper health care services and fair <Col N="1630" /> compensation.  Following the discussions that have taken place between the Department of Health and the women's representatives the services are broadly based and cover all aspects of health care including counselling.</P>
    <P>Positive Action is now focusing its concern on some of the conditions attaching to the tribunal rather than on whether it is statutory based.  There is a fear there may be a tendency within the tribunal to give lump sum awards even if this is not what the claimant wants. Positive Action believes the women and their families will not receive the same protection as they could if the claimant had more power over the acceptance of the award.</P>
    <P>I understand that anxiety but I am not sure how a tribunal such as this would work, although I know its terms are spelled out.  I hope the tribunal being set up will meet those concerns.  I expect it would be responsive to the concerns and medical needs of the women appearing before it.</P>
    <P>I know representatives of the groups accept that if the terms can be worked out properly a tribunal is the right course to take.  It is speedier and more informal; it should have the flexibility and privacy demanded; negligence need not be proved; the right of court action is completely preserved unless and until an award is accepted and proceedings before the tribunal are not excluded from judicial review.</P>
    <P>Following meetings between the Department and the Minister and Positive Action and Transfusion Positive the amended compensation scheme has taken many of the concerns into account.  However, there are three or four outstanding matters.  The Minister has outlined the terms of the tribunal but is there flexibility?  It appears that the statutory element is not the key issue but rather the ways in which the tribunal will work.  It is hard to be sure of some of these matters in advance of the operation of the tribunal, which is a <Col N="1631" /> concern of the groups.  I join my colleague, Deputy Theresa Ahern, in saying that I hope there is room for flexibility and further discussion to deal with the few clear and well argued points put forward by the groups.</P>
    <P>I am pleased with the comprehensive health care package that has been arrived at.  If the tribunal can be agreed and the women are satisfied they will get what they need from the tribunal, it is the best course of action.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not repeat the points already made.  The State has a profund duty to all those who have suffered as a result of the use of contaminated blood products to ensure that adequate compensation is fully and promptly paid and that all medical treatments and supports required are provided on a continuing basis.</P>
      <P>Concern has been expressed that the tribunal is not on a statutory basis.  I am not unduly concerned about that and I reassure people not to be concerned about it for one basic reason.  There is often contention in this House on different issues.  I do not criticise Fianna Fáil for tabling a motion on this issue.  As the deliberations on how to tackle this major problem in the interests of those affected are coming to a conclusion and as the tribunal is being formed, it is only proper to debate the issues in the House.</P>
      <P>Members on all sides express a concern and an identity of intent to ensure compensation is fully paid and proper medical care and supports provided.  No matter what the future political complexion of this House that will remain the position.  I do not believe any political party or any Member will renege on that commitment.  I see an advantage in establishing a tribunal on an informal basis without the panoply of a statutory provision which could result in further months passing before the necessary structures are put in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a great concern about the issue of provisional awards.  As a lawyer who is familiar with how the courts <Col N="1632" /> work I am aware that when someone seeks damages as a result of a wrong done to them by the State or an individual the courts normally make a final decision and a sum of money is ordered to be paid on the basis of the injuries known to have been suffered.  There is no provision in our ordinary civil law system for provisional awards.  In the tragic and unique circumstances in which many people now find themselves it is essential to have a structure which allows for making provisional awards.</P>
    <P>In the Minister's scheme the applicant seeking an award can first choose whether they want a final or provisional award.  If they opt for a provisional award I understand the concern that it remains at the discretion of the person adjudicating to determine whether an award is provisional or final.  However, in the context of the medical difficulties and uncertainties involved in this area, I would find it almost incredible that any person appointed to such a tribunal when asked to make a provisional award would do anything other than make a provisional award.  I would find it difficult to see anybody adjudicating and reaching a decision that they now know the full prognosis of the implications and that a final award can be made.  I do not believe there is a doctor in or outside this country who will give evidence to the tribunal that there is no need with regard to any particular individual to keep in place the possibility of reviewing the original award.</P>
    <P>I understand the concerns in this regard but looking at the manner in which this should work and the way I believe it will work in practice, if someone asks for a once-off overall compensation payment that is the award the tribunal will make.  If they ask for a provisional award it will take something extraordinary for the tribunal to decide anything other than it will simply make a provisional award.</P>
    <P>The State has a profound duty to all those who have suffered as a result of use of contaminated blood products. After lengthy discussions between those affected and the Minister we are putting <Col N="1633" /> in place structures that will seek to provide for compensation and supports. However, one matter has not been dealt with, which should have been dealt with and which will have to be addressed. What happened in this instance is a national scandal.  The use of contaminated blood products at a time when it was not known they were contaminated is understandable.  However, to continue to distribute them and put people at risk for a period after it has become known the blood products are contaminated is scandalous beyond comprehension.</P>
    <P>In countries such as Spain and France criminal law would have been invoked in such circumstances.  Those guilty of such criminal negligence or those against whom such criminal negligence could be alleged would find themselves prosecuted through the court system and at risk of being jailed.  It is not good enough that servants of the State who are given a sacred trust to ensure the safety of our medical system can get away with this act of gross negligence, walk away from it and be at no personal risk.  We have seen it in other areas of our national life and this lesson should have been learned before this tragedy.</P>
    <P>If we put in place the measures so badly needed to assist those who have been affected there is other business left to be done.  It is time for the House to enact legislation to ensure that any person acting in a public capacity as a servant of the State, in a State body or a Government Department, who behaves in a manner so grossly negligent as to affect the lives and health of other people should find themselves at risk of criminal prosecution and imprisonment.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that the Director of Public Prosecutions has not seen fit to look into the report on the background to what occurred and to consider whether in the context of our legal system there is a form of prosecution which could be brought.  In the absence of statutory provision we should not take the view that prosecution is impossible. The Government should ask the DPP and the Office of the Attorney General <Col N="1634" /> to look into the matter further and I would like to see some development.  If the response from the Office of the Attorney General is that it is not possible within current law, the Department of Health, the Department of Justice or the Office of the Attorney General must ensure that if tragedies of this nature occur, our Statute Book contains a criminal law which will bring those responsible to justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoisinShortall" hpid="Ms Shortall Ms Shortall">
      <NameTxt>Ms Shortall</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion. The development of hepatitis by any person is a serious matter but to develop it as a result of treatment provided by the State compounds even further the problem and the misery involved.  The most important issue to be dealt with when circumstances such as these arise is to ensure that they do not recur.  I congratulate the Minister and his Department for the speed with which the product was withdrawn and a virally inactivated anti-D product was distributed to hospitals.  The Minister has also committed himself to ongoing research by the Health Research Board into the effects of hepatitis C on those who have contracted it through anti-D. I assume the results of this work will be made readily available to the public, given the provision allowed for within the compensation scheme to make provisional awards to claimants.</P>
      <P>The issue which now arises is how to deal with the problems facing the women who through no fault of their own have contracted this disease.  The response can be roughly divided into two categories &mdash; health care and compensation &mdash; and I am satisfied with both aspects of this approach.  In particular, I welcome the Government's open approach to the award of compensation where, in the strict legal sense, there is some doubt as to whether negligence can be proven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased the Minister has recognised that the responsibility of the State to its citizens has a moral dimension. Ultimately, whether it was aware of it or whether it was even feasible to be <Col N="1635" /> aware of it, the State is the agency by which these women have contracted this virus.  While the numbers involved represent a small proportion of the women who received anti-D, each case represents a personal disaster for that woman and her family.</P>
    <P>The response of the Government to the health requirements of those in this unfortunate situation in terms of primary and secondary health care services has been comprehensive and clear. Those affected are entitled to no less from the State.  I am pleased also that this treatment will be the subject of continuous assessment by the monitoring board to be established before the end of the year.  The long-term consequences of hepatitis C are uncertain so it is essential that the requirements of those infected be kept under review and appropriate responses be determined.</P>
    <P>In addition to the obvious medical requirements of those suffering from the hepatitis C virus, I welcome the fact that counselling services will be part and parcel of the overall package of services to be provided.  All sufferers of serious illnesses experience extreme mental anguish at their fate, yet I imagine that the sense of anguish is exacerbated in this case where the conditions has been contracted by way of a medically administered process.</P>
    <P>It is somewhat ironic that Fianna Fáil should feel so passionately about the issue of compensation.  There was a time when one would not have been surprised to see the Government disclaim any responsibility in an area like this.  It is only six years since a Fianna Fáil Government unnecessarily precipitated a general election when defeated in the Dáil on the issue of compensation payable to haemophiliacs who had contracted the HIV virus.  Their view, even at that stage, contrasted with the approach taken by the Coalition Government of 1982 to 1987, of which my party was a member, to the disaster at the Stardust nightclub.  I am glad to see the current Government has confirmed that <Col N="1636" /> approach as the appropriate one to take in situations of this kind.</P>
    <P>As Members are aware, the Minister has not acted unilaterally on this issue. The latest draft of the compensation scheme published by the Minister is the result of extensive negotiations between himself and interested parties.  This is by no means a ministerial diktat.  The Minister, in his contribution last night, set out the advantages of a tribunal without statutory powers.  The principal attraction of this scheme is the speed, flexibility and privacy it can bring to its task. Our experience with statutory tribunals in this regard has not been exemplary. Do we seriously wish to engage ourselves in the kind of legal complexities, not to mention huge costs, which have dominated other tribunals?</P>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, statutory tribunals need not be any more permanent than others.  The right of access to the courts, either by way of enforcement action or judicial review, should be sufficient to assuage concerns in this regard.  There are a number of other reasons why the compensation scheme published by the Minister commends itself.  For example, claimants under the scheme are not obliged to waive their right to legal action upon their application to the tribunal.  It is also important that the tribunal has been empowered to make provisional awards, a remedy of particular relevance in this area and one not available to claimants were they to pursue legal action in the courts.  If these measures were not included in the Minister's scheme my attitude to it might be quite different.</P>
    <P>A number of concerns have been raised by interested bodies namely Positive Action and Transfusion Positive, which are partly addressed by the amendments tabled by the Progressive Democrats.  Contrary to the impression given by the Progressive Democrats amendment, oral evidence is not precluded by the tribunal's terms of reference. While it is true to say that the tribunal will usually deal with written medical reports a practice common in the courts, provision exists for oral <Col N="1637" /> medical evidence to be given.  This too should work to the advantage of the climant as it appears from the terms of the scheme that oral evidence will only be requested if there is some dispute about the granting of compensation.  By definition then, oral evidence will be given in the interest of the claimant.</P>
    <P>From my reading of the scheme, the nature of the climant's application-either for a provisional or a lump sum award &mdash; is not determined by the tribunal. Section 11 of the scheme states quite clearly that it is up to the claimant to apply for either a lump sum award or a provisional payment.  It is also possible that, in advance of hearing any particular claim, the claimant can change the nature of the application with the tribunal's consent.</P>
    <P>On the matter of judicial review, I welcome the fact that the Minister has limited his own powers to amend the scheme.  Any change to the scheme which claimants perceive to have damaged their position can be subject to judicial review.  I hope such a measure will prove to be precautionary and given the open manner in which the Minister has approached this issue to date, I am confident that will remain the case.  By its nature, this issue is emotive and consequently, it is difficult to deal with it.  Nevertheless, I believe the Minister's proposals are balanced and fair and I support his amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend my colleague, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, for placing this matter before the House and calling for legislation as a matter of urgency to establish a statutory tribunal. I note the Minister's statement of his commitment to fair compensation and to meeting the long-term health care needs of those who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or <Col N="1638" /> blood product.  The Minister has recognised that there are long-term health consequences arising from hepatitis C and his health care programme, outlined in the House last night, is welcome.  I substantially agree with the Minister that the primary and secondary health care services, which are now clearly set out, show the openness and generosity of spirit with which he has addressed this problem, recognising that he had to respond to a most difficult situation.</P>
      <P>While I do not have a medical background, the documentation issued by the Minister dealing with primary and secondary care aspects seems comprehensive. I ask the Minister to be flexible in responding to any additional needs suggested by Positive Action or Transfusion Positive and those which may be identified in the normal way on an ongoing basis as the full impact of these services are brought to bear on the group of persons affected.</P>
      <P>Legislative arrangements have been approved by Cabinet to give effect to this comprehensive package.  Some of the ingredients of the health care package can be provided under existing legislative or regulatory frameworks and even some <i>ad hoc</i> services provided to the public at present are intended to be offered to the affected hepatitis C group on a statutory basis.  This legislation should receive an easy passage through this House but if our party feels that it does not go far enough, then suitable amendments will be suggested.  It will extend a permanency to what I consider to be as important as the question of compensation, namely the day to day health care of the large group of women, their partners and children identified under the programme as having been affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that substantial progress has been made since this first came into the public domain.  The fact that, at present, <i>ad hoc</i> treatment is being given a statutory framework has substantially won the support of the groups representing the people affected.  If the Minister and his Department had continued to provide the level of services now intended <Col N="1639" /> only on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, little or no progress could have been reported.  A statutory basis for general practitioner, dental, ophthalmic, oral, counselling, home help and home nursing services and the additional services which are intended to be extended to children and partners ensures that full and proper recognition and resources are provided on a permanent basis which can only be changed in the future by amending legislation, regardless of which party or parties form that Government.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Ad hoc</i> services can, over time, take on a degree of permanency but, with delegated authority to chief executive officers of health boards, these services and the level of their delivery and effectiveness can vary widely.  Priorities within board areas vary and while I have commended the Minister on the approach he has adopted in giving statutory effect to the health care portion of the programme, politically this was the only approach which would have been accepted.</P>
    <P>The programme of research to be carried out by the health research board and the establishment of a statutory consultative council is noteworthy.  I presume that such a consultative council could have also been set up on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis but <i>ad hoc</i> consultative councils in the past have had a short and uncertain life span, particularly in times of fiscal rectitude.  My colleague, Deputy Moffatt, stated last night that not all is known about the effects of hepatitis C. Long term research projects will have to be carried out and the full range of programmes monitored so that changes and new services can be provided where the need is identified.</P>
    <P>Certain words have been used <i>ad nauseam</i> in this debate such as <i>ad hoc,</i> statutory and <i>ex gratia</i> in our efforts to address the real needs and concerns of the person affected.  <i>Ex gratia</i> is defined in the Oxford dictionary as a favour, especially not under legal compulsion. The Government's proposal to pay <i>ex gratia</i> compensation to anti-D recipients <Col N="1640" /> who are infected with hepatitis C antibodies or virus, their partners and children who are also infected with hepatitis C antibodies or virus and those persons who contracted hepatitis C from a blood transfusion or blood product does not go far enough for compensation to be assessed by an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal.  The Minister's proposals, at face value, look generous and promise informality and speed.  They also promise attractive early settlements and any other proposals or suggestions made by this side of the House are summarily dismissed.</P>
    <P>Positive Action and Transfusion Positive strike me as representative groups whose sole aim is the well-being and welfare of the people they represent. Nothing I have seen or heard would convince me that they wish to see the work of the statutory tribunal undermined by awards accompanied by large bills for costs paid out to teams of legal representatives.  Because of the potentially large group of people involved in this tragedy, no one wants a rerun of the beef tribunal, the saga of which continues with the commencement shortly of the taxation of horrendous legal bills.</P>
    <P>Many of the proposals of the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme if given statutory effect would have the effect of substantially reducing the legal costs payable on an award.  I am not convinced that the presumption that a non-statutory tribunal will avoid formality, inflexibility, delays and the other reasons put forward by the Minister last night will stand the test of time. It will be chaired by an eminent jurist, trained and experienced in the ways and means of assessing evidence, quantifying compensation &mdash; either by way of lump or interim awards &mdash; and fully conscious of the rules of natural justice and the rights of the injured party to be fully facilitated in presenting their evidence. If procedures are adopted by the compensation tribunal which will not allow the legal teams of the injured parties to fully present their cases, then not only will there be a substantial number of judicial review cases but also the potential of a double set of legal costs.</P>
    <P>A statutory tribunal is required to <Col N="1641" /> give permanency.  Who can say with any certainty that it will not be abolished in five, ten or 30 years' time?  The present proposal could be abolished at the whim of a Government.  To suggest that the High Court &mdash; as suggested last night &mdash; will step in to stop such an arbitrary decision does not fully take into account various decisions of our superior courts which have refused to interfere with administrative and executive decisions. To suggest that already affected people can go to a statutory body, namely the High Court, is unfair to the people in question and does not take into account the substantial delays which those persons would have to endure on top of an already intolerable burden of stress, upset and anxiety.  At present, delays of several years are the norm in High Court personal injuries cases.</P>
    <P>The Minister suggested that if he was to establish a statutory tribunal he, or any other Minister, could be forced to extend that notion of provisional awards to every forthcoming idea.  What is wrong with that, even if his logic stands up?  Such a system of provisional awards has much to recommend it, has been called for by various bodies over many years and would be a much more accurate way of assesing future pain and suffering and future loss of earnings.  It could have the effect of reducing the totality of the sums awarded and allow recipients to manage their affairs in a way to which they are accustomed rather than being the recipients of large lump sums which, in some instances, can have a disastrous effect on people's lifestyles and families.</P>
    <P>I have acknowledged that the Minister has come a long way in meeting the needs and concerns of the representative groups.  He has, in the main, been reasonable in his approach.  However, without being ungenerous to him, the approach of any Minister to this problem has been fashioned by the very serious negligence of the Blood Transfusion Services Board and the excellent representations made by Positive Action and Transfusion Positive on behalf of their members.  It is essential <Col N="1642" /> that confidence is built upon in the type of tribunal offered to alleviate, by means of monetary compensation, the injury inflicted on this group of people. It has been clearly spelled out that the Minister's own proposals for a compensation tribunal are not acceptable. Going the extra 100 yards and giving statutory effect to this <i>ad hoc</i> board will ensure that most, if not all, claims will be processed through it with speed, informality and flexibility, provided the ingredients contained in the draft Bill prepared by Positive Action are given statutory effect.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to participate in this debate and I thank my colleagues, particularly Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, for tabling this motion so soon after we had an opportunity to discuss the issue at a recent select committee meeting.  We are discussing a great human tragedy with regard to the infection of so many people with hepatitis C from contaminated blood products and associated contacts.</P>
      <P>Positive Action and Transfusion Positive, who have been campaigning on this issue for some time &mdash; and did not make a great deal of progress in the early stages &mdash; recently indicated that, although they are satisfied with some of the proposals brought forward by the Minister for Health and the Government on this very important issue for them, there are still, as other speakers said, a number of issues which need to be tackled in a sympathetic way to meet the full needs of the people concerned and the representative organisations. Members on all sides called on the Minister in a gentle but forceful way to re-enter discussions with representative groups to ascertain if the divisive issues could be satisfactorily resolved.  I support those calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the short time available to me I do not propose to deal with the issues raised by my colleagues.  While I accept there are some positive aspects to the Minister's health care package, it will give rise to many difficulties.  There are <Col N="1643" /> substantial waiting lists for dental, ophthalmic and aural services.  I do not know the background to the Minister's proposal, but perhaps he will allow those infected with hepatitis C to obtain such services in the private sector.  If they have to depend on the public service for them they will experience considerable delays and that may add to their dilemma.</P>
    <P>More detail is required on the placing and frequency of the independent counselling service and the length of waiting time that will be involved.  While the Minister stated there would be a one month waiting period for such a service, those infected with hepatitis C may not be able to wait that long.  Home help and home nursing services are overstretched. Will those infected with hepatitis C have to tap into existing services? If that is the case, unless the Minister proposes to expand the service by providing additional funding, others entitled to the service will have to forego entitlements.  Four hospitals in Dublin, one in Cork and one in Galway provide secondary health care services. While this may be due to the availability of consultants and so on, in so far as providing additional funding for such hospitals is concerned, I fail to understand why those services could not be more evenly spead throughout the country, for example, in Galway, Sligo, Cavan and Dundalk.  Surely the majority of those infected with hepatitis C are not from the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>There are many flaws in the health care package.  Its success will be measured on the willingness of this and future Governments to provide additional funding for those services.  It will not be such a good package if hepatitis C sufferers are expected to tap into existing services.  The tribunal should be placed on a statutory footing and Members on this side put forward strong arguments in that regard.  When organisations and individuals request those services, they may not be as freely available as appears from the package. I hope that is not the case, but that will <Col N="1644" /> depend on the financial support of this and successive Governments.  It will be interesting to note how the service develops and succeeds in responding to the needs of those whom the Minister indicated in his health package can tap into the service.  Commitments made in this area must be honoured in hospitals and health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Progressive Democrats' amendment is to home in on the outstanding issues which have taken from the negotiations entered into by the women infected with hepatitis C.  These were referred to by Members on all sides.</P>
      <P>The refusal of the Minister as late as last evening to concede on these last few issues is disappointing and falls short of what the women feel is fair, namely, the commitment in the programme <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to pay fair compensation to those infected with hepatitis C.  Do we want to achieve what is fair in the eyes of the Minister or in the eyes of the women infected?</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats believe all the victims infected with hepatitis C should be compensated by the State.  It is unfortunate that the Taoiseach sought to politicise the matter in recent days when he was confronted with an accounting irregularity.  The Opposition has a duty to point out when such an accounting irregularity is discovered.  It is wrong for the Taoiseach to use the hepatitis C and compensation issue as an excuse for his sleight of hand in cooking the financial books.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great passions were expended on the question of the budgetary irregularity.  It is ironic that such great passions were not voiced on the scandal to which we are referring tonight.  Outrage was expressed on the Order of Business today and yesterday about the budgetary irregularity but the reality of these women's lives did not meet with similar outrage and scandal.  The Minister did not request the resignation of the people in the Blood Transfusion Service Board who are responsible for the scandal, that State board failed abjectly in <Col N="1645" /> its responsibility to the public and the women infected and in doing so breached its own guidelines.  The DPP did not get involved.  The Minister stated it was none of his business, his office is independent.  When I asked the Minister if he had requested the resignation of those guilty of criminal negligence in their duties he said that would not be necessary as they had retired voluntarily with golden handshakes.</P>
    <P>At the outset the State did not have a leg to stand on in respect of this issue. Every inch of territory that has been conceded was negotiated by the infected women and great credit is due to them. I applaud their continuing persistence as they are not yet happy with the deal being offered.  They have been empowered by the tragedy and politicised by the injustice done to them by the State. One would have to be a woman to realise how badly this tragedy affected those concerned.  It flowed from perhaps one of their happiest moments, that of pregnancy and childbirth.  To link tragedy with such happiness must be a double tragedy for the women concerned.</P>
    <P>The report by Dr. Hederman-O'Brien, which was damning in its criticism of the Blood Transfusion Service Board, should be debated by a committee of the House.  Its implications are extremely serious.  The scheme of compensation is offered by the Government to ensure the efficient and speedy payment of compensation to the victims of the biggest health scandal in the history of the State.  It is right that compensation should be paid, but it is not acceptable for the Government to continue to ignore the remaining concerns of women who have been infected which relate to their basic rights and the need for fair play.  It is not acceptable that the spirit of generosity which led to the decision to establish a tribunal has not been carried through to its framework.</P>
    <P>The proposals set out by the Minister in the health care document relating to the long-term health care needs of <Col N="1646" /> women infected with hepatitis C are welcome and satisfy the concerns of the women concerned, but the amended scheme of compensation published by the Minister falls short of the commitment given in the policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to provide fair compensation.  The scheme should be acceptable to the women concerned who have been infected with a potentially life threatening illness for which there is no cure, but what they have been offered is not adequate.  They received contaminated blood from a State board and everything possible should be done to ensure they are happy with the deal negotiated on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Few outstanding issues remain such as the absence of permanence, the manner in which the women concerned will present their cases and the absence of a built-in appeals mechanism.</P>
    <P>All the women in question face an uncertain and unpredictable future.  The full extent of the damage will only manifest itself in time.  That is probably the most frightening aspect.  Many of them may suffer from cirrhosis of the liver and have to undergo a liver transplant. When they close their eyes they see a panorama of uncertainty.  This is part and parcel of the damage caused through negligence on the part of the State apart from any physical injuries they may suffer.</P>
    <P>They cannot be fobbed off with a once-off <i>ad hoc</i> payment.  They want and deserve a contract.  That is the only way to guarantee proper long-term provision. Those who are awarded a provisional or interim award must have the right to re-enter their claims, if the need so arises.  The only way this can be guaranteed is to give the women concerned a proper contract.</P>
    <P>It is the belief of the Progressive Democrats that the order setting up the tribunal should be debated in the House.  At a minimum, all the parties which may make up future Governments must be morally committed to meeting the long-term needs of these <Col N="1647" /> innocent victims because of gross negligence on the part of a State agency.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides for the making of provisional awards which is a key attraction of the tribunal as opposed to going to court.  The scheme states, however, that the awards will be granted at the discretion of the tribunal. On medical grounds or for reasons of a strong personal fear that her hepatitis C condition could worsen, a woman may seek a provisional award.  The tribunal may, however, grant her a lump sum and she would have no right of appeal. There is no entitlement, as of right, to a provisional award under the scheme. This denies provisional awards, the main advantage of the scheme, over and above a court, to a claimant, as of right. Women, through Positive Action, have indicated that the provisional award is a key feature of the scheme and one Positive Action has been campaigning for as it does not exist anywhere else in Irish law.  The Minister and the State are making provision for such an award because hepatitis C is such an uncertain condition, but the restrictions imposed make this a major defect of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the discretion of the tribunal has been deliberately inserted by the Government because lawyers in Ireland are not familiar with the concept of provisional awards and may advise applicants in a certain direction which may not be in their best interests.  That is not the responsibility of the Minister, but of the women concerned. It is an insult to the victims of this tragedy.</P>
    <P>It is unsatisfactory to indicate that the issue may be taken to the High Court if a claimant is not satisfied as only the tribunal can make such staged payments. The victims are concerned that the tribunal will not have permanence and, therefore, there may be a cut-off point for the making of provisional awards.  A binding written contract should be made between the State and the women concerned outlining the terms of the award.  This would be binding on any future Government, thereby <Col N="1648" /> preventing it from abolishing the tribunal. This may seem outlandish, but the women concerned have lost confidence in the authorities and who could blame them?  They have a legitimate grievance.  There is a need to restore their trust.  It is a pity that these issues cannot be resolved.</P>
    <P>This is an <i>ad hoc</i> scheme and the only reference to permanence is to be found in the following sentence: &ldquo;The scheme shall continue indefinitely so as to give effect to said purpose&rdquo;.  This does not remove the feeling of victims that the scheme will be abandoned either in the short or long-term.</P>
    <P>The scheme presented by the Minister does not guarantee the women in question the right to properly present their case.  There is no guarantee that their doctor will be called to give what they believe to be vital evidence.  The usual right to compel witnesses to attend or procure documents is not included in the terms of the scheme as outlined.  All evidence will be heard at the discretion of the tribunal.  The scheme indicates that the tribunal will rely primarily on written evidence.</P>
    <P>Last week at a meeting of the Select Committee on Social Affairs the Minister stated that claimants may not be called to give evidence.  This is unacceptable and blatantly unfair.  We are talking about women who have been injured through no fault of their own, but through the fault of the State.  They should have the right to present medical evidence orally at the tribunal, if they so wish.</P>
    <P>These issues highlight the inadequacies of the scheme.  They are serious omissions which the Minister is well aware of, but he is standing firm.  I cannot see the difficulty with making these concessions.  It causes concern among claimants that the tribunal will hear cases in a summary manner and will work to conclude all hearings by making final awards as quickly as possible.  This problem should be resolved at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Those who contracted hepatitis C through blood transfusions face various <Col N="1649" /> legal difficulties.  If they had a blood transfusion before October 1991, they will be deemed to have contracted hepatitis C as a result of having this transfusion. Where hospital records are not available a person should not be prevented from receiving compensation from the tribunal.  In other words, they should not be punished for the failure of the hospital to retain or produce their medical records.</P>
    <P>The women involved have outlined in detail their concerns to the Minister and all Members.  These relate to the burden of proof at the tribunal.</P>

      <P>Substantial progress has already been made in the past year in meeting the many complex and varied needs of those persons who have contracted hepatitis C from a blood product of blood transfusion.  Deputy Moffatt indicated last night that much of the health care package is aspirational. This is not the case.  The primary health care element of the package which includes general practitioner services, including prescribed drugs and medicines; dental, ophthalmic and aural services; independent counselling services; home help services and home nursing services will be the subject of legislation which will be published by 31 December 1995 providing for these services to be provided free of charge and without a means test for certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C.  The hospital services for these patients are already covered by the health Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the hospital services, specific funding will be provided in the Book of Estimates each year for special clinics and the annual level of funding will ensure open access to hospital facilities for hepatitis C or any related condition; adequate permanent staffing levels; that the required service is not disrupted, particularly in relation to staff replacement; that each unit will have a specialist liver consultant or hepatologist and a nurse-counsellor; that the equipment necessary to provide the required service is available; that no <Col N="1650" /> patient should have to wait more than one hour for a scheduled appointment, that no patient will have to wait more than two weeks for an appointment; that a minimum of five days hospital admission is offered to patients for viral therapy initiation, should such be requested; that adequate training for staff is provided; the non-payment of hospital charges; priority referral to consultants for conditions related to hepatitis C; access to liver transplant procedure where clinically indicated without delay and that each unit will have a designated ward area for hepatitis C patients who are admitted for testing, treatment or biopsy.</P>
    <P>In relation to the designated ward area, this provision, like many of the other services being provided was specifically requested by Positive Action during the course of the recent negotiations between that group and the Department of Health.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said that some patients are objecting to such a designated ward because they may not have revealed to their relatives that they are hepatitis C positive.  In such circumstances the hospitals will, as far as possible, accommodate the patient in an alternative unit in the hospital.  All of the services are being provided under the Health Acts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn raised the issue of counselling for persons with hepatitis C last night.  It is the Minister for Health's intention to prescribe in regulations, among other services, that certain persons who have contracted hepatitis C shall be entitled to a counselling service free of charge.  The health care package indicates in detail the scope of the counselling service, including that an appointment for counselling will be arranged within one month of request.  Funding for the counselling service will be provided by the Department of Health to the health boards which will be responsible for the provision of the service.</P>
    <P>Counselling is currently available at: Dublin, Donegal, Wexford, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Cavan-Monaghan, Westmeath, <Col N="1651" /> Offaly-Laois, Kilkenny, Louth, Meath-Wicklow-Kildare, Cork, Kerry, Limerick, Waterford, Tipperary and Ennis.</P>
    <P>The range of counselling services that will be provided will include: GP's providing counselling at their level of patient contact; nurse-counsellors at hepatitis C-anti-D clinics providing counselling services and assistance at hospital appointments and, if necessary, by follow up telephone contact; consultants at hepatitis C clinics may refer patients for specialist counselling and an independent counselling service to be provided through the health boards.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn spoke last night about the Bain report.  Bain &amp; Co. carried out a major consultancy project at the BTSB and reported to the Department of Health and the BTSB in May last.  The objective of the Minister for Health is to ensure that the BTSB as the statutory health agency which provides blood and blood products to our hospital service is organised and structured to provide a public service to the highest possible standards of safety, efficiency and effectiveness in the best interests of patients and donors.  The full and effective implementation of the recommendations of the Bain report is the top priority for the BTSB.  The main thrust of the report is focused on identifying opportunities to improve levels of safety, patient care and donor care.  The recommendations in the Bain report together with the changes in the management and organisation of the BTSB will facilitate the necessary reorganisation of the BTSB so that it can play its essential role in the overall health care system.</P>
    <P>Positive Action has sought a statutory tribunal on the basis that a statute would guarantee the performance of such a tribunal.  A statutory scheme offers no such absolute guarantees on the permanence of a tribunal.  However, there are a number of safeguards against the abolition or future amendment of the Government's scheme to diminish the rights of applicants to the <Col N="1652" /> tribunal outlined by the Minister for Health last night which, in my view, are worth reiterating: the terms of any award made under the Government's scheme would be enforceable before the courts; and any abolition or future amendment of the Government's scheme to the effect of diminishing the rights of applicants to the tribunal would be subject to judicial review.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health also outlined the ten amendments which have been made to the compensation scheme following consultation and negotiation with Positive Action and Transfusion Positive.  The position is that no further concessions can be made.  The Minister for Health mindful that many claimants wish to apply to the tribunal for compensation without further delay is formally establishing the tribunal on Friday next, 15 December 1995.</P>

      <P>On yesterday's Order of Business on behalf of the Government the Taoiseach accepted liability for the health scandal we are discussing this evening.  He went on to say that the liability must be met and is being provided for.  This morning on the Order of Business he said the credibility of the tribunal with the women who need compensation would be greatly diminished if the Government did not make the financial provision to meet it and that the credibility of the tribunal is enhanced by the fact that financial provision is being made this year.  That is far from being accurate.  As Deputy O'Donnell pointed out, it would be better if the Taoiseach did not use the victims of hepatitis C as the excuse for the questionable accounting procedures of this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement is inaccurate in several respects.  It is hard to diminish credibility for the tribunal proposed by the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, when the groups representing victims are deeply unhappy with it.  As far as they are concerned an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal for hepatitis C victims <Col N="1653" /> has no credibility or very little credibility compared to the statutory one they have demanded.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach also suggests that the groups were pressing for financial provisions to be made for the tribunal and that was what spurred on the Government. The groups representing hepatitis C victims did not insist that the Government push through the Supplementary Estimate in such a hasty fashion.  They wanted the detail of the tribunal sorted out and had not pressed for an Estimate. Some of the groups representing the victims had met the Minister for Health the night before the Supplementary Estimate was moved at the Select Committee on Social Affairs last week and were less than happy with what they were told about the arrangements for the Estimate and the tribunal.  They were not satisfied with the terms proposed by the Minister and believed further talks were necessary.  They also believed the Minister for Health had failed spectacularly to listen to the concerns of those infected and that he was wrong to move forward with the Estimate at that time when the detail of the matter was not agreed.  However, the Minister ploughed on showing complete disregard for the victims of a State disaster. For the Taoiseach to claim at this stage that the credibility of this <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal is enhanced because of the financial provisions is insulting.  He should withdraw the remarks he made this morning on the Order of Business tomorrow.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health made a number of points last night which need to be addressed.  He presented the research carried out by the Department of Health and the Blood Transfusion Service Board into finding the victims of hepatitis C as comprehensive.  He also presented the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal as fair, balanced and as giving an opportunity to all victims to get a settlement.  That is quite inaccurate.  The group which represents the people who contracted hepatitis C from blood transfusions will have legal difficulties with the Minister's proposal. That group includes at least 500 <Col N="1654" /> people, made up of mothers who received transfusions when giving birth, children who needed blood transfusions to save their lives, male and female car accident victims, males and females who received transfusions during serious operations and those with rare blood diseases.</P>
    <P>Under the Minister's proposals transfusee claimants, their children and partners will be required to establish on the balance of probabilities that the hepatitis C antibodies or hepatitis C virus in respect of which they have been diagnosed positive resulted from a blood transfusion or a blood product received by the claimant, parent or the partner of a claimant within the State.  They foresee two difficulties in relation to this obligation which is to be placed on every claimant before the proposed tribunal. They understand that some medical records would have been lost or mislaid through the amalgamation of various hospitals in recent years and that in at least one case medical records have been destroyed.  The individual in question was in hospital as a child over 20 years ago and they understand that, in accordance with administrative procedures in that hospital, the records relating to her have been destroyed. Such persons, therefore, will have to rely on other means of proving they received blood transfusions.  However, the most crucial issue in their view relates to the obligation contained in section 6 (e) (ii) whereby claimants are required to establish on the balance of probabilities that they have contracted the hepatitis C virus from a blood transfusion or blood product.  This means that a claimant must establish on the balance of probabilities, in a positive manner, that he or she contracted the infection from the blood transfusion or blood products.  It is their view that it is not sufficient for a claimant to show that the infection could not be caused by other causes or from other sources. Accordingly, a claimant must show a positive connection between the infection and the receiving of a blood transfusion or blood product.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> The difficulty arises from the fact that screening for hepatitis C was not introduced until 1 October 1991.  Only on or after that date are donors of blood tested for the hepatitis C virus.  Persons who gave blood prior to that date would not have been tested in a significant number of cases.  As the facts become available, it appears that quite a number of donors did not continue to donate blood after 1 October 1991.  It is, therefore, not possible to establish whether such donors donated blood contaminated with the hepatitis C virus.  It appears that only in cases where donors continued to give blood after 1 October 1991 can blood donated to claimants be positively confirmed as having been infected.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board's Lookback programme is only capable of establishing whether contaminated blood was donated in cases where donors continued to give blood after 1 October 1991.  Therefore, there is a crucial difficulty, if not an impossibility, for a claimant to establish that he or she received contaminated blood in the circumstances I have outlined.  Even the Blood Transfusion Service Board's attempts to identify whether blood donated in the past was contaminated will not succeed in identifying such blood unless the donor or the donors in question continued to give blood after 1 October 1991.  Its view is that the obligation to establish, on the balance of probabilities, that a person's infection was caused by a blood transfusion or a blood product may be an impossible onus to discharge, through no fault of the individual claimant.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the legal difficulty from the point of view of the blood transfusion victims is that, under the Minister's <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal, there is a major risk that a bona fide and deserving claimant may not be able to prove his or her case because of the imposition of an obligation to establish that blood was contaminated in certain circumstances that cannot be proved.  It will not be possible to prove because testing for <Col N="1656" /> hepatitis C was not introduced until after 1 October 1991.  If a person who had the virus donated blood prior to that date but did not donate again after that date they cannot be traced for hepatitis C.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service Board's Lookback study, which was requested by the Minister, has only established cases where infected blood was given after that cut-off date of 1 October 1991.  The objections to the Minister's tribunal are compelling and put in context the incompleteness of records and tests so far.  I say to Deputies on the other side of the House who have given commitments to the groups representing victims about a statutory tribunal that if they walk through the lobbies and vote down this motion, they are denying all these people compensation for a tragedy caused by the State.</P>
    <P>The group representing blood transfusion victims has suggested some sensible changes that should be introduced to stop their members being locked out of the tribunal.  So far, the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, has ignored these calls from a very vulnerable group.</P>
    <P>I wish to raise a number of other points with the Minister, Deputy Noonan, who made some remarks about lawyers here last night.  He implied that they would somehow devise a hepatitis C tribunal that would be complex, just to get exorbitant legal fees.  I hold no brief for lawyers but I believe the Minister's remarks are offensive, especially to the senior counsel who have been involved in this controversy.  In fact, instead of insulting them the Minister would do well to listen to them given that at least one of them has held very senior legal office in the State.  The Minister is obviously sore because they have challenged his legal scheme and said it has a number of significant weaknesses. They have also said that the sentence in the scheme providing for the tribunal to continue indefinitely does not remove the real fears that the <i>ad <Col N="1657" /> hoc</i> tribunal could be abandoned by a Government even in the short-term.</P>
    <P>Legal experts also point out that having regard to the provisions of Articles 17 and 28.4.3º of the Constitution there must be a real doubt as to the extent to which a Minister or the Government can purport to bind future Governments in the manner proposed in the scheme. The Minister said last night that even a statutory tribunal could be abolished by amending an Act of the Oireachtas. While I accept that could be done, a Government would think twice about doing this in that it would have to come before the House and have it voted on. It would be much more difficult to do that then to abolish an <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal where the only challenge would come from the courts and where such an action might not succeed.</P>
    <P>All legal advice is that if the tribunal is not put on a statutory basis, then the best way to secure permanence is to provide for individual contracts between each claimant and the State, as Deputy O'Donnell suggested.  I did not regard that as the best way forward and I would prefer a statutory tribunal but the Minister has not even offered the contracts route as a compromise in this affair.</P>
    <P>The well considered advice I have been given by lawyers, close to this controversy, points to the Minister's scheme failing a fairness test on a number of counts.  Claimants cannot present oral medical evidence to the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal; there is no provision whereby witnesses can be compelled to attend hearings and claimants are not given an entitlement or a right to a provisional award.  In all cases the tribunal has the discretion to make a lump sum award rather than a provisional award.  The Minister's tribunal is not subject to judicial review and the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme excludes the right of appeal.</P>
    <P>In his comments last night, the Minister said that proceedings before the tribunal are not excluded from judicial review but the victims and the lawyers do not share this certainty.  It is their view that if there is a judicial review, it <Col N="1658" /> would only be after an onerous process. I heard what the Minister said on these points but advice from senior lawyers does not agree with the Minister's version of events.  In fact, they believe that despite the Minister engaging the groups representing victims in a month of intensive negotiations, no significant improvement resulted in the proposals for the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal.  The lawyers came to the conclusion that the Minister's plan is that hepatitis C victims should be compensated, as Deputy O'Donnell said, with final lump sum awards at the earliest date, by the <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal, so that the problem is put into the past at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister made considerable headway on the health proposals. The health document put forward by him is satisfactory as it finally puts on paper the deal needed to copperfasten the guarantee of continuing quality health care given in 1994 by the former Government.  It is a pity that guarantees had to be dragged, word for word, out of the Department of Health by the representative groups.  The health document indicates that the representative groups will be consulted regarding the enabling legislation. When will the Minister, Deputy Noonan, fulfil that undertaking, given that his commitment in the House is to publish legislation by 31 December?</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that hepatitis C is an unpredictable disease.  It can arise at unexpected times and it can be fatal.  That is why I would say to those on the other side of the House that if they vote down this motion, they are voting for a flawed half measure for the victims of a State tragedy.  To say, as the Minister did last night, that a person falling into a pothole can be compared with a person infected with a life threatening virus at the hands of a State board shows clearly his lack of insensitivity and comprehension of the seriousness of this issue.  The victims have fallen into a bottomless pit and the Minister wants to bury them there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this topic this evening and the Minister for Health for coming in to reply.</P>
      <P>There is no need for me to impress on the Minister that we have a deepening crisis resulting from drug abuse, in circumstances in which an ever increasing percentage of our youth has been or will be caught up in the drugs culture.</P>
      <P>While this Government has introduced a welcome range of stronger measures aimed at curbing the illegal activities of drug importers and pushers, prevention always must be our main objective and can best be achieved through stronger security measures and systematic education programmes, a recipe that has proved successful in other countries.  Sweden has definite proof that properly designed, delivered and resourced education programmes can and are making a difference.</P>
      <P>However, the damaged health of the victims of drug addiction &mdash; the specific aspect of the drugs problem I want to raise this evening &mdash; presents us with a different set of challenges altogether.  To reverse that damage will prove extremely difficult as the problems involved in drug addiction are very complex. To date we do not have precise information on the extent of the damage being done to young people's health through taking different types of drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent survey undertaken in the Dublin region showed a 47 per cent increase in first-time, young psychotic admissions to public beds in St. John of God's Hospital between February and November last, a shocking statistic.  That increase in admissions was attributed directly to the use of cannabis, magic mushrooms and ecstasy and that assertion is verified by a well respected clinical director of the Clúain Mhuire <Col N="1665" /> Centre who has established a direct and definite link between such admissions and drug abuse.</P>
    <P>This demonstrates to me that the damage done is much deeper and of longer duration than I had hitherto realised.  It also confirms the necessity for the Minister to tackle the matter urgently, and to put in place a much more comprehensive range of services to meet the needs of drug addicts who present themselves for rehabilitation. Adult psychiatric hospitals are not the most appropriate for the placement of youngsters.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of the psychiatric problems we all know that some young people having undergone intensive, initial treatment, later, for the want of proper after care and support services, lapse back into drug taking.  Will the Minister have his Department undertake a detailed assessment of the needs of young drug addicts, not only in the greater Dublin area but nationwide, so that we can establish precisely what are their needs and be in a better position to plan their rehabilitation and invest proper resources in community services for that purpose?</P>
    <P>Will the Minister have his Department initiate clinical tests to establish the precise effects of ecstacy on mental and physical health.  Ecstacy is not used in medicine here.  For that reason we do not know precisely the damage it does to young people's physical or mental health.  The first evidence we have of psychiatric or psychotic damage emanated from the report to which I referred.  Will the Minister address both those issues as a matter of urgency?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank Deputy Quill for raising this topic.  Recent media reports on this matter have suggested there has been a general increase of 47 per cent in the number of young, first time psychotic admissions to all public psychiatric hospitals &mdash; that is, persons aged 30 years or under with a diagnosis of chronic psychosis on admission.  This figure relates to first time admissions of <Col N="1666" /> such patients to public patient beds at St. John of God private psychiatric hospital, Stillorgan, not to all psychiatric hospitals as suggested.  The Eastern Health Board subvents 37 beds at the St. John of God hospital for the treatment of public patients with mental illness from the south-eastern area of Dublin-Dún Laoghaire.</P>
      <P>An average of 25 such admissions are made every year during the period January to December, approximately 19 of which are in the months February to November inclusive.  During this ten months period in the current year the number of admissions increased from 19 to 28, an increase of approximately nine patients.  The actual increase was nine patients over ten months but, of course, that is 47 per cent on a base of 19.  It is not as dramatic a story to say nine patients over ten months as to mention a 47 per cent increase in a newspaper headline which magnifies the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not trying to play down the issue, I simply want to put the facts on the record.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the number of young people who are misusing drugs is increasing, and that is a cause of concern.</P>
      <P>The report of the Health Research Board for 1994 on Treated Drug Misuse in the Dublin area profiles the type of people who are typically misusing drugs. The main findings of this report are as follows: the number of persons presenting for treatment for the first time has increased by 34 per cent since 1993; almost 80 per cent of those in treatment were male; over 80 per cent were unemployed; 60 per cent had left school with a minimum education; 92 per cent of those in treatment were in the 15 to 39 age bracket; and 27 per cent of those receiving treatment lived in the north or south inner city areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1992 special funding has been allocated each year to allow for the <Col N="1667" /> development of extensive prevention and treatment services by all health boards and particularly the Eastern Health Board, which is responsible in the first instance for the provision of services for drug misusers in the greater Dublin area where the majority of drug misusers reside.  With the Drug Treatment Centre in Pearse Street and voluntary organisations, the board is proceeding with the provision of additional facilities to cope with the demand for treatment.  Its plan includes the establishment of additional community drug treatment centres which will provide a range of treatment and counselling services, depending on the service needs in each area.  All other health boards are strengthening the co-ordination and implementation structures at regional and local level to address drug misuse so that they may be in a position to tackle whatever drug problems emerge in the future.</P>
    <P>An important component of health board services is the outreach service where addiction counsellors seek out young people experimenting with drugs who are at risk of becoming drug misusers. This early intervention can often prevent young people misusing drugs, since it offers them support and help and offers their families and friends similar support when necessary.</P>
    <P>While the health boards' response will help a number of young people who have drug misuse problems, it will not address the underlying problems linked with socio-demographic factors, which will need a much more integrated wide-ranging response on the part of a number of agencies.</P>
    <P>An important element in the fight against drugs is education and primary prevention.  My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Education, has developed a substance abuse prevention programme for second level schools.  The programme has been implemented in approximately 50 per cent of schools and training of teachers is ongoing to introduce it to the remainder of schools.  Plans are also in progress <Col N="1668" /> to develop a programme for primary schools during 1996.</P>
    <P>My Department's health promotion unit also continues to work with health boards and other agencies, voluntary and statutory, in the development of programmes and training modules for schools, youth clubs, health professionals, parents and groups who deal with young people.  The unit provides a wide range of educational material on drugs through its public office in my Department.  It is also preparing to launch a media campaign in the new year to complement the existing drug prevention programmes.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the prevention of drug misuse is high on my agenda.  My Department will be working closely with all the agencies who have a role in prevention and in the provision of treatment and rehabilitation services, to reduce the overall number of young people turning to drugs and to provide the appropriate services for those who require treatment and counselling.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Suicide Incidence.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MildredFox" hpid="Ms M. Fox Ms M. Fox">
      <NameTxt>Ms M. Fox</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for allowing me to raise this matter.  Suicide is a major public health issue in Ireland. Official figures show that over 1,000 people committed suicide in the past three years.  Several thousand people have attempted suicide during that period but were saved from death by family intervention, medical assistance and, in some instances, by good luck.  The official figures are very depressing, but the real story is much worse.  Experts estimate that the number of suicides in Ireland could be three or four times greater than the official figures suggest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a young person I am greatly concerned at the increase of suicide, which is particularly marked among young people.  Some of these people were friends of mine and while the loss of a friend at any time is a terrible and devastating blow, to lose a friend through suicide is much worse.  So many unanswered questions remain.  Should we <Col N="1669" /> not have noticed the suicidal intent? Could it have been prevented?  The bereaved, in trying to come to terms with the situation experience mixed emotions.  They can vary between bitterness, sadness, loss and blame.  In every case of suicide there are a number of people left behind who are in great need of counselling.  They must learn and understand the whole grieving process, and they must be helped to come to terms with this tragedy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, recently established a national task force on suicide.  I very much welcome this move.  It is intended that by July 1996 the task force will have completed a detailed analysis of all existing data relating to suicide, attempted suicide and associated factors.  The remainder of the year will be devoted to a major consultation exercise involving all interested parties leading to the formulation of a national suicide prevention strategy.</P>
    <P>I wish members of the task force the best of luck.  If it succeeds in preventing the loss of one life it will have achieved much although I expect it will be more successful than that.  Suicide and attempted suicide were decriminalised in Ireland in 1993.  However, despite the change in legislation there is still a social stigma attached to such acts.  The lid of silence has yet to be lifted and until such time as we acknowledge a major problem exists progress will be slow.</P>
    <P>Suicide has been a taboo subject for far too long and it is vital that we have a national debate on it.  Each year in December the gardaí launch a campaign to prevent death on the roads yet more people die as a result of suicide than are killed on the roads.  Action is needed.  It is vital that the true picture be established. We must learn the real extent of the problem and put measures in place to reduce it.</P>
    <P>Society must take a more compassionate view of suicide.  It is vital that suicide prevention programmes are available throughout the country.  Help and support for the bereaved is also essential.  I hope the task force carries <Col N="1670" /> out its work openly and that it helps to change the public's perception of suicide, the victims and their families.</P>
    <P>Over three times as many men as women kill themselves in Ireland.  While spring and summer are the most common times for people to commit suicide, many seriously consider taking their lives around Christmas time and the New Year.  For the majority of people, Christmas is a time of celebration but for others unfortunately it is a time when they feel most alone.  It is important that people are mindful of this fact.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that people will continue to commit suicide.  More support is needed for those at risk and for those affected by suicide.  I pay tribute to the Samaritans for the wonderful work they do in this area.  They provide an ear to those who hit rock bottom and their work cannot be fully evaluated. We owe a huge debt to them.</P>
    <P>A large number of Irish people are affected by suicide.  It is not good enough that the required support is provided solely by the professonal services and the Samaritans.  We all have a part to play.  Society must have a more compassionate attitude towards those who commit this final act &mdash; as Fergal Bowers stated &ldquo;Let God be the judge of their actions, not us&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I thank Deputy Fox for raising this issue and dealing with it in such a sensitive and compassionate way.  In the past, the numbers of deaths from suicide in Ireland were low but numbers have increased in the last 20 years.  In 1970, there were 52 suicides reported.  In 1993 this figure had risen to 360.  These increases have not been accompanied by a fall in other causes of unnatural death such as accidental poisoning, accidental drowning and open verdicts in coroners' courts.  For this reason, it must be accepted that there has been a genuine rise in the incidence of suicide.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is more pertinent, however, to examine the rate of suicide, that is, the number of suicides as a proportion of <Col N="1671" /> population, and this has also increased significantly over the years.  Between 1970 and 1993 the suicide rate ranged between 0 and 4 per 100,000 of the female population while the rate among males showed an increase from 3 to 17 per 100,000.  A classification of suicide rates by age indicates that adolescent males in the 25-34 year age group have the highest rate of suicide.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Law (Suicide) Act, 1993 abolished the offence of suicide but it continues to be an offence to be an accomplice to suicide.</P>
    <P>It is important to distinguish between suicide and para-suicide.  Para-suicide may be defined as an act with a nonfatal outcome in which an individual uses non-habitual behaviour which, without intervention, will lead to self-harm. It is aimed at bringing about a change in circumstances or as a &ldquo;cry for help&rdquo;.  It would be wrong to assume that all suicide victims are determined to take their own lives.  Many are ambivalent. The outcome is determined by the degree to which the method used is lethal or otherwise.  However, it is estimated that approximately 1 per cent of those who deliberately self-harm will take their own life in the following year and that over their lifetime, 15 per cent will have taken their own life.</P>
    <P>Few acts have such deep roots in social and human conditions or as far reaching consequences.  The factors which give rise to suicide have been the subject of debate for many years. Changing structures in society, increased pressures of daily living, depression and social isolation could all be seen as contributory factors.</P>
    <P>Along with research into the factors that influence an individual's decision to undertake a suicidal or para-suicidal act, it is also necessary to look at services already in place and to examine ways in which these could be improved and made more accessible to those in need. The development of the psychiatric services in line with the aims of <i>Planning <Col N="1672" /> for the Future,</i> a service which is comprehensive, community-oriented, sector-based and integrated with other health services, has led in a short time span to a greater level of public awareness and understanding of psychiatric illness.</P>
    <P>Both the Green Paper and the White Paper on Mental Health discuss the need for the promotion of positive mental health and the prevention of suicide. Mental health personnel have an important role to play in the prevention of suicides and voluntary bodies such as the Samaritans also make a valuable contribution.  I welcome Deputy Fox's endorsement of the Samaritans.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation in its <i>Targets for Health for All</i> has recommended action to reverse the rising trend in suicide by the year 2000.  It highlights the importance of early detection and treatment for depression, alcoholism and schizophrenia.  All these factors are currently being addressed in the context of the reorganisation of our mental health services.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the need for detailed analysis of existing data on the factors which lead people to take their own lives and the most effective way of intervening to prevent premature loss of life, a task force on suicide has been established to address these issues in detail.  It will be serviced from within the mental health services division of my Department.  The first meeting took place today.  It has the following terms of reference: (i) to define numerically and qualitatively the nature of the suicide problem in Ireland; (ii) to define and to quantify the problems of attempted suicide and para-suicide in Ireland, including the associated costs involved; (iii) to make recommendations on how service providers can most cost-effectively address the problems of attempted suicide and para-suicide; (iv) to identify the various authorities with jurisdiction in suicide prevention strategies and their respective responsibilities; and (v) to formulate, following consultation with all interested parties, a national suicide prevention strategy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1673" /> It is anticipated that by July 1996 the task force will be in a position to submit an interim report containing detailed analysis of all existing data relating to suicide, attempted suicide and associated factors.  The rest of 1996 will be devoted to a major consultative exercise involving all interested parties leading to the formulation of a national suicide prevention strategy by the end of 1996. I am confident that research and consultation on this issue will significantly help to prevent this tragic loss of life.</P>
    <P>Prior to the establishment of the task force there were a number of studies on suicide taking place.  The Department is providing financial support to a study on para-suicide in the Southern and Mid-Western Health Board areas.  The aim of the study is to reduce the incidence of para-suicide and to develop intervention skills which may be applied to this area.  The study is a collaborative partner in the WHO-EURO Multi Centre Study on Para-Suicide.</P>
    <P>A further study on the incidence and associated risk factors in relation to suicide is being piloted in the NorthEastern Health Board by the recently appointed directors of public health.</P>
    <P>The task force on suicide will draw on the research findings of each of these studies and following the consultation process it will develop a national suicide prevention strategy.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Westport (Mayo) Water Scheme.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Westport water augmentation scheme commenced its initial planning ten years ago to meet the projected needs of the Westport area, Louisburgh town and the rural area between these locations which are 12 miles apart.  Substantial progress on the technical phases of this large capital scheme was made from 1990 to the summer of this year, when a recommended tender was submitted to the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the substantial growth of Westport's population and tourist appeal paints an image of prosperity, <Col N="1674" /> underlying this is a serious threat to the future growth of the town, despite the mounting pressures for further physical development with record numbers of planning applications being considered on a monthly basis by the local authority. Westport has been the only town in Mayo to show consistent growth in its population for the past three censuses. In 1991 a growth rate of 7 per cent was reported and this will be further increased in the next census.</P>
    <P>Even without the designation of the town as a seaside renewal area, in 1993 and 1994 substantial numbers of new houses were built and, increasingly, a significant number of people who work in Castlebar choose to live in Westport. As a town it has a long tourist history but with careful attention to environmental concerns in the planning process, a substantial investment in amenity works and millions of pounds of local investment in hotels, guesthouses, bed and breakfasts and restaurants, the town has gained a national and international reputation as a quality destination to visit.</P>
    <P>This summer was the most successful tourist season to date but it brought to the forefront the serious crisis that faces the town in its ability to cater for existing needs and to cope with future requirements.  However, the prolonged dry spell this summer further accentuated the crisis management operated by the local authority over recent years. The present system can only treat 700,000 gallons per day but peak demand has exceeded 800,000 gallons on occasion.  In these emergencies untreated but disinfected water is put into the system.</P>
    <P>The growth in demand for water has shown a continued upward spiral and this will be further exacerbated in 1996 with a minimum of 75 new hotel bedrooms being built in addition to the extra accommodation provided in 1995, new guesthouses and bed and breakfasts and continued industrial expansion.</P>
    <P>In a water system requiring renewal, leaks of a minor nature can have serious consequences.  Our largest industrial <Col N="1675" /> employer makes sterile ophthalmic solutions which are water based.  It employs 700 employees and the local authority is constantly operating on a knife edge to cope with increasing demands.</P>
    <P>The tender from reputable contractors has been with the Department since August of this year.  It has been examined by Department officials and I am led to believe that matters are in order. The new scheme, costed at approximately £16 million, is intended not only to augment the supply to Westport town but with a capacity to treat 1.5 million gallons per day it will be sufficient to meet the future needs of Westport town, the large rural area to and beyond Louisburgh to group water schemes which have a poor supply.  The scheme also envisages an extension north of Westport to Kilmeena where the present source of supply is best described as dire.</P>
    <P>My constituency has shown an overall loss of population but with growth centres such as Westport, designated by the Minister for Tourism and Trade as an area of urban renewal, and that challenge having been successfully clasped by the people of the area over recent years, it now requires an early decision from the Minister to commit the funds necessary to allow a contractor to come on site.  I have the support of my constituency colleagues in raising this matter. Unless a Government decision is made immediately industrial, commercial, farming and residential interests will look to the summer of 1996 with trepidation.</P>
    <P>A £1.5 million leisure complex which opened in Westport in August of this year was grant-aided to the extent of £250,000 by the Department of Tourism and Trade.  The leisure complex incorporated a 20 metre swimming pool which was not allowed by the local authority to be filled with water from the town's supply.  Water had to be transported by tanker from Castlebar for the purpose.  I hope this indicates clearly the seriousness of the case.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister of State for sharing her time; I will be brief.  I support my colleague Deputy Hughes and assure him this matter is a priority with me, the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  Deputy Kenny, the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin and the Taoiseach.  We are concerned about this problem in Westport. I hope we will have a satisfactory outcome very soon.  Deputy Hughes is right in describing Westport as a developing town and this scheme is important for agriculture, tourism and industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Ms McManus)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Hughes for raising this important matter.  Mayo is a large county requiring substantial investment in water and sewerage infrastructure to meet the needs of agriculture, tourism and industry.  Deputy Hughes will know that County Mayo has fared very well in recent years in the provision of capital funding by my Department for these services.  To date, more than £25 million of EU Cohesion Funds have been secured for major projects, which include the £10 million Ballinrobe sewerage scheme which is nearing completion and the extension of the Lough Mask regional water supply scheme to serve Claremorris.  Cohesion Fund approval for the planning stages of the following major projects has also been secured: Westport sewerage scheme, costing £14.5 million; Claremorris sewerage scheme, costing £6.5 million; the extension of Lough Mask water scheme to Knock and Ballyhaunis, including a new distribution system for the town of Ballyhaunis, costing £15 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister recently announced a new water supply scheme for Achill costing £1.9 million, a new water distribution network for Belmullet costing <Col N="1677" /> £350,000 and the upgrading of the Castlebar sewage treatment works to provide for a much needed reduction in nutrients entering the Castlebar river. Planning is well advanced for further large scale projects within the county and approval has issued to the county council to invite tenders for the construction of the Ballyhaunis sewerage scheme, costing an estimated £4 million.</P>
    <P>While all the projects I have referred to so far are large scale ones and are urgently needed for the maintenance of the highest environmental standards as well as supporting tourism and industry, we are anxious that the needs of small towns and villages are not overlooked either.  So far this year, small water and sewerage scheme grants have been approved for the towns of Shrule and Tourmakeady.</P>
    <P>Mayo's single biggest industrial employer is located in Westport and the continued operation and expansion of the industrial base is fundamental to the future economic well being of the region.  Tourism is also vitally important for Westport.  Both Westport and Achill are included among the 15 designated resort areas under the 1995 resort schemes.  We are confident that the tax incentives provided will further benefit tourism in the Westport area.</P>
    <P>The proposed Westport water supply scheme is designed to serve an area of some 230 square miles.  The supply zone stretches from just south of Newport to Louisburgh and Killary Harbour and inland to the Partry Mountains.  The proposed scheme is very large and complex. It is comprised of some 3,500 metres of rising mains, more than 25,000 metres of trunk mains and about 22,000 metres of distribution mains.  Four new reservoirs are proposed for Murrisk, Lochta, Old Head and Carrowmore; and the capacity of the water treatment plant will be boosted from 2,200 cubic metres per day to more than 7,000 cubic metres per day.  Deputy Hughes has first hand knowledge and experience of the <Col N="1678" /> countryside through which the scheme will be laid.  He will also appreciate that an ambitious scheme such as the one proposed will be costly to construct.  The civil works alone would cost more than £11 million and the overall cost would well exceed £15 million.</P>
    <P>In November last year, my Department submitted an application to the EU Commission for Cohesion Funds for the Westport scheme and a decision is awaited.  We have been pressing the Commission for early decisions on this and other pending water and sewerage projects; we cannot however, give a definite commitment at this stage as to when financial approval can issue.  I would like to assure Deputy Hughes that we are determined to seek a solution to the water supply problems which could affect tourism and industrial growth in Westport.  My Department will explore every avenue to ensure that an improved water supply will be put in place at the earliest opportunity.</P>

    <P>Those of us who have followed this saga in the House will have felt a grave sense of tension and worry as the matter dragged on following meetings where one thought it would have been satisfactorily settled.  This led to disquiet at the intransigence shown by British Ministers and officials regarding the Irish case, which was put forward coherently. I felt all along that the British would use it to build tension in the wider framework of Anglo-Irish relations.  It is a <Col N="1679" /> mark of how they look at Irish difficulties and problems in that one must constantly engage in a battle with the UK Government on every issue.  One step forward is always followed by two steps back, not only in industrial and commercial issues but in political ones also. It is clear to both Government and Opposition in Ireland that it is a matter of some pride to the British if they are seen from time to time to act with obstinacy and obduracy regarding anything connected with Ireland.</P>
    <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me to discuss this matter.  As a guardian of our interests you have constantly afforded us an opportunity to discuss this important issue in the House.  I raise it to assure the Minister of our support, which I have been vocal in offering.  The British Government should know we speak with one voice on this matter, so that it will see the principle of divide and conquer is not operating.</P>
    <P>The Minister commissioned a report so that he and the Taoiseach could present it as a case proven as to why the deal arranged with ISPAT for Irish Steel and the subsidy attendant upon that deal should be allowed to pass by Brussels and the Council of Industry Ministers, bearing in mind all the other countries agreed to it.  We requested a copy of the report today and finally received it this evening, for which I thank the Minister.  It is a simple but strongly worded report which bears out the point of view we all put forward, that the arrangement for Irish Steel would not in any way impinge upon the viability of either Scunthorpe or Shelton. The argument put forward by the British is that any productivity which affected the Scunthorpe plant could in turn affect Shelton.  That has been proven to be incorrect.</P>
    <P>As I said on the radio some time ago, Irish Steel is but a minnow in comparison with British Steel and in the European and world steel markets.  The <Col N="1680" /> people of Cobh, the 350 workers in the plant &mdash; reduced from 550 &mdash; their families and children have all pulled together, made sacrifices and allowed the factory to become more streamlined and economically viable.  It makes a good product and they look forward to the future with pride.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to release this report to allow us publicly comment on it so that we can add our voices to the case being put forward and counter once and for all the spurious arguments raised by British Steel, which I strongly suspect is being encouraged by its Government.  The Minister should condemn that argument and endorse the clear findings the report has produced. I encourage the Taoiseach and the Minister to be strong in their convictions when putting forward the case.  The British arguments are tenuous to say the least and technically insupportable.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel and its workforce should be congratulated on a job well done so far.  Both the Taoiseach and his brother, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, should stiffen their resolve in the face of intransigence, obstinacy and obduracy.  The report ends by stating that Irish Steel's continued existence will have no impact on Shelton's viability.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Rourke for her continuing interest in this issue and her support on what is an important matter for Ireland as well as for the people of Cobh.  In a report sent to the Department of Enterprise and Employment by Eurostrategy consultants, the arguments advanced by British Steel over the past few weeks were examined.  The report came to the conclusion that the arguments were tenuous and not supportable technically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It had been maintained that Shelton and Irish Steel were in head to head competition but this is not the case &mdash;<Col N="1681" /> only 34,000 tonnes of Irish Steel products are in the Shelton range, representing less than 10 per cent of Irish Steel's products.  Only 7,000 tonnes of this product goes into the UK market. Shelton is a heavy section mill, unlike Irish Steel which is a medium section mill.  There is no basis for the suggestion that the continued operation of Irish Steel will damage jobs in Shelton.  The management at that plant has confirmed this point.</P>
    <P>British Steel had maintained that Irish Steel's viability was dependent on increasing its market share in the EU medium section market at the expense of British Steel.  It also maintained that Irish Steel's viability was dependent on depressing market prices.  According to Eurostrategy, the withdrawal of the Belgian steel company Cockeril-Sambre and the Portuguese company Siderugia Nacional from the medium sections market would ensure that Irish Steel and its competitors in that market, including the British Steel plant at Scunthorpe, will experience an increase in market share.</P>
    <P>The consultants state that current economic indicators from independent sources in the UK forecast a rise in construction output in the industrial sector over the next few years.  With millennium projects expected to underpin the non-housing construction market, the demand for structural steel will increase, so that Irish Steel should be able to meet its sales strategy without taking business from British Steel.</P>
    <P>The consultants therefore feel the British Steel argument about Irish Steel's viability being dependent on increasing its market share at the British company's expense is not well founded. To put it in a nutshell, demand in Europe is forecast to grow by 7 per cent but Irish Steel is expected to increase its share by only 0.5 per cent to under 9 per cent of the relevant market segment.</P>
    <P>As regards British Steel's point about Irish Steel's viability being dependent <Col N="1682" /> on it depressing market prices, the independent consultants said there was no evidence Irish Steel sold below market prices; it tended to follow British Steel's price lead.  Steel prices are highly sensitive to demand.  Over the past few months prices for steel have softened in anticipation of the seasonal downturn in construction demand during the winter. Overall steel prices should continue to enjoy a modest improvement of 2.5 per cent per annum.  The consultants also feel British Steel's arguments are not supported by the facts.  It is ludicrous to suggest a small plant could hope to survive by engaging in a price cutting strategy.</P>
    <P>Another point made by British Steel in opposition to Irish Steel's case was that its Shelton plant was an overflow plant for Scunthorpe and its existence depended on Scunthorpe having excess demand which would disappear if Irish Steel continued or increased production. The consultants were unable to see any logical link in British Steel's argument in this area.  This is plainly true, when one realises Shelton is a heavy steel mill and cannot produce the same product as Irish Steel.</P>

      <P>I met the president of the UK board of trade, Mr. Ian Lang, and the UK Minister for Industry and Energy, Mr. Timothy Eggar, in London on 5 December to discuss the UK attitude to the Irish Steel case.  Since then, the UK has been considering the points made by me and I understand that senior British officials will contact senior Irish officials within the next few days.  There is no particular action I can take to counteract the publicised move by the British Iron and Steel Producers' Association to seek a British veto at the forthcoming industry council.  However, <Col N="1683" /> I assure the Deputy I will ensure that the opposite side and the very strong Irish case is made clear to those who should know of the strength of the Irish case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry council has been specifically requested by Ireland to discuss the Irish Steel case on Wednesday 20 December.  I hope that will result in <Col N="1684" /> Britain recognising the genuineness of the Irish Steel case which is supported by 13 of the other member states plus the EU Commission and the presidency. I hope it will enable the British Government to lift its reservation.</P>

      <P>The advisory committee on third level student support found that the present system of administering student support is fragmented and very confusing for grant applicants in that there are three separate schemes administered by 70 agencies in all.  The committee recommended that the processing of grant applications and payment of grants should be transferred from the local authorities and the vocational education committees to a central agency.</P>
      <P>I share the committee's view that rationalisation of the organisational arrangements for the administration of student support is desirable and necessary. However, I have already indicated in this House that I feel it appropriate to review the Advisory Committee's recommendation for a central grant processing agency in the light of the following considerations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  Representations have been made to me to the effect that a central agency will be too remote from candidates applying for grants <Col N="1427" /> and that the present system enables the agencies at the local level to assist candidates with their queries and grant applications in a personal and user-friendly way that a central agency will not be able to do.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>The report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women concluded that the fact that so few lay female teachers become principals is a result, in part, of a lack of experience of interviewing by selection boards.  In particular, the Commission pointed to a lack of sensitivity to gender issues on the part of selection boards.</P>
      <P>The Commission also noted that most teachers believed that being male is an advantage in securing a promotion. Only a small number believed that being female is helpful in securing a promotion.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the low number of female principals relative to male principals. However, I should point out that, at primary level, matters are improving. In 1994, for instance, 59 per cent of appointments to principalships in primary schools were women.  At present, 46 per cent of principals at primary level are women.</P>
      <P>I accept, however, that given that some three-quarters of primary school teachers are women, they continue to be under-represented as principals in this sector.</P>
      <P>At second-level, the percentage of female principals has dropped from 32 per cent in 1991/92 to 30 per cent at present, in a teaching force of which 67 per cent are women.</P>
      <P>I wish to assure the Deputies that this matter is already being considered in my Department.  All the recent research in this area is being studied in this context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, the White Paper on Education, <i>Charting our Education Future,</i> states that the principal will be selected <Col N="1430" /> on the basis of procedures prescribed by the Department of Education following consultation with the relevant interests. Officials of my Department will shortly commence discussions with the partners in education regarding revised selection procedures for the appointment of principal teachers.  All the issues emerging will be taken into account in these discussions. In particular, adequate representation of both sexes on selection boards and an awareness of gender equality issues by members of boards will be addressed as part of these discussions.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 22 together.</P>
      <P>My Department has been involved in detailed discussions with the management authorities of the Presentation and CBS schools to facilitate their amalgamation. Part of the discussions involved the need to carry out alterations to the Presentation building.  An architect from my Department visited the school recently and is currently preparing plans for the necessary works.  At this stage, I expect that the work will be under way early in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1431" /> It is planned to house Gaelscoil Chorain in the former CBS school building, which is being vacated in the amalgamation process.  At present, my Department is negotiating the acquisition of this property.  Any works required to the building, which I understand would be minimal, will be carried out early in the new year.</P>
    <P>There has been no undue delay in this case.  The amalgamation process involves discussions on many issues and is therefore quite complex.</P>

      <P>Twenty-three fee charging schools, all of which are Protestant, received a block grant of £2.8 million in respect of the year 1995.  This grant is paid to the secondary education committee for distribution among needier Protestant children to enable them to attend a Protestant school.  It averages at about £122,000 per school.</P>
      <P>In addition, fee charging Protestant schools may qualify for grants in respect of a range of expenditures such as secretaries-caretakers, transition year and school books.  The total allocation of such grants to these schools, for the school year 1994-95, was £336,000 &mdash; an average of £14,600 per school.  The total allocation in respect of these grants for the second level sector was £8.5 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The total annual amount paid in respect of salaries and allowances of teachers in fee-charging schools is approximately £28 million.  Of this, approximately £10.5 million is <Col N="1432" /> accounted for by the salaries of teachers in Protestant schools.  The total teacher pay bill at second level is of the order of £584 million.</P>
    <P>Applications for capital grants by fee-paying schools are infrequent and do not give rise to a significant charge on capital resources.  In 1995, a capital grant of £580,000 was approved for one Protestant fee-paying second level school in respect of an extension.  A payment of £129,407 has been made in 1995 in respect of the project.  The balance will be paid in 1996.</P>

      <P>I am not in a position at present to make additional remedial teacher posts available to the schools mentioned by the Deputies.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, I announced the allocation of an additional 55 remedial teacher posts to primary schools.  These posts were allocated on the basis of priority of need following recommendations from my Department's Primary Inspectorate.  Account was also taken of data submitted by the applicant schools.</P>
      <P>This allocation brought the total number of remedial teachers now in place in the primary sector to 1,188.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the schools mentioned by the Deputies were not successful on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I would point out to Deputy O'Malley that both Herberstown and Patrickswell national schools already benefit from an existing shared remedial teacher service.</P>
      <P>I am keeping the question of further appointments in this area under regular review.  I can assure that the needs of all the schools in question will be taken fully into account as part of this process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage, 87 per cent of the pupils <Col N="1435" /> in our primary schools have the possibility of access to a remedial teacher. This is a big improvement on the position when I took office in 1993 when 77 per cent of pupils had the possibility of such access.

Generally, post-graduate fees are lower than undergraduate fees.  I understand that the application of the fee increases in 1995 will still leave post-graduate fees, on average, lower than undergraduate fees.</P>
      <P>The universities are required to operate within balanced budgets by the Higher Education Authority.  The budgets approved by the Higher Education Authority comprise an Exchequer grant and an amount of income to be generated by the colleges from fees and other activities.</P>

      <P>The 1995 ESRI Annual School Leavers' Survey which focuses on 1993-94 school leavers is currently being finalised.  Preliminary data from the survey indicates that there has been a substantial decline in the numbers of leavers with no qualifications from a figure of 3,300 in 1992-93.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The average annual take-up of Youthreach places in the education sector was 1,563 in the year 1994, but the overall number of places was increased <Col N="1437" /> to 2,000 at the end of that year and a further expansion of 450 places is now taking place.  This will bring the total provision in the education sector to 2,450 places, and this is complemented by approximately 900 additional foundation places funded by FÁS in Community Training Workshops.</P>
    <P>Youthreach consists of a two year programme embracing a foundation period followed by a progression phase. The progression phase is provided by FÁS through participation in a range of vocational training options, and separate figures on this element of the programme are not available.  However, an analysis of the destinations of those who completed the Foundation phase of the programme shows that 32 per cent progressed to employment, and 34 per cent progressed to further training.</P>
    <P>Measures have been put in place which are designed to ensure the retention of young people in the school system. These include:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the junior cycle schools programme, which is designed to meet the needs of a small proportion of pupils in the junior classes of second level schools who do not benefit from the junior certificate programme.  This programme is being developed at pilot level for introduction, on an expanded basis, from September 1996.</P>
    <P>The leaving certificate applied programme, which I introduced from September 1995, will prove an attractive option for those who find the existing senior cycle curriculum unsuitable.</P>
    <P>One of the main objectives of educational policy is to encourage and facilitate as many students as possible to continue in full-time education after the end of the junior cycle.  A major objective, as outlined in the White Paper on Education, is that the percentage of the 16-18 year old age group completing senior cycle will increase to at least 90 per cent by the year 2000.  This objective will be achieved through providing an <Col N="1438" /> effective foundation of general education and a strengthened and expanded vocational orientation in a restructured senior cycle.</P>

      <P>The initial implementation phase of the &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo; programme at primary level was completed in June 1995.  The teachers who were on full-time secondment have been replaced by a wider network of 40 teachers capable of supporting the programme on a part-time basis.

    <P>Initial funding of £40,000 was made available to CAPP by my Department to cover training and other costs associated with the delivery of the programme. I have agreed to provide an additional £40,000 to cover the costs which CAPP have projected for 1996.</P>

      <P>The feasibility study commissioned by my Department was received in December 1994.  The Study recommended that a 50 metre pool-leisure complex, costing an estimated £17 million, be built on a site in Tallaght Town Centre.  DISC/ISHOF have presented a proposal to provide a pool estimated to cost £25 million, exclusive of VAT.</P>
      <P>A project of this scale requires very careful consideration because of the implications for Exchequer funding of the overall capital and operating costs involved.  Other considerations to be taken into account include the need to bring existing pools in the country up to a modern standard, the demand for pools in areas not served at present and the demands from many other sports and community groups for facilities.  In short, whether an investment of this magnitude in one facility would be to the benefit of Irish Sport in general.</P>
      <P>These questions are being considered in my Department at present and a decision will be made as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>In recent years the results of applications for a recheck of leaving certificate exercises have been issued in the first week of October.  This date was decided on in 1992 following discussions between my Department and the university authorities.</P>
      <P>Some universities are now opening earlier than in 1992.  Furthermore, the Central Applications Office is now, with the co-operation of my Department, in a position to issue offers to applicants some days earlier than in previous years.  Taking everything into consideration, I have decided that in 1996 the results of rechecks of Leaving Certificate exercises will be issued on 27 September. This decision was communicated to schools by a circular letter issued on 29 November 1995.</P>
      <P>I should add that the former issue date of the first week of October was agreed with the university authorities with a view to ensuring that all candidates who qualified for admission to a course as a result of an upgrade would be admitted, in the current year, to the course in question.  I have no doubt that the issue date of 27 September in 1996 will facilitate the universities and other third-level institutions in this regard.</P>

    <P>The Position Paper sets out a careful <Col N="1443" /> and balanced approach to the implementation of Government policy, as contained in the White Paper on Education published last April.  This policy includes broadening the representation of the governing authorities of universities to include representation from the wider communities served by universities.</P>
    <P>In the preparation of the Position Paper, my Department was assisted by the advice of the Heads of the various universities, including the Provost of Trinity College.  This advice was given in their personal capacity.  My Department listened very carefully to the advice and has sought to take full account of the advice in relation to the particular needs of the universities, including Trinity College.</P>
    <P>All the institutions, including Trinity College, now have an opportunity to consider the position paper.  I am confident that such consideration will allay the fears referred to in the Deputy's question.</P>

    <P>The report examines the concept of educational disadvantage as it impacts on pupils in the education system.

The Commission will also have full regard to the key principles and policy aims set out in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The Commission will report within three months of its establishment and its report will be published.

      <P>I do not accept that the grants available to remedial teachers are inadequate.  Each remedial teacher is allocated a start-up grant of £400.  This <Col N="1447" /> is further supplemented by an annual top-up grant of £200 to fund the replacement of equipment used through the course of the school year.</P>
      <P>In 1994, I sanctioned a very substantial increase of 60 per cent in both of these grants.  The start-up grant was increased from £250 to £400 and the annual top-up grant was increased from £125 to £200.  I will continue to review the level of grants in the context of available resources and having regard to competing demands for supports in the special needs area.</P>
      <P>I should point out that the funding in question is intended to equip the remedial teacher to deliver the service to all the children on his or her case load.  This applies whether the remedial teacher is dealing with children in one or more schools.  Where schools are being served by more than one remedial teacher, the grants in question are payable in respect of each remedial teacher post.</P>

    <P>The in-career development unit of my Department has supported a number of courses on bereavement counselling for school guidance teachers.  This unit is prepared to consider further applications for support for such training. Other developments, such as supporting home-school links, have a special relevance for developing a sensitivity in schools in relation to bereavement.</P>
    <P>The Chapter in the White Paper, <i>Charting Our Education Future,</i> dealing with the role of schools in promoting the social, personal and health education of students, stresses the value of a supportive schools climate within which account is taken of pupils' personal needs.  The Health Promoting School Project, which is under way already, seeks to implement this policy.</P>

      <P>As I told the House some weeks ago, the inter-departmental committee which I established earlier this year to look into the various issues involved with regard to the taxation of cross-Border workers has met on a number of occasions and has received submissions from various parties involved.  As part of its work the committee met a number of Border county Deputies and Senators.  In addition, both the Irish National Teachers Organisation and the Cross-Border Workers Association made presentations to this committee.  I expect that the committee will shortly complete its work and will be in a position to submit its findings and recommendations to me.</P>
      <P>However, I must once again state that the issues involved are complex, involving two jurisdictions, and that there may be no easy solutions, since it may be difficult to find a solution which caters directly for the individuals affected while being fair to all the taxpayers involved i.e. both the cross-Border workers and all other Irish resident taxpayers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure under the General Medical Services Scheme on products which would be classified for colds and flu are also used as remedies for a wider range of other conditions and it would <Col N="1471" /> be misleading to interpret this expenditure as being solely in relation to colds and flu.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> The orderly transition to the new diploma programme in nurse education and training which commenced in Galway in October 1994 will of necessity take a number of years to complete.  Three new general hospital sites have commenced on the new programme in 1995.  In addition, the programme has been extended to psychiatry in Galway.</P>
      <P>I would expect that a similar number of sites will commence in October 1996 and subsequent years until the new programme has commenced in all schools of nursing.  Detailed planning is well under way with the schools scheduled for commencement in 1996.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has received numerous submissions and approaches in this regard from nursing schools and third level colleges and the intention is to agree a schedule of start-up dates for new schools coming onto the diploma <Col N="1472" /> programme from October 1997 onwards.  The Deputy will appreciate that the rate of progress actually achieved will depend on the availability of development funding for this purpose as determined in the Health Estimate each year.</P>

      <P>A sum of £500,000 was provided in my Department's 1995 estimates for an information campaign in the run up to the divorce referendum.  The estimated overall cost of the campaign to my Department, including salary costs, will be in the region of £480,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As none of the staff of my Department was engaged in referendum related work on a wholetime basis it would not be possible to determine the proportion of their salaries attributable to such work.  Salary costs amounting to <Col N="1476" /> £10,000 approx. were, however, incurred in respect of three persons seconded to my Department during the referendum campaign to provide an information service for the public.</P>
    <P>In 1994 a grant of £160,969 was awarded to the Council for the Status of Women, now the National Women's Council of Ireland, of which £20,969 was in respect of the divorce referendum.  In 1995 that body was awarded a grant of £147,895 of which £7,895 was in respect of the divorce referendum.  The council is, of course, independent of my Department in the manner in which it organises its affairs.</P>
    <P>My Department has no responsibility for or control of expenditure incurred by any of the other organisations to which the question refers, or for expenditure incurred by other Government Departments, in relation to the Divorce Referendum or any other matter.</P>

      <P>The issue raised by the Deputy is the day-to-day responsibility of the RTÉ Authority and I have no statutory function in the matter.</P>
      <P>In accordance with long-standing custom, I am prepared to furnish to the House information supplied by RTÉ in response to questions relating specifically to improvements in reception of the national broadcasting services.  In this regard RTÉ have advised that it is aware that television coverage in Monaghan Town and North Monaghan is variable and that good quality reception is difficult in certain instances.  Due to the undulating nature of the terrain, many homes do not have good reception from the RTÉ transmitter at Mongorry Hill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>RTÉ report that in the course of planned work at Mongorry Hill during <Col N="1481" /> 1996 the power emitted by the transmitter will be increased.  This will result in a partial improvement in reception.</P>
    <P>As a further improvement measure RTÉ propose to establish a new transmitter station for North Monaghan.  At present possible sites are being asssessed.  RTÉ hopes that, subject to the necessary international co-ordination, licence and planning permission, the new station for North Monaghan will be on-air during 1997.</P>

      <P>The most recent comprehensive data available to my Department are contained in the strategy document <i>Recycling for Ireland,</i> and indicate a national recycling rate of 7.4 per cent for combined household and commercial waste and 10.3 per cent for packaging waste.  More recent information indicates increased levels of recycling including, for example, industry estimates of a current overall recycling rate of 18 per cent for packaging waste.</P>
      <P>As stated in reply to Question No. 106 of 14 November 1995, the Environmental Protection Agency has commissioned a comprehensive project on waste statistics.  This will update and increase significantly the information available on waste activities generally.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the reintroduction of house improvement grants.  The Government's priorities in the housing area, as set out in <i>A <Col N="1486" /> Government of Renewal</i> and in the policy document <i>Social Housing &mdash; The Way Ahead,</i> are to expand the local authority and other social housing programmes and to upgrade deficient local authority dwellings.  As the available resources will, accordingly, be concentrated on these programmes, there are no proposals, at present, to reintroduce a house improvement grants scheme.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 96, 102 and 113 together.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year, I announced the allocation of £150,000 for a pilot scheme of grant-aid towards the provision of escorts on certain school transport services. The pilot scheme is being targeted on special schools and schools with special classes for children with disabilities. All applications for support under this scheme were carefully considered by my Department having regard to priority of need and the available resources.  I am pleased to inform the House that funding for the appointment of 35 escorts on special transport services has now been allocated to the selected schools.  The bulk of the funding has been targeted on special schools for children with physical handicaps. However, I have also allocated a sum of £25,000 towards the cost of escort services for pupils attending the special schools for hearing impaired and visually impaired children who travel long distances by bus and train at weekends.</P>
      <P>It will be a matter for the individual boards of management of the selected schools to decide on the individual routes selected for an escort service. Unfortunately, routes serving St. Paul's Special School, Montenotte and Fota, were unsuccessful in their application for support on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1491" /> I will be keeping the operation of the pilot scheme under review and the needs of the schools mentioned by the Deputy will be considered in the event of any further expansion of the scheme being undertaken.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware that I provided £2 million this year to facilitate the abolition of fees on these courses with effect from 1995-96.</P>
      <P>I am sure the House will appreciate the need to strike a balance between competing demands for resources in the education sector &mdash; between funding for the different levels of the system, between initial and second chance education, between student supports, investment in quality assurance, and special measures to combat disadvantage and under achievement.</P>
      <P>In the case of PLC courses my policy priorities to date have focused on improving the quality of the system, through investment in national certification and assessment arrangements, in programme development, in inservice training, and in ensuring that courses continue to be available in a wide range of disciplines for as many students as possible.</P>
      <P>A means-tested maintenance grants scheme for students on post leaving certificate courses would cost in excess of £9 million per annum.</P>

Factors taken into account include the incidence of unemployment, local authority housing occupancy and medical card holding among the parents of the children concerned. Account is also taken of the views of my Department's inspectorate and the prevailing pupil teacher ratios among applicant schools.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I commissioned the Combat Poverty Agency to review the adequacy of current approaches to the selection and support of schools in disadvantaged areas.  This report has now been received in my Department and provides a very valuable basis for considering our future approach to the identification and support of educational disadvantage.  My Department is currently finalising its consideration of the report and I hope to be in a position to make a further and more detailed announcement on this matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>The present system ensures that all candidates receive their results on the same day, thus minimising stress and anxiety.  While An Post can guarantee next-day delivery of the results to the 800 post-primary schools, they could not do so for delivery to the homes of 130,000 students.  The junior certificate results, and the leaving certificate results, will therefore continue <Col N="1495" /> to be sent to schools for all school-based candidates.</P>
      <P>I would also like to stress the positive role played by school principals and teachers in conveying the results directly to their students and the support which they provide to candidates who may be distressed by the results. Candidates who are disappointed can be re-assured by the principal and teachers that there are options open to them, including applying for a re-check.</P>
      <P>Up to 1995 the results of the junior certificate were issued on the second or third Wednesday in September.  This year the junior certificate results were issued on the preceding Monday.</P>
      <P>My Department has also commenced a pilot study aimed at assessing the capability of technology to read marks directly from source examination documents into the computerised examination system.  The objective is to arrive at a situation by 1998 where the junior certificate results will be issued to schools before they re-open in September.</P>

      <P>In 1992 my Department published seven <Col N="1500" /> Bills, viz. the Criminal Evidence Bill, the Censorship of Films (Amendment) Bill, the Twelfth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the Thirteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, the Criminal Justice Bill and the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993 my Department published five Bills, viz. the Criminal Law (Suicide) Bill, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, the Criminal Procedure <Col N="1501" /> Bill, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Bill and the Criminal Justice (No. 3) Bill.</P>
    <P>In 1994 my Department published five Bills, viz. the Extradition (Amendment) Bill, the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Bill, the Solicitors (Amendment) Bill, the Courts and Court Officers Bill and the Refugee Bill.</P>
    <P>In 1995 to date my Department has published five Bills, viz. the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Bill, the Transfer of Sentenced Persons Bill, the Refugee Bill, the Courts and Court Officers Bill and the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  Of those Bills, 17 have been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In addition to the Bills published in 1995 I can assure the House that during the year very substantial and satisfactory progress has been made on a wide range of other measures &mdash; particularly in the area of criminal law &mdash; which are in the course of preparation in my Department.  To mention just two examples: in recent weeks the Government approved the general schemes of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Bill and the Children Bill, which deals primarily with juvenile justice, and these are now being drafted in the parliamentary draftsman's office.</P>

    <P>The total expenditure on professional fees in respect of services rendered by 27 consultancy firms hired by my Department from January 1995 to date, in relation to prison design works or specific building projects amounted to £727,577.  In relation to the probation and welfare service the total sum expended in respect of design consultancy fees was £26,269.  It would not, however be appropriate for me to break these figures down to reveal the cost of each consultancy because of the market sensitive nature of this information.  Furthermore, in the interests of security of <Col N="1508" /> the prisons, it would not be appropriate for me to identify consultancy firms or individual consultants involved in those prisons works or specific building projects.</P>

      <P>Farming systems in Ireland are predominantly grass based and are likely to remain so. Despite the reduction in the price of concentrate feeds as a result of the reform of the CAP, these feeds are not as cheap as grass for ruminant diets.</P>
      <P>The feeding regime to be adopted in individual cases is a matter for commercial decision to be taken in the light of all the circumstances obtaining.</P>
      <P>I am anxious to encourage the production of non-food crops as a means of creating additional employment in rural areas.  In this context biomass or biofuel crops could present opportunities especially as the growing of some of these crops can be done on set-aside land without loss of set-aside benefits.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 136, 152 and 154 together.</P>
      <P>The publication of the Charter of Rights for Farmers in April of this year was a clear indication of my commitment to the improvement of the services provided by my Department to farmers. Copies of the charter have been made available to farmers through all local offices of my Department.  The charter envisaged a programme of substantially improved services for farmers to be implemented over a two year period. The payment targets set for 1995 have been largely met or indeed exceeded. This is the case especially in relation to headage and premia payments which are, of course, a primary concern of farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1523" /> The following is a summary of the progress made in implementing the charter:</P>
    <P>
      <i>Confidential Office Consultations</i>
    </P>
    <P>The programme to improve local office facilities, including provision for private and confidential office consultations, is well advanced and is set out by location in the attached table.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Help for Farmers to Minimise Errors in Application Forms</i>
    </P>
    <P>In June an effective service was provided at local marts to help farmers in completing their forms.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Speedy Response to Application Problems</i>
    </P>
    <P>In general, where problems arise with application forms the local offices are issuing letters promptly to farmers.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Appeals Procedures</i>
    </P>
    <P>The appeals unit promised in the charter is now in operation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Upgraded Telephone System</i>
    </P>
    <P>Arrangements for the introduction of this new system are well in hand.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Access to Department's Offices</i>
    </P>
    <P>The Department's offices are providing a full service to farmers during the hours 9.30 a.m.-12.30 p.m. and 2.00 p.m.-5.00 p.m.  This is a very important step in the provision of a one stop shop service.</P>
    <P>
      <i>One Stop Shop</i>
    </P>
    <P>The final steps in the provision of this service have been delayed due to industrial action.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Review Group</i>
    </P>
    <P>I will shortly be setting up the review group which will report annually on the operation of the charter.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Scheme Payments</i>

      <P>Expenditure by An Bord Bia on market development and the promotion of Irish meat on the British market amounted to approximately £1 million this year.  This expenditure has been concentrated on market development, market research, buyer contact and quality appreciation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Total exports of Irish beef to the United Kingdom amounted to approximately 114,000 tonnes in 1994. However, there are no reliable figures on the volume of Irish beef sales in British outlets which is branded as having been produced in Ireland.  However, traditionally Irish beef sold in the United <Col N="1527" /> Kingdom has not been branded as such and the bulk of our beef exports to that market are sold either unbranded or under own level brands in supermarket outlets.</P>

      <P>Immediately the presence of BSE became known in 1988 my Department initiated a campaign to alert official veterinary staff and private veterinary practitioners as to the symptoms of the disease; this included the use of relevant video material obtained from the UK authorities, which was circulated to local veterinary societies.  In addition, on numerous occasions, animals affected with BSE have been shown on various farming programmes on national television as well as the national news.  The disease is notifiable and there is an obligation on anybody who possesses a suspected animal to report the fact to the Department without delay.  As with most diseases the evaluation of clinical symptoms is a matter for appropriately qualified persons.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 139, 140 and 143 together.</P>
      <P>The position is that all animals for slaughter for human consumption are required to undergo ante and post mortem veterinary inspection.  The aim is to ensure that only healthy animals are slaughtered and that meat which is fit for human consumption enters the human food chain.</P>
      <P>Specifically, the ante-mortem examination seeks to establish, <i>inter alia,</i> whether the animal is suffering from a disease or shows symptoms of a disease which would make the meat unfit for human consumption.  In addition the animal is checked for signs or symptoms of having being administered any substance which might make its meat harmful to human health.  The condition and general welfare of the animal are also taken into account.  There are no disorders which are detectable in an ante-mortem examination which cannot be detected in a detailed post-mortem examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has implemented a comprehensive system of controls in relation to BSE.  BSE is compulsorily notifiable and the carcases of affected animals are destroyed by burial or burning under official supervision.  Every animal presented for slaughter is examined alive for signs of the disease.  All <Col N="1529" /> carcases and offal are subject to a post-mortem examination by an official veterinarian. All obvious nervous and lymphatic tissue is removed during processing. The feeding of meat and bone meal to ruminants is banned as is the importation of cattle from the United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland) except for young animals for immediate slaughter in which there is no trade.</P>
    <P>These controls go beyond what is recommended by scientific evidence or by international organisations.  I am satisfied that these controls provide more than adequate protection to Irish consumers.</P>

      <P>No figures are available in my Department in relation to the total expenditure in the State on such research.  Due to the very low incidence of the disease in Ireland, and as the availability of confirmed cases in Ireland is low by comparison with the UK, comprehensive research has not been pursued in Ireland.  The Veterinary Research Laboratory in my Department has carried out collaborative work for a research project in the UK while another project is under way in University College, Dublin.</P>

      <P>The transfer of eligibility between eligible and non-eligible land is permitted provided there is no increase in the overall area of eligible land on the holding.  All land farmed by an applicant in a particular year, including conacre land, is regarded as part of the holding for that year.  In the case of conacre land, producers have been advised to obtain the written consent of the land owner to transfer eligibility. It would not be feasible for my Department to notify individual land owners of such transfers.</P>

      <Quest>if he accepts that, in the case of an area aid application made by a person (details supplied) in County Cork, a mistake was made in his Department when transferring 1993 information onto the 1994 area aid application and that this 1994 application form was presented to the applicant as a repeat of the 1993 application form which the applicant subsequently endorsed and that this Departmental error is now prohibiting this person from an extensification premium for each of the years 1994 and 1995; and if he will have arrangements made to rectify the error and pay the premium.</Quest>

      <P>The person named declared 66.40 acres on her 1993 area aid application.  In 1994 she was sent a blank area aid application form and she declared a slightly lower figure of 64.49 acres on that application.  My Department did not transfer any 1993 details onto her 1994 application.  She completed the application herself and in doing so declared a lower acreage than in 1993.</P>
      <P>When the person named was sent her 1995 area aid application with the 1994 details pre-printed thereon she was invited to return it with any changes shown thereon if such were warranted or unchanged if no changes had taken place between 1994 and 1995.  She returned it to my Department unchanged.</P>
      <P>As the period for making justified changes in 1995 area aid applications expired on 15 May 1995 last and as the person named did not notify my Department of any such change in her 1995 area aid details by that date, I regret that it is no possible now under the relevant EU regulations to allow the 1994 or 1995 areas declared to be changed by that person or to authorise any lesser area to be used for the purpose of paying 1994 or 1995 extensification premium.</P>

      <P>In order to ensure the lowest cost and best value possible for the electricity consumer, it is envisaged that each of the bidders in the competition will select the site which they believe will be most advantageous. It will therefore be up to the builder-operator (develop) of the new station to decide where, within the east-midlands region, the new station should be located.  In making this decision the developer will take into consideration the relevant economic elements to the equation such as the availability and proximity of suitable supplies of peat, suitability of the site for the construction of a new plant and other facts, such as, the transport infrastructure required.</P>

      <P>In 1993, in the context of the Culliton/Moriarty reports, the Government announced that the mandatory off take regime at the Whitegate Oil Refinery should terminate at the end of 1996.  In response to the Government decision, the Irish National Petroleum Corporation prepared a commercialisation and development plan which was approved in December 1993.</P>

      <Col N="1542" /> The programme of investment being carried out by the INPC is funded from its internal sources and trading operations and involves over 20 individual projects.

Based on implementation to date, the plan is on target and I am confident that its realisation will enable the refinery to trade profitably in open market conditions from 1997.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a number of the regional airports have been experiencing difficulties. It was for this reason and to encourage development of the regions that my Department made arrangements for the introduction of an essential air services programme between four of those airports including Aerphort Dhún na nGall and Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that my Department put the Dublin-Aerphort Dhún na nGall route out to tender twice and that neither of the tendering procedures was successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Strict criteria are laid down, in accordance with European Regulations, with which applicant airlines have to <Col N="1543" /> comply.  The tenders received presented serious difficulties, both for my Department and the EU Commission, in relation to the suitability of the airlines and the scale of financial compensation sought for operating the service.  I cannot be any more precise for confidentiality reasons.</P>
    <P>I am arranging for a further call to tenders for the route to be inserted in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</P>
    <P>I might add that international air services should operate on a fully commercial basis and it will not be possible to introduce a subsidy in respect of such services.  It is a matter for the management of the airport to attract carriers to international routes.  Under the EU Air Transport Liberalisation package, carriers are free to operate whatever international services they wish, on the basis of their own commercial judgment.</P>

The Institute is at present carrying out a national programme of surveys into the presence of radon gas in dwellings in Ireland.  The survey, which commenced in 1992, has been completed in eleven counties and is in progress in a further six.  The survey is scheduled for completion in 1998.</P>

      <P>In July this year the Government announced its response to the report of the efficiency audit group on its review of the Defence Forces and published a document detailing the EAG report and setting out the Government's approach to the reorganisation.</P>
      <P>That document, which was entitled &ldquo;Review of the Defence Forces&mdash;1995&rdquo;, was circulated widely throughout the whole of the Defence Forces following its publication.  A considerable number of copies were made available to the Defence Forces representative bodies including the Reserve Defence Forces Association.  Copies were made available to media representatives and members of the public who expressed an interest in the document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have stated on a number of occasions that I am fully committed to a consultative approach to the review of the Defence Forces.  In line with that approach the Representative Association for Commissioned Officers and the Permanent Defence Forces Other Ranks Representative Association has recently been given a presentation on the work of the implementation group, which was set up by the Government to advance the review process.  The Reserve Defence Forces Representative <Col N="1554" /> Association will shortly receive a similar presentation.</P>

      <P>Defence Force Regulations S7 were signed on 2 July 1992.  RDFRA has not proposed any amendments to the regulations. Since the constitution and rules of the association were furnished in November 1993 and approved by its delegates in December 1993 a number of administrative changes have taken place within RDFRA which necessitate minor amendments to these documents.  These amendments are being examined within RDFRA at present and I anticipate receiving amendments which will enable me to ratify the association's constitution and rules shortly.</P>
