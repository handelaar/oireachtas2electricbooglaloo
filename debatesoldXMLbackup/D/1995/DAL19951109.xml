      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy O'Donoghue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to seek the Adjournment of the Dáil to raise an issue of the gravest national importance, the seizure yesterday of the largest consignment of illegal drugs in the history of the State and the gross inadequacy of the Government's response to the overwhelming problem of drug importation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 4 and 5.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) The following arrangements shall apply in relation to No. 4: (i) The opening statement of a Minister or Minister of State and of the main spokespersons for the Fianna Fáil Party and the Progressive Democrats Party shall not exceed 30 minutes in each case; (ii) The statement of each other Member called upon shall not exceed 20 minutes in each case: (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) A Minister or Minister of State shall be called upon to make a statement in reply; and (2) The sitting shall be suspended today directly <Col N="3" /> after the order of Business until 1 p.m.</P>

      <P>Are the proposals for dealing with item No. 4 satisfactory and agreed?  Agreed.  Is the arrangement to suspend the sitting directly after the Order of Business until 1 p.m. agreed?  Agreed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be aware that last night one of the Houses of the Oireachtas made a clear decision, in the interests of equality in the educational system, that evening and night students should receive free education. As most of these people are on low levels of pay, will the Taoiseach say whether provision will be made for them, reflecting the views of the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must know that the matter to which he refers is not strictly related to the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should imagine that the Taoiseach who, in fairness always has given due recognition to the Houses of the Oireachtas, would not ignore decisions of one of those Houses.</P>
      <P>Since the legislation to counter drug trafficking will give powers of arrest to naval officers and provide for the seven day detention of people suspected of engaging in drug trafficking, will the Taoiseach say when the relevant Bill will be published?  While on the subject, I congratulate the naval service, the Garda and the other arms of State involved in yesterday's activities although, unfortunately, it appears that the drug barons behind this haul have escaped once again.  I wish the Garda well in apprehending them.  The relevant Bill is long overdue and has been announced by the Minister several times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill will be available before Christmas.  Obviously, one <Col N="4" /> would not expect to find the drug barons in the lorry.  That they were not apprehended on the spot should not warrant the significance Deputy Ahern attaches to it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>However, we should congratulate the Garda Síochána, Revenue Commissioners and all of the State's security officers on the biggest drugs find in the nation's history rather than trying to make much of the fact that the drug barons were not found in the cab of the lorry when it was found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>While thanking the Taoiseach for the useless information he has given the House, I am very disappointed he is now ignoring the Seanad. It indicates that, in common with many others, he thinks it is irrelevant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not have to look for drug barons in lorries but perhaps the Taoiseach would instruct his Minister for Justice to endeavour to do something about catching some of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister who has been responsible, through the security forces, for the biggest drugs find in the nation's history does not need any instructions of the kind suggested by Deputy Bertie Ahern.  Rather than trying, as he does daily here, to make petty, political issues of important national questions, the Deputy should have the generosity &mdash; which he did not show&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the enormous drugs find, does the Taoiseach agree that the public might reasonably expect that arrests would be made &mdash; I sincerely hope they will be, and soon? Has the Taoiseach settled his differences with the Minister for Social Welfare and will he say when we can expect the Book of Estimates to be published?</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business yesterday our party leader questioned the Taoiseach on the paucity of promised legislation, something we have been endeavouring to do in recent weeks, when the Taoiseach, in his smug way, answered that five Bills had been published in the last two weeks.  That is <Col N="6" /> not correct and perhaps he would amend the record accordingly.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach said yesterday the Government had published five Bills in the past two weeks. This Opposition party has not received those Bills.  For the information of the House, I should say the Government published four Bills since 13 September, two of which were published on Friday last.</P>

Will he say whether its provisions will protect minority language rights in this country, or can the minority in the North learn from this how this Government treats minorities?</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach referred our party leader this morning to the Constitution.  If he studied his legislative programme he would be in a better position to give full and proper answers to the House rather than talking about invisible Bills which have not been published.

I intend to answer that question in the same manner as my august predecessor.  When the legislation is ready it will be presented to the House.  I am interested to note that the Deputy's impatience on this matter is newfound since he showed no urgency about it when his party was in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to outline to the House the steps the Government is taking to improve women's health and to inform Deputies about the preparations under way for a plan for women's health.  Why do we need a special initiative on women's health?  It is disappointing to report that in spite of the dramatic advances in women's health since the forties, the life expectancy of Irish women at birth is one of the lowest in the European Union.  The reasons for this are complex.  Mortality from heart disease in Irish women is among the highest of any of the European Union countries and is currently 70 per cent <Col N="12" /> above the European Union average. Adding years to the life expectancy of Irish women is one of the major challenges facing the health services in the next decade.  Women's health deserves special attention because it is at special risk during pregnancy and childbirth. Women's health may also be undermined because of the multiple roles which many are called on to play as a result of their economic dependence and gender based violence.  Low self-esteem linked to social and economic attitudes to women's place in Irish society inhibits many women's full development and this impacts on their health.  The high incidence of depression among women is perhaps a symptom of a deeper social problem.  Since women rely on good public health and social services to maintain their health.  We must be aware of women's vulnerability to illness and disability and actively work to promote their health.</P>
      <P>Many health services for women tend to operate independently of each other, without common objectives or links.  One gets the impression that our services are geared to deal with a breakdown in the system rather than with promoting the concept of the &ldquo;well women&rdquo;.  We need to focus on the health needs of women over their lifetime to identify how health services for women could be improved and to take action to ensure that Irish women enjoy the highest attainable standards of health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I acknowledge the role the former Oireachtas Joint Committee on Women's Rights chaired by the former Deputy Monica Barnes played in raising awareness about women's health.  In 1991 a deputation from the committee led by Deputy Monica Barnes met the Minister to outline to him the concerns of many women about the health services and the extent to which they were not responding to women's needs.  Following that meeting a women's health committee was established in the Department of Health.  This committee collected the information and research <Col N="13" /> findings on women's health which formed the basis for current initiatives on women's health.</P>
    <P>The former joint committee's concern about the response of the health services to women's health needs was echoed in the 1993 report of the Second Commission on the Status of Women.  It recommended that the Minister for Health should publish a discussion document on women's health, that there should be widespread consultation on the contents and that the Government should adopt and implement a plan for women's health.  The former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin accepted this recommendation and a commitment was made in &ldquo;Health Strategy, Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo; to the publication of such a document, to consultation and to a women's health plan. This commitment was given a new significance when it was included in our Government programme, A Government of Renewal.</P>
    <P>Last June, the first part of his commitment was fulfilled by the publication by my colleague the Minister for Health, Deputy Michael Noonan of a discussion document, <i>Developing a Policy of Women's Health.</i> At the same time he initiated the second part of the commitment, the consultative process which will lead to the adoption by Government of a plan for women's health early next year.  I was particularly pleased that prior to the publication of the discussion document, the Council for the Status of Women now renamed the National Women's Council of Ireland, agreed to assist with the consultative process on the discussion document so that the plan for women's health will be informed by the authentic and representative voice of women.  Over 130 organisations are members of the National Women's Council representing over 300,000 women in the Republic.</P>
    <P>The discussion document looks at the health services from a woman's point of view.  It analysis the health status of Irish women and pinpoints the main causes of morality and morbidity among women.  The main causes of premature <Col N="14" /> death among Irish women &mdash; that is deaths among women under 65 years &mdash; are cardiovascular disease, cancer, especially of the breasts and lungs and accidents.  Following the principles of the health strategy the document looks at the scope for preventing premature mortality and increasing health and social gain.  The document points out that there is great scope for reducing premature mortality in women, principally by a reduction in smoking, by screening for breast and cervical cancer and by good nutrition.  The discussion document examines health issues particular to women, such as childbirth and gynaecology, breast and cervical cancer and violence against women.  It commends the high quality of care in our maternity services but advocates a more consumer friendly approach by the hospitals and staff involved in the care of expectant mothers.  The challenge to our health and education services of teenage pregnancy outside a stable relationship is highlighted in the document.</P>
    <P>The document identifies health issues which predominantly affect women, such as family planning and support for carers, and issues which affect women differently from men, including drug dependence, mental illness and dental health.  It records recent initiatives on these issues and suggests where further action is needed.  The problem of accessing health services by disadvantaged women such as women with disabilities, traveller women and women in advanced old age is discussed.  The need for greater consultation and representation of women in the health service is highlighted and suggestions are made as to how the voice of women could be more clearly heard on the health services. The discussion document concludes by suggesting priorities for tackling the main health problems of women to be addressed in the plan for women's health to which the Government is committed.</P>
    <P>In choosing priorities for inclusion in the plan for women's health, it is clear that the most serious causes of mortality and morbidity among Irish women <Col N="15" /> should receive attention.  There is no doubt that cigarette smoking is the single greatest cause of premature death and preventable illness among Irish women.  There is a direct link between smoking and the very high level of mortality from heart disease among Irish women.  I realise that smoking is not usually seen as a &ldquo;women's&rdquo; health issue but, given the scale of harm it causes to women, we must give a high priority to persuading as many women as possible to stop smoking and prevent as many girls as possible from taking up the habit.  I will refer later to the most recent initiative on smoking.</P>
    <P>Cancer claims the lives of thousands of Irish women each year.  A proportion of these deaths could be prevented.  We could wipe out most forms of lung cancer by persuading women to stop smoking.  We could reduce deaths from breast cancer in women over 50 by one third by screening women aged 50 to 64 for the disease.  We could prevent about 40 of the 75 deaths from cervical cancer each year by a programme of screening of women aged 30 to 50 years.</P>
    <P>A further priority suggested in the document is making our maternity services more responsive to the expectations of mothers and partners for more individual care and greater involvement in decision making.  Our services must also respond more effectively and in a more co-ordinated way to women who are the victims of domestic violence and rape.</P>
    <P>We know that the health of women in the travelling community is much worse than that of other women and the document suggests that their health needs should receive particular attention in the plan for women's health.  The under-representation of women at most levels in the health services also needs to be addressed, and more research is needed about women's health needs.</P>
    <P>While there is much to be done in this country, the health problems of women in many countries of the world are so great that they demand our attention and assistance.  Ireland has a long and <Col N="16" /> distinguished record of aid to the developing world, much of which has benefited women.  The discussion document suggests that we need to strengthen our commitment to improving women's health in the developing world and the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>These priorities were identified in the discussion document to focus discussion during the consultative process which will lead to a plan for women's health.  I have no doubt that these priorities will be modified and possibly changed as a result of consulting women on what they consider to be the most important issues affecting their health.</P>
    <P>The consultative process on the discussion document began immediately after publication.  The first step in this process was a conference held on Friday, 30 June 1995 on the discussion document organised jointly by the Department of Health and the National Women's Council.  Representatives of every organisation affiliated to the council were invited, as well as representatives of health boards, professional organisations and many voluntary bodies active in the field of health. Over 200 people attended the conference, which I had the pleasure of opening.  Contributors included Noreen Byrne, Chairperson of the National Women's Council, Dr. Freda O'Neill, the Department's medical adviser on women's health, Maureen Gaffney, Chairperson of the National Economic and Social Council, and Deputy Frances Fitzgerald.</P>
    <P>The conference was most successful. It confirmed the positive way in which the discussion document has been received by all those interested in women's health.  Participants made useful suggestions about the way in which the consultative process should be carried out.  They also identified issues which were not included in the discussion document but which they felt should be addressed in the plan.</P>
    <P>Following the conference, the Secretary of my Department wrote to the chief executive officer of each health <Col N="17" /> board about the discussion document and the consultative process.  Health boards were asked to consider the discussion document at one of their regular meetings, to actively pursue consultation on the document and to nominate a senior member of staff to act as a coordinator for the consultative process. Each board has since appointed a coordinator to ensure that the consultative process is as wide and deep as possible. Each board is taking steps to consult women by way of well publicised public meetings, seminars and workshops on the document or issues in it.  Women have been invited to make submissions on the document through local newspapers and local radio.  A number of boards are consulting their own female staff on the document.  As women and employees of health boards, they are a particular source of expertise on women's health and women's experience of the health services.  I am glad that two health boards, the North-Eastern and North-Western, have, independently of the discussion document, consulted women about how health services for women can be improved.  In these two boards, consultation on the discussion document will take place on a strong foundation.</P>
    <P>My Department has also agreed with the National Women's Council on how consultation with women at regional and local level can best be organised. The aim is to tap the resources of the boards and women's organisations to make sure that as many women as possible are given an opportunity to comment on the document and identify priorities for the plan.  The council is particularly keen that marginalised women are consulted and that the consultative process is as participative as possible.</P>
    <P>With assistance from my Department, the council has employed a project officer to work closely with member organisations of the council and the health boards to ensure that the expectations of the National Women's Council of the consultative process are met.</P>
    <P>Consultation is also taking place with <Col N="18" /> other groups concerned with or involved in women's health.  Submissions have been invited on the discussion document from interested organisations and individuals.  On Friday, 20 October, the Department of Health, with the Congress of Trade Unions, held a joint conference of women's health which provided women trade unionists with the opportunity to examine the document in detail and express their views on the contents of the plan for women's health.</P>
    <P>Following consultation on the discussion document, the Department of Health will begin developing a comprehensive plan for women's health for adoption by the Government early next year and implementation over the next few years.  This plan will provide a focus for improving the health of Irish women, addressing the needs of women who are vulnerable to ill health and improving the responsiveness of the health services to women.</P>
    <P>I stress that this document is not an excuse to hold up developments which will promote women's health or reduce illness among women.  Even since the discussion document was published, decisions have been taken on some issues where there is general agreement that progress should be made.  Funding has been allocated for counselling women with crisis pregnancies and research has been commissioned on the reasons women with crisis pregnancies seek terminations abroad.  A tribunal to assess compensation on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis of women infected with the hepatitis C virus as a result of receiving anti-D blood products is being established. On 6 October last, the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, announced the expansion of the breast cancer screening programme which has been piloted by the Eccles Street project.  The first phase of the expanded programme will, it is hoped, be commenced by the end of this year.  It will cover the Eastern, North Eastern and Midland Health Board areas.  It will target 120,000 women in <Col N="19" /> the age cohort 50 to 64, which represents 50 per cent of the national target population.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health is putting in place the organisational structures and arrangements to support the commencement of the first phase.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to honour a commitment in the health strategy, &ldquo;Shaping a Healthier Future&rdquo;, when I launched the health promotion strategy in July last.  It was the first document of its kind to be launched in Ireland.  The health promotion strategy targets premature mortality amongst women and men.  Most importantly it identifies goals and targets and it is in pursuit of these that a significant improvement in the health status of the population can be achieved.  Improving the health status of women will receive a high priority in the implementation of the health strategy.  It addresses the prerequisites for the success of a national strategy.</P>
    <P>In this context it is vital to acknowledge that many people and organisations have a role to play in achieving improvements in health status.  Health promotion takes place in the home, school, community and workplace and it is by co-ordinated, targeted actions in these settings that improvements will be made.  Achieving better health status is in the interests of a large number of key organisations in the public, private and voluntary sectors.</P>
    <P>Whilst the health promotion unit of my Department will play a pivotal role it it only by multi-sectoral involvement and participation that the healthier choice will become the easier one to make.  It is the individual, equipped with appropriate knowledge and skills and supported by a healthy environment, whom I want to see enabled to exercise the healthier choice as a result of this strategy.  Not only will individuals be more likely to enjoy their full potential in life but our country will benefit economically and socially.  A multi-sectoral consultative committee on health promotion has been established and will <Col N="20" /> soon begin to make a vital contribution to health promotion.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the importance this Government gives to health promotion and the serious risk posed to the nation's health by smoking, I was pleased to launch a comprehensive action plan to reduce smoking in May this year.  The five main features of this plan are: a reduction of 5 per cent in the advertising and sponsorship budgets of tobacco companies in Ireland from January, 1996; a strengthening and widening of the regulations which prohibit smoking in certain public places; a review of the voluntary code on smoking in the workplace &mdash; this initiative was put in place last summer and the feedback is being received from various companies from which a report should be completed in 1996; implementation of supports for the retail sector to assist it in observing the law on the sale of cigarettes to children.  I look forward to the initiative in this area which will be launched later in the month by the health boards' chief executive officers with the support of the Irish Heart Foundation.  There will be a continued development of health education programmes designed to increase awareness of the dangers of tobacco.  Steps have already been taken with the development of the Smokebusters programme which is being made available to selected primary schools and the SCRAP programme for secondary schools which I launched recently.  Both programmes us a peer-led education approach with a view to encouraging children and adolescents to develop the skills necessary to resist the pressure to become a regular tobacco user and to take responsibility for their own health.</P>
    <P>As part of this plan, I launched a new media campaign last Monday which aims to persuade smokers to stop smoking and young people to avoid taking up the habit.  The theme of the campaign is &ldquo;say what you like &mdash; smoking kills!&rdquo;. The campaign is targeted at three groups of the population &mdash; young girls, smokers aged 30-45 and smokers in the <Col N="21" /> lower income groups.  We attach particular importance to stemming the uptake of smoking among girls and young women.  We want to counteract the peer pressure on young girls to smoke and the inference of some tobacco advertising that it is sophisticated for women to smoke.  We recognise the difficulties of persuading women in the lower income groups to give up smoking. For women on low incomes it is more than just a habit; it may be one of the few sources of pleasure in their difficult lives.  We have engaged the Centre for Health Promotion Studies at University College Galway to undertake an indepth examination of the effectiveness of the campaign so that we can gauge the results and inform our decisions on future initiatives in this area.</P>
    <P>I am proud to say that the discussion document, Developing a Policy for Women's Health, is the first of its kind to be produced by a Government of the European Union.  The publication of this document opened, for the first time, a major process of consultation on the health needs of women and the capacity of present services to meet them.  It represents an important step towards positive equality of women in the health sphere to which they are entitled as a matter of social justice.  I am pleased that there is full and active participation in this process by a wide variety of organisations and people interested in women's health.  I look forward to hearing the many views and observations the document will provoke and to seeing them reflected in the plan for women's health.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire as ucht go bhfuil tuarascáil bhreá den chineál sin againn inniu agus go bhfuil díospóireacht ar siúl sa Teach mar gheall air, an chéad uair, sílim, go raibh aon díospóireacht againn chomh fada is a bhain sé le cúrsaí sláinte na mban.  Creidim gur dul chun cinn é. Tá sé tábhachtach go gcuirfí na moltaí atá san tuarascail i bhfeidhm agus <Col N="22" /> beimid ag brath ar an Aire len é sin a dhéanamh agus ag faire air go speisialta go ndéanfaidh sé rud cinnte ina thaobh sin.</P>
      <P>It puzzles me that when people talk about the progress women have made it is always in terms of their careers, roles and positions.  For example, they tend to talk about women in politics, the fact that there is a female President and women in management.  What is more important is that there should be a widespread general sense among women that they are more in control of what they do with their lives and their health. Rarely do we have an opportunity to discuss women's health issues in the House other than discussing a specific aspect during Private Members' time or at Question Time.</P>
      <P>This debate is welcome and timely because of the ongoing concerns regarding hepatitis C and other health issues. It arises from a commitment in the document <i>Shaping a Healthier Future</i> which was published in 1994 by the previous Government of which I was a member.  It is an important document because it charts a future course for the health services generally.  There was provision within the health strategy for various discussion documents to be brought forward as a matter of priority. This document was promised as part of that strategy.</P>
      <P>Women's health requires special attention because of the major role women play in society.  Until now there has been neither sufficient debate nor action on the issue.  Even though women make up over half the population, issues concerning their health do not tend to receive either the media coverage or discussion time they deserve.  Some of this stems from the broader problems in society regarding women's issues: they are slotted into a male driven agenda. Hopefully this document will mark a turning point and from now on they will be placed at the top of the agenda.  It is important that this is so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Women play a key role in society. Their reproductive role places them at a considerable health risk.  They work <Col N="23" /> under great stress fulfilling many roles at the same time.  We all know women who are economically dependent and they will ensure their children's or partner's health is taken care of before their own.  In some cases by the time they get around to taking care of their own health it is too late.  We need to educate women and empower them to take control of their health.</P>
    <P>A broader issue which must be discussed is the representation of women in the health services.  Most of the top management posts in the health sector are occupied by men and the absence of women at senior levels in the health service means pressure groups are often the only bodies that articulate women's perspectives.  The representation of women in health service posts is an important and urgent matter that needs to be tackled.  Who better to know the types of health services necessary and how those services should be managed than women?</P>
    <P>This discussion document makes disturbing reading.  It quickly dispels the popular myth that Irish women are among the healthiest in Europe and that the health care provided for them is adequate.  The document shows that the life expectancy of Irish women at birth is one of the lowest of any member state of the European Union.  For women aged 40 Ireland has the lowest life expectancy of any EU member state. This discussion document rightly notes that there is considerable scope to add years to the lives of Irish women.  One of the recurring themes in the document is the importance of education in terms of women's health.  Education is necessary in regard to diet and lifestyle so that there can be a reduction in the mortality rates of women.  At present the main causes of death among Irish women under 65 are cardiovascular disease and cancer.  Deaths from heart disease are higher than the EU average. This emphasises the importance of education in terms of risk factors such as smoking in particular, hypertension, high fat diet and sedentary lifestyle.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> The discussion document notes the higher prevalence of cancer and depression among female general practice attenders than among men.  It highlights that women in lower socio-economic groups are more likely to be admitted to psychiatric hospitals, have a higher prevalence of chronic conditions and are more likely to develop cervical cancer than women in the higher socio-economic groups.</P>
    <P>The report notes the absence of good research on the health of women in low socio-economic groups.  It must be a priority therefore to establish the state of women's health generally and the socio-economic factors that influence it. Since women in the lower socio-economic grouping are very often economically dependent they almost always take care of everybody else's health problems, in the same way as they take care of other problems, except their own.  By the time they get around to looking after their own health problems it is often too late.</P>
    <P>There is great scope for the Department of Health through the health boards and health centres &mdash; which have a network although it is not as efficient and widespread as we would wish &mdash; to establish in conjunction with all the voluntary women's groups which exist in every area and do much good work, a health education policy that gets through to all women.  For instance, in the past the Department of Health under various Ministers implemented very effective health education policies particularly in regard to smoking.</P>
    <P>This debate is timely as we have recently witnessed one of the biggest health tragedies in the State, that is the infection, between 1970 and 1994, of more than 1,000 mothers with hepatitis C through the contaminated blood product anti D.  As we now know, there are other infected groups such as haemophiliacs and those who received blood transfusions.  We do not know at this stage how many of those will come forward or will be detected under the national screening programme.  Hepatitis C is a serious and potentially life <Col N="25" /> threatening virus for which there is no effective cure.  As we are aware from the report of the expert group that examined the Blood Transfusion Service Board, contamination occurred because the Blood Transfusion Service Board failed to follow its own standards for donor selection and to heed clear warning that the product was contaminated.</P>
    <P>The discussion document, <i>Developing a Policy for Women's Health,</i> makes a two page reference to contamination in this case and outlines the historical position.  It is a presentation that needs radical rewriting in view of the findings of the expert group.  The Miriam Hederman O'Brien report is a very valuable document and we have yet to discuss it either in this House or in the Select Committee on Social Affairs.  I hope the Minister gives us an opportunity to discuss that report at some time in the future.</P>
    <P>The Minister's document refers to the &ldquo;comprehensive counselling programme&rdquo; of the Blood Transfusion Service Board.  That is the service strongly criticised by women who turned to it for help when they found they had hepatitis C since they were questioned about their lifestyles whether they had their ears pierced recently, whether they had tattoos applied to any part of their body and so on.  The expert group believed that service was not an appropriate one from the Blood Transfusion Service Board. There are many counties &mdash; Cork, Limerick, Clare, Kerry, Waterford, Tipperary, Roscommon, Leitrim, Carlow and Longford &mdash; that still do not have an independent counselling service for infected women and their families. Nearly two years after this terrible tragedy unfolded there is no designated independent professional counsellor in those areas to whom women can turn for the help they need.  The Minister will agree that is totally unacceptable.  It highlights a failure to fulfil the commitment to meet the needs of infected women.</P>
    <P>In his policy document the Minister <Col N="26" /> states that services for persons identified under the national screening programme will be available for as long as they are required.  That is a laudable aspiration but it lacks the clear guarantees needed which infected people deserve.  I would be the first to admit it is impossible for any Minister or Department to say now what the future health needs of this group will be, but just as the seriousness of the health problems these women will face cannot be determined, neither should they be dismissed.  Some women have already died as a result of the hepatitis C infection. The State has an absolute obligation to meet all the health needs of infected women.</P>
    <P>The document also refers to the Government's commitment to establish a tribunal to pay fair compensation to infected women.  The <i>ad hoc</i> tribunal proposal put forward by the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, has virtually met with a stone wall from the voluntary groups representing those infected.  As a result of pressure from those groups, an announcement was made by Fianna Fáil that it would publish a Bill to put the tribunal on a statutory basis.  There was an indication from our colleagues in Opposition that they would support such a Bill and a motion was put before the Seanad last week on the tribunal. The Minister has entered into what I hope are genuine negotiations and discussions with the groups involved.  I hope those discussions will be fruitful and will have a satisfactory result for the women infected and their representatives. However I warn that these discussions must be brought to a conclusion by the first week in December.</P>
    <P>I hope that time limit will be adhered to because it would not be beneficial if negotiations were to again break down and the Minister and his Department went off on one tangent while the women's groups, with support from the Opposition, went off on another.  I am sure the discussions would be supported by everybody as they would be a beneficial development.  If they fail, the Bill introduced will provide for the findings <Col N="27" /> of the tribunal being placed on a statutory footing and we will push that to a vote in this and the other House.</P>
    <P>The experience of women with hepatitis C raises the wider question of women's access to health services.  That is an important consideration in the formulation of policy.  I would welcome research detailing women's experience of the health services which would be a useful input to the type of discussion that will and has arisen following the publication of this document.  We do not know how many women have a regular general practitioner, if they make appointments with their doctors or how long women, often with children, have to wait in surgeries even when they have appointments.  We also do not know if women find they can talk freely to a general practitioner about family planning, menopausal difficulties, sterilisation and other issues.  The Minister gives a commitment in this document to make available a comprehensive family planning service before the end of 1995. There is little more than six weeks left before the end of the year and I do not have evidence of the availability of such a comprehensive family planning service &mdash; not just to the major towns and cities but also available through general practitioners in health centres throughout rural areas &mdash; where there is a major need and a demand for such a service for women.  Research in this area carried out on behalf of the Department would be beneficial as it would highlight the weaknesses and strengths in different areas and one could be balanced against the other.  The benefit of positive results in certain areas could be applied to those with negative results in regard to women who do not have as comprehensive a health service as they would like.  Often, women seeking a comprehensive family planning service must travel a long distance from their area to gain access to it.</P>
    <P>Another aspect not addressed, or one I could not find, in the report is the issue of the location of health centres.  Given <Col N="28" /> that part of the constituencies represented by the Minister of State and I are in rural areas, he will be aware that such a service is not available in many of them.  In other areas they may be located in places to which women find it difficult to gain access.  In some towns and villages the health centre is often a health hazard.  For many years such centres may have been neglected perhaps because the health boards have not invested in upgrading local health centres as they consider other areas of health care deserve a higher priority.  If we are to provide as comprehensive a health service as the Minister of State and I would like, the health boards must spend small amounts of money necessary in many instances to upgrade health centres.  Health boards provide limited services in certain areas and that issue must also be addressed.</P>
    <P>Women's access to hospitals is another important matter that must be discussed in the context of this document.  The move towards the location of major hospitals in key areas makes a good deal of economic sense to the Exchequer, but the cost of making trips to such hospitals which may be located a long distance from women in low socio-economic groups must also be considered.  I am aware from my time in Government that when a proposal is put forward that will incur a good deal of money it must be balanced against the best decision in terms of the Exchequer. That issue is like others we were sensitive in dealing with while in Government. A social as well as a cost factor in terms of the Exchequer must apply to such decisions.</P>
    <P>Services can be made available in certain areas.  For example, in my constituency it was the trend for many years for general practitioners to set up practices in areas and remain in them until their retirement.  They provided an excellent basic service to the local people.  Suddenly, a young, bright go-ahead general practitioner arrived, took account of the fact that he was living 50 miles from Galway city, decided it was unfair for this patients who have the same health <Col N="29" /> problems as those who live in a city to be so far removed from an ambulance service and did something about it.  He got the community involved and took a lead role in organising a fund-raising campaign with the assistance of the Order of Malta, a voluntary group, to provide an ambulance in his area.  Such initiative was unheard of in that area previously and that general practitioner is from the same county as the Minister of State.  The general practitioner took another initiative.  He noticed that small operations were carried out in day care facilities in the local hospital and he questioned why he should send his patients to that facility in the University College Hospital in Galway which would clog up the system when he could perform them in his surgery.  He put forward a proposal in that regard to his local health board and he now performs such day care surgery in his practice. Health boards should consider that issue and it should not fall to one individual with bright ideas to use his initiative to address those problems. Health boards and the Department of Health could learn from such practitioners. If more responsibility were given to general practitioners, many procedures carried out in accident and emergency departments of hospitals in the period from December to February could be reduced.  Such minor emergencies could be dealt with in a day care facility in a well equipped health centre attached to a general practitioner's practice.  That would save a good deal of money.  I gave that example to highlight the initiative taken by a general practitioner for whom things have worked out very well.</P>
    <P>Maternity services are crucial to the health and well-being of women.  The task force which has been established is welcome.  I hope it considers matters such as the length of time women are kept waiting for parental care and the presence, without consent, of medical students at the time of birth and during examinations.  Some women find their presence offensive.  This issue is not only confined to but particularly relates to <Col N="30" /> maternity services.  Female patients find that their consultants who make their rounds with six or ten medical students in tow is an invasion of their privacy and their consent is never asked before such an entourage arrives.  That area should be considered by the task force.</P>
    <P>Many women express concern about the lack of opportunity to ask questions about their pregnancy during hospital visits and when in hospital.  We must remember that we in the House are articulate and would always ask questions irrespective of whom we would be dealing with, but many women do not ask questions about their health and sometimes feel intimidated.  The task force should consider this matter.</P>
    <P>The issue of breast-feeding raised in the document is important and must be treated sensitively.  On the one hand, women may not be given enough encouragement to breast-feed their babies, but on the other, people may be over zealous in pushing that method. When my first child was born 21 years ago ten babies were born on the same day and eight of the ten mothers bottlefed their babies.  When my second child was born 16 years ago 12 babies were born on the same day and ten of the 12 breastfed their babies.  That was a major change in five years, probably as a result of a change in hospital policy.  It was not that anybody was over zealous but an effort was made in the hospital to give information to expectant mothers when they called for their examinations prior to their confinement.  Breast-feeding is recommended and provides a defence mechanism to a child against infection. It is an issue that should be dealt with sensitively.</P>
    <P>The latest FÁS report on its Dublin services indicates that the number of women at work in the capital city rose by 50 per cent over the past 20 years while the number of men remained static.  That interesting statistic points to the importance of healthcare in the workplace for women especially in relation to chemical hazards.  The Department of Health can play a positive and supportive role in regard to <Col N="31" /> this.  However, the Department with responsibility for labour affairs has to take the lead.  That Department is responsible for FÁS and NISO and it should take advice from the Minister's Department and implement it.  The State services, where many women are employed whether in Departments or semi-State companies, should show the way and the Departments responsible for labour affairs must be vigilant.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the abortion information Bill all Members, including the Minister, expressed concern at the lack of counselling for women in crisis pregnancies. It is important that proper counselling is available to women at every stage during this crisis in their lives and it should be State supported. Caring and compassionate counselling must be widely available and it was agreed at the time of the abortion debate that resources would be provided.  The Minister was in agreement that education counselling services must be available to general practitioners who are the first professionals to be consulted by a women in a crisis pregnancy.  I hope the Minister will tell us what progress has been made in regard to counselling because there was a definite commitment to it.</P>
    <P>The main reason women are more in control in the area of health is the better flow of information.  Cancer is a word seldom spoken, other than in hushed tones.  It was viewed as such a threat to health that people closed their minds to it and refused to try to come to terms with it.  That has changed.  Today we have a greater awareness of the disease, how to prevent certain forms of it and how to cope with it.  It would be wrong to overstate the progress that has been made and I do not want to falsify the picture in relation to breast cancer, one of the major unsolved problems and threats in medicine today.  It is the second most common cause of death in women between 25 and 35 years of age and the most common cause of women's death in the middle years.</P>
    <P>I mention those grim facts because it <Col N="32" /> is important not to lose sight of the threat this disease poses.  We should not stop supporting research into it or sharing information which can prevent it. The fact that breast cancer still presents a profund theat to women does not mean there has not been progress. There has been a great increase in the level of awareness of the disease and a radical improvement in detection methods.  Better options are available to women who have had surgery to excise such cancer.  A network of services &mdash; but not enough &mdash; and human supports are available to help women following surgery.  The last group is worthy of special mention because women who have been through the ordeal and who are devoting a good part of their time to helping other women to get through the trauma need support.  No treatment, whether surgical or chemical, compares with that simple human support.</P>
    <P>This worthwhile document raises many issues.  It has allowed people to debate many issues.  This is not confined to women but to many organisations and groups.  I look forward to the Minister receiving many submissions on the document and I will be interested to hear what the health boards have to say. I hope my contribution will be helpful. I will support any initiative to put in place a better health policy for women in each of the health board regions.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity on behalf of the Progressive Democrats to participate in a debate on women's health.  As Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said, it is a rare opportunity for us to address, in a positive fashion, women's health and well being as distinct from items of legislation which tend to deal with particular crises, such as the abortion information legislation and family planning legislation which was introduced over a long period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years a policy on women's health lacked the participation and subjective experience of women because women were not involved where the policy was being formulated.  As Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn said, there are very <Col N="33" /> few women involved in the higher echelons of policy making.  In the main, it is left to lobby groups and the umbrella group, the National Women's Council, to feed in the experience of women as a social partner to the formulation of policy.  This has marked a great improvement in reflecting women's experience in the formulation of health policy. Unless women Members participate in debates such as this, and in our committee system, and unless women are appointed to the higher levels of public policy making outside the House there will continue to be a democratic deficit in relation to policy issues on women's health.</P>
    <P>I welcome this discussion document which contains many good ideas. However, many of the ideas come from the 1994 health strategy, <i>Shaping a Healthier Future,</i> most of which are recommendations outlined by the Second Commission on the Status of Women in 1993.  There is a danger of becoming bogged down in a paralysis of analysis on the various issues.  There is no substitute for one definite initiative when it comes to issues on women's health.  We could end up dealing with aspirational reports for a long time.  I accept that women's health has been making steady progress.  This relates to the greater economic independence of women and more control.  It is accepted at public policy level that women have a right to control their own fertility which for many years was not accepted by the State.</P>
    <P>A matter I wish to raise about the document reflects my own experience. The document is firmly entrenched in conventional medicine.  At no stage in the report is there an acknowledgment that many thousands of women in Ireland have abandoned conventional medicine and have opted for alternative medicine.  There is a medical prejudice against non-conventional medicine but this is not reflected in reality because many women have decided to move away from the drug-based prescription <Col N="34" /> for every ill and have opted for methods such as homeopathy, healing, herbalism, reflexology and aromatherapy.  It is extraordinary that in all the policy documents we debate in the House, and in all the responses from Government and State agencies, there is not even a mild acknowledgement of that sphere of alternative medicine which is so popular, particularly among women.  I question whether there is a prejudice among the powers that be in medicine against alternative methods.</P>

      <P>A silent revolution is taking place.  The choice is being made by women on how to keep well.  This debate would be devoid of reality if we did not acknowledge that hepatitis C has had a disastrous effect on women's health.  That so many women were infected by this virus because of negligence by the State is appalling.  I know discussions are ongoing, with a December deadline, but these women should be given whatever they want.  My party will support placing the tribunal on a statutory basis if satisfactory negotiations are not completed between the representative groups and the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government's response has been inadequate in terms of the availability of counselling on a nationwide basis.  It is tragic that the main negotiators in this whole affair are the victims.  These courageous women, victims of State negligence, are required to go through protracted and detailed legal negotiations with the Government to get what they want and to assure themselves that their long-term health needs will be guaranteed.  Although there has been goodwill on the part of the Minister and the Government, they should be in a position to be satisfied with whatever deal is negotiated.  In other countries people would be in jail as a result of this episode.  Here, as usual, there has been a flight from accountability and voluntary resignations with golden handshakes. <Col N="35" /> The report by Dr. Hederman-O'Brien must be debated by a committee of this House because its implications are serious.</P>
    <P>Women bear the major brunt of the effects of unemployment and poverty in addition to having the responsibilities of child care, care of the elderly and the disabled members of our society.  Consequently, women are more likely to become ill and in general to be more dependent on health services.  For these reasons, even if health policies in principle do not appear to discriminate against women, it is vitally important that when health policy is being considered, its effects on women are taken into account and their specific needs considered.  This gender based approach, therefore, to the formulation of health policy is justified in the case of women because women's health issues are different from those of men.  This House must concentrate specifically, at policy and discussion document level, on issues which particularly affect men's health such as the uniquely high rate of suicide among young men.</P>
    <P>Health services account for approximately 20 per cent of all Government spending.  The existing health services, with varying degrees of success, attempt to meet a wide span of needs.  The Commission on the Status of Women made a wide range of recommendations recognising that the delivery of a responsive and comprehensive health service would make a significant difference to the quality of women's lives. Those recommendations were made almost three years ago and we are still discussing them.</P>
    <P>Depression is a major cause of illness among women.  Approximately 38 per cent of all admissions of women to psychiatric hospitals are related to depression.  That figure is from the Annual Report on Health Statistics, 1993, published today.  Overwork and putting their dependant's needs before their own have contributed to low esteem of women and subsequent depression.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="36" /> In the past, too much emphasis was placed on drugs as a treatment for depression in women.  Many women now use alternative medicine such as reflexology and aromatherapy to treat the symptoms of depression.  Those forms of alternative medicine are not available in the public health service because there is not any recognition that they exist.  If the State recognised them they would be much cheaper than conventional medicine.</P>
    <P>Women are the main users of the health system either for themselves or their families.  By virtue of pregnancy and childbirth women are particularly vulnerable to ill health.  While women may live longer than men, the quality as well as the length of their lives must be examined.  Figures show that at the age of 40, women in Ireland have the lowest level of life expectancy of all women in the EU.  This document focuses on reducing premature mortality in women by reducing smoking, extending breast and cervical screening and ensuring proper nutrition.</P>
    <P>In doing this there is a danger we might be drawn into creating a parallel health care service for women.  We already have a good GP service network and if the primary health care system was enhanced by virtue of a good GP network, it would be more responsive to women's needs.  Women like to have their health needs addressed at local level at the first possible and most convenient point of contact.  There is great scope for an economic enhancement of medical services by extending GP services around the country.  The Minister seems to be in agreement with this principle as at the recent European medical conference in Dublin Castle, he said that specialist services should not be duplicated in any health board region.</P>
    <P>Governments all over the world spend huge amounts of money on their health services.  We must ensure that more money is allocated to primary care and to streamlining expensive high technology medical services.  Excessive duplication should be eliminated.  A greater enhancement of primary care is <Col N="37" /> the best way forward, particularly in relation to women because many do not have transport and their best health needs can be met at local level by their GP.  Access to laboratory and physiotherapy services would cost less than funding high technology hospital services, to which we all aspire, but when we are talking about an area of limited resources and a relatively small population, we do not have the opportunity of providing high technology services around the country.</P>
    <P>Primary care services should be better developed in relation to health education. The discussion document outlines the dangers posed to women's health by smoking, heart disease, lung and cervical cancer.  It is fair to say that the increased life expectancy and the improvement in women's health through the years has not come from medical improvements but by changes in lifestyle and in the environment. Given that they come in contact with approximately 90 per cent of their patient population over a three year period and that women of childbearing years have the highest attendance at surgeries, general practitioners are in an ideal position to implement the health educational aspects of this document. Women should be entitled to avail of a full medical check-up by their GP every two years.  This would involve a breast examination &mdash; despite the fact that breast cancer is the main killer among women most of them do not carry out this examination &mdash; a smear test and advice on diet, nutrition, the dangers of smoking, family planning, HRT and the menopause.  This would not involve a huge cost to the State and would greatly improve the quality of life and health of all women.  We could substantially improve primary health care by using the existing GP network and the detailed knowledge GPs have of the family history, social background, etc. of their patients.</P>
    <P>Cancer accounts for approximately 20 per cent of deaths among women.  Cancers of the lung, large bowel and stomach account for the largest number of <Col N="38" /> deaths among both sexes while cancer of the breast accounts for the largest number of deaths among women. Ireland ranks fourth highest in the EU in terms of the number of deaths from breast cancer.  I welcome the breast screening initiative recently announced by the Minister which will eventually ensure a national breast screening programme for women over 50.  Mammography screening has not yet proven to be totally effective for women under 50. The most effective method of screening for younger women is regular breast examination.  However, some women are not fully aware of the importance of these examinations and unfortunately many of them do not carry them out on a regular basis.  We could make some impact in this respect by improving GP services and ensuring that women have bi-annual check ups.</P>
    <P>In 1993 cervical cancer accounted for 74 deaths.  While screening for cervical cancer is simple, quick and relatively inexpensive, not all women at risk of the disease respond to requests to attend for screening.  It has been found that women from the higher socio-economic groups present for screening while women from the poorer socio-economic groups may fail to do so.  As it is mainly in the latter group that deaths from cervical cancer occur one can see that there is a direct relationship between socio-economic conditions and mortality.</P>
    <P>A report on cervical screening was recently lodged with the Minister for Health.  When will we see this report? Should we not be reading it in conjunction with this discussion document? Women and their doctors would like to know what the Minister and the Department will do in relation to screening for cervical cancer.  The document says that smear testing could be provided without charge to women covered by the GMS and women in the 30 to 50 age group who are covered by medical cards could be invited to avail of a smear test at recommended intervals.  However, these are only aspirations and there have been no detailed promises on the action to be taken in regard to this aspect of <Col N="39" /> women's health.  Women who are covered by the GMS can only have a smear test as a diagnostic measure and they are not allowed to have one for screening purposes.  It is outrageous that poor women with medical cards are only allowed to have a smear test as a diagnostic measure.  I hope the Minister will allow such women to avail of smear tests for screening purposes.</P>
    <P>The document deals with abortion and the need for counselling.  The abortion rate among women is rising and, given the clandestine manner in which Irish women avail of abortion abroad, it is inevitable that they will have inadequate aftercare.  The Minister said that funding had been allocated for counselling women with crisis pregnancies and research has been commissioned on the reasons women with crisis pregnancies seek terminations abroad.  He will not have to spend much money in trying to find out the reasons women with crisis pregnancies seek terminations abroad; it is because they cannot have their pregnancies terminated here.  We could deal with the issue of counselling but unfortunately it is not being dealt with at present.  The provision of such counselling was promised during the debate on the controversial abortion legislation.  It was extremely difficult to get that minimalist legislation, which only allowed women to receive information to facilitate their travel abroad, through the House.</P>
    <P>Every year approximately 5,000 Irish women travel to Britain for abortions. During the past 23 years 63,000 Irish women have had abortions in the United Kingdom.  Research has shown that the majority of these did not consult with any medical professional here. A study of 53 Irish women in Britain in 1991 shows that four were sent by a pregnancy counselling service and five by their GP while the rest had obtained the telephone numbers themselves.  We know very little about the conditions under which these 5,000 women travel to Britain each year.  While many of them have independent means I believe <Col N="40" /> the vast majority of them are young poor women who travel alone.  In many cases their pregnancies will be more advanced as it will have taken them a few weeks to collect the money.  They leave like thieves in the night.  The State cares very little for the physical or emotional condition of these young women, not to mention the difficulties experienced by them when travelling alone.  Research has shown that many women who receive counselling, which is absolutely essential, opt not to terminate their pregnancies, which is in the public interest.  Given our national self-delusion and hypocrisy, we will not solve this problem during my time in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Teenage pregnancies are a related matter.  While the marital birth rate has fallen sharply there has been a tenfold increase in the birth rate outside marriage.  Births to single mothers are heavily concentrated among the younger age group.  Approximately 40 per cent of all first time births are to single mothers while approximately 19 per cent are to teenage girls under 20.  Early parenthood can have physical and social consequences, including a greater likelihood of living in poverty.  The high incidence of pregnancy among young people highlights how vulnerable and ill equipped they are to deal with the issues of sexual responsibility and contraception.  There has been little or no success in the promotion of pregnancy prevention in the education system.</P>
    <P>The findings of a recent survey of teenage mothers conducted at the Coombe Women's Hospital showed that many of them took no precautions and had no understanding of their own ovulation cycle.  The best way to address this matter is to be honest and introduce a comprehensive sex education programme in second level schools.  The number of births is proof that teenagers are not being given the information they need.  There is a need to highlight for young women the disadvantages associated with early unplanned pregnancies and for young men the responsibilities associated with parenthood as well as <Col N="41" /> the requirement to share the responsibility to use some form of contraception.  That is the only way forward if the number od teenage pregnancies and abortions is to be reduced.</P>
    <P>While women are well represented in the category of general practitioner this is not the case when it comes to senior medical posts.  There are only three female consultant gynaecologists out of a total of 83.  The imbalance as between women and men in senior positions needs to be systematically and thoroughly corrected to provide equal career opportunities for women and to ensure that female patients have the option of being treated by a female consultant, if they so wish.</P>
    <P>The Department of Health, health boards and professional bodies need to adopt equal opportunities policies. There is scope to pursue a more flexible approach to job-sharing in the health services.  Some work practices militate against the advancement of women and constitute indirect discrimination.  For example, junior hospital doctors have to work long hours.  This work pattern can cause severe problems for doctors with children.  What specific action will be taken to address these issues?</P>
    <P>The unlawful activities of a doctor which were brought into sharp focus recently have shaken women throughout the country.  The nature of the abuse was such that it could only be understood by women.  They are anxious that procedures are put in place, be it at Department of Justice or Medical Council level, to ensure that allegations of abuse are dealt with as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Concern has also been expressed about the way in which the board of a voluntary hospital dealt with the complaint from a patient who alleged she had been abused.  It dealt with it in the way it would have dealt with a personnel or disciplinary matter.  It has now been accepted this was inappropriate. An external review of procedures at the hospital in question is being carried out.</P>
    <P>There is an anomaly in that a doctor <Col N="42" /> in a health board hospital may be suspended under the relevant legislation pending an investigation whereas the voluntary hospitals are left to their own devices.  The Minister has ordered an inquiry into the matter.</P>
    <P>This debate is timely in that serious issues have arisen during the past year. I look forward to hearing the contributions of female Members and of those Members who are also members of the medical profession.  It is important that we obtain their views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Ring.  We have all heard successive Ministers for Health outline aspirational plans to shape a healthier future.  A gender based approach has been adopted in this discussion document &mdash; Developing a Policy for Women's Health.  This is great stuff, but I would like to see results.  The Minister should immediately launch a national breast cancer screening programme targeted at all women in the high risk age group of 50 to 64.  The Irish Countrywomen's Association recently organised a magnificent campaign to encourage women in this target group to attend for screening.</P>
      <P>This document states that the number of deaths from breast cancer among women over 50 years of age could be reduced by about 30 per cent by a well organised breast cancer screening campaign.  The Government is committed to the phased expansion of a screening programme for breast cancer in women between the ages of 50 and 64 thoughout the country.  This phased expansion will take place subject to the limitations of ensuring appropriate expertise in all aspects of breast cancer screening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is not an adequate response given that the number of deaths could be reduced by 30 per cent.  There is no need for further research or the introduction of further pilot programmes.  It is a question of making the necessary resources available for a national screening programme.  While the Minister may point to the cost of providing <Col N="43" /> mammography facilities women must be encouraged to attend for screening as a matter of routine once they reach a certain age.  Such a policy would produce results.</P>
    <P>I was fascinated to hear recently that there are significant benefits to be gained in having two X-rays taken as distinct from one.  This may lessen the need to recall patients for further examination.  It is also significant that the number of deaths from cervical cancer in women of all ages could be reduced by up to 60 per cent by a similar screening programme.</P>
    <P>I am glad this document contains a commitment to promote equal opportunities programmes in organisations funded by the Department of Health and to secure the appointment of a greater proportion of women to health bodies.</P>
    <P>I also note the discussion document's remarks about aid in the developing world.  Last week I had the great satisfaction of seeing what can be done with such aid in South African townships. With little money enormous advantage can be derived from the efforts of the Irish aid programme abroad.</P>
    <P>Finally, I return to my original point. There is no need for further research or pilot schemes, only for action on national screening for breast cancer. The Minister can take such action, all that is required is the will.  The services are available and I trust the Minister will implement them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 34, 69 and 70 together.  I remind the House that matters arising from the RTE &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; broadcast <Col N="45" /> of 2 November are the subject of legal proceedings by the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications in relation to that programme.  In the interests of not jeopardising these proceedings in any way.  I am obliged to exercise caution in what I say in relation to this matter.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware from previous Dáil questions and debates on this matter that a number of letters received by Ministers and others were referred to the gardaí to enable them to decide whether a criminal investigation should take place.  The Garda authorities have been in contact with relevant Government Departments in this regard and, while no new or separate investigation has been initiated arising out of the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; broadcast of 2 November, the gardaí have taken account of the broadcast in the context of the assessment on which they are already engaged.</P>
      <P>In her reply to questions on 24 October, the Minister for Justice replied at some length on the manner in which the allegation that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications had been placed under surveillance was dealt with.  I refer Deputies to the full reply the Minister gave on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware from that reply that the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications provided information to a senior Garda officer on 25 July concerning an allegation, contained in a letter he had received, that he and others had been placed under surveillance.  The Minister also told the House that the Garda authorities subsequently informed the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications and the Minister for Justice that having examined the information provided and taking the Garda's investigative role of criminal issues into account, they had decided they had no investigative role in relation to the particular allegation of surveillance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Justice also informed the House on that occasion that, in view of the decision which the <Col N="46" /> Garda authorities had taken in relation to the surveillance allegations, no report was prepared by the Garda Síochána on the surveillance issue, and that the question of the content and conclusions of such a report did not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister of State now advise the House why the Garda authorities should have felt the surveillance issue should not have been investigated further?  There was an allegation of criminal activity linked to surveillance.  Does the Minister accept that if surveillance was linked to a criminal offence, in that event it would be deemed to be aiding and abetting the crime and the gardaí would have seen fit to pursue the matter?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice answered part of that question in the House on 24 October.  I have explained the current position.  To bring the matter up to date, the gardaí have not initiated an investigation into the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; broadcast for the reason I stated.  The Garda authorities have, however, taken account of the broadcast in the context of the wider assessment of the letters in question, in which they are already engaged.</P>

I ask him to do so and to answer the following question.

As the Deputy and everyone else is aware, the &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; programme is a matter of legal consideration and I do not think it would be wise for me to answer further questions in relation to it.

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>
      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the number of offenders currently unlawfully at large, having breached their temporary release conditions, in view of the fact that in a written reply to a parliamentary question of 20 September 1995, she stated that figures were being compiled and analysed and would be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16616/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>It is best, perhaps, to begin by explaining what is meant by the term &ldquo;unlawfully at large&rdquo; as it could, mistakenly, be taken to mean that one is dealing with a large contingent of dangerous outlaws.  The reality is rather different.</P>
      <P>The Criminal Justice Act, 1960 under which most offenders are granted temporary release, provides that an offender who breaches a condition of his temporary release is deemed to be &ldquo;unlawfully at large&rdquo;.  The breach, however, may be of a relatively minor, technical nature, as I shall explain, and does not necessarily mean that the person concerned has engaged in any form of serious criminality.</P>
      <P>What has emerged from a major survey carried out in the Department of Justice recently, the results of which have just become available, is that only eight individuals of those deemed to be &ldquo;unlawfully at large&rdquo; are persons who actually escaped having been in custody in a closed institution &mdash; the escape usually occuring while on escorts to hospitals etc. outside the institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further 228 are offenders who absconded from open institutions. These are institutions which, as <Col N="51" /> Deputies will be aware, accommodate the less serious offenders and in which, in accordance with long standing policy and practice, a more relaxed regime operates.</P>
    <P>A further 784 offenders are people who had already been granted temporary release, but who were guilty of technical breaches of their release conditions.  These breaches, for the most part, consisted of failing to sign-on, on a regular basis, at the Garda station or prison as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of their release conditions.</P>
    <P>In other words 76 per cent of those who are deemed to be unlawfully at large are people who fall into that category because of the technical breaches to which I referred and 98-99 per cent of all those unlawfully at large are individuals who acquired that status either as a result of these technical breaches or as a result of absconding from open institutions.</P>
    <P>In presenting the facts to the House in the manner I have, I do not, for one moment, wish to suggest that it is a matter of little or no concern that various individuals are deemed, by law, to be unlawfully at large, but it is important that Deputies and the public generally understand what exactly is involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply has confused me.  Who monitors the activities of the 288 who have absconded from open institutions?  Is the Minister saying they are unlawfully at large?  Is there information on whether they have committed offences while unlawfully at large?  Does the Minister agree that this matter has taken on a sharper focus in the eyes of the public as a result of recent settlements?  There are three claims pending against the State for offences committed by people while on temporary release and settlements, involving a high cost to the State, have been made in respect of two of them.  Will the Minister outline in detail the terms of the settlement made without liability, how he can justify that <Col N="52" /> and the costs involved in respect of a case taken by a woman raped by a man while on temporary release?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept this a matter of public concern.  It is also a matter of concern for the Minister and me.  The Deputy referred to two cases and, while I have the details of them here, I am not sure if I can give that information to the House.  We are concerned that this should not happen again.  The Minister is paying particular attention to the matter and is examining the guidelines governing temporary release.</P>
      <P>It is the statutory function of the Minister under the Criminal Justice Act 1960 to grant temporary release to prisoners on various compassionate grounds such as illness of a relative, bereavement, christenings, children's First Communion ceremonies, or to enable an offender sit examinations, to be interviewed for employment &mdash; thus helping with the resocialisation programmes for longer term offenders &mdash; or to grant daily release to employment of an offender toward the end of his or her sentence.  Temporary release may be granted for different periods of time, as deemed appropriate, ranging from a few hours to weekly renewable temporary release.  There are conditions attached to such releases.  Temporary release always is subject to conditions but in all cases to the condition that the person concerned is of good behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Various other conditions may be applied.  For example, the individual concerned may be subject to supervision by the Probation and Welfare Service; he or she may be required to report at regular intervals to a Garda station, to reside at a particular location and so on. I should point out that such temporary release ends automatically if any of those conditions is breached, when the individual concerned can be returned to custody immediately without the need for fresh proceedings even in the event of there being one day only of the original sentence remaining outstanding. This condition was laid down in the <Col N="53" /> 1960 Act and is monitored continuously by the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State and I appear to be at cross purposes, perhaps because this is a complex statistical subject.  When I asked the Minister on 20 September how many offenders had reoffended while on temporary release over the preceding three years she informed me such statistics could be compiled only by way of an examination of the individual records of several thousand offenders and that this would involve the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of time.  In a subsequent exchange with the Minister I established that adherence to or breach of the conditions of temporary release is not recorded; in other words, there is no record maintained of the activities of people on temporary release.  Yet the Minister of State in his reply today said it would appear from the statistics available to him that many people on release are not a danger to the public while at large unlawfully because of a technical breach of the conditions.  If there is no monitoring of the incidence of reoffending while on temporary release, how can the Minister continue to preside over a system which allows the possibility that many such people may reoffend, particularly bearing in mind potential claims against the State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, when replying on the previous occasion to which the Deputy referred, promised to obtain additional information and supply it to her.  The Deputy ought be pleased, though not surprised, that the Minister carried out that promise through the up-to-date information I have just supplied. I should point out that a monitoring process is in progress.  That is the only reply I can give at present and it should be viewed in the context of the Minister's previous one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it the Minister will continue to preside over a system which continues to release <Col N="54" /> offenders into the community on temporary release bonds while there continues to be inadequate monitoring of adherence to their conditions of release, while accepting that the State is liable for their criminal activities whenever released temporarily?  Is the Minister saying there will be no changes in the present regime of temporary release, even in the face of this huge financial threat to the State, which is liable for their activities while at large unlawfully, even if only technically?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not saying there will not be any changes.  I have said that the Minister will keep this matter under continuous review.  Clearly the unfortunate incidents to which the Deputy referred would concentrate the mind. The practice of continuing to release people, with proper safeguards, will continue as I understand it has continued since approximately 1960.  We are not an inhumane society in which prisoner applicants for temporary release, with good reason, will not be given appropriate consideration.  Nonetheless, the greatest practicable safeguards will be applied and, within that context, the Minister will continue to monitor the matter as closely as possible.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the number of claims that are outstanding against the State arising out of criminal offences allegedly committed by persons on full-time temporary release; the plans, if any, she has to introduce new proposals or guidelines to govern the temporary release of prisoners; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16614/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one legal action, and one claim for damages which may <Col N="55" /> result in legal action, outstanding against the State arising out of criminal offences allegedly committed by prisoners while on temporary release from prison.  The legal action relates to a claim for damages arising from a malicious wounding conviction dating from 1992.  The other claim arises from conviction for malicious damage and arson in 1993.  Legal proceedings have not been initiated in the latter case.</P>
      <P>The Minister has on several occasions in this House outlined the guidelines which govern the operation of the temporary release system which, I should emphasise, has been operated under statute since 1960 by successive Ministers for Justice.  While the system of temporary release is soundly-based, I am also aware that, due to a shortage of prison accommodation, some offenders do serve a smaller proportion of their sentence than would otherwise be the case.  The Minister does not believe, however, that this problem can be addressed by tinkering with the guidelines under which the system currently operates.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo; which was published last year contains, in Chapter 5, a review of the current temporary release arrangements together with a number of specific proposals for the future.  In brief, these proposals provide for a reduction in the number of unsupervised releases in favour of a system under which the majority of releases would be closely supervised by the probation and welfare service.  The plan also provides for an increase in the number of prison spaces and this aspect is currently under active consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 5 and 50 together.</P>
      <P>Title VI of the Treaty on European Union, which came into operation in November 1993, contains provisions for co-operation among member states for the purposes of preventing unlawful drug trafficking and other serious forms of international crime.</P>
      <P>ECU 1,800,000 was made available in July 1995 from the general budget of the EU for projects to improve police co-operation under Title VI.  In close consultation with the Garda, my Department submitted a project for funding from that allocation for an exchange of operational police personnel involved in combating drug trafficking in a number of member states.  I expect our application will be successful and approximately ECU 280,000 will be allocated to the project by the EU.  This means Ireland should receive in excess of 10 per cent of the amount available.  The project will start later this year and finish in late 1996.  The Minister is, of course, keeping under review all opportunities that may arise for EU funding to assist in this critical work.</P>
      <P>While on the subject of drug trafficking it may be appropriate to record our congratulations and appreciation of the great success by the Garda, Customs Service and Naval Service in capturing the largest consignment of drugs in our history.  It is good news for all law abiding people and bad news for the criminal gangs involved.</P>

      <P>I join the Minister of State in congratulating the Garda, Naval Service and Customs service for yesterday's seizure.  I hope those who perpetrated the crime will be brought to justice.  On the evidence of yesterday's huge haul of cannabis, does the Minister of State agree there is a strong argument to be made at EU level to make Ireland the centre for the fight against illegal drug trafficking into Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree everything possible should be done in a European context to reduce and, if possible, eliminate the possibility of drugs being imported into this country.  The Minister for Justice has been working hard in that regard and the Taoiseach has called for the establishment of a European coastguard, which would be an important element of the Government's proposals.</P>
      <P>An interdepartmental group was set up in June 1995 following the Government's decision to consider initiatives that might be taken in relation to drugs during Ireland's presidency of the EU. The group has been considering <i>inter alia</i> the question of a European coastguard and has identified some of the wide ranging and complex issues involved in this difficult matter.</P>
      <P>The issues involved include the effectiveness of such an initiative in combating the drugs problem in Europe, particularly the heroin problem which is generally regarded as constituting the most serious threat; the concerns of the member states at the prospect of the introduction of a European law enforcement agency with an operational role and the effect this development would have on national law enforcement agencies, particularly with regard to gathering and distributing intelligence and mounting intelligence driven operations against drug traffickers.  It is generally accepted that intelligence is the strongest weapon of the law enforcement agencies in the fight against drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The group has not yet completed its examination of this matter but expects to present its report to Government by the end of the year.  It will be an <Col N="59" /> important part of our participation in our presidency of the EU next year. Considerable progress is being reported on the legislation on drugs promised by the Government.  It is at an advanced stage of preparation, is expected to be before Government in the next two or three weeks and will be before the House this session.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I remind the Minister of State that the Government's response to the problem at Castletownbere, where the drugs seized yesterday are reported to have arrived, was to decide to close the Customs office there.  The Government appears to have a revolving door policy on land and an open door policy at sea ports.  As part of the review of the Maastricht Treaty next year, does the Government intend to seek to provide a legal basis to establish a European coastguard service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for consideration in the context of our presidency of the EU.  As to the other matter the Deputy mentioned, I am a Minister of State at the Departments of Justice, Health and Education and I have some experience in those Departments.  I am afraid, however, my knowledge does not extend to detailed considerastion of the position in Castletownbere and I apologise to the House for that.</P>

      <P>Arising from the Minister of State's reference to yesterday's drug seizure, can he confirm or deny reports that this otherwise successful operation was almost jeopardised by a reported leak of information to the media in Cork?  This same leak has possibly jeopardised the successful prosecution of the drug barons involved. Has the Minister of State any information on the matter?</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>the progress, if any, that has been made in her Department towards updating the law to ensure that young children are prevented from begging on the streets with the knowledge of their parents; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 14 of the Children Act, 1908, provides that if a parent causes or procures his or her child to be in any street, premises or place for the purpose of begging, the parent shall, on summary conviction, be liable to a fine not exceeding £25, or alternatively, or in default of payment of such fine, or in addition to the fine, to imprisonment for any term not exceeding three months.  If a parent is charged with an offence under that section, and it is proved that <Col N="61" /> the child was in any street, premises or place for the purpose of begging, and that the parent allowed the child to be in the street, premises or place, he or she shall be presumed to have allowed the child to be in the street, premises or place for that purpose unless the contrary is proved.</P>
      <P>In addition section 3 of the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act, 1847, provides that a parent who causes, procures or encourages his or her child to beg is liable to be imprisoned for a period not exceeding one month.</P>
      <P>It is intended to update the law protecting children from being sent out to beg by their parents, or any other persons who have the custody, charge or care of them, in the context of the preparation of the legislation which will deal mainly with juvenile justice matters. This legislation is now at an advanced stage of preparation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that I questioned him in detail on this specific matter in April 1995.  His response at that time was that he was examining the Children Act, 1908, and the Vagrancy (Ireland) Act, 1847, which refers to the problem of children begging with the knowledge or otherwise of their parents.  Given that his reply indicates he is still in the process of examining the law with a view to reform, will he indicate whether prosecutions have been brought under the existing legislation or action taken not to allow children to beg on the streets?  In other words has anything happened since I raised this with him in April 1995?  Does he agree that cultural licence by travellers &mdash; admittedly a small number of families &mdash; to neglect their children in this way is not acceptable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Deputy referred to our very useful discussion on this matter last April.  I am lucky to be wearing three hats when replying to this question because it not only has a justice dimenson, it also relates to education and health.  I will do my best to bring the Deputy up to date on the <Col N="62" /> issue.  The Children Act, 1908, is being updated and the juvenile justice legislation is at an advanced stage of preparation.  Some of the difficulties that arose in previous administrations, dating back to the mid-1980s have been resolved under my chairmanship of a committee dealing with three Departments, Justice, Health and Education. Some of the questions the Deputies posed on children begging and so on will be answered in the near future.  I established a task force to look at truancy which clearly relates to children who should be at school but are out begging.  Very considerable progress has been made in that regard and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement about that in the very near future. When the time comes I hope the Deputy will give due credit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful that there has been an advance on the long awaited juvenile justice legislation.  Is the Minister aware that under the 1908 Children Act a Garda can take immediate action by obtaining a care order pending an investigation by the health board?  Given that begging is prevalent at Christmas and that it is unlikely the juvenile justice legislation will be enacted will he agree that a special effort should be made by the authorities to make contact with families who persistently neglect their children in this fashion?  Will he, as Minister of State in the Department of Health, contact the Eastern Health Board and ensure it is extra vigilant in dealing with children begging on the street during the Christmas period?  This problem affects a small number of families but has a devastating impact on the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help but reflect that the Deputy is getting great value for money, three Ministers rolled into one, to answer questions on all aspects of the problem.  She has reminded me of another scalp I have under my belt when I did not refer to the very significant progress I made in implementing the Child Care Act which came into <Col N="63" /> force in 1991 and only now is being implemented.  Forty four sections were implemented on the last day of October.</P>
      <P>Children begging is not unique to Dublin, particularly coming up to Christmas.  I do not like to see it.  People who are quite capable of making money in other ways use their children to appeal to our humanitarian instincts coming up to Christmas.  It would be far better if people did not contribute and if that happened there would be fewer beggars on the streets.  The problem is not unique to Dublin but is prevalent in cities and towns throughout the world. The Deputy suggests we take action coming up to Christmas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>An interim response.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a great many problems.  While most of the children begging may be classified as itinerants not all are, and there are major difficulties with the itinerants.  For example if the gardaí move in they have difficulties establishing their names and addresses and if they remove them from the streets where do they put them?  Often they refuse to say where they are staying and it is a matter of the Garda going to some considerable trouble trying to identify the camping spot from where the children come.</P>
      <P>The problem is serious but I am determined that something will be done about it.  I see the answer in the full implementation of the new Child Care Act and action on truancy.  If we can get those in place we will be well on the road.  In addition there are the efforts of voluntary organisations.  We should take the opportunity of paying tribute to those voluntary organisations which do their best to look after children and make sure they are not out on the streets where not only are they in danger of breaking the law but are exposed to many other temptations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that there is enough staff to deal with the very serious problem of truancy?</P>

    <Col N="64" />
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>That is really a question for the Department of Education. However, I can answer the Deputy that I am not satisfied.  It is something we are taking a serious look at, but it does have financial implications that I have to be concerned about.  The Deputy will hear more about that in due course.</P>

      <Quest>if she has satisfied herself with the present level of policing in the towns of Dunmore, Glenamaddy and Milltown, County Galway; the plans, if any, she has to fill the Garda vacancies in these towns; and if she will make a statement on proposals for policing in the North Galway area.</Quest>

    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of Garda manpower and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  They have informed me that the Dunmore, Glenamaddy and Milltown stations form part of the Tuam District in the Roscommon-Galway East Divison.  The present strength at both Dunmore and Glenamaddy stations is one sergeant and two gardaí compared to one sergeant and three gardaí in December last year.  Milltown station has a present strength of one sergeant and two gardaí and this has been the strength for the past few years.</P>
      <P>I understand that the stations at Dunmore, Glenamaddy and Milltown are open to the public from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Tuesdays, from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Friday and Saturday, from 12 noon to 1 p.m. on Sunday.  Outside these hours the public served by these stations can avail of a direct communication link to the district headquarters at Tuam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also understand from the Garda authorities that the official car based at Dunmore patrols all three sub-districts. These patrols are augmented by the district patrol car as required.  Moreover, there are two community alert schemes <Col N="65" /> in operation in the Dunmore sub-district, and one in both the Glenamaddy and Milltown sub-districts.  These schemes encourage close co-operation between the local gardaí and the people in these areas.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a total of 28 crimes were reported in the three sub-districts concerned in 1994 and that the indications are that there will be a reduction in the level of crime in those areas this year. While I would never be complacent about any level of crime, I believe this trend suggests that policing in these areas remains effective.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that a good police service is, indeed, being provided to the towns of Dunmore, Glenamaddy and Milltown.  They say that consideration will be given to filling the vacancies at Dunmore and Glenamaddy as soon as possible with due regard to the need also to fill other vacancies throughout the Roscommon/Galway East Division.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear there are proposals to fill the vacancies at Dunmore and Glenamaddy.  I question some of the figures the Minister gave. He mentioned that Dunmore had one sergeant and two gardaí.  That is not correct; a garda was transferred from there quite recently.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister any proposals to carry out refurbishment works at our Garda stations, particularly to the living accommodation, to enable gardaí and their families to live in the towns and villages which they serve?  Is the Minister aware that there is major concern that some of these stations may be closed if such improvement works are not carried out?  Can the Minister give an assurance that this will not happen?</P>

    <P>Community policing in urban areas was first introduced on a pilot basis in the Ballybrack/Loughlinstown area of south Dublin in 1987.  Following its success there it was subsequently introduced in the DMA North Division in February 1988 and in Tallaght later that year.  As there was favourable public reaction to this form of policing and local Garda <Col N="68" /> officers were pleased with its success it has since been extended throughout all of the DMA and gradually to the other areas which I have already mentioned. In 1993, there were 211 community gardaí operating in urban areas compared to 246 at present.  These gardaí are designated to specific areas and pay particular attention to getting to know the people in their locality, particularly young people.</P>
    <P>While I am convinced that the gardaí need to maintain the closest possible links with the communities which they serve, it should also be recognised that there is a limit to the number of gardaí who can be dedicated solely to this type of duty, given the overall demands on the force.  It is, of course, a matter for the Garda authorities to decide on the number and deployment of community gardaí.  I understand from them that it is unlikely that the present ratio of community gardaí to other gardaí will change significantly in the DMA in the immediate future.  However, they say there is scope to further develop community policing in smaller urban centres throughout the country but that this would be a matter for local Garda management to consider in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated there are 246 community gardaí. How does his Department evaluate the success or otherwise of this type of policing?  Is he aware of criticisms that criminal elements have managed to infiltrate and take advantage of the closeness of such gardaí to the community?  Is there evidence of that possible danger to the expansion of the scheme?  Does he agree that community policing, being essentially preventative, is a highly appropriate form of policing given the high levels of juvenile crime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that community policing is essentially preventative and particularly so as regards juvenile crime. I am aware of the press article to which the Deputy referred.  I consulted the Commissioner on that matter and he <Col N="69" /> assured me the article is without foundation.  However, that is not to say people with criminal backgrounds are not involved in youth diversion projects. The nature of the projects is to target those who may be involved in or on the fringes of crime.  Youth diversion projects have been successful in diverting young people away from crime.  Projects have been established in Moyross in Limerick, in Cork, in Killinarden and there are two in my constituency, one in Ronanstown and the other in Blanchardstown.  It is planned to extend these projects to other areas next year.  My Department is spending £250,000 this year on these projects which involve the gardaí, probation and welfare services, local businesses and voluntary agencies. They are aimed at providing young people with an opportunity to contribute positively to society.  I congratulate the gardaí and the voluntary organisations on the extent to which they cooperate in the interests of young people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the presence of community gardaí is reassuring for those living in the community?  I am concerned that the Minister has indicated all decisions on the deployment of gardaí to particular areas of policing is left to Garda management.  Does the Minister agree that as a result of this constant abdication of responsibility for the deployment of Garda resources there is inability to inject political direction into where and how we police communities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very careful about that.  I have an advantage over the Deputy in that I have experience of police operating under political direction. It is not something I would recommend. I had substantial experience of that in another jurisdiction and would caution the Deputy to think again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that community gardaí are reassuring in a local community.  That is an important element of community policing.  Part of the reason for the lack of leadership in many deprived areas is that those who are lucky enough to <Col N="70" /> acquire leadership qualities through education, accident of birth or whatever do not reside in the local area.  In many instances teachers teaching in the local school do not reside in the community nor do those operating businesses in the area.</P>
    <P>There are two groups of people to whom local communities owe much &mdash; the religious who choose to live and minister in the area and do not get sufficient credit for what they do and the gardaí.  I know from experience in my constituency that the community gardaí are present at nearly every function I attend.  They deserve the highest credit for their efforts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the sentiments expressed by the Minister of State.  Is it intended to extend the concept of community policing to enable gardaí go into schools and warn young people against the dangers of illegal drugs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The gardaí do so already. It is an important element in the defeat of drug pushers.  Young people must be educated on the consequences of taking drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am heartened to hear the high esteem in which the Minister of State holds the gardaí.  When I last tabled the question, community gardaí who were absent were not being replaced.  Does Garda management recognise that when a community garda is absent from work the continuity of his or her work must not suffer?  Will he give an assurance that, in the absence of a community garda, his duties are carried out by another garda?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>From time to time community gardaí are diverted from their policing role to carry out other duties. I am, however, informed by the Garda authorities that this does not happen readily but occurs only in cases of absolute necessity.  Garda management must be free to deploy the force in accordance with the demands placed on it.  The <Col N="71" /> Garda authorities recognise and respect the unique and important role played by community gardaí and ensure that the diversion of community gardaí to other policing duties is kept to an absolute minimum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the success and popularity of the community garda concept, will the Minister agree that the number of community gardaí designated to the Dublin area &mdash; 195 &mdash; is insufficient?  Constant calls are made by communities for an increase in this type of policing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Garda authorities would like to be in a position to deploy more gardaí to this very important preventative work.  Certainly, the Minister and I would like to see more gardaí involved and will do everything possible to increase the number.</P>

      <P>I have no such proposals and I am not convinced that that approach would be appropriate.

      <P>There is a considerable number of applications before the taxing master of the High Court relating to the level of fees claimed as a result of the beef tribunal.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern.  He knows better than I that the level of legal fees is, to a great extent, determined by the laws of supply and demand; the market sets the rate.  If the State or any person represented at a tribunal employs a top lawyer, they are likely to be charged the going rate.  I am sure Deputy O'Donoghue would like to be in the top echelons in that respect. In determining the rate one should, as provided by Department of Finance guidelines, have regard to the likely duration of a tribunal or inquiry and the question of agreeing an overall cap on the level of fees to be paid.  The former Fair Trade Commission, when examining restrictive practices in the legal profession some years ago, strongly opposed statutory controls on legal fees. The commission favoured greater competition in the provision of legal services which, it argued, would tend to reduce legal costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will accept that the excessive fees agreed in the beef tribunal will give all tribunals a bad name.  In that context, will the Minister agree that in further inquiries of this nature it should be possible for the State to introduce a method whereby a flat fee could be negotiated for teams of lawyers employed by the State?  It should be possible to obtain the service of excellent lawyers without paying the top commercial rate in the marketplace.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>if she will expedite the delay in replacing personnel in Garda stations in the Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush and Lusk areas in view of the fact that incidents of crime go unreported because stations are often closed and patrols infrequent.</Quest>
      <QRef>[16512/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>The allocation of Garda personnel and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  They have informed me that the present strength at the stations concerned is as follows: Balbriggan, 32; Skerries, 7; Rush, 5; Lusk, 3.</P>
      <P>Balbriggan is the district headquarters and is open to the public 24 hours each day.  The other stations have limited opening hours although the Garda authorities say that it is necessary, on occasions, to alter their prescribed opening hours to cope with unforeseen circumstances.</P>
      <P>Foot and mobile patrols are carried out in each of the towns referred to in the question.  There is one marked and one unmarked patrol car allocated to Balbriggan, and one marked patrol car each allocated to Skerries and Rush stations which perform mobile patrols in their areas.  There is no patrol car assigned to Lusk but the area is patrolled by the vehicles attached to Balbriggan, Skerries and Rush.</P>
      <P>There is no basis to the Deputy's suggestions that incidents of crime are not reported because stations are closed.  The crime trend for the first nine months of this year suggests that there will be a drop of more than 40 per cent in the crime rate in the Balbriggan area this year compared to last year's figure. Since the Balbriggan station is open on a 24-hour day basis, it can hardly be said that the crime figures are down because the station is closed.  In any event when a station is closed personal callers have facilities to contact the district headquarters direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the best possible Garda coverage is being provided in the Balbriggan district with the current deployment of personnel and resources and they have no plans at present to allocate additional <Col N="74" /> gardaí to the stations referred to in the question.  However, the position is being kept under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>For a while I was not sure whether the Minister was answering my question.  The deployment of gardaí, particularly to Skerries, is eagerly awaited.  Will the Minister review the position whereby, because the Balbriggan district has responsibility for policing Trinity House and Oberstown House, two premises well known to the Minister, stations are frequently closed, particularly in Lusk.  In that context it is unacceptable for the Minister to say there is no basis for suggesting that crime is often unreported.  I ask him, when reviewing the position, to take into account that gardaí in the Balbriggan area have to escort young offenders around the country.  That work also takes up much of the overtime budget for the district, resulting in cutbacks in other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I hoped I would not have to tell the Deputy that the matter of policing in the areas to which he referred, Balbriggan, Skerries, Rush and Lusk is given continuous attention in the Department of Justice.  The position could hardly be anything other than that, given that the Minister represents that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>That is favouritism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinCurrie" hpid="Mr. Currie Mr. Currie">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Currie</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that the Minister's concern is at least as great as that expressed by him.  I am somewhat concerned that he queried the opening times I gave for one station of 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.  He did not say it was a matter of personal observation, he said it emanated from other sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the position regarding Oberstown House and Trinity House.  Wearing my education hat I am concerned about that matter also and have put in train certain steps to deal with it.  Wearing my justice hat, I accept that members of the force from the Balbriggan district are called upon to escort <Col N="75" /> juvenile detainees from the detention centres at Oberstown House and Trinity House in Lusk to court as required. Escorts are also provided by personnel from other stations in the Balbriggan district.  The Lusk area receives Garda coverage from personnel attached to Skerries, Rush or Balbriggan stations when gardaí at Lusk station are deployed on escorting duties.  This type of escort duty is part and parcel of the demands placed on our Garda force.  I give an assurance that the Minister for Justice will pay the necessary attenion to those areas and the Deputy need not be concerned in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister of State will realise that I am worried on behalf of others.  Will he examine the matter of the long awaited allocation of two additional gardaí to Skerries?  I would greatly appreciate if this matter could be expedited.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue.  I congratulate the Minister on presenting this policy document.  This is the first Government in Europe to consider a policy document on women's health.</P>
      <P>This is the first opportunity I have had in the House to congratulate the Minister for arranging for the provision of an orthopaedic unit in Castlebar General Hospital.  I understand that phase II of that project is due to commence next year.  I am sure the Minister will be pleased that I will no longer knock on his door seeking his approval for that unit.  On behalf of the people in County Mayo, I compliment him for the speed with which he sanctioned its provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week the Minister allocated £91,000 to the Western Health Board to provide lifts in a hospital.  I compliment him for the speed with which his Department responded to that urgent request but I ask him to investigate why that health board had to request £91,000 to provide lifts given that the hospital concerned was opened during the last <Col N="110" /> ten months.  I want the public to be informed about it.</P>
    <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on behalf of women.  I compliment all the women who over the years have been treated as second class citizens.  I come from a family of 13 children and I saw how hard my mother worked to raise her family.  She looked after herself last as does every mother in this State.  Women have been devalued here for far too long.  That is why I compliment the Minister for bringing this important policy document on women's health before the Dáil.  It is a major initiative on which we should build.</P>
    <P>Breast cancer is a major concern and I welcome the breast screening programme set up in recent weeks.  I am disappointed County Mayo has not been included and people must travel more than 100 miles from Belmullet to the nearest hospital for such screening. That is unacceptable.  Services must be brought to communities and women's health must be given priority.</P>
    <P>The issue of cancer is of great concern in the west.  I may table questions on it in the coming weeks, but the Minister might consider investigating why there is such a high incidence of cancer in the west.  I am sure other Deputies from the west will raise the issue of breast cancer about which a great number of constituents who visit my clinic are concerned.  I ask the Minister to put in place a breast screening programme as a matter of urgency.  Mayo is the third largest county in the country.  If men were affected by breast cancer, millions of pounds would have been spent on research into it.  I am asking the Minister to examine the matter.</P>
    <P>A major problem in the west is that daughters who stay at home to look after an elderly parent and who may have some land are means-tested for the carer's allowance.  That is wrong.  Any person or household who looks after an elderly person should receive some State aid which should not be means-tested.  As it costs the State hundreds of <Col N="111" /> pounds per week to look after an elderly person in an old folks home I fail to understand why the State cannot make a contribution to those who care for old people in their houses.  Some years ago this was a major election issue.  I call on the Government to reconsider their attitude to this.</P>
    <P>Women have never been recognised for their true value and for their contribution to society.  In many cases women have to go out to work to provide for their families.  In the evenings they return home to look after their families. I compliment them on that work which has not been recognised by the State.  I call on the Government to make provision &mdash; similar to the children's allowance &mdash; in the next budget for women who stay at home to look after elderly people or their family.  It is only right and proper that the major contribution women made to this country is recognised.</P>
    <P>In my constituency there is concern about cystic fibrosis.  It has been brought to my attention by a number of people in County Mayo that 1,200 people approximately in the State suffer from this condition, 150 of whom live in the Western Health Board region and over one third attend the Mayo General Hospital.  As the Mayo General Hospital is at the planning stage of phase II an adult unit should be put in place for those patients.  Patients in County Mayo have to travel long distances to St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, where the condition is dealt with.  A doctor in County Mayo who had a particular interest in cystic fibrosis died recently and a replacement should be appointed to look after these people who have a serious illness.</P>
    <P>It is important that a breast screening programme is put in place in County Mayo.  I welcome the Minister's approval for the orthopaedic unit in Castlebar General Hospital.  I am pleased I will not have to be knocking at this door any longer.  I call on the Government to make provision in the forthcoming budget for some payment <Col N="112" /> to the women who stay at home to care for an elderly relative.  I am familiar with the way my mother struggled and worked hard.  In the past women were not treated properly.  I hope the Government will implement the recommendations of this document and that women get the respect they deserve.  I wish to share time with Deputy Bradford.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously a five minute slot is not entirely appropriate if one is to address this document in a significant way.  I concur with Deputy Ring on the inadequate way in which we have recognised the role of women in Irish society.  We have not formally recognised that our country had founding mothers as well as founding fathers. It is only recently that we have tried to give women, the 50 per cent plus of the population, the recognition they deserve for the role they played in the development of this country.</P>
      <P>One could address the issues of the monetary value, the lack of financial resources, the lack of any formal recognition by the State of the important role played by women in the home but what we are talking about is developing a policy for women's health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must return to the adage of prevention being better than cure.  While it is important to have the best medical care available &mdash; this is usually the most expensive &mdash; we often seek medical help too late.  Whether we are discussing women's, men's or children's health prevention is an important issue.  We should address problems before they require a solution, namely, we should do whatever we can to prevent the many illnesses which cause such difficulty and in many cases a high mortality rate. Much progress has been made in the past 30 to 50 years in health care for both men and women.  Basic health care has improved significantly and as a <Col N="113" /> result the mortality rate has decreased and life expectancy has increased.</P>
    <P>In the Ireland of the 1990s we need a new approach because problems, diseases and illnesses which had not been recognised as late as the 1970s or the 1980s are commonplace and need to be addressed.  In regard to women's health we have to concentrate on further research and on encouraging women to come forward for assessment and tests earlier.</P>
    <P>Generally, women are slow to come forward when they have an illness. While they do not hesitate to have illnesses in their children investigated they put themselves at the end of the queue. That approach, laudable though it may be from a humanitarian point of view, has caused and continues to cause difficulties.  The role of the Department and the health services must be to encourage women to come forward for assessment much earlier.  We must allocate more resources to preventive measures.  We must have sufficient support programmes available to encourage women to come forward in the initial stages of their illness to ensure we make further progress in increasing the life expectancy of women and deal with problems as they arise.</P>
    <P>I would like more time to speak on this important matter but I welcome this type of debate and the approach of the Minister in this area.  Obviously that approach will require further expenditure because we cannot solve any of these problems without the appropriate funding.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomMoffatt" hpid="Dr. Moffatt Dr. Moffatt">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Moffatt</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to contribute to this debate on developing a policy for women's health.  Women are living longer now than they did in the past because of a number of factors, including better nutrition, housing, sanitation, immunisation, the availability of antibiotics, earlier detection of inherited and acquired diseases and the capacity to treat them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The expectation now is that women will live longer and healthier lives.  Historically, the question of male and <Col N="114" /> female health was examined jointly.  In assessing health in the past we often looked at the causes of death.  In 1840, the number of deaths among men in the 25 to 34 age group was 10.6 per thousand.  The 1980 figure for the same age group is 0.5 per thousand.  In 1840, the life expectancy of women was 42 years; in 1980 it was 76 years.  The life expectancy of men in 1840 was 40 years; in 1980 it was 70 years.</P>
    <P>In earlier years, the primary causes of death were TB and infections.  Women faced the additional problem of puerperal sepsis during childbirth.  The increase in the life expectancy of women is due to better nutrition, housing, public health measures, safer childbirth, the introduction of antibiotics, the treatment of anaemia and associated conditions and other medical advances, particularly immunisation.</P>
    <P>Where do we go from here?  Prevention is the way forward.  We must also concentrate on areas we might have neglected in the past.  We must also promote self-help and examine other areas where advancement has been made in the recent past.  In regard to obstetrics, we should begin even before the child is born.  Pregnant women should take folic acid which may prevent many neural tube and central nervous system defects. That is one area of preventive medicine requiring attention.</P>
    <P>In regard to cancer of the cervix, Pap smear tests and screening is the way forward because this cancer is preventable if detected at an early stage.  Women should be encouraged to have these type of examinations.  When talking about cervical cancer, it must be remembered that if young girls engage in sexual practices it is not conducive to good health in later life.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to breast cancer and I welcome the Minister's special initiative in this area.  It might be said that the Minister should have extended the initiative to include the entire country; he has selected a number of areas for investigation.  Many women will be concerned that their areas were not included but this is a <Col N="115" /> pilot programme and perhaps the Minister will be in a position to extend it in the future.  Women must be assured that they are not being discriminated against in regard to their health and that all areas of the country will be treated equally.</P>
    <P>I welcome the advances in breast screening which includes taking additional views of the breast, which has improved the detection rate.  Cancer of the ovaries is a problem peculiar to women.  With all the advances that have been made through screening, this form of cancer should be detected earlier and I hope that will be the case in the near future.</P>
    <P>More emphasis must be placed on the promotion of breast-feeding which would not be a major cost to the Exchequer but of great benefit to women and infants.  I urge the Minister to address this area with a view to further educating women through the distribution of leaflets, etc,. outlining the benefits of breast-feeding to various women's groups.</P>
    <P>I wish to talk about the central nervous system.  Stress, anxiety, depression and psychiatric disorders cause major problems in society.  We are making progress in this regard, however, particularly in the psychiatric area with the sectorisation of psychiatric services.  I hope this will be a way forward and that there will no longer be a stigma attached to people with psychiatric disorders.</P>
    <P>Women may not be the head of the family but they take full responsibility for the care of the children.  Great stress is placed on women with handicapped children and we must examine the services available to them.  The Minister should consider making more places available for young children with a mental handicap including day services, respite care, etc.  The provision of such services will have a favourable effect on women's health, in some cases in a specific way.  This is an area where improvements can be made and we must constantly be mindful not only of the <Col N="116" /> woman's health but also that of their offspring.</P>
    <P>In recent times there has been an increase in the number of suicides and eating disorders.  Early intervention is the way forward, particularly in relation to depression which can lead to suicide. Today psychiatrists in the Southern Health Board region referred to the importance of the early detection of depression in reducing the number of suicides.  When talking about women's health consideration must be given to self-help.</P>
    <P>One of the preventative measures people can take is to give up smoking. It is very important for women to take cognisance of this point as there has been a decrease in the number of men who smoke but, unfortunately, there has been an increase in the number of women who smoke.  I stress the importance of prevention which costs very little and one of the ways to ensure prevention is through education.</P>
    <P>There is inadequate representation of women on health boards and other bodies where decisions are made in regard to health.  I am not a great supporter of gender balance on all boards but women should have an input to decisions which affect them.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to the appointment of competent women to such boards.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryCoughlan" hpid="Miss Coughlan Miss Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Miss Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  I welcome the Minister's initiative in allowing further discussion on this document. There is grave concern about the causes of death among women.  Approximately 20 per cent of women die from breast cancer while many others die from cardio-coronary heart disease.  I strongly welcome the Minister's decision to introduce a national breast screening service and urge him to ensure that it is established as a matter of urgency. Women who are afraid that they may have breast cancer should be encouraged to undergo an examination.  In addition, there should be an immediate follow through from the GP to the consultant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="117" /> It is important to provide adequate services in each region.  I ask the Minister to follow up on his recommendation that we should work in conjunction with the Northern Ireland authorities.  This would be of particular benefit to Donegal women, some of whom are in very bad health, who have to travel to Dublin at great expense.  Greater emphasis should be placed on the need to carry out proper research on the causes of cancer.  Given the concerns of all families about cancer, particularly as it affects women, the amount of money available for research is totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>Cervical cancer accounts for 2 per cent of all cancers in women.  It is important, therefore, for the screening to be simple, quick and inexpensive.  I ask the Minister to give consideration to the promotion of screening for women and to undertake proper promotional campaigns at regular intervals.  I commend the North-Western Health Board for its innovative response to the document and concur with many of its recommendations.</P>
    <P>One of the main problems experienced by women in rural areas is a lack of access to many of the services provided by health boards.  A centre along the lines of the Well Woman Centre should be set up in every region to complement the community care services provided by GPs.  I am not criticising GPs who provide an excellent service but an alternative should be available to encourage women to take the initiative in regard to family planning and screening.  This service should be made available in particular to young women in their late teens and early 20s.</P>
    <P>The document refers to the criticisms about the lack of privacy for patients and the lack of respect shown to many of them, particularly women.  In my constituency there has been severe criticism of the outpatient facilities.  The hospital in Donegal town is totally inadequate and uncomfortable and affords no privacy to patients.  I accept that there is a resource problem but it is necessary to have proper out-patient services and <Col N="118" /> proper play facilities for children.  These facilities should be the norm in all out-patient departments.</P>
    <P>I welcome the White Paper on mental illness.  In the case of women, issues such as depression, alcohol abuse and eating disorders need to be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Many people complain that their GPs treat depression and stress with a tablet and by telling them to pull themselves together.  Tablets should be a last resort and not the first treatment.  There is a need for a national support service for women and their families in cases involving stress and depression.  There is much stress attached to parenting and there should be easy access to counselling services, particularly for families with problems. A 24 hour helpline would help prevent much of the stress suffered by women. This problem may be linked to the increase in violence in the home.  It is important to establish in each region a centre along the lines of the Rape Crisis Centre and to provide adequate resources for refuges.  Prior to the opening of the refuge in Donegal people had to attend centres in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We will have to address the problem of our ageing population and re-evaluate the services provided in the community.  It is important to provide proper services for the elderly but it is equally important to look after carers. Carers, 80 per cent of whom are women, should be supported in every way possible and I ask the Minister to provide an allowance to all of them, irrespective of their means.  This would give recognition to their work which, while being fulfilling, involves much stress.</P>
    <P>Because of the role they play in society, women have different expectations from the health services and want to be informed and to be involved in their own health care.  There is a need to involve more women in the decision making process at health board level. This would ensure a flexible and more co-ordinated approach to health services and to women's needs.</P>
    <P>Women are concerned about the way the hepatitis C issue is being handled. <Col N="119" /> Although we responded in the best way we could when the crisis developed there is a need for a statutory tribunal. It does not matter how much this would cost.  The women affected and people who have had transfusions are frightened.  Who is to say what will happen to them 20 years down the line?  I ask the Minister to reconsider setting up a statutory tribunal.</P>
    <P>There have been hiccups in the provision of counselling services.  It is imperative that women are counselled to help them cope with this disease. Problems have also been encountered in obtaining overnight allowances.  The bureaucracy should be eliminated and these should be paid automatically.</P>
    <P>I commend all those involved in the formulation of this discussion document.  The Minister is awaiting response from the health boards and from public meetings.  Certainly there is a need to involve women in setting up a health policy plan.  Funding will have to be made available if women are to make progress.  With 20 female Members in the House the Minister is no doubt aware that he will have to address the document in its entirety as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Ms E. Fitzgerald)</NameTxt>
      <P>I feel strongly that I should take part in this important debate.  I am delighted the Department of Health has given a commitment in this discussion document to improve women's health, to engage in a consultation process and to implement a strategy in this regard. This is in line with the commitment given in Beijing to plan for women's health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Emphasis on good health promotion is very important.  By and large, our health services have concentrated on tackling disease rather than promoting the well woman concept.  A number of years ago I served on a health promotion committee in the Department of Health.  A positive attitude has been adopted in this document and the idea <Col N="120" /> of involving healthy women in designing health services is a good one.</P>
    <P>The key to successful health promotion is to ensure that the healthy choices should be the easy and natural choices to make, but very often they are the more difficult choices.  It was not an easy choice for me to decide to battle to lose weight.</P>
    <P>The major killers of women are smoking and heart disease.  As an asthmatic, I am aware of the importance of getting that message across.  We will talk about Sellafield and the need to breathe clean air, yet we will pour smoke into each other's lungs.  I suffer from occupational asthma as a result of working in smoke filled rooms.</P>
    <P>I am horrified at the number of young women taking up smoking.  I am delighted, therefore, that the new programme is based on peer pressure as peer pressure is the reason many 12, 13 and 14 year olds puff away behind the toilets on the way to and from school. We should tell women that they can relieve stress in many other ways, that they should not destroy their lungs or their chances of having a healthy child by smoking during pregnancy and that they should avoid ageing prematurely due to smoking.  That is an important health message.</P>
    <P>Breast cancer is also a major woman killer.  When my mother was my age she was dying from cancer and left a family of eight children behind.  I am delighted that the breast cancer screening programme is to be extended and targeted at a specific age group to ensure the maximum reduction in the number of deaths.  A cervical cancer screening programme should produce results.</P>
    <P>Women tend to visit their doctors during pregnancy only.  Once they reach their early forties they are less likely to visit the doctor or undergo routine checks.  There is a need, therefore, to put systems in place for those who do not visit their doctors regularly.</P>
    <P>The causes of morbidity among women include the menopause and associated problems such as osteoporosis as well as hysterectomies.  This is <Col N="121" /> a major operation, both psychologically and physically.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the importance of treating women with respect.  I am glad I do not suffer from a skin disease and live in Cork.  It is important that women are treated with respect when they present with an illness.  Often when one visits one's doctor, particularly a male doctor, there is a male-female relationship.  Women can feel disempowered when stripped of their garments.  They have to talk to a fully dressed doctor while in their night attire.  In such circumstances many women find it hard to speak up for themselves.</P>
    <P>When I had my babies the maternity services were not family or women friendly when it came to respect.  While the standard of health care was excellent one's partner was not allowed to attend the birth: one was processed through a production line.  It is important to be called by one's name rather than being called &ldquo;mother&rdquo; as if one were a Reverend Mother, and to be treated as a human being so that people may be able to say what is important and ask the questions they want to ask rather than leave the clinic and half an hour later feel furious that they had not been able to ask relevant questions.  The role of women in seeing that balance in relationship between the dressed-up predominantly male establishment and the disempowered woman in her nightie or pyjamas is a perspective we need by having a gender balance in the planning of our health services.</P>
    <P>Women tend to put themselves last and do not visit the doctor with every ache and pain.  They will always put their children first.  About three or four years ago a survey on women and nutrition was carried out in Tallaght.  It looked at nutrition among poor families. One frightening finding was that low income families particularly lone parents were feeding their children at their own expense and were not consuming enough calcium, protein and so on. They were going without, or eating a sandwich or a boiled egg while looking <Col N="122" /> after the needs of the children.  It is important that women look after their own health and retain a sense of self-esteem.  They should take it seriously and give it the same attention as the more hypochondriac gender is prepared to give it.</P>
    <P>There have been enormous changes for women.  Family planning was bitterly fought for in this House over a quarter of a century and access to good family planning has probably been the single biggest contributor to women's health. Some groups of women, such as travellers, still do not have proper access to family planning and put their health at risk through having large families with children too close together.  They are not able to cope with managing this aspect of their lives.</P>
    <P>We also had a long battle over female sterilisation.  Women had to go before a hospital ethics committee rather than being able to make decisions over their own bodies.  If a women decides her family is complete, she is entitled to sterilisation, if that is the couple's choice.  Male sterilisation is the better option because it is a lighter operation but some men regard it as unacceptable or equivalent to castration.  These options must be available to women through our public health services.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Coughlan about the importance of créche and play facilities at women's and children's health centres.  I brought my children to places like the Eye and Ear Hospital, where they would have had drops in their eyes and be unable to read.  There would be no toys in the waiting area, nothing except pictures of damaged eyes.  I had to try to keep my children quite because the blind, the infirm and the elderly were there also.  This was unfair to everyone.  It does not cost much to provide a box of second-hand toys, a book which a parent can read to her child, or a play facility.  These are essential and mothers notice their absence when they bring their children but if males design the services they are often blind to these issues.</P>
    <P>Deputy Coughlan's point about <Col N="123" /> women as carers was important.  Often in families it is the daughter or daughter-in-law who looks after an elderly parent.  The caring role is usually stressful.  Quite apart from the monetary aspect, which has been raised, the stress for the carer is neither appreciated nor relieved.  We should stress the importance of respite breaks for carers, who are predominantly women.  I recommend to the Deputy an excellent book called <i>Who Cares?</i> by Catherine McCann, which is a bible for carers.  The issues it raises are crucial for our health services as a whole.</P>
    <P>Issues which are important for women tend to concern their children. The reduction in infant mortality has been significant.  Sudden infant death is still the biggest cause of unexplained mortality.  If one goes through the process of having a child who then dies it is an appalling experience.  I am delighted with the breakthrough in research in this area and we should continue to do everything we can to reduce the death toll and its effect on women.</P>
    <P>Our image of the health service is of male doctors and female nurses.  This must change.  There are few women in obstetrics and gynaecology, which is a women's area.  Women are treated by people who do not know what birth is like.  It is important to have a positive action programme so that there will be more women in that area.</P>
    <P>Dental health is another area where women are neglected.  I served for five years on the Dental Council as a consumer representative.  We dealt with dentists who wanted more money and greater throughput of patients.  My concern was with the number of women who could not afford to fix their teeth and whose dental health was damaged through pregnancy and lactation, which reduced their calcium.  A positive action programme is needed in that area also &mdash; we are not doing enough.</P>
    <P>Members mentioned the importance of psychiatric and mental health for women.  Female victims of rape, violence and depravation should receive <Col N="124" /> counselling, as should women who were abused as children and may carry that burden through to later life.</P>
    <P>Deputy Moffatt stressed the importance of breast-feeding, against which there is a huge cultural bias in Ireland. It is not made easy to breast-feed in pubs, etc.  When I was in the Coombe the curtains were pulled around me when I breast-fed as if I was unclean rather than doing what was right for my children.  If breast-feeding is regarded as unclean and sexual rather than natural, the implication is that women should bottle feed children because they can do that in company.  We should send the message that breast is best for the baby, it is natural and not prurient.  We should be able to do it in cafés, buses and within our families and not have to hide away.  Who will breast-feed if they have to go upstairs to a cold bedroom, rather than in the company of the family?</P>
    <P>These are personal comments on the subject.  I am delighted the issue has been put on the Dáil agenda and that so many women Deputies contributed.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Death Sentence on Nigerian Activists.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday, on the eve of the Commonwealth Conference, the Nigerian Provisional Ruling Council confirmed the death sentences imposed on the writer and environmentalist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists.  In a move of breathtaking cynicism, the Nigerian authorities have cocked a snook at human rights activists who have condemned both the sentences and the deeply flawed trial. Amnesty International fears that their execution may be imminent.</P>
      <P>Ken Saro-Wiwa is well known in the west for his animal fables allegorising political life.  As a writer and environmentalist, he has campaigned peacefully against the environmental despoilation of Ogoniland by Shell International, aided by Nigerian Government forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of last month a special <Col N="125" /> court found the defendants guilty of murdering four Ogoni leaders and sentenced them to death.  There are serious question marks over the conduct of the trial.  The defendants were detained incommunicado for at least eight months before being charged and there have been allegations of ill-treatment and torture while in detention.  The civil disturbances special tribunal which convicted these men falls outside the Nigerian judicial system, and was specially convened to try the cases of these men, who have long been thorns in the side of General Sani Abacha and his military dictatorship.</P>
    <P>The defendants were denied the right to a fair trial and to appeal to a higher court.  In effect, they were tried by a kangaroo court in contravention of both Nigerian and international judicial procedures.  The Nigerian military junta has acted as judge and jury and &mdash; unless increased international pressure is brought to bear &mdash; may act as executioner.</P>
    <P>The flawed trial of Ken Saro-Wiwa and the other defendants, and the subsequent death sentences, are just the latest outrage in a human rights record which has steadily worsened since General Sani Abacha refused to accept the results of democratic elections.  There are at least 43 people currently imprisoned in Nigeria after being tried by a special military tribunal headed, ironically, by a member of the military government.  They have been accused of complicity in an alleged plot to overthrow the Government in March of this year &mdash; a plot whose existence is questioned by many.  Also, there have been at least 180 executions since the military regime assumed power.</P>
    <P>The Government is well placed to press the European Union to make formal representations to Nigeria calling for the immediate release of Ken Saro-Wiwa and Dr. Barimen Kiobel, the former president of the Nigerian Medical Association, both of whom Amnesty International believes to be prisoners of conscience, and to seek the commutation of the death sentence in all cases <Col N="126" /> where it has been imposed.  In the long-term, only sustained pressure by the international community will force Nigeria to clean up its human rights act. The softly-softly approach being adopted by the UK and other member states is unlikely to have any effect on a regime that has consistently defied international opinion.</P>
    <P>Economic sanctions may be the only way to exert pressure on the Nigerian authorities.  The European Union should impose an immediate arms embargo on the Nigerian regime which is using its military might to repress even its own people.  I hope Ireland will play a leading role in the European Union in exerting maximum pressure on the Nigerian authorities and in demanding a review and commutation of the sentences of those on death row.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton) Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Ms Burton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</P>
      <P>Ireland, both bilaterally and with its partners in the European Union, has consistently expressed its serious concern to the Nigerian authorities about the case of Mr. Ken Saro-Wiwa and the Ogoni people.  We fully supported and participated in the European Union fact finding mission to the Ogoni region which took place last November.  The mission saw evidence of considerable destruction, with houses and schools in some Ogoni villages either partially or completely demolished.</P>
      <P>At Ireland's instigation and following our expressions of concern last January, the EU made representations to the Nigerian authorities on the need to restore democratic rule and on human rights violations, including the case of Mr. Saro-Wiwa, and EU monitors attended the tribunal hearings of his case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government also raised this issue with the Nigerian Chargé d'Affaires when he was summoned to my Department in July as part of a demarche on democracy and human rights issues carried out in all EU capitals, and again during subsequent official contacts with <Col N="127" /> the embassy.  Mr. Saro-Wiwa's son, with whom we have maintained continuing contact through diplomatic channels, had a meeting with officials at my Department when he visited Dublin last month.</P>
    <P>Following the recent imposition of the death sentence on Mr. Saro-Wiwa and his co-accused by a special tribunal in Nigeria, I issued a statement on behalf of the Government.  In it I expressed our grave concern about the imposition of the death sentence on Ken Saro-Wiwa and his co-defendants and our earnest hope that it would be commuted when the Provisional Ruling Council considered the judgement of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>In follow-up to this statement.  I met the Nigerian Ambassador on 6 November to convey directly the Government's grave concern and our appeal to the Head of State of Nigeria and the Provisional Ruling Council to cancel the sentences imposed on Mr. Saro-Wiwa and his co-defendants.  In asking for clemency I also expressed our concerns at the overall position regarding human rights and democracy in Nigeria, particularly in Ogoniland.</P>
    <P>In addition to Ireland's reaction to the Saro-Wiwa case many other Governments and the Commonwealth Secretary General have expressed dismay or concern about its outcome and have sought to have the death sentence cancelled or commuted.</P>
    <P>In 1993, as part of its efforts to encourage a return to democratic rule and respect for human rights in Nigeria, the European Union imposed a number of restrictions on the movement of personnel and military equipment from that country.  These measures remain in force.  They include restrictions on the placement of military personnel in Nigerian diplomatic missions, the annulment of bilateral military training courses and the suspension of bilateral high level visits which are not indispensible.  In particular, they provide for the case by case examination of new export licences for defence equipment with an <Col N="128" /> automatic presumption of refusal by member states.  Visa restrictions on military personnel and their families were also introduced at that time.</P>
    <P>In his national address on 1 October, the Nigerian Head of State announced a timetable for a return to democratic Government in Nigeria over a three year period.  The European Union has asked to have this implemented in a shorter period in its statements of 2 and 20 October.  The EU also used these statements to express its concern about the lack of transparency in the trial of alleged coup plotters and to deplore the continued use of secret military tribunals and the suspension of <i>habeas corpus</i> in Nigeria.</P>
    <P>Nigeria remains an area of priority engagement and concern for Ireland and the European Union.  The Government will continue to follow closely, both bilaterally and with our EU partners, the implementation of the public commitments made by General Abacha and his Government's human rights policy.  In so doing we will take account of all appropriate measures, including the strengthening of existing EU restrictions and whatever additional measures prove necessary in the interests of ensuring an early return to democracy.</P>
    <P>I express, on my behalf and that of the Government, our deep disappointment and dismay at the latest reports that the death sentences imposed on Mr. Saro-Wiwa and his co-defendants have been confirmed by the Provisional Ruling Council.  We called yesterday on EU partners to bring forward publication of the EU declaration on the matter and we have also raised the matter with our EU partners at high level today in Brussels.  We will use every means at our disposal, both bilaterally and with our EU partners, to try to ensure that the death sentences are not carried out by the Nigerian authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>The House has recently dealt with the problem of combating drug abuse, associated crime and <Col N="129" /> youth crime and we have provided resources for community policing, schools and partnership companies. However, we have failed to provide sufficient funding for youth services and in that regard I make a special plea on behalf of the parishes of Darndale-Belcamp and Kilbarrack-Foxfield St. John.  The parish of Darndale-Belcamp is approximately 21 years old with 1,250 houses and approximately 6,000 people. Despite major errors by Dublin Corporation in planning the estate, which has had to be refurbished at significant cost, there is tremendous community spirit and a vibrant tenants' association in the area.  The Oblate Order and a number of interested estate management committees, such as the Belcamp Estate Steering Committee, have set up in the area.</P>
      <P>The Darndale-Belcamp youth service which has operated for the past 20 years is badly in need of funding.  Two youth workers provide a wide range of activities for children from four to 19 years, but they must share a centre with a FÁS workshop which greatly restricts their hours of activity.  While they have approximately 30 voluntary helpers, the need for more full-time staff in a parish with so many young people is self evident.</P>
      <P>The youth service wishes to build a new centre at a cost of between £250,000 and £1 million that would include a drop-in centre, cafe, indoor sports hall and a car workshop, which they believe would be of great benefit. Those two youth workers have done tremendous work in helping to alleviate some of the problems in the area, including joyriding, and I make a special plea to the Minister on their behalf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second parish I want to make a plea for is that of Kilbarrack-Foxfield, an older one.  In some areas of it there is up to 30 per cent unemployment without any facilities whatsoever for youth.  There are some excellent local residents associations, including a socio-economic one called Obair but no <Col N="130" /> facility for the children.  At a well publicised, televised meeting on an estate in that parish on drug abuse children complained there was not even a disco they could attend.</P>
    <P>While accepting that the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, represents Cork North-Central, he must realise that in most urban areas, perhaps including his, north and west Dublin &mdash; there is a representative from Dublin West present &mdash; Limerick and so on there is a desperate need for the provision of such facilities for youth.</P>
    <P>Like my constituents I become very angry when I see national lottery funds being allocated to exclusive golf clubs, or very wealthy areas in which there are such recreational facilities.</P>

      <P>Yes.  Last year I noticed that, out of 29 grants on one sheet of national lottery allocations, 13 went to Kilkenny, including, I think, the Kilkenny Sailing Club or some such group.  Bearing in mind the funding received in my constituency that is nothing short of disgraceful.</P>
      <P>I plead with the Minister of State this evening to cater for youth services in deprived urban areas, specifically those of Darndale-Belcamp and Kilbarrack-Foxfield, to transform them from Cinderella-types into those with proper facilities and resources for our youth. We know from experience that the cost/benefit is considerable and can help keep young people occupied and educated, thus preventing them from following a path leading to anti-social behaviour.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Broughan for having raised this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of my areas of responsibility in the Department of Education is the provision of youth work services.  These services are in the sphere of non-formal <Col N="131" /> education.  I am continuing in my efforts to make these youth services available to young people.  This is done principally through the provision of financial assistance to special projects for disadvantaged young people and to national youth organisations which support local clubs and units throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Youth projects and organisations present valuable opportunities for the social and personal development of young people.  Qualities and skills such as leadership, co-operation, decision-making, motivation, and self-responsibility can be acquired in a learning-by-doing manner.  The aim of the youth service is to assist all young people to become active participants in a democratic society.  This participation, essential to the full development of young people, extends to involvement in institutions of social, political, cultural and economic life.</P>
    <P>In essence, therefore, the primary objective of the youth service is to help realise the potential of each young person and to facilitate their full participation in community life.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate the emergence of a more comprehensive and accessible youth service, a revised policy on youth work was outlined in the recent White Paper on Education, <i>Charting our Education Future.</i> Furthermore, in line with a commitment given in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> I have arranged for the preparation of a youth service Bill in order to provide a statutory basis for the development of youth work here.</P>
    <P>Youth services in the parishes of Darndale-Belcamp &mdash; Dublin 17 &mdash; and Kilbarrack-Foxfield &mdash; Dublin 13 &mdash; are provided mainly through Comhairle le Leas Óige, the youth sub-committee of the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  Darndale-Belcamp youth service was established to identify the needs of young people in the area and to provide programmes to meet these needs through social, recreational and educational activities.  An allocation of £51,636 was made through the youth affairs section of my Department to this <Col N="132" /> project for 1995.  In addition, a number of youth clubs in both areas received smaller operating grants from Comhairle le Leas Óige.  These included The Belcamp Adventure Group and The Friday Ravers Club in Darndale-Belcamp and St. Benedict's Youth Club in Kilbarrack-Foxfield.</P>
    <P>I envisage that the new structures currently being planned for the youth sector will facilitate the involvement of local communities in identifying gaps in provisions at local and community level and empower them to play a role in the development of responses to the needs of young people.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the recreational and sports grants being made available out of national lottery funds.  I will be closely examining applications, based on the needs of each applicant area and its level of contribution, not in absolute financial terms but dependent on its social needs.</P>
    <P>I do not think golf clubs were major recipients of such funds last year from my predecessor.  That mentioned by Deputy Joe Walsh in his constituency was allocated, not from national lottery funds but rather by the Department of Tourism and Trade.  Any decisions I shall take will be based strictly on the needs of applicant areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>From the beginning of this year we have learned of massive drugs seizures here, some examples of which are the following: £650,000 worth of heroin in January; £3 million worth of cocaine in February; £20 million worth of cannabis in March; £20 million of ecstasy and in November 15 tonnes of cannabis worth a massive <Col N="133" /> £150 million, clearly huge hauls worth massive sums.</P>
      <P>We must not forget the horrendous international statistical evidence to the effect that approximately 10 per cent only of drugs reputed to be trafficked into a country is seized.</P>
      <P>I warmly compliment the Garda, Naval Service and officials of Customs and Excise on the tremendous job they did in seizing the huge haul yesterday but there is now a clear need for an immediate legislative response on the part of the Government.  With great fanfare the Minister for Justice announced in early summer that she would introduce measures to tackle drug trafficking, in particular a measure whereby persons suspected of engaging in drug trafficking would be detained for seven days to allow them be questioned.  At present a suspected drug trafficker may be held here only for two periods, one of six hours and one of eight hours &mdash; the latter being a rest period &mdash; for questioning.  That ludicrous provision must be changed.</P>
      <P>The Minister also promised that the Naval Service would be given powers of arrest.  I also welcomed that decision. Fianna Fáil strongly supported the Minister's proposals but is alarmed that, several months later, the legislation urgently required has not been introduced.  It is clear the Minister and the Government have a criminal policy which is simply not working; that would represent the very best scenario or, alternatively, and at worst, no criminal policy in this area.</P>
      <P>It is of the utmost urgency that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice explain in forceful terms to the European Union Council of Ministers that not only is this country being used as a haven by drug barons and traffickers in order to import illegal drugs but is also being used by the same evil people to export massive amounts of illegal drugs to mainland Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In those circumstances one must take the view that it is incumbent on the European Union Council of Ministers not merely to protect our young people <Col N="134" /> but those on mainland Europe also.  As an island nation on the periphery of Europe it is obvious why this country should be the centre of a European coastguard service to tackle this problem head on.  It is obvious we do not have the requisite resources to do so. Nonetheless, despite scarce resources and shortage of personnel, our Garda, Naval Service and Customs and Excise officers have had remarkable successes.</P>
    <P>It is now time to act, to seek the aid of the European Union and to have definitive legislation on our Statute Book.  The time for procrastination, prevarication and indecision is over.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter in April last and again on 25 October representing as I do the Cork South-West constituency which has a very long coastline and many big harbours and inlets.  The fact that Deputy Deasy also raised the matter clearly demonstrates that it is a non-political issue.  We represent the area and we are often asked to contact the Minister to have additional resources provided to the Garda and the Customs service to combat the problem.  A number of large shipments and regular consignments have come in along the south-west coast.  The country is awash with drugs. The issue of drugs and related crime is the biggest issue facing society today.  It is an horrendous evil we must stamp out.</P>
      <P>The Minister announces <i>ad nauseam</i> that she has declared was on drugs.  We do not want declarations; we want something done about the issue.  I tabled a parliamentary question to the Minister today asking how many gardaí had exclusive responsibility for drugs in west Cork.  The reply was that out of 238 gardaí in Cork one inspector attached to Bandon station and a sergeant in the area are employed to deal with drugs. In County Kerry there are 230 gardaí and one garda is engaged full-time on drugs enforcement in the Kerry division.  If that is our response to the drugs problem along the south-west coast we are not serious about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="135" /> I appealed to the Minister on two occasions to allow the Customs office to remain open in Castletownbere, a major fishery port off one of the busiest shipping lanes in Europe, so as to retain a static presence there.  On 1 October the office was closed.  Is this a serious response?  The south-west coast is vulnerable and the Customs officers operating there do not even have a mobile telephone.  They have to beg or borrow coins in the hope that the public telephone will work if they need to use it.</P>
    <P>Some time ago suspects had a pleasure craft just off the harbour in Casteltownshend and the Customs officers had to borrow a punt at the pier to sail out as they do not have their own. The punt was not in good condition and started to take in water.  The Customs officers were in danger of losing their lives but for the suspects on the pleasure craft who came to their assistance and brought them ashore.  We must move on from such situations and I appeal to the Minister to become serious about this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the opportunity to congratulate the Garda on the success of the operation yesterday which resulted in the largest ever seizure of cannabis in the State.  I also acknowledge the co-operation and assistance of the Customs and Excise Service and the Naval Service in the operation.  This high level of co-operation is very much in the spirit of the new measures announced by the Minister for Justice last July to tackle drug traffickers and last night's drug operation is rightly regarded by all concerned as a major success for this policy of joint action and co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the House will appreciate, I am not in a position to go into any great detail on the background to last night's drugs operation.  Suffice it to say that it was the result of very good intelligence work and detailed planning by our law enforcement agencies.  It is important to emphasise that all Garda operations, <Col N="136" /> including the one yesterday, must be conducted on a confidential basis. Responsible Members on the opposite side of the House will appreciate that in order for the Garda, the Customs and Excise Service and Naval Service to do their work effectively this strict confidentiality must be maintained.</P>
    <P>As regards the drugs problem in general, the drafting of legislation to allow for the detention of persons suspected of involvement in drug trafficking for a period of up to seven days, and for the extension of the responsibility for the issue of search warrants in drug trafficking cases to a Garda superintendent, is at and advanced stage of preparation in the Department of Justice.  It is expected that the Minister will be bringing the proposals before the House this session.  Other measures announced by the Minister for Justice in the July drugs package are being implemented as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>I strongly support the proposal to make a coastal location in Ireland the centre for a European coastguard.  I am also Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and I have been pleased to see the Department of Justice closely engaged in European matters.  It is important the Department should impress on our European colleagues the problems we face in Ireland and the consequences of Ireland being targeted by drug barons and criminal organisations as a drugs market, with onward transmission to continental Europe.  I assure the Deputy the case for resources for Ireland in the fight against drugs is being made strongly by the Department of Justice, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste.</P>
    <P>Deputy Broughan spoke earlier about the problems in areas of north-east Dublin.  I represent the Dublin West constituency and there are a number of areas there which have significant problems of crime and drug abuse.  We have to adopt a twin track approach&mdash;first, to limit the operations of criminals in the drugs trade and, second, to provide the services Deputy Broughan mentioned <Col N="137" /> as alternatives to drugs and crime, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <P>In relation to the matter to be raised by Deputy Andrews I am advised that as of yet the person referred to in the request has not been charged in connection with any of the offences.  I remind the House that questions of guilt or innocence are matters for decision by the courts and that under the revised <i>sub judice</i> rule there is an onus on Members to avoid comment which might prejudice the outcome of any proceedings arising from the offences. Accordingly, Members should exercise discretion in their contributions and if it can be avoided they should also avoid making reference to persons outside the House by name or so as to be identifiable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I was motivated to raise this matter by a call from a constituent who is the keyholder of a shop in the Blackrock area of Dublin.  He brought to my attention during the week the most extraordinary circumstances involving an individual who has been sentenced to prison for a number of years for aggravated robbery.  This individual has been given weekend releases over the last number of months and during the period of his weekend releases he has raided this particular shop nine of the 12 times it has been robbed in recent months.</P>
      <P>This is a shocking commentary on the system.  The gardaí in Blackrock are among the best in Dublin, if not in the country, and I would not criticise them under any circumstances.  I have the greatest respect for the gardaí in Blackrock and Dún Laoghaire.  They operate under this system however, and it is difficult for them to deal with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a case where an individual&mdash; effectively a social terrorist&mdash;is released for the weekend on the revolving door principle.  Not only has he attempted to <Col N="138" /> assault his jailers but, in one of his robberies, according to the information given to me by my constituent, he caused £7,500 worth of damage to the premises in question alone.</P>
    <P>Last weekend this individual was again apprehended by the Garda, carrying out their work in a decent and generous manner to try to help the citizens who are terrorised by him.  I call on the Minister to examine this case in the context of the quite proper admonition given by the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in advance of anything.  I might say because, despite this individual's terrible behaviour, I do not want to prejudice his rights in law or his right to freedom.  However, we have responsibilities and duties, and this individual has exercised neither.  I ask the Minister of State to bring this matter to the attention of the Minister for Justice with a view to seeing if anything can be done about him.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge, the individual in question was apprehended last weekend arising out of another attempt on the premises to which he seems to be attracted like a moth to a flame.  I would much appreciate it if the Minister would give an undertaking to the House which would enable me to go back to my constituent and tell him, his wife, his family and the people in the locality that this individual will not be allowed to terrorise the keyholders of this shop premises or other individuals in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoanBurtonLAB" hpid="Ms Burton Ms Burton">
      <NameTxt>Ms Burton</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the legal profession Deputy Andrews will, I am sure, appreciate the constraints on giving a full response to him on this matter. The person to whom he refers has not been convicted &mdash; or charged with &mdash; any of the robberies referred to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The temporary release system has been operated under statute since 1960 by successive Ministers for Justice. While the system of temporary release is soundly based, I am also aware that, because of a shortage of prison accommodation, some offenders serve a smaller proportion of their sentence <Col N="139" /> than would otherwise be the case.  Individuals are also granted early release from custody for what are considered justifiable reasons &mdash; basically to facilitate resocialisation etc.</P>
    <P>Great care is taken in selecting individuals for release, involving consultation with prison authorities, the Garda etc., but we are not aware of any system which can guarantee, with certainty, that no individual released will commit offences during the period of release. The only foolproof way of ensuring this would be not to release anybody. However, all the professional advice is very much against this.  Not only would it lack humanity, it would also remove from the system a very important incentive to behave, a very valuable opportunity to resocialise, and would, in all probability, mean that at the conclusion of the sentence, society could find itself dealing with a much more difficult and troublesome individual.</P>
    <P>In chapter 5 of the document entitled &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo; which was published last year, there is a review of the current temporary release arrangements with a number of specific proposals for the <Col N="140" /> future.  In brief, these proposals provide for a reduction in the number of unsupervised releases in favour of a system where the majority of releases would be closely supervised by the Probation and Welfare Service.  The plan also provides for an increase in the number of prison spaces.  This aspect is currently under active consideration.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, a matter of the greatest concern, when any individual on temporary release commits a serious crime, and I can assure the Deputy that in all such cases a serious breach of this nature will be taken fully into account in the future management of the individual's sentence.  The Deputy can be assured that the case he has raised is already the subject of examination by officials in my Department.</P>

      <P>As a result of the serious level of delays in the courts the programme for government <i>A Government of Renewal</i> gave a commitment to review the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1994 to ensure that measures will adequately address the need to tackle the backlog of cases to be heard in all courts.  This review was completed last June and I obtained Government approval to prepare a Bill which would include provisions to increase the number of judges of the Supreme, High, Circuit and District Courts by three, two, seven and five respectively.  The drafting of this Bill is currently being finalised in my Department and I expect to introduce it very shortly.  When this Bill has been enacted I will be in a position to appoint these additional judges.</P>

      <P>A serious disturbance occurred in the Gallanstown-Cherry Orchard area of Ballyfermot on the evening of 31 October 1995.  From approximately 7.30 p.m., the gardaí became the target of a concerted and premeditated plan to immobilise them, ram vehicles and cause injury. Reinforcements were drafted in and an operation was conducted to restore order in the area.  Order was restored by 11.00 p.m.  Sixteen arrests were made and the following items recovered: 72 milk bottles, one of which was primed as a petrol bomb, 14 lengths of spiked planks of timber and four stolen cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that some suggestions <Col N="80" /> have been made to the effect that the gardaí delayed an ambulance getting through to a young boy who had been injured.  This matter is the subject of a separate investigation at present. However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that the gardaí, in fact, had to escort the ambulance through the crowd in order that it could reach the young boy.  Records show that the ambulance arrived at our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin 11 minutes after it had arrived at Gallanstown.</P>
    <P>It is important to state that the persons engaged in this disorder represent a small minority of those living in the area and involved others from outside the area.  Since the incident, the gardaí in Ballyfermot have received numerous messages of support from people in the area and others commending them for the action taken to protect life and property.  While it is clear there are certain underlying social factors contributing to crime in the area, it must be stressed there is no justification for the type of anti-social behaviour witnessed in the incident in question.  Such behaviour is at all times unacceptable.  Nevertheless, there is a need to tackle fundamental causes and, in this regard, proposals for a community based initiative similar to the one in operation in Ronanstown are being finalised by the Garda and will be submitted to the Department in the very near future.  I will act quickly on the recommendations made in this regard as these schemes are proving to be quite effective in other areas.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government's policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal</i> gives a commitment to draw up a charter for victims of crime including an immediate review of the criminal injuries compensation scheme.  The question of restoration of the pain and suffering clauses is an important issue that will be considered as part of the review of the scheme.  It also proposed to establish a restitution fund to which offenders could contribute.  Work on the charter for victims of crime and the review of the criminal injuries compensation scheme is under way in my Department and I hope to receive recommendations in this regard shortly. Any proposals which I might have, as a result of the detailed examination of these matters, will, in accordance with normal practice, have to be considered in the first instance by the Government.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to introduce legislation which would allow the Pretty Polly Enterprise Fund in Killarney to be exempted from tax, in view of the need to maintain this fund at £300,000 gross having regard to the serious unemployment situation in the Killarney area.</Quest>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, arising from the closure of the Pretty Polly factory in Killarney the workers received statutory redundancy payments, which are exempt from tax, and redundancy payments from the firm.  The latter payments are subject to income tax to the extent to which they exceed the basic tax-free element applying to redundancy payments i.e. first £6,000 (increased to £10,000 in certain circumstances) plus £500 per completed year of service in the employment.  In addition the firm has put aside a £300,000 enterprise fund from which grants are available to redundant Pretty Polly workers who start their own enterprise.</P>
      <P>Under the tax code any such grants-additional payments from an enterprise fund, being funded by a former employer, are treated as part of the firm's overall redundancy package and are taxed as part of the ex-worker's redundancy payment.  This practice has been applied to other redundancy situations.  The money provided for such enterprise funds is an integral part of a firm's overall redundancy package and must be so treated for tax purposes. This position was confirmed to representatives of Pretty Polly in response to inquiries on this matter in August, 1994.  Exempting such payments from tax could lead, in general, to taxable redundancy payments being substituted, at least in part, by non-taxed grants. This would increase the Exchequer's already significant financing of redundancies through the existing tax exemptions element applying to such payments.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I have no plans to alter the existing method of taxing payments from an enterprise fund being funded by a former employer.</P>

      <P>In 1994 the Department of Justice published a major policy document in relation to prisons entitled &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo;.  This outlines in detail the best way forward for the prison system for the following five years.</P>
      <P>The provision of additional prison spaces is one of the elements of the strategy set out in this document.  As the Deputy will be aware, in June of this year the Government decided to defer the Castlerea prison project and the proposed new women's prison.  The matter of the Castlerea project is still under examination by the interdepartmental committee set up after the decision on the deferral was taken.  This committee has been asked to report to me by the end of December 1995.  In the meantime the other elements of the strategy set out in the five year plan, such as the importance of developing community sanctions and measures as a means of avoiding the negative effects of imprisonment will be developed. Some of these sanctions are already in place and the scope for extending community based sanctions and measures is considerable given the professional expertise available in the Probation Service.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 78 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the detailed allocation of Garda manpower and resources to individual areas.  They have informed me that the present strength of the Kerry division is 230 and that of the Cork West Division is 238.</P>
      <P>While specialist drugs units have a valuable contribution to make, there is a limit to the extent to which available resources ought to be allocated to them. The Garda authorities believe that a more effective response is to provide for specialised anti-drug training of a much greater number of members of the Force who use that specialised training while also carrying out other police duties.  I must be guided by them in their professional judgment in this matter.</P>
      <P>In line with this policy, 40 members of the Kerry division have completed a specialised course in drug law enforcement.  There is one member engaged full time on drugs enforcement in the Kerry division.  In addition ten gardaí from Kerry and six from Cork West have undergone extensive courses with the Drugs Squad at Harcourt Square on the enforcement of drug related legislation which also involved practical experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there is one inspector attached to Bandon, the headquarters of the west Cork division, who has overall responsibility for drug related matters and enforcement in that division and <Col N="98" /> there is also a sergeant who is employed exclusively on drug related duties. These members co-ordinate intelligence on drug related matters and organise divisional resources in operational matters.</P>
    <P>I have also been informed that during 1993 20 members of the west Cork division, the majority of whom are attached to maritime stations, attended a specially convened drugs conference in Bandon.  Personnel from the Drugs Liasion Office and from Customs and Excise addressed this conference.  I understand that the juvenile liaison officers attached to both divisions are actively involved in organising and conducting seminars and talks for secondary school students, parents groups and interested organisations.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities have informed me that the members of the Kerry and Cork West divisions work in close co-operation and with other drugs units attached to adjoining areas.  They also liaise regularly with the National Drugs Unit which in turn liaises with Interpol and Europol.  There is a Garda inspector assigned permanently to the Europol Drugs Unit which is based in the Hague and he acts as this country's liaison officer with other member states of the European Union in relation to drugs trafficking and other related matters.</P>
    <P>I must stress that all members of the Garda Síochána receive basic training in drug legislation and enforcement.  There is an onus on all members as part of their normal policing duties to investigate and prosecute breaches of the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the policing arrangements, including those relating to drug-law enforcement, are kept under continuous review and any adjustments considered appropriate will be made.</P>

      <P>There have been no major works carried out at this station since 1984-85 when the Office of Public Works undertook a scheme of works which included interchanging the Garda station and married quarters.  Since then only minor essential maintenance works costing no more than £500 per annum have been carried out.  An exception was the exterior painting of the station in 1994 at a cost of £2,250.</P>
      <P>The deployment of Garda manpower and resources to individual areas is a matter for the Garda authorities.  They have informed me that there has been no sergeant allocated to the station in question since 1987.  They have further informed me that the station concerned has been part of the rural policing initiative since September 1991 with Kanturk being the area headquarters. This iniative combines the resources of all stations within the area headquarters for patrolling purposes.  The station concerned is supervised by a sergeant attached to the area headquarters.  The Garda authorities have informed me that they are satisfied with the current Garda service being provided to the area in question and they have no plans at present to allocate a sergeant there.</P>

      <P>Total trade with Mexico in 1994 amounted to almost £70 million which is down considerably from the peak of £93.2 million in 1992.  The balance of trade is very much in Ireland's favour with exports of £61.7 million and imports of £8.2 million in 1994.  Exports to Mexico grew very rapidly in the late 1980s and early 1990s as Mexico underwent rapid economic growth accompanied by major economic reforms and market opening as a prelude to joining the North American Free Trade Area, NAFTA, in January 1994. An economic slowdown and a monetary crisis later that year undoubtedly had an adverse effect on trade and contributed to the decline in Irish exports in 1994. However, the provisional CSO figures <Col N="101" /> for the first half of this year look encouraging and I am hopeful that trade will continue to recover through the rest of the year.</P>
      <P>Over the past three years An Bord Tráchtála has taken three trade missions to Mexico, one led by the former Taoiseach and one led by the former Minister for Tourism and Trade.  An Bord Tráchtála is confident that the underlying factors which made Mexico a growth market remain in place and that there is every reason to expect that Mexico will continue to be a significant market for Irish exporters in the future.</P>

      <P>Ireland's total trade with Poland has grown from £79 million in 1990 to £95 million in 1994.  In that period exports have grown from £24 million to almost £42 million, and the balance in Poland's favour has continued to narrow.

      <P>Vietnam is undergoing rapid economic development as it moves towards open trading economy status. Its commitment to this process has been underlined by its application to join the World Trade Organisation and by its admission earlier this year to the ASEAN group of nations.  Ireland's trade with Vietnam has grown from practically zero five years ago to £11.1 million in 1994.  In 1994 we imported £9.27 million, mainly footwear, and exported £1.84 million.  As I indicated in my reply of 10 May 1995, the Government will continue to support closer economic and trade links between the EU and Vietnam.</P>

I am particularly anxious that there should be a better balance in our trade with China and I made my views on this matter known to China's Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation, Madame Wu Yi, when she visited Ireland in April of this year.  Minister Wu Yi's response was encouraging and I am hopeful that Irish exporters will make good progress in China as its economy continues to grow, particularly in the special economic regions Guangzhou and Shanghai where significant opportunities have arisen as a result of the massive foreign investment pouring into these region, and China becomes more integrated into the world trading system.  Ireland, together with our EU partners, supports its accession to the World Trade Organisation as the appropriate entry conditions are met.</P>
      <P>An Bord Tráchtála sees good opportunities in sectors such as aviation, where Irish companies already enjoy considerable success, consultancy and training and construction, power generation, telecommunications and electronics.
