      <P>The first amendment I observe to be in order is amendment No. 6 in the name of Deputy Joe Walsh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11.&mdash;Section 24B of the Principal Act (inserted by section 4 of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1993) will be reviewed by the Minister and a report on this review will be laid before the House.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank the Chair for allowing amendment No. 6 as it is difficult to have amendments allowed under a social welfare Bill.  My amendment seeks a review by the Minister of fishermen, particularly crewmen on trawlers, throughout the country.  The fishing industry is extremely important and is going through a development phase.  Our fishing fleet is old and many of the boats are only barely seaworthy.  It is a dangerous <Col N="426" /> occupation because of inclement weather.  Fishermen and crewmen, because of regulations and court interpretation, cannot qualify for the full social insurance benefit.  As this group work hard and have a difficult and dangerous job to do the Minister should review their position and later in the year seek to redress it by allowing fishermen to opt for voluntary contributions so that they can benefit in the same way as everybody else on stamps or contributions.</P>
    <P>The limited benefits under the present system confine fishermen to 13 weeks unemployment benefit.  Due to weather conditions, highlighted this winter, 13 weeks unemployment benefit is inadequate and insufficient.  At a minimum the Minister should seek to find a way to increase the 13 weeks unemployment benefit to 18 or 20 weeks.  The position in Killybegs, Dingle, Castletownbere or Union Hall is that boats were tied up for months on end this winter.  It is difficult for those hard working fishermen to go to their local employment exchange and qualify for unemployment assistance or dole. They are subjected to a means test and find it extremely difficult to prove their earnings as they are regarded as shareholders on the trawler.</P>
    <P>Similarly, when they go to their community welfare officer to seek a medical card for their family they are subjected to a means test.  As they are not in regular employment and do not have P60s and P45s they find it extremely difficult to convince the health boards they are entitled to medical cards and the various other benefits.  In many cases they depend on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and voluntary organisations.  This is a desperate situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister told me yesterday that if the full stamp was allowed in this case there would be an overall cost of £67 million.  The reality is that of the order of £4 million was provided in the budget for social welfare.  It is unfair to single out one hard working section of the population who are prepared to make <Col N="427" /> their contribution and pay the full stamp.</P>
    <P>I am aware that skippers are anxious to be helpful to their crew and staff. Having got good and conscientious workers and crewmen they want to keep them on.  We are talking about a fight to maintain and retain isolated coastal communities.  Those communities who depend on fishing in Killybegs, Dingle, Rosslare, Union Hall, Kinsale and Castletownbere have no other source of income or any trade to follow.  They depend on fishing and are making a go of it.</P>
    <P>An important development in recent times has been the establishment of local co-operatives in these towns and villages to develop onshore much of the potential of the fishing industry.  These people do not want anything for nothing, they are prepared to make their voluntary contributions but they also want equity and fairness under the social welfare system.  We are talking about the retention of vibrant rural communities who are prepared to work for themselves and who have demonstrated that they are prepared to go out to sea in harsh weather conditions. When they are forced, because of weather conditions, to tie up their boats for some considerable time they do not qualify for the benefits to which I and any fair minded person would think they are entitled.  I ask that the Minister review this and present a report to the House at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>I strongly support Deputy Walsh's excellent amendment. As someone who lives in a coastal county, I am aware of the difficulties encountered by share fishermen.  For example, last year boats were tied up for a considerable period and fishermen were unable, through no fault of their own, to work.  It would be fair and equitable to accept Deputy Walsh's amendment. The main problem with fishing is that it is very dependent on the weather which means that share fishermen and <Col N="428" /> fishermen generally can spend a considerable amount of time on shore. Deputy Walsh's reasonable amendment would bring greater equity to social welfare law and I wholeheartedly support it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa) Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare (No. 2) Act, 1993, introduced a special scheme of optional insurance for share fishermen with effect from the 1993-94 contribution year.  Section 28B of the Principal Act provides for the rates of optional contributions payable and for the benefits covered by these contributions. Share fishermen can qualify for treatment benefit-disability benefit for up to 12 months in any continuous period of illness and for unemployment benefit for up to 13 weeks in any calendar year.  On Committee Stage I explained that the previous Minister had intended proposing a further optional scheme under which skippers who had regarded themselves as employers could, where crew members agreed, opt to pay the equivalent of the employer contribution, thereby entitling crew members to the full range of insurance benefits.</P>
      <P>A more fundamental review of the basis of insurability as an employee is required to deal not only with share fishermen but also with other categories of workers such a C45 workers in the construction industry.  I am not unsympathetic to the plight of share fishermen who do a difficult and dangerous job and I intend to carry out a full review of the insurability of employees generally. I hope to be in a position this time next year to bring forward proposals which will deal with the complexities of this issue.  On that basis I am not prepared to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important amendment.  On Committee Stage Deputy Walsh tried to get the Minister to take some action on share fishermen. We agree that there is a need for a review of the insurability of share fishermen and other categories of C45 <Col N="429" /> workers, for example, the self-employed, contractors, carpenters, bricklayers etc.  We need a basic review of the insurability of people who previously were clearly employees, who the Department of Social Welfare would wish to have kept and supported as employees.  However, this was not possible as a result of the finding of the court, to which the Minister must have regard.</P>
      <P>This ongoing problem needs to be addressed.  While consideration needs to be given to the two key areas there are also other areas which need to be looked at in the full review of the insurability of employees.  Share fishermen C45 workers and hotel workers and the residual effects of the court decisions which prevent them from receiving benefits they previously received have been referred to.</P>
      <P>Share fishermen have a special problem which needs to be addressed urgently.  The valuable interim scheme for share fishermen which was introduced in consultation with the representatives of fishermen provides cover for retirement, widows, orphans and survivors. It also provides cover in an exceptional way for treatment benefits which would not apply to other self-employed categories, 13 weeks unemployment benefit cover and a certain level of disability benefit.  Share fishermen do very hazardous work, yet under the changes introduced as a result of the High Court decision they do not have cover for invalidity pension.  On Committee Stage I asked the Minister to put down a Report Stage amendment on invalidity pension which would cost only £30,000 or £50,000 a year to introduce and would be of little consequence in terms of the overall social welfare budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very important that we do something about invalidity pension and occupational injury, the lowest cost area. Last week in Howth I met a fisherman who was involved in an accident on board a vessel out of one of the southern ports.  This man who has a steel plate in his leg and had no occupational <Col N="430" /> injury or invalidity cover told me that the owner of the vessel had no insurance cover and he felt that before licences were issued the owners of vessels should have insurance to cover the people working on boats.  Most boats have civil liability cover but there was no cover for this boat.  This man now receives a means tested payment. Deputy Walsh asked for a review as a matter of urgency and for a report to be laid before the House.</P>
    <P>This is an urgent matter and while we accept the Minister's commitment to review it in a general way, it will be some time before the experts can devise a scheme which will meet the requirements and the financial parameters.  The position of share fishermen is regarded as exceptional not only in Ireland but elsewhere, and exceptional arrangements are put in place for them.  I acknowledge that exceptional arrangements have already been made for them, but in the context of the current year it is important that further steps are taken as a matter of urgency.  While I accept the Minister's goodwill in saying he will carry out a general review at the end of which there will be development, I warn him of the complexity from a technical point of view of the various elements of that review and the importance in the meantime of making progress which would be particularly welcomed by share fishermen.  On those grounds I ask the Minister to deal with this matter urgently rather than in the long term.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to carry out an overall review of the matter, but my amendment deals specifically with share fishermen.  I am disappointed with the lack of concern and appreciation for their hazardous job and the fact that their boats are tied up for long periods of the year.  Skippers do their best by painting their boats and so on, but they do that only once a year.  They are in an extremely difficult position.  They reside in towns in peripheral areas where there <Col N="431" /> is little opportunity of securing other work.  We talk a great deal about cohesion and equal treatment for people in all parts of the country.  If the Minister joined his colleague, Deputy McGinley, in visiting, for example, <Col N="432" /> Killybegs and Castletownbere he would see at first hand the difficulties about which we are talking.  As this is an urgent matter I will press my amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 6, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;11.&mdash;Progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare will be reviewed by the Minister and a report will be laid before the House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Commission on Social Welfare produced its report in 1986 and it is reasonable almost ten years on that its findings be reviewed and the recommendations updated.  On Second and Committee Stages I asked the Minister to pay the rates recommended by the commission but I regret to say this has not been done.  As they are not exorbitant the cost involved would not be great.  In some instances the recommended rates have been exceeded.  Old age contributory and retirement pensions and survivor's and deserted wife's benefit are at 99 per cent of the recommended rate but in the case of supplementary welfare allowance, short term and long term unemployment assistance, unemployment and disability benefit and lone parent's allowance we still have some way to go.  The rates recommended by the commission are the absolute minimum required to provide the necessities of life.</P>
      <P>When people looked at the national finances and the state of the economy they expected to receive an above normal increase.  It is unfortunate therefore that those in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance and various assistance payments, including small holder's assistance &mdash; in some instances the figures stand at 90.7 per cent and 93.8 per cent &mdash; did not have their payments increased to the rates recommended by the commission.  In the case of social insurance schemes &mdash; I thank the officials of the Department of Social Welfare for supplying this information at such short notice &mdash; this would cost £16.79 million and in the case of short term and long term unemployment assistance payments £53 million, giving a total cost of £69.84 million this year and £30.11 million and £95.12 million in a full year.  These are not large amounts given that the total social welfare budget is £4 billion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a year in which there is a balance of payments surplus for the first time in more than a quarter of a century people were entitled to think that at last their hour had come and their payments would be increased to the absolute minimum required &mdash; £66 per week in the case of the personal rate of assistance or non-contributory old age pension.  This is not a substantial amount of money. Instead the rate was increased by £1.50 per week from £61 to £62.50.  It would have been reasonable to expect that it <Col N="435" /> would be increased to the recommended rate.</P>
    <P>I have received booklet No. 72 from the Department of Social Welfare which recommends a strategy and a payment structure for those dependent on social welfare.  We are not dealing with a small section of the population; rather we are talking about the 40 per cent or one million who are dependent on social welfare.  It has been identified in a number of studies by a number of agencies that at least one third of the population are living in poverty.  It is regrettable when there is cash in the kitty that they have not been given an above normal increase.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that both child benefit and the carer's allowance have been increased but the basic point is that one third of the population are living in poverty. As they tend to run out of money before the weekend they become distraught and find themselves at the mercy of moneylenders and various kinds of parasite.  Were it not for the charity and voluntary efforts of so many organisations and others in the community, including the Samaritans, St. Vincent de Paul and Meals on Wheels, the position would be much worse in our villages, towns and cities.</P>
    <P>Those dependent on social welfare have no hope of finding a job.  A sizeable number find themselves in this category. There is no point in saying to the 250,000 in receipt of old age pensions that we will increase child benefit as only 6,365 receive this allowance.  A further 92,000 are in receipt of various illness payments, including disability, invalidity and injury benefit, giving an overall total of approximately 350,000 who have no hope of obtaining work, even if they wanted it.</P>
    <P>It is most disappointing in a year when there were such high expectations that the rates were not increased to the absolute minimum required.  The Minister has said this would not be of much benefit but if that is the case why not provide them with the absolute minimum?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="436" /> The family income supplement was not increased.  The unfortunate people deemed by our system to have an income which is less than adequate and to whom the family income supplement applies were abandoned on this occasion.  There was no increase for those receiving child dependant allowance.</P>
    <P>There must be progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare. They must be reviewed by the Minister as a matter of urgency and a report laid before the House because people living in poverty, who are now referred to in the glossy reports as &ldquo;the marginalised&rdquo;, must be targeted and their problems highlighted.  After ten years there must be a review of this whole area and the commission's recommendations on this wide-ranging topic must be brought into the 1990s.  We must adopt a strategy whereby the wealth of the nation is distributed more equitably throughout the community.  That can best be done by reviewing the Commission's report and recommendations and having the report laid before the House for a full debate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment.  There is no coherent strategy on social welfare reform in the Social Welfare Bill.  There is certainly no acknowledgement of the seriousness of the plight of those on social welfare or any indication that the fight against poverty has been moved further up the Minister's political agenda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to point out that the budget was prepared against a background of extremely favourable economic parameters but no effort was made in the Social Welfare Bill to acknowledge that and to use it to help the most needy in society.  I make that comment in light of the minimalist increase of £1.50 per week in social welfare payments. While the Minister has provided for an increase in the child benefit scheme, he has not taken any congnisance of the plight of widows, single persons and, in particular, the elderly.  By the end of this year those people will <Col N="437" /> find that the rate of inflation is higher than the increases given to them by a Democratic Left Minister for Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>There is very little change in the carer's allowance.  The 2.5 per cent increase is totally inadequate.  While there are one or two good provisions in the Bill I ask the Minister to look at the whole issue of carers.  The Minister will be aware that one of the greatest problems in the years ahead &mdash; and which we are beginning to face already &mdash; is the need for accommodation in public hospitals for our elderly.  It is almost impossible to find such accommodation.  There has been a great proliferation of private nursing homes throughout the country because people do not have any other option but to send their elderly relatives to these nursing homes.  It is costing them a great deal of money each week to keep their relatives in these nursing homes because the carer's allowance is not sufficient to cover the cost of caring for them at home.</P>
    <P>In developing a policy on social welfare to cover the period up to the year 2000, and in line with what Deputy Walsh said, I ask the Minister to examine the whole area of carers.  The concept of looking after our elderly relatives at home was one of which we could have been very proud in the past.  Will the Minister also examine the whole area of means testing because many people would be happy to look after their elderly relatives in their own homes if an adequate amount of money was made available to them?  One of the difficulties people face in this regard is the means test.  There must be a serious examination of the costs involved in sending an elderly person to a private nursing home.  In the case of a person entitled to a nursing home supplement, we should consider whether it would be cheaper to remove the existing imbalance in means testing.  We should try to determine the percentage of people who might be able to live at home with relatives if an adequate amount of money was available to them through a fair mechanism of means testing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="438" /> Maintaining an elderly person in a hospital or private nursing home is far more costly to the State in the long term.  This problem will have to be addressed sooner or later because people are now living longer.  There will be a greater number of elderly in our population in the foreseeable future.  It is vital, therefore, to address the problem of how to care for our elderly population in a more efficient way.  Allowing them to be cared for in a homely environment is a policy worth pursing and I strongly urge the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <P>Before leaving this topic I want to quote from a speech the Minister made last year when he was in Opposition.  He stated: &ldquo;It is fair to anticipate that not too many bottles of champagne will be cracked open when these increases are eventually paid&rdquo;.  I believe those words have come back to haunt the Minister as a result of this budget and the Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>Widows, single people and the elderly will not forgive a Minister in whom they placed their trust and whom they hoped would be of assistance to them.</P>
      <P>In 1994 the supplementary welfare allowance was increased by 6 per cent and this year the Minister will increase it by 2.5 per cent.  The Minister understands that the supplementary welfare allowance is an emergency payment designed to met the exigencies of problems that arise out of the blue.  It is availed of by, for example, the homeless and those who cannot care for themselves and who are incapable of managing their own affairs.  It serves as a bulwark to help them cope with the extremes of poverty they may experience on a short or long term basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about a strategy that will apply up to the year 2000.  Has the Minister considered the possibility of rationalising this scheme?  Ongoing talks about bringing supplementary welfare <Col N="439" /> allowance within the remit of the Department of Social Welfare took place in the Department.  Has that idea gone by the wayside?  Does he agree that the system whereby the scheme is administered by the health board and the Department of Social Welfare is cumbersome, is not cost effective and is not meeting the real needs of the people who should benefit from such a scheme?</P>
    <P>A matter about which I feel strongly is the payment of rent supplement.  In 1989 the total amount paid was £7 million while this year the Department will pay up to £57 million.  Supplementary welfare allowance was supposed to be an emergency payment, but in reality it is an ongoing payment to landlords to keep people in private accommodation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that the intention behind the scheme?  I do not think it was.  From studies I have carried out, it appears that 69 per cent of all rent supplements are paid to single persons with no dependants.  That raises a question not alone in terms of our housing policy but in the context of marriage breakdown and the Government's policy in that regard up to the year 2000.  I accept there is an inadequate number of local authority houses, but is it the Government's intention to build one bedroom and two bedroom houses in future?  If we are to believe the statistics available from the Department, we will have to change our housing policy. While three bedroom and four bedroom houses will always be needed, because of changes in society it is imperative that we ensure that one bedroom and two bedroom houses are made available.</P>

      <P>I strongly support the amendment in the name of my colleague, Deputy Joe Walsh, which requests the Minister to review progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare and to place a report before the House.  A series of issues is raised in the main recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare, on some of which the Minister's predecessor had made substantial progress. One of these relates to the provision of information to social welfare recipients. For many years, particularly prior to the appointment of Deputy Woods as Minister for Social Welfare, this area was desperately neglected.  As Minister, Deputy Woods had to fight with Government to obtain the necessary resources to commence a major programme for the provision of information to social welfare recipients and the development of substantial new infrastructure &mdash; I am talking here about new social welfare offices.  The Minister's predecessor should be complimented on the substantial progress he made on this issue, which is referred to in the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I look forward to the opening of a new facility in my constituency in Tallaght. In reply to a parliamentary question put down by me, the Minister said <Col N="441" /> it is expected that office will be open in May.  The availability of information to social welfare recipients, particularly in my constituency in Dublin South-West, is a major aspect in the development of social welfare services.  I look forward to the opening of that and other facilities and I hope the Minister will&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Not in the seat in which you are now sitting.  I am sure that came as a shock to the Minister, as it did to many other people, but I congratulate him on his appointment.</P>
      <P>The amendment relates to the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  There is a section in the report about the provision of information to social welfare recipients, but information cannot be provided if we do not have the facilities, computerisation and staff, therefore this is very relevant to the amendment.  The Minister's predecessor undertook a major programme to meet those recommendations and I hope this Minister will continue with that investment.  I look forward to the opening of the new social welfare office in Tallaght which was planned by the Minister's predecessor and which will be a major source of information to social welfare recipients in my constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I spoke on Committee Stage about housing issues and the impact of rent increases.  The Minister outlined the decision taken by Dublin Corporation in this regard, which is laudable, but the problem is it was made on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, and it is up to individual local authorities as to whether to implement it.  I hope all local authorities will follow <Col N="442" /> the example of Dublin Corporation in terms of rent increases.  In so far as I can encourage my colleagues around the country to adopt its approach, I will do so.  There has been much criticism in the past, and rightly so, that increases for social welfare recipients, particularly in local authority housing, were swallowed up by rent increases.  I hope at some stage the Minister will develop a national policy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister congratulated himself and his colleagues on Dublin Corporation on making the decision on rent increases.  I hope he will persuade his colleague in the Department of the Environment to adopt such an approach and ensure this policy is put on a statutory basis so that increases for social welfare recipients in local authority housing will not be swallowed up.</P>
      <P>On the recommendations in the report of the Commission on Social Welfare relating to one parent families, there is a problem in terms of women having to prove they have been deserted.  It is traumatic for a woman to be deserted by her husband, but she then faces the difficulty of trying to prove she has been deserted.  This needs to be looked at in a far more compassionate way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that we discontinue the condition that the woman applying for deserted wife's benefit-allowance must prove her husband left of his own free will.  Tremendous hardship is caused to women who find themselves in this situation. I am dealing with such a case where a woman claims she has been genuinely deserted, has provided as much information as she can to the Department of Social Welfare office in Sligo but has been told the information is insufficient.  She has had to involve the Garda in trying to prove she has been deserted.  I accept there can be cases of abuse but generally women who find themselves in this situation should <Col N="443" /> not be faced with a series of hurdles to prove they have been deserted.  It is a time of great personal stress for the woman and her family and I hope the Minister will agree to review and effect change in this area.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Social Welfare recommended that the death grant should not be part of the social insurance system but should apply only to social assistance.  There is a great deal of confusion about who is entitled to a death grant and this arises at a time when people are suffering the trauma of losing a family member.  Entitlement to such a grant should be on a structured basis.  The Minister might also look at the level of grant aid as the death grant falls far short of funeral costs.</P>
    <P>The ability to keep people in the community where at all possible by paying a carer's allowance has been an issue since this allowance was first introduced.</P>

      <P>Deputy Walsh put forward a reasonable amendment and I ask the Minister to consider it.  Perhaps at some stage during the course of this year but prior to next year's budget he will have the opportunity to make progress on some of the main recommendations, be they financial, structural or whatever.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendment tabled by Deputy Walsh.  It is timely to review the progress we have made in implementing the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare particularly because of the lack of progress on the main rates in this year's budget.  It has been mentioned that the review relates particularly to the main rates.</P>
      <P>It is disappointing that there has been no movement in this year's Social Welfare Bill towards achieving the level set by the Commission on Social Welfare. In 1995 terms the main rate would be £66.60 with the upper level rising to £79.90.  In successive years the increase in the rates of social welfare has been above the basic increase and an extra increment was provided to close the gap between the existing rates and the rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  For example, while there was a general increase of 3 per cent paid last year the rates of short term unemployment assistance and supplementary welfare allowance increased by almost 6 per cent.  Additional moneys were paid to try to bridge the gap between the existing rates and the main rates.  The same applied to unemployment and disability benefits although in those cases because of other changes there was an additional increase above those rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is particularly important to continue to make progress along those lines <Col N="445" /> whether in regard to insurance or assistance rates.  If we do not continue to make progress we will find that the main target rate will be further away. Rather than bridging the gap, there is a real danger this year that the 2.5 per cent increase will be below the rate of inflation.  It is particularly important that we continue to bridge the gap.</P>
    <P>A great deal of progress has been made in recent years in meeting the target set by the Commission on Social Welfare.  For example, many payments such as old age contributory pensions and retirement pensions are above the bottom of the main rate.  Last year at least the priority rate was reached and exceeded for every payment.  That was a substantial improvement on the previous position.  The gap between that and the main rate of £66.60 was reduced very considerably and the possibility of bridging that gap was certainly opened up for this year.</P>
    <P>What does bridging that gap mean? The rate of invalidity pension is 96.4 per cent of the recommended rate and this means the gap is relatively small.  In the case of old age non contributory pension the gap is 6 per cent and 93.8 per cent of the main rate has been achieved. Going half way towards bridging those gaps this year would have made it possible to close them fully next year.  In the meantime the many thousands of recipients who depend on these payments would have had a further increase above the basic inflation rate, which we have grave doubts about.  All rates have reached 93.8 per cent except supplementary welfare allowance and short term unemployment assistance.  They stand out like a sore thumb.  Supplementary welfare allowance is the payment given to homeless people.  We heard various Government Deputies speak about the homeless and how important it is to suport them yet these rates are at 90.7 per cent.</P>
    <P>It would have cost only £3 million to go half way towards closing the gap between these two rates and the main rate.  Admittedly in a full year it would <Col N="446" /> cost approximately £6 million.  By definition, those in receipt of these payments are in the poorest of positions yet that £6 million could not be found. Something is radically wrong.  The progress made by successive Ministers over the years has been set aside.  No progress was made this year, rather the levels have been frozen at the inflation rate.  That should not happen in circumstances where, as Deputy Walsh pointed out, there was a surplus for the first time in 27 years.  It should have been a good year for those who depend on social welfare payments but nothing was done. Somebody took their eye off the ball because for the first time in a number of years no extra increase was given above the increases which apply generally. That is why we feel there is need for an urgent review of the strategy in the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  Good progress was being made and was welcomed by Deputies on all sides.  They were happy that the increases kept pace with inflation and in some cases were above it.  Deputies from all sides welcomed that approach.  The strategy was correct.  By all means do some things that will be high profile and bring in extra votes.  That is always welcome. Children are one of the priority areas and Deputies are not divided on the importance of support for children. However, the Government cannot just increase child benefit and freeze everything else.  That is the problem and that is where the strategy has changed.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we asked the Minister to reconsider some aspects of this but he said it was a firm decision and the route he was taking.  We pointed out that there were 180,000 old age pensioners with 2,000 child dependants.  The vast majority of them cannot benefit from the increase in child benefit and will only receive an increase of 2.5 per cent which is likely to be below the level of inflation.  It was hoped at budget time that the increase would match the estimated inflation rate.  Out of 196,000 recipients of unemployment assistance <Col N="447" /> only 62,000 have children and can benefit indirectly from the increases in child benefit.  There are 822,000 social welfare recipients but only 212,000 have children. In other words, 74 per cent of all recipients cannot so benefit.  When the report of the Commission on Social Welfare was introduced by the then Fine Gael Minister, Gemma Hussey, she said that the first recommendation, the increase in the main rates, was the No. 1 target.</P>
    <P>Reading what the Minister said last year one could take it that he was strongly convinced the rates should be continued and that the progress recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare on the main rates should be continued this year.  However, he said he would leave it aside this year and look at it again next year.  On 1 March 1994, as reported at column 1128 of the Official Report, he stated that the miserable level of most of the increases told its own story: £2.10 extra for a contributory old age pensioner and £3.40 for a pensioner with a dependant aged 66 and over.  He regarded these increases as miserable and derisory.  He used the word &ldquo;miserable&rdquo; several times and compared the increases with the cost of champagne and so on.  One would have thought that this Minister would at least have had a conviction and a commitment to do something in that area.  Even the basic 3 per cent would have provided a weekly increase of £2.15 for a single old age pensioner as against £1.80 weekly increase which is not the price of a pint even where the pint is not too expensive.</P>
    <P>The basic 2.5 per cent increase in the main rates is grossly inadequate.  That will become abundantly clear to everybody, especially to social welfare recipients. When old pensioners and other groups receive their payment books, they will realise the bad news in terms of the value of the increases provided in this Bill, while seeing other groups doing nicely because the economy is faring well but what does that mean to people on social welfare in so far as this <Col N="448" /> Government is concerned?  It means that the Government has forgotten about the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare on the main rates and will not close that gap where supplementary welfare allowance and short term unemployment assistance are 90.7 per cent of the main rate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh pointed out how costs could have been divided.  Increases need not have been made in respect of all benefits but only in respect of people in the worst position.  Different types of progress could have been made in terms of the main rates but no progress has been made in that regard.  While we welcome other measures in the Bill, we regret that.  The Minister and the Government will regret the day they decided that a 2.5 per cent increase was enough for old age pensioners.  That decision was made at the Cabinet table. The Government said it was not concerned about the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare nor the impact of the increase for old age pensioners.  Neither was it concerned for the majority of the unemployed and for the 74 per cent of social welfare recipients who cannot benefit from child benefit increases.  Will the Minister carry out a review and examine this as a matter of great urgency to regain sight of the target of reaching the main rates as quickly as possible?  I realise that may be difficult.  The Minister may say he cannot achieve all objectives at once and we recognise that but it is disappointing that he did not make progress on any of the main rates.  The weekly increases are of the order of £1.50 to £1.80.  That is the impact of the 2.5 per cent increase and it is not enough.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage we discovered that at the beginning of the year there was a substantial surplus of £50 million in the social insurance fund which covers the cost of insurance based rates, in respect of which workers, their employers and the self employed pay weekly contributions.  It is the first time in the history of that fund that there was a surplus in it at budget time.  That fund essentially pays the basic rates of social <Col N="449" /> insurance, bridges the gap to which the Commission on Social Welfare referred and should ensure that the rates increase to at least the main rates.  The Minister has told us that the extra money in the fund was used to pay the equal treatment payments but those payments should have been a charge, as is the case in respect of the balance of those payments, on the Government, the Department of Finance and the Exchequer.  Equal treatment payments arose as a result of a mistake made by the 1984 to 1986 Government and it should be paid for by the Government and the Exchequer, not from the social insurance fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a mechanism under &ldquo;public administration&rdquo; for the imposition of a surcharge.  Money was available on the insurance side to move towards the main rate recommendations and they could have been achieved. Unfortunately, the Government lost sight of that objective, perhaps because of the change of Government and the formation of the Rainbow Coalition whose members had to learn to understand each other.  It took its eye off the ball and lost the momentum developed over the years.  That was revealed in the Department figures given to Deputy Walsh.  The Minister discovered there was a surplus in the fund at the beginning of the year and that the Exchequer must contribute £106 million to it, an <Col N="450" /> equivalent of 6 per cent of the total fund.  That figure was only revealed during Committee Stage and the Minister acknowledged he had not been aware that was the position.</P>
      <P>As the Exchequer figures were rounded up after the budget, it transpires they will include an allocation of £106 million to bolster the social insurance fund because of what happened. In his review the Minister must ensure that the fund is safeguarded for the workers it was designed to serve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We must remember that the worker wants someone concerned about his or her basic payment to give the matter priority, as the Commission on Social Welfare did.  While within the law one can manipulate various things, beneficiaries depend on the Minister to ensure the security of their basic rates and ensure there is not too much drift from the fund.  Now that we know the Exchequer will provide £106 million, the Minister for Finance will have to supplement the fund by that amount.  No doubt the Minister for Finance will state <Col N="451" /> there is a limit to the funds available to him.  The Minister for Social Welfare must bear in mind that, within the subtlety of the future development of that fund, priority must be accorded to workers' benefits.  However, that did not happen this year as there was no improvement in the basic rates.</P>
      <P>In the review proposed by Deputy Joe Walsh the Minister should maintain a close eye on the social insurance fund and its development to enable it to cater for workers who contributed throughout their lifetime, and ensure there is no move towards means-testing benefits. At the end of the day the danger is that one's old age, invalidity pension or other direct payments would be means-tested.</P>

      <P>A number of other matters are important with regard to the development of main rates, one relating to adult dependant allowances &mdash; 90 per cent of such recipients are women workers.  As soon as an adult dependant earns in excess of £60 per week, the main beneficiary will lose the adult dependant allowance, creating many difficulties.  In previous years that allowance was increased steadily until it reached £60, with a commitment during the past year to provide a sliding scale to income in excess of £60, operable from the date of implementation of this Bill, thereby obviating an immediate cut-off.  The only other alternative is to increase the figure of £60 but it was agreed on both sides of the House last year that a sliding scale was preferable. It was disappointing to note that no such sliding scale was introduced in this Bill which we would have welcomed and supported.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other, similar anomalies warranting attention, highlighted by the Commission on Social Welfare.  A great deal of progress has been made on its <Col N="454" /> main recommendations.  It would be timely and valuable to produce a report on progress made to date, thereafter its main value would be to focus minds on the importance of pursuing the main rates, which is what has been lost sight of this year.  That was the reason Deputy Walsh tabled his amendment, the first priority of the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>The Minister said a number of times: &ldquo;We have heard this before, the increase is 2.5 per cent, it has been decided, and we do not propose doing any more&rdquo;.  On Committee Stage, he said he would look at the main rates next year.  The problem is the payments are so low.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In practical terms they are still too low.  We are talking here about two separate issues.  One is that the 2.5 per cent increase is likely to leave all the beneficiaries below the inflation rate which was tentatively estimated at budget time.  The Minister knows as well as everybody else that it is likely to be exceeded by 0.1 per cent, 0.2 per cent or 0.3 per cent and, if so, people lose out.  That is one side of the equation.  The other side is the main rates recommendation of the Commission on Social Welfare and the importance of continuing progress there.  I urge the Minister to continue with the improvements which all of his <Col N="455" /> predecessors have built into the main rates.</P>
      <P>Let us look at the practicality of what has happened and the limited 2.5 per cent increase for 1995.  If we compare the insurance schemes for 1994 and 1995 we find a reduction in the amount of money provided for all those schemes of £8.9 million.  In other words, In 1994 the allocation to the insurance schemes was £47.5 million, in 1995 the allocation is £38.6 million.  That is a reduction in 1995 of £8.9 million.  The allocation to all the assistance schemes &mdash; the two groups covered in this amendment &mdash; has decreased from £49.5 to £38 million, a decrease of £11.5 million.  Between insurance and assistance there is a drop of over £20 million in the money provided in this area over last year.  This issue should not be allowed drift away because it comes home to people on the ground.  It means that old age pensioners, widows, deserted wives, invalidity pensioners, those on short term and long term unemployment assistance &mdash; about 74 per cent of all the 850,000 direct beneficiaries &mdash; cannot benefit from the indirect child benefit improvement. In effect it means they will only get the 2.5 per cent increase and they will make no progress in relation to the recommendations of Commission on Social Welfare.  Their position as the Minister said last year, in relation to a bigger increase, will be miserable.  I do not know what word the Minister would use to describe this year's increase.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

    </Speaker>
    <P>I strongly support the amendment put down by Deputy Walsh and congratulate him for giving us the opportunity to <Col N="456" /> make these points in the House.  People tend to miss what has happened on Committee Stage where we had an excellent discussion in a fairly short session. This is a short Bill but that is a separate question.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh has given us an opportunity to highlight and tease out the issues so that when the Bill leaves the House it will be clear what has happened. Let us then celebrate the good parts in the Bill and the improvements in child benefit.  We dealt with those in detail on Committee Stage following the report of the review committee on child benefit.  We must recognise that what has been done to the vast majority of people who depend on social welfare has been particularly bad and will have a damaging effect on their financial standing and on their ability to meet their outgoings.  It will have a disastrous effect this year.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;repeat themselves on the one point they wish to make on the whole Social Welfare Bill, which we heard for hours on end last Friday and yesterday.  It must have been a relief, in view of the fact that they knew their earlier amendments would be out of order, that they thought of an amendment which would be in order to allow them discuss it widely.  There is some merit in the proposal contained in their amendment.  The Minister indicated yesterday that he would consider a broader review of the whole social welfare system, not just looking over the commission's report.  That is the proper approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest the matters which the Deputies opposite are asking the Minister to consider be dealt with by the Select Committee on Social Affairs, which <Col N="457" /> has been given extended terms of reference. As a Government member of that committee I look forward to using the powers given to us to initiate studies in many areas.  Issues concerning social welfare, health and labour come within the remit of that committee.  The Select Committee on Social Affairs should be engaged in the type of consideration envisaged in this amendment.</P>
    <P>A glance over the first chapter of the report with a summary of the recommendations indicates that a substantial amount of work has been done and that substantial further moves are contained in the budget but more remains to be done.  It is clear from the budget provisions and developments in recent years that we need a new agenda of social welfare issues.  That is the kind of review I would like to see carried out of the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, now ten years old.  We should work towards setting a new agenda for the Department of Social Welfare and use our powers in a focused way to ask the Minister to adopt the priorities we will set and what he is doing about the remaining items.</P>
    <P>I would be more impressed regarding the sincerity with which Deputy Woods and his colleagues are pursuing the question of the minimum rates had he not so recently left office, having been involved in a greater number of budgets than any other Minister for Social Welfare in the history of the State.  If it was so easy to achieve he has many more questions to answer than the Minister. There is a new generation of social welfare issues.  Take for instance the commission's recommendations on child care.  What is happening in this Bill and what the Minister has indicated will happen as the second phase next year is totally different and is moving towards a more radical approach than that envisaged in the commission's recommendations, which were modest in that area. This is an area the Select Committee on Social Affairs could usefully look at.</P>
    <P>I hope that in the next century the pressure on the labour force will be significantly reduced, growth will continue <Col N="458" /> and there will be a reduction in the number of people unemployed.  This will enable us to consider the introduction of measures which are too costly to introduce at present.  One of these measures should deal with dependency, and the Select Committee on Social Affairs could look at this issue.  In many families the main recipient receives £48 or £52 per week while the needs of the other members are catered for out of the dependant allowance and the children's allowance.  This gives rise to very real problems and we should consider the abolition of the dependency concept at a time when we are in a position to introduce costly reforms.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to support for teenagers, many of whom are in grey area and can only be guaranteed a substantial income if they become lone parents. The Bill increases the guaranteed minimum payment for teenagers living at home with their parents.  Consideration should be given to supporting teenagers who are in education.  We need to examine this area to ensure that our support systems encourage young people to engage in activities which will prove valuable to them in the long term and do not facilitate ways of life which lead to poverty for both them and their children.</P>
    <P>I agree with the broad principle that all incomes should be taxed but consideration should be given to the negative impact of the previous Government's decision to tax social welfare benefit in that people who have been on social welfare for a certain period do not want to take up employment as they are not given a tax free allowance.  The way the taxation of social welfare benefit is implemented is a direct disincentive to recipients to take up employment. We would be horrified if we were not given a tax free allowance.</P>
    <P>The reason Fianna Fáil tabled this amendment was to enable it to regurgitate its one page response to the Bill.  I would have been much more impressed if the Deputies opposite had a more wide-ranging debate than merely repeating the arguments already made <Col N="459" /> about the rates of payment.  The public have taken part in opinion polls and they know that even though there were losers in the budget there were also substantial winners.</P>

      <P>The Deputies opposite have failed to accept that unlike previous budgets there have been no cutbacks and that the increases are in line with the rate of inflation while the increases for certain identified categories have been much greater.  The public recognises the priorities set by the Government and accepts that the commitments made by all Government parties have been honoured in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The best way of dealing with the issue raised in the amendment is at the Select Committee on Social Affairs which can question the Minister and officials in detail.  As the Government convenor of the committee, I would support such an approach for reviewing the progress made in the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare and for setting a new social welfare agenda which goes beyond the issues raised in the programme.</P>

      <P>The Deputies opposite have regurgitated the points they made during the debate on the budget and on Second and Committee Stages of this Bill.  It is clear that some of them have not even read the Bill.  For example, they referred to the need to taper the adult dependant allowance but did not know that section 15 provides <Col N="460" /> for this.  On the recommended rates, I draw attention to the fact that the injury benefit which was ahead of the recommended rate was reduced by a Fianna Fáil Minister.  Deputy Woods said there should be no losers but I would remind him of the dirty dozen cuts and the fact that Fianna Fáil never introduced increases in social welfare without cutting the rates in other areas.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil has not set out any coherent strategy or put forward a single new idea on social welfare policy or how to tackle poverty.  All we have had from the Deputies opposite is constant carping and complaining.  However, the public recognises the paucity of Fianna Fáil's ideas in this area.  Up until last year we had a Fianna Fáil Minister for Social Welfare since 1987.  The electorate has finally got a break from that pain.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flood referred to the need to abolish the concept of desertion.  He does not seem to have listened to the Budget Statement, my speech on Second Stage or the numerous statements I made since then that a second Bill which will abolish the concept of desertion will be introduced later in the year.  The Department is almost finished its work on that Bill.  The Deputies opposite do not appear to have read the Bill or to have any ideas other than to complain about the rate of increase. They fail to acknowledge that we have had the biggest increase ever in the social welfare annual budget, 35 per cent more than last year when Deputy Woods was Minister for Social Welfare. I take Fianna Fáil crocodile tears with a grain of salt.</P>
      <P>Deputy Woods said unemployment benefit or disability benefit should not be means tested.  He was the Minister who facilitated the taxation of those benefits.  When I took up office I discovered he had agreed not only to the taxation of those benefits, but the wheels were in train this year to deduct the tax at source from a person's social welfare cheque.</P>

      <P>We have heard a great deal of waffle and chat but nothing new.  We have been told to review the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  Of course those 65 recommendations which were put forward in 1985 should be reviewed.  It is interesting to note that the commission recommended the Government of the day should move immediately on implementing a priority rate of £45 for those earning less than that amount.  It took Fianna Fáil Governments from 1987 to 1994 to reach, not the recommended rates, but the priority rates the commission recommended should be implemented immediately.  I do not take the Deputies' criticism seriously.  They have <Col N="462" /> failed to present a serious case.  On the one hand, they argue that the Government is spending too much money and, on the other, they argue we are not spending enough on social welfare increases.  At the same time they welcome the increases in child benefit and want it all paid.  From where will all the additional money come?</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know why the <Col N="463" /> Minister is getting so excited.  This is a simple amendment requiring that progress on the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare will be reviewed by the Minister and a report will be laid before the House.  I fail to understand why the Minister cannot accept that amendment.  Would he be embarrassed by the report which would be published annually while he is in office, which I hope will not be for long?</P>
      <P>The figures indicate that substantial progress was made in the past decade. Despite what the Minister stated, substantial progress was made in the past decade in reaching the target rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and in some cases those rates were exceeded.  The Minister will be aware that the supplementary welfare allowance and unemployment assistance rates are still 10 per cent below the target recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The Bill will assist in moving them further from the target.  The Minister stated that what he heard today was a regurgitation of what was said on Second and Committee Stages.  In view of his response, it does not surprise me that much of what was said on those Stages had to be repeated today.  He has not acknowledged one suggestion from this side of the House and even today he has signally failed to respond to the points made.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated there was not a single new idea in the Fianna Fáil approach.  It is up to the Minister to come up with the new ideas, that is the job with which he is charged.  I read the Bill carefully and did not find a single new idea in it.  It is a combination of tinkering with the system and tokenism, giving a few bob here and there to various targeted political groups in the electorate.  The objective is not to increase the benefits payable to the poorest and most vulnerable in our society, but to top up the electoral support of the parties in Government, particularly the Minister's party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="464" /> Deputy Woods stated that there is not a sliding scale in relation to adult dependant allowance.  That is true and despite what the Minister just said there will not be one as a result of this Bill. His reply was tantamount to misleading the House.  When referring to section 15 on Second Stage the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Section 15 provides for the giving of regulatory powers to the Minister to enable an adult dependant allowance to be paid in respect of a spouse or partner who has weekly income in excess of a prescribed amount.  It is my intention that the adult dependant allowance payable in these circumstances will be tapered by reference to the level of the spouse's or partner's income.</P>
    <P>In other words, in section 15 the Minister has given himself an enabling power to introduce regulations at an indeterminate time in the future to do what Deputy Woods suggests should be done now.  The Minister quoted a proposal&mdash; of which I do not have any knowledge &mdash; which he alleges was in the works at the time the previous Government fell. There was a proposal in the works at that time to introduce a sliding scale for adult dependant allowance to which the Minister did not refer.  It makes perfect sense that this should be done.  The cut-off point for adult dependant allowance is £60.  That is inequitable and unjust and I could give the Minister numerous examples of individual cases where it operates unfairly.</P>
    <P>If the Minister examines the taxation system he will note that there is a sliding scale of exemption limits which represent the cut-off point below which a certain income is not taxable.  If it is logical and just to introduce such a measure in the taxation system, surely it is imperative that it is part of our social welfare system.  The proposal would have been introduced this year if a Fianna Fáil Minister had been introducing the Social Welfare Bill.  The Bill merely provides the Minister with the power to enable him introduce the regulations. <Col N="465" /> There is no indication when they will be introduced or what form they will take. The net result of section 15 is that the Minister now has power, which I reckon he always had, to bring in regulations to provide a sliding scale.  That is not much good to the people affected by the gross anomaly whereby if the main beneficiary's partner earns more than £60 in a week his allowance for his partner is automatically discontinued.</P>
    <P>The Minister accused Fianna Fáil of saying not enough was being spent, and asked where the money would come from.  That is a new tune for Deputy De Rossa to sing.  When he was in Opposition I and other members of the Government had to listen to him during Adjournment debates and debates on legislation, and money was no object to Deputy De Rossa.  The illusion was created outside this House by the Minister Deputy De Rossa and his cohorts that the 14 or 15 people around the Government table had a bottomless sack of money which they would not give to the poor because of their scrooge mentality.  The reality is that money spent by any Government is taxpayers' money.  The Minister, who is now asking us where we would find the money for this, that and the other, had scant regard for that when he was on this side of the House.  The record proves it.</P>
    <P>This budget will take us further from the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare on rates of payment.  Will the Minister of State tell me how many people will not benefit from the increase in the child dependant allowance?  It is my information that of all social welfare recipients, about 75 per cent will not benefit and will only get the 2.5 per cent increase.  The Minister claimed he was increasing benefits for 75 per cent of social welfare recipients in line with inflation.  Where did his figures relating to inflation come from? My information is that 2.5 per cent is a wildly optimistic estimate.  If inflation exceeds 2.5 per cent, as the Minister of State knows it could, the net result will be that 75 per cent of social welfare <Col N="466" /> recipients will have their benefits reduced in real terms by the Minister, Deputy De Rossa, the champion of the poor.</P>
    <P>The overall increase in social welfare has been adverted to by the Minister as some sort of alibi for what he is doing for 75 per cent of social welfare recipients. I welcome an overall increase in social welfare expenditure.  However, the money is being improperly spent. The Minister spends most of his time taking credit for a decision of the courts and claiming that he is paying married women their entitlement off his own bat rather than acknowledging that he was forced to do so by a court decision.  I realise that a substantial part of the increase in the overall Social Welfare Bill consists of increases in child benefit to social welfare recipients, but child benefit is payable to everybody, including the wealthiest.  The Minister's main theme when in Opposition was that overall expenditure on social welfare was too low and, more important, that expenditure on social welfare should be properly targeted at the weakest and most vulnerable in our community.  This Bill does the reverse of that.  There is plenty of targeting but it seems that it is the better off who are targeted at the expense of the poorest and most vulnerable. It is the weakest who will have to pay for the increases which are going to the better off up to and including the wealthiest.</P>
    <P>The Social Welfare Bill flows from social welfare announcements in the budget.  If one compares its provisions with other measures in the budget, for example, the abolition of third level education fees, one will see that it is the better off who benefit, people who cannot satisfy the means test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State does not seem to understand the simple fact that there is a means test for third level grants.  People who do not qualify earn above the threshold, therefore, they are the better off, the people who <Col N="467" /> will gain in net terms from the abolition of third level fees to the extent of £40 a week per child.  Compare that with the increase of £1.50 a week for an old age pensioner or £1.60 a week for a person in receipt of unemployment assistance. On the Minister's scale of values and that of the Government whose policies the Minister of State enthusiastically supports, one beef tribunal lawyer's daughter is worth 27 old age pensioners. That is the scale of values of the Minister Deputy De Rossa, the champion of the dispossessed.</P>

      <P>Perhaps I should not be surprised that Deputy Durkan enthusiastically supports these policies, as he does not seem to understand how third level fees are calculated and how the means test operates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a narrow Bill, a combination of tinkering and tokenism.  It does not iron out many of the anomalies in the social welfare system despite undoubted improvements made in various aspects of social welfare over the years.  Nothing has been done about the adult dependant allowance other than enabling the Minister to perhaps do something about it at some time in the future.  Unless I have misread the Bill, there is no proposal to amalgamate disabled persons maintenance allowance and unemployment assistance as recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  There is no proposal to reorganise the fuel allowance scheme which is riddled with anomalies. Those are just three examples. The Minister has announced on several occasions that he will amend the lone parent's allowance scheme to provide for a single category and abolish the concept of desertion, but that is not in the Bill.  I understand the Minister will introduce further legislation at some indeterminate time in the future.  Will the Minister of State give some indication of when this legislation will be brought forward, because asking the <Col N="468" /> Taoiseach on the Order of Business is really the dialogue of the dumb.  One learns more from the papers.</P>
    <P>On the proposals made by the Commission on Social Welfare in regard to rates this Bill will take us further from, rather than closer to, the implementation of the recommended rates to which the Minister repeatedly said he is committed.  Whatever ingenuity he brings to bear the Minister of State will not be able to disprove that contention as the figures speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>On the question of lone parent's allowance &mdash; I understand that something will also be done about this rate &mdash;very little has been done to pursue deserters to make a contribution towards the cost of maintenance payments. Successive Governments must take responsibility for this.</P>

      <P>The Government has been in power for three months and I see no sign of action although 14,000 deserters have walked away from their responsibilities and families.  It is my understanding that of these only 183 are paying maintenance.  I do not know what percentage of the 14,000 would be in a position to pay &mdash; I suspect about half &mdash; but only about 500 have been identified. Approximately £7,000 per week is being received from the 183 who have been pinned down.  There is, therefore, a crock of gold which could be used for the benefit of social welfare recipients. As a first step the number of staff in the maintenance arrears section of the Department should be increased from the present figure of four.</P>

      <P>We ask the Minister and his Minister of State to ensure that the 75 per cent of social welfare recipients who cannot claim child dependant allowances will not lose out.  Even at this late stage I appeal directly to the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, who has been very vocal on behalf of the large number of social welfare recipients in his constituency, to ensure that the Bill is amended either here or in the Seanad. At a time when the Minister is committed to the implementation of the rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare and the economic climate is benign it is despicable that these recipients should lose out.</P>
      <P>The minimum the Minister should do is accept this amendment as it would not cost the Government or the taxpayer money.  It seems the only reason for not accepting it is that it would be a monument to the failure of the Minister and a source of embarrassment to him.

      <P>Some of the points raised by Deputy O'Dea were only vaguely relevant to the amendment.  He used the words &ldquo;tinkering&rdquo; and &ldquo;tokenism&rdquo; but this was farfetched.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Fianna Fáil spokes-person on Social Welfare, Deputy Walsh for recognising the great work that has been done within the space of three months and suggest that he tabled the amendment with tongue in cheek. One cannot change the social welfare <Col N="470" /> system in that length of time but a review is being undertaken and it is the intention of the Government to improve on an ongoing basis the lot of those in receipt of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea suggested that the thrust of this Bill will work to the benefit of the better off.  He may have in mind a proposal that would discriminate against those who currently qualify for child benefit and so on.  I detected this at an earlier stage.  If so, he should state this clearly.  From remarks on Second Stage it appears that the proposal might be that women above a certain income limit should not receive child benefit.  If that is the case I seek clarification before Members on the opposite side of the House shed crocodile tears.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to a number of other points raised by Opposition speakers.  They have hard necks to come into this House over recent days, and weep and gnash their teeth in an effort to give the impression that they are actually concerned.  Do they remember what they did when they were in power?  Do they remember the measures they put in place only one year ago, some of which are only now <Col N="472" /> becoming obvious to certain unfortunate people?  I could outline numerous cases &mdash; and I am sure other Members could do the same &mdash; of unfortunate people who, through no fault of their own, found themselves out of work due to illness.</P>
      <P>I gave an example in the House on a previous occasion of a person who had never been out of work in his life until he had to undergo major surgery.  That person got a shock when he returned to work as a result of a measure that was brought in by those who are now, thankfully, sitting on the opposite side of the House.  There are other problems that we have not yet had time to address comprehensively.  Having recovered from the serious operation, including the additional expenditure of hospitalisation and medication, and having overcome the general concern about his health, the man I referred to returned to work after a period of four months and the first shock he received was that his tax free allowance had been slashed.</P>

      <P>I recognise there was a need to ensure that there was not an abuse of the system and that certain employers and employees did not benefit to the extent that it was of a distinct disadvantage to others.  However, it was the classic case of using a sledge hammer to crack a nut.  The measure adversely affected everybody in an indiscriminate way and it was a serious disincentive to people going back to work.  There is not anything more serious for a middle aged person than to find that after all their years of working diligently and providing for their families they are suddenly penalised when they become ill.  I am amused when I hear Opposition speakers talking as if they were really concerned about these people.  We know how concerned they were &mdash; they expressed it by introducing the measure to which I referred.</P>
      <P>Members opposite are nice people generally &mdash; but they tend to go off on a tangent and be a little irrational at times.</P>

      <P>I hope that after seven or eight years in Opposition they will recover and become normal once again. They are in danger, however, of becoming the &ldquo;2.5 per cent&rdquo; party because all I have heard from them since the budget was introduced is the 2.5 per cent social welfare increase.  I know Deputy O'Dea is good at figures and if he takes into account the fact that social welfare payments generally will be made six weeks earlier this year, he will find that the 2.5 per cent rises above 3 per cent.  As people will receive their payments six weeks earlier, they will actually receive more money than if the original increase had been 3 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods was not in the House but it seemed as though we were discussing the beef tribunal a few minutes ago.</P>
      <P>Members opposite should get away from this straitjacket of 2.5 per cent about which they are constantly talking. I will try to explain how the 2.5 per cent general increase becomes 3 per cent when the payments are brought forward, as has been done.  Opposition Deputies should forget about the 2.5 per cent because the increase is actually more than 3 per cent.  That figure was identified by the leader of the Opposition in his comments on budget day. He obviously came to the conclusion that 3 per cent was a reasonable increase.  We are giving a 3 per cent increase so there should not be any difficulty. I do not understand, therefore, why other members of his party &mdash; weeks later &mdash; continue to complain about the 2.5 per cent increase.</P>
      <P>The thrust of the Bill &mdash; which is also the thrust of the budget and will be the thrust of Government policy &mdash; is to ensure that everyone is treated equally. The 3 per cent increase is approximately what most other employees will be getting by way of their increases this year. We are attempting to introduce a balance which did not exist previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to refer to one other matter. When my colleague, the Minister for Social Welfare and myself come under attack from Deputy O'Dea over the abolition of third level fees I feel very vulnerable.  People in Limerick must be different from those elsewhere because throughout my public life I met people who experience great difficulty in keeping two, three or four children in university because their incomes are barely above the eligibility limits.  Those people will most benefit from the proposal that will be implemented shortly.  Those who consider that a person with three children in third level education who is earning £18,000 or £19,000 is well off, <Col N="475" /> are wrong.  We are talking about all adults in the household and if one equates that with social welfare payments, we are talking about basic social welfare payments in terms of disposable income per individual in the household. If it is being suggested by the Opposition that such people should not get the kind of relief to which Deputy O'Dea referred, I do not agree with them.</P>

      <P>In fact, the system can be very negative and the Deputy should know this if he has dealt with this problem. However, the general thinking on this issue &mdash; I agree with it &mdash; is that, wherever possible, erring husbands should be made in some way financially responsible for their wives and families. It is of little benefit, however, to a wife or family if the Department of Social <Col N="476" /> Welfare or any Department collects money from such husbands.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister accept it is inequitable for the State to subsidise the ferry service to some islands while not to others?  For many years State subsidy has been given in the case of Irish speaking islands off the Galway coast such as the Aran Islands, but the same does not apply to Inishbofin or to Clare Island or Inishturk off the coast of Mayo.  Will the Minister indicate the Government's policy in this regard?  I will be the first to applaud him if he introduces an equitable scheme that makes no distinction between Irish and English speaking islands.  He should ensure that people living on islands off our shores are treated equally.  People in the Gaeltacht islands who have been getting better services, would also welcome that.  A separate Department dealt with their affairs down the years and the public representatives in the area fought for their rights.  Is the Minister aware that the Taoiseach's Department has been an obstacle in this matter? I appeal to the Minister to give an indication that the position will change.</P>

I acknowledge, as was pointed out by Deputy Molloy, that the only power in this area at present relates to the 1946 Act which empowers the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to subsidise service to the Aran Islands.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry) Michael Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2, 16, 18 and 77 together.</P>
      <P>I answered parliamentary questions on the matter of TEAM Aer Lingus on 21 February 1995 and it was also the subject of Adjournment debates on 28 February and 23 March last.  The background to the problems at TEAM Aer Lingus and the reasons for my decision to address those problems directly have, accordingly, been fully explained in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that following receipt of a report prepared at my request by the executive chairman of Aer Lingus, I have requested the executive chairman to submit a five year business plan which will provide a basis for developing an assured commercially viable TEAM Aer Lingus.</P>
      <P>I have acknowledged that significant progress has been made in introducing improved work practices and flexibility in TEAM Aer Lingus, but further substantial progress is required in order to establish competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am awaiting the submission of the <Col N="480" /> five year business plan which is being prepared by Aer Lingus at present. When received, it will be examined thoroughly and carefully, in consultation with the company if necessary.  As I have indicated in the past, I will not rush this examination, nor will I allow myself to be rushed.  It would be irresponsible to act in such a matter.</P>
    <P>For reasons of commercial confidentiality, as is common practice with reports of this nature, I will not be publishing details of any reports to me on TEAM Aer Lingus.  Clearly, it would not be in the interests of the company to do so.</P>
    <P>As I have already explained, it is the responsibility of the board and management of TEAM Aer Lingus to brief the company's employees and, in particular, to take the necessary steps to inform staff of the nature of the difficulties which face the company.  I will not interfere in management's responsibility in that regard.</P>
    <P>The resolution of the difficulties at TEAM Aer Lingus is a matter for the board and management of the company. The future of TEAM Aer Lingus cannot be assured by actions of the shareholder.</P>
    <P>As regards the overall position of the group, the Government approved a restructuring programme in July 1993 which was designed to restore Aer Lingus to self-sustaining financial viability.  As part of the restructuring programme, the Government decided to invest £175 million in the company over the three years 1993-95.  A total of £75 million of that equity was paid in December 1993, £50 million was paid in December 1994 and the remaining £50 million is due for payment in 1995.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in replies to previous parliamentary questions, substantial progress has been made at the airline under the restructuring programme and the airline core business has benefited from the general uplift in world aviation. Regardless of the world aviation backdrop the airline is continuing to make the sort of progress envisaged in the restructuring programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="481" /> Payment of the final tranche of equity is subject to the provision by the Irish Government of a report to the European Commission confirming that satisfactory progress has been made by Aer Lingus in achieving the targets set out in the restructuring programme.  My immediate expectation of the Aer Lingus board and management, therefore, is the satisfactory implementation of the restructuring programme.  That programme provides focusing on the core airline activity and, <i>inter alia</i>, the disposal of non-core assets. The implementation of the asset disposal programme is the responsibility of the board and management of Aer Lingus and I do not have a function in the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply although I am staggered to hear him say the Government does not have a role in the disposal of State assets.  Even if they are subsidiary companies they are still State assets.</P>
      <P>The Minister refused to publish the chairman's report on TEAM Aer Lingus &mdash; I understand that from the point of view of commercial confidentiality and I do not wish to be awkward in that regard &mdash; but is it realistic to ask for a five year plan, the way aviation is today?  Is it a way of postponing the issue?  Would the Minister not have been better to ask for a 12 month plan in the first instance and publish it so that we could discuss it in this House?</P>
      <P>Stories circulating suggest that TEAM Aer Lingus does not have enough work to keep going for the next few months &mdash; I would not want to make life there any more difficult than it is but if that is true, it would be as well that we know about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Deputy understands why I cannot make the report public and there is obviously commercially sensitive information included in that report.  As indicated in my reply, TEAM Aer Lingus is being restructured and has received a £25 <Col N="482" /> million injection from its parent company, Aer Lingus.  The necessary changes in work practice have proved very difficult to achieve and have involved a lengthy and costly industrial relations process.  The trading position of the company remains difficult in an extremely competitive international environment.  With the difficulties in TEAM Aer Lingus, it is not possible to turn the company around and make it commercially viable in a short time.  The European Commission is obviously looking at the restructuring and it has its concerns.  I have my concerns as Minister and I want to ensure that the £50 million tranche, which is of crucial importance to the Aer Lingus group, is available and that the Government will have approval from the Commission to invest it.  It is absolutely essential for the core airline business that that is done.</P>
      <P>I requested management to increase its efforts, get out into the market place and generate sufficient work to ensure that the situation which arose last year &mdash; when there was a substantial number of layoffs during the summer months, industrial unrest and people blocking public roads &mdash; would not happen again.</P>
      <P>In response to the Deputy's question on layoffs in TEAM Aer Lingus, I have been urging Aer Lingus, pending completion of the preparation of the five year business plan to seek to ensure there is adequate work available for those employed in TEAM Aer Lingus. I understand from Aer Lingus that work covering the bulk of budgeted hours up to the end of August has been already secured.  Accordingly, the company has informed me and my Department that there is unlikely to be any requirement for layoffs at TEAM Aer Lingus this summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress, however, that the future security of employment in TEAM Aer Lingus can only be assured with the implementation of a business plan which demonstrates the establishment of commercial viability.  That has to be done in the long term and that is why I have sought a five year business plan which will indicate progress in terms of <Col N="483" /> the viability of the company.  As a result of this business plan I hope to convince the European Union to allow this Government to invest the £50 million equity needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister is confident that there is enough work there up to the end of August and he does not envisage temporary layoffs this year.  The workers in TEAM Aer Lingus will be glad to hear it also.  Newspaper reports in recent weeks suggest that TEAM Aer Lingus have sought £100 million from the Government specifically for itself.  If that is not true, will the Minister put that rumour to bed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received no specific request from Aer Lingus in respect of equity nor did I expect it against the background of the discussions I had with the chairman and chief executive of the company.  At an early stage I indicated to the company that a resolution of its problems must come from its own resources and should not revolve around further State equity.  I made it quite clear to the company that no further State equity would be available. One of the difficulties that TEAM Aer Lingus has faced is that the international market for maintenance has declined at an alarming extent.  The Cahill plan was structured originally on the basis that it could command $50 an hour but international competition has forced those rates down to an average of $30 per hour.  There is considerable work at TEAM Aer Lingus but there is not profitable work available to TEAM Aer Lingus.  This has to be taken into account in the context of the five year plan, which I am awaiting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister quite rightly pointed out that the Government agreed a £175 million injection in Aer Lingus of which £125 million has been invested.  Can he assure the group that the remaining £50 million will be delivered, or is he telling the group that <Col N="484" /> it is outside his hands and it is a matter for the European Union?  Is the Government committed to securing that additional £50 million and when might it be paid over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is committed to providing that £50 million tranche of funds but the reality is that to enable the Government to make that decision it must first seek the approval of the European Commission.  We had some difficulty in convincing the European Commission that the last tranche should be paid.  I fear &mdash; and this is why I moved earlier &mdash; that the European Commission will take a negative view of the declining fortunes of TEAM because TEAM does not conform with the proposals within the restructuring programme which was submitted previously to the European Commission.</P>
      <P>It was necessary to review the restructuring plan which was submitted to the EU Commission in light of TEAM's preformance at present.  The basic criterion on which the restructuring at TEAM was based has changed dramatically because of competition and the drop in the hourly rate they can command for work undertaken.  My concern is for TEAM to produce a singular business plan which will indicate to me and the Commission that the problems are under control and that it has a viable future.  That is the responsibility of the executive and management of TEAM Aer Lingus.  As soon as I receive the plan, it will receive immediate and careful attention.</P>

      <Quest>the estimated employment implications of the proposals in the report from Telecom Éireann on the partners available to it.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6599/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision of competitive telecommunications services is now <Col N="485" /> generally recognised to be critical to economic development and employment growth in all economies.  Finding and building a relationship with a strategic partner may be crucial for Telecom Éireann to meet that objective in Ireland.  The development of a strategic partnership will, therefore, have a critical impact on employment both in the general economy and in the telecommunications sector.</P>
      <P>I have received a report from Telecom Éireann dealing with future business strategy and the question of strategic partnership.  This is now being considered and I hope to be in a position to convey a decision to the company as to the next phase of strategic partner discussions when this consideration is complete.  The report is not specific in relation to future employment levels in Telecom Éireann.  Clearly any analysis of the strategic partnership question is a multifaceted one involving careful assessment of a number of key criteria.  These include: existing investment, underpinned to a large extent by Irish taxpayers, in the telecommunications sector; employment implications of any strategic partnership both for the economy as a whole as well as Telecom Éireann; the future provision of telecommunications infrastructure and services in Ireland which are necessary to support industrial development and underpin the competitive position of Irish goods and services in the international marketplace.</P>
      <P>As the Telecom Éireann report contains confidential and commercially sensitive information relating to both the company and other interested parties it is not possible to publish it.  This is accepted procedure and any other approach would represent unrealistic practice.  Unfortunately, I am not in a position to divulge the contents of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any future discussion with potential partners, it is clear that maximisation of sustainable employment inside and outside the core business must and will be an important agenda item.  It is generally accepted by all observers that <Col N="486" /> the employment issue is just one of a variety of considerations which must come into play in these discussions. Telecommunications in Ireland must not only be competitive in terms of cost, it must meet changing customer needs in what is generally recognised to be a volatile and uncertain market place.</P>
    <P>Naturally, while there are employment implications in any strategy for a successful competitive Telecom Éireann in a liberalised market, there are serious consequences for employment in the general economy in not having a fully competitive, national telecommunications company.  These will arise in those areas which are most dependent on the highly skilled employment required by industry and services which the Irish labour force is uniquely equipped to exploit.</P>
    <P>Obviously there are several considerations and all are addressed in a general way in the report I received which is being studied in the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I could understand the Minister not publishing the report in the case of TEAM Aer Lingus but I do not accept it in this case.  I ask him to reconsider publishing this report given that we are talking about a strategic alliance for Telecom Éireann and the future of a major State company.  It is about having foreign or other domestic partnerships with Telecom Éireann. How are we and the public to know that some of the options do not include a straight disposal of part of the company? How are we to assess newspaper reports that up to 400 or 500 jobs are at risk in Telecom Éireann if this Government of transparency decides to deal privately behind closed doors with the future ownership and partnership of a major State company?  If the report cannot be published in full, the Minister should publish a sufficient part of it to ensure that the House can debate what is a fundamental strategic issue for the country.</P>

I accept that this is a major decision requiring careful consideration and it will be taken following an exhaustive consultative process.  I received a report from the Communications Workers' Union and one from Telecom Éireann.  I was impressed by the immense amount of common ground that exists between the union and Telecom Éireann.  The reports will be studied in my Department and I will bring forward sugestions to Government on how to proceed.  Our position will be made public and it will then be the subject of public debate.  There is keen interest by international consortia in the global telecommunications market or being strategically involved with Telecom Éireann.  Unlike the previous Government who had side deals with companies I have no preconceived ideas on who should be the strategic partner.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications</askee>
      <Quest>the present position regarding the proposed peat-fired power station in the midlands; the estimated cost per unit of electricity to be produced there; the estimated cost of electricity being produced in each of the existing peat fired power stations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[6509/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am fully committed to the continued use of peat for electricity generation on the basis that it can be increasingly provided on a competitive basis.  The proposal for a new 120 MW peat fired station to be located in the east midlands is a vital new element in this drive to competitiveness and essential for the future financial strength of Bord na Móna.  I indicated at the outset of my taking responsibility for energy that securing EU support for this important project was one of my immediate top priorities.</P>
      <P>On Monday this week I met Commissioner Wulf Mathies to impress upon her that the new regional development dimension to this proposal was vital for the east midlands area.  The jobs to be provided within Bord na Movna and in the ESB even outweigh the essential national energy security aspect to the proposal.  In my meeting with the Commissioner I believe that she recognised the essential job dimension I presented to her and that she shares my broad views on both this aspect and on the enhanced environmental standards of new state of the art technology which will be introduced by this project.</P>
      <P>The Commissioner, naturally, had her own outstanding concerns but we both agreed that these would be addressed on Wednesday by way of undertakings from me given through my senior officials who will visit Brussels today. With agreement on these concerns, a final positive decision may well be forthcoming within the next few weeks.</P>
      <P>Given the difficulties encountered with the previous Commissioner and the clearly negative attitude underpinning these difficulties I am pleased at such a constructive outcome to my initiative.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>EU support for this project will not <Col N="489" /> only bring a vital grant aid support of £21 million but will also be an important vote of confidence in the east midlands region.</P>
    <P>With that level of European support a feasibility study carried out on behalf of Bord na Móna estimated that electricity could be sold to the grid from the new station at an all-in cost of around 3.7p per unit at 1993 prices.  Without any grant assistance, the consultants estimated that the cost per unit of electricity would be in the region of 4.1p.  At the planned price of 3.7p per unit the next generation of peat electricity stations would provide electricity at prices comparable to heavy fuel oil and gas and very significantly less than the costs per unit from existing peat generating stations.</P>
    <P>I have been advised by the ESB that in 1994 the average cost of electricity from the existing peat fired power stations was as follows: Ferbane, 8.0p; Shannonbridge, 4.8p; Rhode, 6.3p; Lanesboro, 4.3p; Bellacorrick, 6.4p; and Gweedore, 16.0p.  These costs per unit are affected by items such as load factor and load profile and cannot, therefore, be used directly for comparing station performances.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the comprehensive information he has finally given the House and I wish him success in the discussions taking place with the EU Commissioner on this issue.  Is it true that the experts advising the Commissioner recommended some time ago that this proposed peat powered station should not be grant aided?  Is that the reason ministerial meetings with the Commissioner were held and because that did not resolve the matter further meetings are taking place?  The initiative for this proposed peat powered station was taken when I was Minister and I have an interest in ensuring that it comes to fruition at a viable economic unit price in terms of the electricity output.  The figures quoted by the Minister are encouraging if they can be achieved in practice. <Col N="490" /> Will he indicate the level of opposition that exists among advisers to the Commissioner and the reasons for it?</P>

      <P>It is not a change of policy. I am confirming the Government's position in respect of it.  It is totally committed to the provision of this plant.  The European Commission had a negative attitude towards this plant on the fundamental grounds that it considers the generation of electricity to be a lucrative area.  Each member state should be in a position to fund its supply of electricity, an essential commodity.  I have moved the discussion from that area and emphasised to the Commissioner the regional dimension and the strategic importance of this proposed plant to the east midlands and the impact it will have on jobs and on the local economies. I emphasised to the Commissioner that this area is totally dependent on the activities of Bord na Móna and the ESB which are interconnected and that the proposed peat fired station would underpin the Government's commitment to it.  I am satisfied that, as a result of the discussions which will take place <Col N="491" /> today and the commitments and clarifications I gave the Commissioner yesterday in respect of the Government's position, grant aid will be forthcoming. I am satisfied also that the project will be approved by the Government and that the ESB, Bord na Móna and any interested consortia can compete for the construction, operation and maintenance of it.</P>

      <P>The proposal by Aer Rianta for the building of an hotel at Dublin Airport is being examined in my Department.</P>
      <P>Aer Rianta's core business is the management and development of Dublin, Shannon and Cork airports.  The company is proposing an investment programme of over £200 million on upgrading the three airports to cater for traffic growth to the year 2000.  The scale of this investment has major implications for Aer Rianta's finances.</P>
      <P>My Department is at present reviewing Aer Rianta's forward airport development programme and Aer Rianta's ability to fund it.  This review includes assessment of forecast cash flows and profit projections to the year 2000 of the Aer Rianta Group, including the hotels subsidiary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I am referring to an hotel company as against Aer Rianta?  Is he aware that 12 months ago a submission was made to his Department indicating that a second hotel was needed because the demand was outstripping the supply of bed nights available adjacent to the airport?  Will the Minister not agree that on economic grounds and the job creation potential that would result from the provision of a second hotel adjacent to Dublin airport, this project should receive immediate approval?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the project is an important one.  It is precisely for that reason that it needs careful consideration. I do not accept the Deputy's point <Col N="493" /> that there has been undue delay in considering it.  Since that report was furnished to the Department the market has changed dramatically.  For example, I have read public comments of various investors' intentions to invest in new hotels in Dublin.  Bearing in mind all these planned projections, one must question whether there is a market for all of the new hotel ventures planned for this city.  It is against that background that the matter must be considered. Aer Rianta already has a broad span of activities, managing and developing three large airports, their core business, on which I should like them to concentrate and for which the company was originally established. Any proposals in regard to its subsidiary activities cannot be considered in isolation from their possible implications for those core functions.  That would be foolhardy, particularly at a time when the company has in hand a massive investment programme for development of the airport.  I have no doubt Deputy Batt O'Keeffe would not like to see me encourage Aer Rianta to divert investment from Cork Airport to the building of a hotel in Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>While agreeing with the Minister that many things have changed dramatically, will he confirm that the throughput of passengers at Dublin Airport increased by some one million over the past 12 months?  Would he also agree that already this year there has been an increase of 20 per cent in throughput of passengers, which means that an additional one million passengers will pass through Dublin Airport?  Would he agree that the Great Southern Hotel group might perceive this to be a vote of no confidence in <Col N="494" /> them even though that group, with seven hotels under its aegis, produced a profit of £1.5 million last year?  With a second hotel adjacent to an airport that is obviously flourishing, would the Minister agree that it would make good economic sense for him to allow Aer Rianta to proceed with this development?</P>

      <P>This proposal cannot be viewed in isolation.  Anybody who has studied Aer Rianta accounts and the activities of the Great Southern Hotel group will accept there has been very poor return on the capital funds tied up by Aer Rianta in that project.  While there may be strategic reasons for the provision of a second hotel, it would be irresponsible of me to make such a decision without first having studied very carefully its impact on the overall operational dimension of Aer Rianta activities.  Its first priority must be the conduct of the business for which it was established &mdash; to improve airports, generate greater activity by way of cheaper costs and greater access to this country.</P>

I have sought professional advice and have recruited a firm of consultants to assist my Department in examining Aer Rianta's cashflow forecasts, profitability projections and plans for the future, thereby enabling planning in advance of the duty free regulation changes about to take place.  It is possible that the hotel the Deputy mentions may from part of its plans.  I will be examining the overall position very carefully but as of now I have not learned sufficient positive news about this project to be entirely enthusiastic about it.  I have neither ruled it in nor out.  It will be the subject of close examination and when I receive the consultants' report and an overview of the activities of Aer Rianta, I will make a decision in respect of that and the company's other activities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>The alternative energy requirement scheme was designed to achieve a target of 75 megawatts of electricity generating capacity from alternative energy sources by 1997. In order to do so, an enhanced price structure for purchases of electricity by the ESB was devised.  In addition it was arranged that up to £15 million would be made available by the ESB in the form of grants for which proposers could bid in order to give them a return on investment.  As it turned out, the target of 75 megawatts was exceeded without the need for grants and the ESB was authorised to offer power purchase agreements only to projects which did not bid for a grant; this amounted to 111 megawatts.  This is an indication of the promising potential for economically competitive supplies of energy from alternative sources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> I have ordered a review of strategy in relation to the development of alternative energy sources in the light of the experience of the scheme which is now under way.  It is intended that this review will result in the setting of new targets for the various alternative energy technologies, including biomass, and the formulation of schemes for the achievement of such targets.</P>
    <P>Provision has been made in the Economic Infrastructure Operational Programme 1994-1999 for European Regional Development Fund support, amounting to £15 million over that period, for alternative energy development. This is separate from the ESB's £15 million.  It is proposed to make available the European Regional Development Fund support in the context of these new schemes.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased and indeed surprised at the high level of interest and the high level of applications for the scheme.  We have exceeded our target without the need to use either the ESB grants or the European Regional Development Fund funding.  I want to acknowledge the work of Deputy Noel Treacy on this project when Minister of State in this Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the Minister's acknowledgment of my work on the project.  Will the Minister agree that few Irish companies qualified under this programme and that for many years the bid of many pioneering enthusiasts involved in alternative energy in Ireland were not successful?  At the outset I felt we could exceed the target of 75 megawatts of electricity generating capacity from alternative energy sources and I congratulate all involved in exceeding the target.  Will the Minister agree that in order to meet our national and international commitments to alternative energy and to environmental management that those who bid unsuccessfully and who are now prepared to supply energy to the ESB should receive power purchase agreements immediately?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware <Col N="498" /> that the Government is bound by EU competition rules and that we have no alternative but to operate within those guidelines.  While the Deputy is right in saying that many of the companies who were successful were not necessarily Irish based, they were entitled to bid and have their applications and tenders examined on an equal basis with Irish based companies.  I recognise that many Irish companies who have done much pioneering work in this area were not successful in this round.  As I said I have ordered a review of strategy with a view to having a new round within a year and a special round for biomass.  I have asked my officials to bring it forward and within the next two months I hope to make an announcement on the biomass round.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister has to operate within EU competition rules pertaining to energy and environmental policies.  Will the Minister agree that Irish energy pioneers have spent up to £100,000 on projects, and that at least one was sanctioned previously for a THERMIE grant by the EU?  That project is now available at the bid price.  Is it unfair that the people who are making a major contribution to fulfilling our national alternative energy and environmental requirements should not be allowed to supply energy to the ESB and thus expand the base which has begun?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the target of 75 megawatts of electricity generating capacity was agreed by him when he was in office.  I have exceeded that target within this round and have brought it up to 111 megawatts of production which is considerable increase on the target set by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the reality.  The bid price which is subsidised will cost the Irish consumer, over the 15-year period of the scheme, in excess of £70 million. <Col N="499" /> We could have easily used up the £15 million grants available and we would have 200 megawatts of alternative energy available to us, but the costs would be out of balance with what we are trying to do.  We are trying to achieve the lowest price possible for alternative energy so that the consumer is not burdened with it, while at the same time being conscious of the environmental targets we have to reach. I am confident we will exceed the targets from an environmental point of view and on the exclusion of CO 2 into the atmosphere.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>

Surely there is a duty on us and the Minister of State to acknowledge the contribution of the people who pioneered this effort for many years and have spent huge sums of money on projects. We should ensure we fulfil our energy and environmental commitments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot reopen the alternative energy requirement scheme at this stage.  We are reviewing the system arising from our experience with a view to allowing another round of applications. It will not be possible within that scheme either to give a local Irish weighting because EU competition rules do not allow it.  Regardless of whether Irish companies have expended moneys on research and development in advance, that will not allow me and it would not have allowed the Deputy when he was Minister, to give preference to Irish companies.</P>

We went to England to examine the generating systems there and on our return tried to get clearance for the manufacturing tax, tried to secure sites but at the end of the day we got a list indicating that more was thought of companies like Wimpey and Guinness's than of the people of Monaghan who are enterprising.

I accept the very positive part of that proposal which would deal with the widespread pollution that now exists in the Deputy's constituency, in the neighbouring constituency and, possibly, across the Border.

We are not expecting preferential treatment for Irish bidders, we only want fair opportunities for them. The competition is over.  The Minister has exceeded the target.  Those who pioneered it, who spent money on it are prepared to supply the energy at the same price as those who were successful. The Minister should allow them do so.

      <Quest>the actions, if any, he has taken to meet the priority targets of the Shannon Task Force of finding new sources of inbound tourism business and attracting a new scheduled service from the United States of America market.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>The action taken to meet the priority targets of the Shannon Task Force is that a new marketing body for the airport, Shannon Airport Marketing, was established with effect from 1 October 1994.  This was the central recommendation made by the task force, and it was taken on board by my predecessor.</P>
      <P>While finding new sources of inbound tourism business is not a primary function of Shannon Airport Marketing &mdash; its task is to stimulate traffic growth at Shannon &mdash; the activities of the new body will result in new business opportunities for Shannon, including new sources of inbound tourism.  As recommended by the Shannon Task Force, the two main elements of Shannon Airport Marketing are: first, the marketing of Shannon Airport has been separated from the promotion of tourism in the region; and second, the foundation for the new marketing body is the former marketing joint venture between Aer Rianta and Shannon Development. Shannon Airport Marketing has brought together in a single entity and put into a sharper and more coherent focus the former roles and expertise of Aer Rianta and Shannon Development in marketing the airport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="504" /> The provision of transatlantic air services between Ireland and the US is governed by the Ireland/US Air Transport Agreement.  In accordance with the terms of that agreement, designated airlines of both countries are free to operate air services on specified routes between the two countries.  There are no limitations on the capacity which may be offered by airlines on such services.</P>
    <P>In relation to scheduled air services, Irish airlines currently enjoy access rights to four US points &mdash; New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles&mdash; while US airlines may serve Ireland from any US point.  The question of whether an airline wishes to exercise its right to operate on any specific route is, however, a matter for decision by such airline on the basis of its commercial judgment.  Shannon Airport Marketing's mandate is to grow the traffic at Shannon through vigorous promotion of the airport in overseas markets, including the US.  The overseas staff of the unit includes a full-time member located in New York.</P>
    <P>As I informed the Deputy in reply to his question of 15 March 1995, Aer Rianta estimates that the capacity for 1995 on transatlantic routes will be in excess of one million seats.  Bord Fáilte figures indicate that the total number of passengers carried on these routes in 1994 was 804,000.  There is no capacity problem on this route.  At the same time, I should stress that attracting a new scheduled operator from a North American gateway is a priority preoccupation of Shannon Airport Marketing. The marketing body is in regular contact with the major North American airlines to achieve this objective.</P>

      <P>Terminal traffic at Shannon Airport increased by 4 per cent in 1994.  This is the traffic which provides <Col N="505" /> the spin-off for hotels in the mid-west region and which underpins tourism, employment and development in the entire region.  The volume of American traffic increased by 8 per cent while European traffic increased by 16 per cent over the same period.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>As expected, transit traffic at Shannon, that is traffic passing through the airport, decreased in 1994 due primarily to the new direct Aeroflot flights between Moscow and New York. I have a particular interest in Shannon Airport and I recently announced an investment package for it.  I fully recognise the dependence of the west and mid-west regions on a strong and viable airport in Shannon.  The investment programme was warmly welcomed by people in the area.  I am also very interested in ensuring that the hubbing arrangement between Aeroflot and Shannon is enhanced and encouraged and whatever funds are needed to facilitate its successful implementation will be provided by Aer Rianta.</P>

      <P>Given the controversy surrounding the policy change and the views of the Minister's party on it when in Opposition &mdash;they are not very close to the ones being espoused by him today &mdash; one would have thought that a substantial assessment of the change would be carried out to ascertain whether it has been successful for the country.  The question refers to new carriers. The only United States carrier operating scheduled flights to Ireland is Delta Airlines.  This has been the position for up to seven years.  The Minister <Col N="506" /> said that these airlines may fly into Ireland and I would like to know if he has had any meetings with the chief executives of major United States airlines with a view to getting additional business.

From the information available to me, substantial progress has been made and I acknowledge that.</P>
      <P>On the point made by Deputy Molloy, Shannon has experienced growth but not to the same extent as that achieved nationally.  There are many positive aspects to the developments at Shannon on which we can build for the future and I intend to support and encourage these and to make available whatever facilities are necessary to ensure that Shannon reaches its full potential.</P>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's point about the need for meetings with other airlines. An initiative is needed in this regard and I have instructed my officials to prepare one on my behalf and if ministerial intervention is needed at the appropriate time I will be available.</P>

      <P>Regarding the importance of generating tourist traffic in the south and west, as the Minister signalled relatively low increases in traffic from Europe and, in particular from North America, is he satisfied that the marketing focus is as exact as it should be?  Is he satisfied that there is not duplication in that focus? Is he also satisfied that, particularly in regard to the European market, Shannon, Cork and other regional airports are not vying with each other seeking the same market? Does the Department have plans to regulate and co-ordinate marketing activities for those airports, particularly in the context of Europe?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>Systems are in place to market Ireland and our airports and to ensure we achieve the greatest growth possible in tourism.  I am satisfied that there is excellent co-ordination between the various authorities in that regard.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that when we put questions to the Minister for Tourism and Trade about developing new markets and access from the North American continent to Ireland he refers us to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications? We now have an opportunity to put those questions to him.  Is he aware that there is great dissatisfaction at the lack air of transport facilities to Ireland from the southern states of North America where there is a large Irish population?  To holiday in Ireland those people must take a roundabout journey through London or other airports at additional cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tourism industry is frustrated at the lack of response from the Government to open up the market in that part of North America.  We visit those Irish groups on St. Patrick's Day every year and then forget about them.  They must <Col N="508" /> go to great expense and take long tedious journeys to come here on holidays. Surely we can treat them better than that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelLowry" hpid="Mr. Lowry Mr. Lowry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lowry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the validity of Deputy Molloy's arguments.  The matter is being treated as a priority in my Department.  It is very off-putting for people in those parts of the United States to have to take such a circuitous route to holiday in Ireland, we are losing a considerable amount of tourist traffic as a result.  While we are subject to international rules and regulations, there is room for improvement in this area.  I asked my management team, the executive of Aer Lingus and other airlines to explore the opportunities that exist in this area and to put in place a satisfactory scheme to secure more tourist traffic from those areas.</P>

It is my understanding that Irish airports are undercutting each other, particularly in the European market, to gain access to business.

I am also conscious of the opportunities that can be exploited and I use the mechanisms available to me to correct the inefficiencies in the system.  In general, the system is working well.  There has been enormous growth in tourist traffic through our airports.  My primary concern is to ensure that Aer Rianta, who play a major role in this area, continues to examine its costs structures and make it easier and cheaper for airlines to use our airports, making access to Ireland cheaper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>In addressing this question, I take it that the Deputy means any type of authorisation or licence which applies to petroleum exploration activities in the Irish off-shore.</P>
      <P>There are six petroleum authorisations under which companies can hold interests offshore Ireland.  They are a petroleum prospecting licence, a licensing option, an exploration licence, a reserved area licence, a lease undertaking, and a petroleum lease.</P>
      <P>General requirements applicable to all authorisations are contained in the publication, <i>Licensing Terms for Off-shore Oil and Gas Exploration and Development</i>.  All authorisations issued to companies are under these terms and conditions.  The nature, extent and appropriateness of the work programme required is determined and agreed having regard to the type of authorisation being granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Full reports of all activities undertaken are submitted to my Department on a regular basis.  From these and from the level of monitoring being undertaken by my Department, I am satisfied that obligations are being fully met by <Col N="510" /> the authorisation holders and that commitments are carried out within the agreed timeframes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the largest number of companies ever has joined the Irish off-shore operators' group in the past year? Will he indicate the number involved and the number of licences held by them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Eleven prospecting licences are held at present.  A petroleum prospecting licence is a nonexclusive licence which gives the holder the right to explore for petroleum in any area not covered by exclusive authorisations such as an exploration licence and petroleum lease.  A total of 22 exploration licences are currently held. Such a licence gives the holder the exclusive right to explore for petroleum in a specified area for a number of years.  The holder is obliged to carry out a work programme which must include the drilling of at least one exploration well.  Nine licensing options are held at present.  A licensing option gives the holder the right, subject to certain conditions, to obtain a petroleum exploration licence over a specified area during or at the end of the period of the option.  During the option period the holder is obliged to carry out a geological-geophysical exploration work programme in the specified area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The conversion of an option into an exploration licence is subject to agreement on an appropriate exploration work programme for all or part of the licensed area, including drilling one or more exploration wells.  Two companies currently hold lease undertakings.  Such an undertaking is granted when a discovery is made in a licensed area and the licensee is not yet in a position to declare the discovery commercial, but expects to be able to do so.  This is an undertaking by the Minister, subject to certain conditions, to grant a petroleum lease at a stated future date.  Twelve petroleum leases are held at present.  If a <Col N="511" /> petroleum lease is granted and a commercial discovery is established in a licensed area, the licensee applies for the petroleum lease with a view to development of the field.  This gives the holder the exclusive rights to produce and dispose of petroleum in the area for a specified period which would normally be expected to cover the field's life.  The development is subject to the Minister's approval.  A plan of development is submitted to the Minister setting out the details of the development proposals.</P>

Companies making such a find would require the type of facilities that will then be available at Whiddy which I expect to be ready for use in about 12 months.</P>

      <P>The £18 million will be raised from within the resources of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation itself.  It has various ways of doing that. It can do so by way of the commercial activity that will arise, by putting a levy on petroleum companies &mdash; because it will be reducing an existing levy one would balance out the other &mdash; and, because of the development in Bantry there will no longer be a 90 days' storage requirement on the oil companies in their own storage facilities, which was a charge on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>The facility is badly needed, and it is highly desirable, from a strategic point of view, to store our own reserves.  It has the capacity to store 1 million tonnes of oil.  That facility will be available for commercial storage of oil where the INPC would very quickly recover the £18 million to be expended. I am very conscious that the facility there, effectively in moth balls because it cannot be used, has a value of £100 million.  It would be commercial madness and socially irresponsible to leave a £100 million investment lying idle for the sake of £18 million.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 9 in the name of Deputy Joe Walsh arises out of Committee proceedings. Amendment No. 10 is related so it is proposed that amendments Nos. 9 and 10 be taken together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 9:</P>
      <P>In page 12, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(6)  That the fine of £1,000 for a summary offence in the payment of unemployment assistance be increased to £1,500.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment will deter people from acting in a fraudulent way under the Social Welfare Acts.  I can give examples of employers who do not pay their employees' contributions.  In many cases, employees are too timid to raise this issue or they do not want to offend their employers for fear of losing their jobs.  They subsequently experience difficulty when claiming social welfare benefits.  There is also a problem with some companies who act illegally and when they go into liquidation there is no money in the fund to pay their employees' contributions.  This area must be tightened up and an increase in the fines would be a further deterrent. Any moneys saved by the implementation of this measure could be used to benefit more deserving cases under the acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Minister might, in courtesy to the Members of the House, give his views and the views of the Department on the amendment. That is normal etiquette and procedure in this House.  This is a fairly minor matter. Deputy Walsh is saying that the fine of £1,000 should be increased to £1,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When these fines were originally suggested it was proposed in the House that the fines on summary conviction should be say, £2,000.  The arguments made against it at that time was that under the Constitution, the Attorney General felt we could not go beyond a fine of £1,000 for summary fines.  That is why I thought that, for the sake of civility, the Minister would have communicated with the Opposition spokesperson on the present position.  Since then fines <Col N="573" /> of £1,500 have been introduced elsewhere by some of the Minister's colleagues in Government.  There is obviously some difference in the view on that and the Minister should take the opportunity now to review the position. That is what Deputy Walsh is trying to do with this straightforward amendment which was not discussed on Committee Stage because there was not sufficient time.</P>
    <P>Tackling fraud, abuse and unwarranted claiming is an important element of the social welfare system and dealing with those issues on a summary basis can be valuable in the normal operation of the system.  On fraud and abuse of the system, the Minister might discover there is a sufficient level of fraud to provide the £3 million for the increases in supplementary welfare benefit and short term unemployment assistance required this year and which was recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  While everyone in this House supports increases and improvements in social welfare, we are mindful that fraud and unwarranted claiming takes place. That must be dealt with and, accordingly, I support the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 9 and 10. The Social Welfare Acts provide for a wide variety of offences and prosecutions are considered in the case of: employers who fail to carry out their statutory obligations and people who fraudulently receive social welfare payments. Conviction for an offence may have severe consequences for the individual concerned and for this reason discretion is exercised in determining which cases warrant prosecution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision to prosecute is taken on the basis of: the circumstances of the case; the nature of the alleged offence; the available evidence; and the circumstances of the person concerned.  The criteria applied in determining whether a prosecution should be taken include: the duration of the offence; whether the individual or employer is a persistent offender; the amount of money <Col N="574" /> involved; the incidence of fraud in a particular firm, industry, or area; and the existence of collusion between employers and employees to defraud.</P>
    <P>Prosecution involves gathering a large body of documentary evidence for each case.  Only the more serious cases are pursued with a view to prosecution.  The maximum penalties at present for cases heard summarily is a fine not exceeding £1,000, a term of imprisonment not exceeding one year or both such fine and imprisonment.  The maximum penalty for cases heard on indictment is a fine not exceeding £10,000, a term of imprisonment not exceeding three years or both such fine and imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Social welfare cases are generally prosecuted summarily as the penalties which may be imposed by the District Court are seen as an adequately reflecting the seriousness of the offence. Ultimately, the penalty to be imposed in any case is a matter for the courts to determine.  Generally speaking, the courts tend to impose fines below £200 and the maximum fine of £1,000 has been imposed only on vary rare occasions.  In these circumstances, I see no point in increasing the maximum fines and in any event, I am satisfied that the existing penalties provided for in the Social Welfare Acts represent an adequate deterrent.  Consequently, I oppose the amendments proposed by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil I welcome the improvements made by this Bill.  Some of the amendments we put down on Committee and Report Stages were intended not to immediately bring increases but to highlight the gaps in the system, and it is regrettable that no amendment was accepted by the Minister.  I hope that people who are most deserving will benefit most from the Bill.</P>

      <P>The Bill will now move to the Seanad.  There have been differences of opinion on various sections. We welcome the increases in child benefit and the further improvements for carers and employers in terms of PRSI. It is significant that the social insurance fund provides for these developments in the current climate.  The main objective of the social insurance fund is to provide for the members who contribute to that fund.  It is a pity the Minister was not prepared to accept any of the amendments put forward by this side of the House.  Such behaviour is unusual and is probably a record on a Bill such as this. The Minister opposed Deputy Walsh's proposal for a review and that is unfortunate because he will obviously carry out a review.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed the Minister took no action in regard to share fishermen. They will have to await wider analysis and I hope that will be made sooner rather than later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The adoptive benefit scheme was introduced on Committee Stage without discussion.  This measure is very welcome and is supported by everybody.  It mirrors the adoptive leave scheme introduced by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  It is a weakness in the Bill that the adoptive benefit scheme does not provide for equal treatment for men and women.  I understand the cost of providing equal treatment under this scheme would have been in the order of £200,000 per annum, therefore it is not <Col N="576" /> a matter of money but of not being prepared to take that step at this stage.  The Bill is open to legal challenge since it does not provide for equal treatment, but I hope it is not challenged.</P>
    <P>Fathers play a more active part in child rearing nowadays, particularly in the case of adoption.  The Adoption Board and those interested in adoption generally have called for equal treatment for men and women in terms of adoption.  This is not a maternity or a medical matter and there should be equal treatment for men and women.  I am disappointed the Bill makes no provision in this regard.  It does, of course, cover situations where the father is the sole adopter and some other rare circumstances. Surely this is one of the places where the Minister should have taken the opportunity to provide for equal treatment.  I know his colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, resisted this also on the Adoptive Leave Bill.  That is unfortunate.  We did not have the opportunity to discuss this scheme during the passage of the Bill as it was introduced as a single amendment on Committee Stage and could not be reached.  Deputy Walsh's attempt to have it discussed on Report Stage was ruled out of order even though he proposed that it should be done without additional cost to the Exchequer, with the adoptive leave divided between the two parents.  That has not been done.</P>
    <P>There is a number of beneficial things in the Bill and I am happy to support it on that basis.  This Bill is relatively small compared with recent Social Welfare Bills.  There was not a great deal of time for examination, given that it is to be implemented on 6 April.  Some of the information we received in debate on the Bill was revealing and it showed that the money being allocated to all the insurance and assistance schemes was £20 million lower than allocated last year.  That has annoyed, upset and aggravated the Opposition, but the Minister does not seem to understand that.  It is a reasonable expression of the <Col N="577" /> feelings of people who will be confined to a 2.5 per cent increase this year.</P>
    <P>No steps have been taken on the report of the Commission on Social Welfare, which is regrettable.  In addition the Minister has gone so far as to vote down, with his partners in Government, an amendment which Deputy Walsh tabled on Report Stage to call for a review of the recommendations of the Commission on Social Welfare.  That is a very reasonable request but the Minister was not prepared to enter into a commitment, although he may well do it in practice. It was not so great a commitment to ask him to undertake because he should be doing so in any event.  The urgency relates to the fact that progress on the Commission's recommendations has been left aside for the present.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he would return to this point next year and see how things will have worked out.  That is a dramatic change from his approach in Opposition. This Bill is a reflection of his changed views on these matters.  People will find that quite extraordinary.  He says all of this is to be overcome by the increases in child benefit.  Welcome as they are, they do not apply to three-quarters of social welfare recipients.</P>
    <P>We are happy to support the other developments provided for in the Bill and to support it at this stage.</P>

      <P>I join with Deputies Walsh and Woods in wishing the Bill well.  It has been a long teased out affair in every sense of the word.  In one way or another 30 per cent of our population is in receipt of social welfare and they depend entirely on the Department for their income.  It is not an income as such but merely allows them a meagre existence. I would have faith in the Minister's statement that he would be prepared to see if he could do things better next year and I hope he will do so. Many on social welfare will never have a job and they have to be treated fairly and with the height of respect.</P>

      <P>I have done and intend to do so.  The child benefit was increased to an unprecedented extent. Changes in the carer's allowance will bring in people who were previously not entitled to it and there are changes in the income disregard of the spouses of those who are carers.  We have a 150 per cent increase in unemployment assistance for young people living at home, as well as an 11 per cent increase across the board for students who are participating in the summer jobs scheme and in addition a £200 increase for those students whose parents depend solely on social welfare.  We have extended free travel to Northern Ireland for those who are currently entitled to it.  We have provided for colour television licences for all those who currently qualify for black and white television licences.  We have applied the general increases <Col N="579" /> across the board six weeks earlier than has been the case in previous years and have made a commitment to bring it back further in coming budgets to the April deadline.</P>
      <P>In addition we have two new Bills on track, one which will provide for changes in the social welfare code to guarantee that no one on social welfare will lose out as a result of divorce and a Bill which seeks to remove the obligation to prove that their spouse deserted them in order to qualify for support for themselves and their children.</P>
      <P>This is a very good Bill.  The record of this Minister in the few short months he has been in the Department is such that he cannot be described as having been unable to do anything for those living in poverty.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned I was speaking about the position of small travel agents who employ two or three people.  While I welcome the extra protection for consumers we must look at the case of those travel agents who will have to met the increased costs of insurance.  The Minister stated yesterday that the cost of package holidays will increase for a short time as a result of the new arrangements under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1982 bonding system will no longer be adequate and new arrangements must be put in place to cover pacakge holidays in Ireland.  Major hotel groups offer home holiday and historical and cultural holiday packages.  There will be extra costs involved in organising such tours in Ireland in future.  Most Deputies spoke in terms of package <Col N="580" /> holidays overseas and I understand 350,000 people avail of such holidays to the sun every year with 150,000 making their own arrangements.  It was obvious during the World Cup last year that the bonding system was not adequate. Package tours were supposed to include accommodation and tickets for the games but, in the case of a well publicised Cork company, neither was supplied. Everyone passed the buck.  The travel agent blamed the tour operator and the tour operator blamed the airlines and hotel companies.  For the first time, the onus of responsibility will be placed on the tour operator and I welcome that.  Under the Bill the tour operator is responsible for everything advertised and for the contents of the brochure.</P>
    <P>Travel agents have pointed out that many of the 1995 brochures covered the period up to the end of September or early October.  The Minister should consider putting down an amendment to exempt travel agents from the provisions of the Bill for that period. People often complain that home holidays are expensive and it would be unfortunate if their cost was increased as a result of the provisions of the Bill. Many of those in the tourism industry might refrain from selling packaged holidays in Ireland.  The small tour operator will be hit as they try, in many instances, to provide specialised holidays.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not clarify what is meant by business travel.  If we are speaking about separate bookings for transport and accommodation it could be called a package holiday.  Some EU countries have facilities whereby their nationals can travel within the EU without a passport.  They are known as the Schengen group.  Ireland is not a member of that group and the Government is aware that such a facility is not available for Irish citizens.  It would be of great benefit if we could go on holiday in the EU without having a passport.</P>
    <P>We have often spoken about the necessity for Irish people to have visas when visiting the US.  Even though <Col N="581" /> President Clinton announced last autumn that the Irish would not need visas we have not received the go-ahead from the US for this facility although I understand it is to happen next month.  People in Northern Ireland and other European countries can travel to America without a visa.</P>
    <P>There are 320 travel agents in Ireland, a large number of whom are small operators. They may find it difficult to get insurance because of the extra facility they may have to provide.  The Bill is primarily about consumer protection and I support that.  We must look at the question of passports and visas and also the times of flights and sailings.  The timing of flights should be taken up with those in the tourism industry.  Holiday flights often leave either very early in the morning or very late at night and people are very tired when they arrive at their holiday destination.  Sufficient facilities should be provided to enable people to enjoy their holiday.</P>

      <P>The purpose of this Bill is the implementation of the European Union internal market in the tourism sector. Laying down common rules on package holidays will help eliminate the shortcomings and different practices which have been in operation in member states, thus bringing about a major improvement for Community consumers who will be able to benefit from comparable conditions when buying holiday packages in any member state.</P>
      <P>In giving effect to the EU directive this legislation is in effect, a charter of rights for all EU consumers travelling on package holidays.  We are all too well aware of the plight of Irish holiday makers who found themselves stranded abroad when their tour organiser suddenly went out of business or &mdash; as has also happened to many people on package holidays &mdash; the holiday destination and the services provided did not live up to the exotic promise of the brochure.</P>
      <P>The Council of Ministers which, at the time of Ireland's Presidency in 1990, was presided over by Deputy O'Malley, brought forward this very important consumer protection measure.  The directive was adopted on 13 June 1990 with a requirement that the implementing legislation be in place in each member state by 31 December 1992.  The Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications might inform the House of the reasons his Department has not met that deadline. It would be useful to know the implementation date in other member states for comparison purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From my reading of the Bill, it seems that the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications complied in most respects with the broad requirements of the directive.  It is a matter for national law to determine the measures necessary to comply with this directive and whether more stringent provisions should be adopted to give even greater protection to the consumer.  This Bill, <Col N="583" /> welcomed by the Progressive Democrats, brings a double benefit.  It will benefit the Irish holidaymaker because of the protection afforded while on holiday, but it will also be of immense benefit to the Irish tourism industry as foreign visitors coming here on package holidays promoted by Irish companies will have the benefit of the extra protection requirements and it should help greatly in further establishing Ireland as a good reliable tourist destination.</P>
    <P>Any measure which helps to build a good image of Irish tourism is of great value to our economy.  This industry has grown in importance over the years, the private and state investment made has helped to greatly increase the number of job opportunities and the industry has been an important revenue earner for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>As Article 10 on page 33 of the Bill indicates this measure was recommended to the Council of Ministers by its then President, my colleague, Deputy O'Malley on 13 June 1990.  It is appropriate to acknowledge the contribution made in this area by Deputy O'Malley and his staunch opposition to the European airline cartel which charged such high access fares to this island economy and prevented the growth of travel to and from Ireland for so many years.</P>
    <P>Air travel was virtually static from 1978 to 1985.  Air fares rose by far more than the rate of inflation.  When the Government in 1986 did a U-turn in the course of a Bill to fine and imprison those who discounted airline tickets, there followed a period of sustained growth in Irish air travel and tourism and it is higher than in any OECD country. The Green Paper on Aviation Policy, published a year ago by the then Minister, Deputy Cowen, showed the major benefits to be gained from airline deregulation policies which Deputy O'Malley was the first to espouse in this House in the years 1984 to 1986.  That Green Paper quantifies some of the benefits that accrued.  It states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="584" /> The benefits for Ireland in terms of wealth and employment creation as a result of the policies pursued over the past six years have been significant:</P>
    <P>&mdash;visitor numbers to Ireland rose to 3.3 million per annum in 1993, an increase of over 60 per cent in 1987;</P>
    <P>&mdash;over 25,000 jobs have been created in tourism between 1987 and 1993;</P>
    <P>&mdash;increased tourism and foreign travel earnings amounted to over £560 million since 1987;</P>
    <P>&mdash;travel by business people has increased by about 50 per cent which undoubtedly has helped our merchandise export drive.</P>
    <P>It has now been clearly established that competition in air travel is the first prerequisite to good value for the traveller, however, there is much to be done still to realise this goal in Europe.  Air fares in Europe are the highest in the world. European airlines' share of world air travel is falling rapidly.  Many European State airlines exist on State handouts, of which the European Union has had to sanction some £10 billion to aid the slumbering State giants to the detriment of more competitive airlines.  The control of slots at busy airports by old airlines under the grandfather rights system is a major barrier to competition which the European Union must address by reallocating slots to new airlines in sufficient quantities to make a significant impact.  State aids and predatory pricing by large airlines on smaller carriers must also be addressed.</P>
    <P>The charter airlines played an important role in getting the customer to his or her sun destination for about a third of the cost of scheduled airlines, according to the Cascade studies carried out by the Civil Aviation Authority. Within geographical Europe charter airlines have about 40 per cent of all passenger miles flown.  The charter airlines are typically profitable, low cost and do not require State assistance.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless the combination of the elements in a package tour has in the past proved unstable.  Holidaymakers <Col N="585" /> have been stranded abroad.  Tour operators have gone out of business between taking payments for holidays and the date of those holidays.  There has also been a number of cases where brochures have contained misleading information and inaccurate photographs of hotels and other amenities.</P>
    <P>The reputable tour operators have been with us for many years and a bonding system is now in operation.  Nonetheless, EU Ministers considered there was a need for this directive.  A holiday abroad is a major item in any family budget and the anxiety caused by problems in the past had left a strong consumer lobby for Government controls over the package holiday sector.  In an ideal economy there would be no need for regulatory controls.  Good tour organisers would be kept on their toes by the arrival of new market entrants. In this case the interval between paying for and going on a holiday plus the number of producers in different countries involved in putting the package together, retailing it, providing the air transport and the accommodation, make it difficult for the consumer to apply market sanctions against the provider of an unsatisfactory holiday.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, there are costs resulting from this kind of legislation which are often overlooked.  The Governments of Europe will incur legislative and administrative costs at a time when few of them are able to balance their books and virtually all of them levy tax bills which are already excessive.  If the package tour industry had been self-regulating, this Bill would not have been required and taxpayers would be better off.</P>
    <P>When levies are imposed on all the members of an industry in order to compensate customers of the unsatisfactory members of that industry, we have what is called in insurance terms &ldquo;moral hazard&rdquo;. The conduct of the bad members of an industry is covered by levies on the customers of the majority in the industry who discharge their duties to the customer in a satisfactory manner. Government intervention in banking <Col N="586" /> and insurance cases is open to this strong criticism, and this Bill incurs the same costs.  For example, why should a customer of risky banks, insurance companies and tour operators be compensated by the clientele of banks, insurance companies and tour operators who run their affairs with probity?</P>
    <P>There are benefits in terms of consumer protection to be gained from legislation such as this which are sufficient to justify our support for this Bill.  Its provisions also involve costs to the public sector in assuming extra responsibilities and for companies' customers.</P>
    <P>The European Union directive is comprehensive, covering all the main areas of concern to the travelling consumers, from their original perusal of a colourful and attractive brochure to booking a holiday, involving myriad services, including public and private transport, complicated schedules and timetables, transport by air, sea and road; accommodation, ranging from tents and caravans to registered guesthouses and hotels, luxury liners or hire-out yachts and motor boats; the list is endless.</P>
    <P>While my party welcomes the Bill and intends supporting its Second Reading, some of its provisions to which I shall refer, require clarification, as they are causing concern to some people within the industry and among groups that organise cultural and educational tours on a non-commercial basis.</P>
    <P>The first issue requiring greater clarification is that of information to be furnished to intending holiday-makers by tour operators or holiday organisers, on health requirements, under the provisions of section 10 (1) (e).  It appears that the sponsoring Department and the drafters of this Bill gave insufficient attention to this important provision as the accompanying explanatory memorandum does not even mention it.  From time to time we all become aware of unfortunate, sometimes disastrous, sequels to sun holidays through people becoming seriously ill from having eaten <Col N="587" /> some food or drinking contaminated water.</P>
    <P>This highlights not only the type of information on health requirements that should be provided to intending holiday makers but also the important issue of ensuring immunisation against particular infectious diseases prevalent in many of the more exotic sun holiday destinations worldwide.  For example, the hepatitis A virus, a serious debilitating infection of the liver, is found in areas of southern Europe graded as presenting intermediate risks while Africa, South America and Russia are regarded as high risk areas.  Given the serious consequences of contracting hepatitis A, and the risk that arises in some holiday destinations of contracting the even more lethal hepatitis B virus, it is essential that holiday-makers travelling to areas at risk are made aware of the possibility of contracting those serious illnesses and be vaccinated against both forms of hepatitis before departure.</P>
    <P>In the light of those health risks it would be appropriate for the Bill to spell out in more specific detail obligations on tour operators to provide intending holiday-makers with fuller information about them.  Indeed it would be better still if requirements in relation to health risks in a host country formed part of the essential terms of the holiday contract spelled out in section 14.  I urge the Minister to carefully consider upgrading this particular requirement.</P>
    <P>I have received representations from the National Youth Council of Ireland expressing concern that the provisions of this Bill &mdash; intended to regulate commercial tour operators &mdash; do not extend to various organisations engaged in youth and educational exchange tours between this and other European Union member states.  The Bill, as drafted, does not draw a distinction between commercial tour operators and groups and organisations engaged in cultural and educational exchange programmes, involving the transport of people <Col N="588" /> between member states of the European Union.  Given the non-profit status of educational and exchange organisations, there is a reasonable case for their exemption from some of the commercial requirements and definitions of this Bill, such as having to maintain a reserve fund against possible claims.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that the Irish Travel Agents' Association is concerned about the intention to bring the provisions of this Bill into force within three months of its enactment as they have already published half a million brochures for the 1995 holiday season, a reasonable point &mdash; its implementation could well await the winter holiday brochures this year.  However, it is abundantly clear that the full and effective implementation of these new provisions governing the harmonisation of travel laws between this country and the remainder of the European Union will bring much greater peace of mind to the 350,000 Irish people expected to embark on package holidays this year, while rendering this country a more secure holiday destination for people travelling here from the other 14 member states of the European Union.</P>
    <P>I shall raise some further points on Committee Stage but my party will support this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this important consumer protection Bill, dealing with the tourist industry which is of immense importance to our economy and within which there is enormous potential for growth as there are no curtailments, quota restrictions or the like involved.  We must attract more tourists and there is no doubt that, following the cessation of violence in Northern Ireland, more people will be encouraged to choose our country as a holiday destination.  Neither is there any doubt that the huge demand for the sun holidays of the past decade or so are on the wane, people realise there are health risks involved, so our mild climate and the attractions we can offer in a clean environment will attract many more visitors.  However, we must ensure <Col N="589" /> that when they come, they enjoy the same standards we expect when we travel abroad.</P>
      <P>The provisions of this Bill seek guarantees for people purchasing a package holiday so that their experience is commensurate with that offered by the tour operator.  It is only fair to point out that most people involved in the tourist industry are honest, people who have been involved over many years and built up a reputation.  However, like any business, there will always be the whiz-kid who may set up an office down the street, offer package holidays at give-away prices, and disappear within six months, leaving many people disillusioned and disappointed.  They tend to give reputable firms a bad name. Regardless of how many times they are warned, people tend to go for the glossy brochure or the television or billboard advertisement &mdash; there is nothing wrong with that because people selling a product must entice customers to their premises &mdash; but, having enticed them, any potential customer would be very foolish to choose such a product merely on the strength of its advertisement or relevant brochure.  A good maxim is to believe half of what one sees and less still of what one reads, which would be true in the case of many brochures on products being sold not just here but worldwide.</P>
      <P>The guarantees incorporated in this Bill are welcome.  Too frequently we come across people who, having chosen a package holiday in good faith, on inquiry of their tour operator, were told they would have a panoramic view from their hotel bedroom window but, on arrival, may discover a &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo;&mdash; type view of the surrounding roof tops.</P>

      <P>While it may be all right for Deputy Davern who is used to travelling, many people purchase such package holidays without having already <Col N="590" /> travelled abroad and will expect the panoramic view illustrated in the brochure.</P>
      <P>In addition, a brochure may well specify that one's hotel is within walking distance of the beach: does that comprise three miles, four miles?  Let us be specific.</P>

      <P>Deputy Davern may have problems in that regard but there are means of having people transported if and when required.  I am talking about people who buy a package deal offering various services but who, having paid through the nose, find that the deal does not live up to its claims.  We must ensure that what the brochure states is accurate and, if not, there must be a come back. Too often people complain that the guarantees in the brochure are false. Guarantees must be put in place.</P>
      <P>We want guarantees on food quality drinking water, hotel standards and so on.  Frequently people have been disappointed in their holidays.  The complaints of even one unsatisfied customer can affect business and the fly by night operator can do untold harm.  If we are seeking guarantees for our people going abroad we should also give similar guarantees here.</P>
      <P>We have a great opportunity to promote agri-tourism.  I note the Bill does not cover bed and breakfast accommodation unless it is part of a package tour. Most people who visit the region I represent come on fishing holidays and expect to get bed and breakfast accommodation. There are also fishing clubs which operate package holidays and I am sure that would include the accommodation offered to them here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While most people in the business provide top quality accommodation, people who see an opportunity but do <Col N="591" /> not have experience in this field are moving into this industry.  They would not provide the same standard of accommodation as those in the business who worked hard to build it up over, say, the past ten years.  New operators cannot be allowed to undermine the industry because tourism is about to take off here and there is money to be made.  We must have long term constructive planning and safeguards to ensure that people coming here are as satisfied as we would like our people going abroad to be.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the number of people going on foreign holidays.  We cannot be parochial and say our people should stay at home.  With the economic uplift provided by this good Government &mdash; which I hope will continue for a reasonable period &mdash; people will have extra money in their pockets and will seek to go abroad.  Retired people who have reared families, may decide to visit Europe.  We must guarantee that their hard earned savings are not thrown away on a holiday that does not live up to their expectations.</P>
    <P>Our sports people are gaining international fame and people are travelling abroad to support them.  Last weekend I had the pleasure of travelling to support Caitriona McKiernan from Cornafein, County Cavan, to Durham where she came second and won a silver medal for the fourth time in the cross country grand prix.  She is not acknowledged here but if she came from Dublin or Cork there would have been banner headlines.  However, it is a marvellous achievement for a young girl from Cavan.</P>
    <P>We travelled to Newcastle and on to Durham.  I was annoyed that the Irish currency was not acceptable in the hotel in which we stayed, yet the punt was equal to the pound sterling.  It is not good enough in this day and age that our currency should be belittled.  One of the people travelling with us had Northern Ireland currency and the hotel would not accept it.  I wonder whether <Col N="592" /> the people in Northern Ireland are aware of that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>Tour operators should try to ensure that our currency is acceptable in accommodation, generally hotel accommodation.  In the hotel to which I referred there was a billboard at the back of reception showing various currencies but the £IR was not quoted.  I take that as an insult.  That is not acceptable and it is time, as a nation, we insisted that we be allowed trade in our currency.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies asked whether this Bill will result in increased holiday and travel costs.  Up to now going on holiday was a risk, a type of gamble.  A spoiled holiday cannot be costed.  Surely guarantees are worth the extra costs.  If tour operators want to give a package holiday without guarantees let them say it is without guarantee.  If there are people who want to accept it, that is fine.  This would operate like the smoking advertisements which say smoking is bad for health but people still risk taking the odd cigarette.  If a tour operator guarantees that if a holiday does not live up to the offer made the money will be refunded, a price has to be paid for it. There are two sides to the argument.  It is not acceptable that a tour operator should sell a pig in a poke.  With all the mod cons and the various developments there should be no reason to doubt that places of destination live up to expectations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a marvellous opportunity to promote Ireland which has miles of unspoilt beach and acres of open countryside.  This legislation shows that <Col N="593" /> the Minister is willing to adopt standards expected in Europe and that can only be beneficial.  I compliment him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Davern.  I too welcome this legislation.  In the long term the consumer should benefit from such legislation.  I hope the legislation will not apply to this year's brochures as it would make things very difficult for travel agents who have already sold holidays from those brochures.  Travel agencies will have to make contingency plans for this legislation.  I hope business travel will be excluded from it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Boylan referred to the possibility of holiday costs being increased.  I have spoken with a few travel agents who have said that in the long term the legislation will result in an increase in the price of holidays abroad.  It will put pressure, as has already been shown, on small travel agents with regard to insurance.  I understand that in the UK and Holland insurance costs increased by 40 per cent following the introduction of similar legislation.  I am not criticising that.  It is probably inevitable because travel agents will have to take more responsibility for what they are selling to their customer.  I hope solicitors will not encourage people to sue travel agents merely because they experienced some slight difficulty during their holiday.  Deputy Brennan referred to people who had sued travel agents and won on very dubious grounds&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>If the package does not include a ride on a camel one cannot sue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt that some solicitors will pursue these cases. We have all heard of cases involving <Col N="594" /> half built hotels, no facilities and people arriving at airports in the middle of the night with no courier to look after them. A holiday is a huge financial cost for people and it should be properly run from start to finish and be in accordance with the details given in the brochure.  It is not good enough for a brochure to say that an apartment overlooks the sea when a hotel was built in front of it two years ago and one can no longer see the sea.  This should not be allowed happen and I hope the legislation will put pressure on travel agents to ensure that they know what they are selling and can stand over it.</P>
      <P>One of the worst examples of travel agents not doing their job properly involves Sportex which circulated a very glossy brochure giving details of a package holiday which included a flight to the USA for the World Cup, internal flights, hotel accommodation for a month and match tickets for the outrageous price of £1,200-£1,400.  If travel agents had added up the individual costs they would have realised it was impossible to sell the package for this price. However, many of them decided to ignore this and sold these holidays which proved to be a nightmare for approximately 320 people from Ireland and England.  Under the legislation it will not be possible for this to happen in the future.  The travel agents who sold these packages were as responsible as Sportex for letting people down.  It costs approximately £400 to fly to the United States, 30 nights accommodation costs a minimum of £30 a night and there are also the internal flights, giving a total of more than £1,500.  The costs did not add up and travel agents should have known that.  I do not know what action the Minister can take against Sportex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most worrying aspect of all this is that when people rang Sportex to complain they were put through to a company called Air Track Football Limited. The FA in England has had huge problems with Sportex and Chris Abbott has a history of letting down people who wish to attend sporting fixtures.  I am delighted the legislation will deal with <Col N="595" /> people who go out of their way to take money from fans.  It is about time these people were put in jail.  Both Sportex and the travel agents who sold these holiday packages to the general public are guilty of fraud.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which will deal with extreme cases similar to the one referred to by Deputy Ryan. Saliva must be dripping from the mouths of members of the Incorporated Law Society and the medical profession who regard this legislation as another bonanza.  I am particularly concerned about small travel agents who are supposed to know the details of brochures on Turkey, Afghanistan, Australia, North America and other places they have never visited.  These are the people we ask to pay rates, public liability insurance, employment levies, PRSI and tax.  Yet we propose to place a further imposition on them by requiring them to take out insurance which will be very costly.  When the Minister says there will be a small increase he really means that there will be a significant increase.  I am sure he will agree that the price of holidays will be increased by 5-6 per cent as a result.</P>
      <P>The legislation will lead to a significant increase in whimsical complaints. Deputy Brennan referred to a fellow who fell off a camel in Tunisia.  If a brochure contains a picture of a person riding a camel then one may assume this is part of the package holiday.  Such pictures encourage people to take a camel ride when in Tunisia.  From my experience of the horse industry I know that some visitors who have never even ridden a bicycle go horse riding while on holiday.  If anything happens to them while riding a horse the tour operator will be liable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a person on a driving holiday hits a pothole can he sue the tour operator for failure to warn him that there were potholes in Cavan, Monaghan and elsewhere? If a person plans a holiday to Ireland because he or she is told it is a friendly country and is mugged while <Col N="596" /> here, can that person sue the people who sold the holiday?  The provisions of the Bill are far too broad and will pander to people's whims.  What about school, religious and voluntary group tours?  Will the person who organises a bus to, say, a football match in Cork or Killarney be liable if something goes wrong?  The Bill refers to &ldquo;a person who acts as an agent other than for reward&rdquo;. This whole area needs to be reconsidered. Will the Minister consider not introducing the measures this year?  If not, travel agents will have to reprint their brochures.  There is a tendency sometimes to take the liberty of advertising a sunny climate in particular destinations, but we cannot even guarantee sunshine in Spain any more.  In such circumstances would travel agents be liable under the legislation?</P>
    <P>If people are encouraged to take out insurance there will be a huge number of claims.  To some extent, the travel industry has been self-regulatory.  If a person books a holiday through a travel agent, particularly in a small town, and the holiday turns out to be disastrous, the adverse publicity which would ensue could spell the end of the travel agency. Why should a travel agent be responsible if a person gets food poisoning while on holiday?  I know that is not the Minister's intention, but the legal eagles will ensure that people will sue the travel agent at every hands turn.  For example, if a person contracts AIDS while on holiday he or she could sue the travel agent for not supplying condoms or if a married couple were not made aware that they might have a lax moment while on holiday and the women became pregnant the travel agency is liable to be sued.  I can foresee ridiculous cases arising as a result of this Bill, just as in the case of local authorities where people claim for reasons we never dreamt of.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the overall package enterprise, it will be to the detriment of holidays at home because of the high cost involved.  I am not concerned about cases brought to the High Court, but about the large number of minor cases <Col N="597" /> brought before the District and Circuit Courts.  To save money in legal costs, insurance companies will pay out lump sums of up to £7,000 to stop litigation going further.  Will the Minister reconsider the provisions of the Bill and, in particular, ensure that travel agents cannot be held responsible for the variety of facilities they advertise?  This would be detrimental especially for smaller agents and will tend to centralise large travel agencies in the big cities who can afford the insurance costs because they have the staff to monitor and research them.  Once again areas outside the Pale will be adversely affected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Even if the cost of holidays increases, in the long term consumers will welcome its provisions.  The genesis of the Bill is in the sharp practices and misleading information which occurred in the past which left many people disappointed after their holidays.  Most people go on holiday with high expectations and to enjoy themselves.  They go of their own volition, they certainly do not go out of a sense of duty or obligation and, obviously, they are disappointed if the holiday is not to their satisfaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Holidays account for a considerable percentage of most people's average income, some even borrow to go on holiday.  It is important, therefore, that people are afforded the necessary protection when they go on holiday.  The basic principle of business is to keep the consumer happy and this is true in particular of the tourism industry.  Holidays are discretionary but if a person is disappointed with a holiday, he or she will not be anxious to return to that destination and if travel agencies do not bear that in mind, they will go out of business sooner rather than later.  Also, people who are dissatisfied with their holidays will not book through the same travel agency the following year.  It is <Col N="598" /> important that travel agencies maintain high standards to encourage people to book their holidays with them.</P>
    <P>The Bill will increase the rights of consumers under a number of headings. It is important that a third party should be able to avail of bookings when the person who booked the holiday is unable to avail of it.  In the past, many difficulties with package holidays arose from a lack of clarity and anxiety on the part of those selling holidays to present the holiday in the best possible light. While that may be the fairest and most charitable way to present a holiday, some people distort information and mislead people in presenting holidays.  It is desirable that such practice is brought to an end.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for clear regulations in regard to categories of transport and the type and standard of accommodation and, as this is easily defined, people will know exactly to what they are entitled.  The Bill also covers meals, tour itineraries and transport.  It is also important that people are aware of the tax they must pay and the distance their hotel is from the beach.  Vague terms such as &ldquo;near the beach&rdquo; and &ldquo;beautiful views&rdquo; should be clarified.  There is no excuse for people being vague about the distance from the hotel to a beach or other facilities.  It is a simple procedure to measure the distance, it can then be written in black and white.  People will then know exactly where they stand and can plan accordingly.</P>
    <P>The provisions regarding passports and visas are very important as it can be very frustrating to discover at the last minute that a visa or passport is not in order.  It is pleasing to note that our passport facilities are being improved so that people can obtain a passport within a few weeks.</P>
    <P>The Bill will make the process of providing package holidays much more complicated.  The health and safety requirements are very welcome because nobody wants to become ill while on holiday.  It is important that realistic and practical precautions are taken to ensure that does not happen.  Minimum <Col N="599" /> levels of insurance, insolvency arrangements, etc. are also important &mdash; we have had some nasty experiences in this regard in the past.</P>
    <P>I agree with some of the remarks by Deputies opposite about Irish travel agents who have printed their 1995 brochures. I hope the Minister will take their difficulties into account because it was reasonable for them to go ahead and print those brochures when they did.  I am sure something can be worked out to get over the immediate problem so that everybody will know where they stand.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Bill will create some difficulties for small operators here, in particular, people who provide bed and breakfast type accommodation and offer fishing, pony riding and golfing facilities etc.  They will be covered by this Bill.  It is highly desirable that the services they offer should be adequate, but I sincerely hope the Bill will not discourage them from developing new products to sell to their customers.  It is important that such operators should work at developing new packages. Obviously they will have to raise their standards, and it is desirable that they should do so.  However, I hope due consideration has been given to the problems they will encounter and that it will be possible to alleviate legitimate problems that arise.  In that context it is worth mentioning that about one-third of the work-force in the European Union are employed in organisations which employ fewer than ten people. The tourism industry is a very important area for growth in employment and I am anxious to see the development of new packages.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill will probably result in an increase in the cost of holidays but one gets what one pays for. If we are paying for a better service, that should prevent a recurrence of many of the disappointments that were suffered in the past, and that is desirable.</P>
    <P>The Bill is also part of a phenomenon whereby consumers' rights are given much more attention than in the past. <Col N="600" /> That is desirable but, as a society, we have become very concerned with rights.  However, in addition to rights there are obligations and duties, and I sometimes feel that we have become excessively concerned with rights and inclined to disregard obligations and duties.  It would not be out of place if there were an element of adjustment in the balance between rights and obligations. It would do us no harm to pay a little more attention to our responsibilities and obligations.  The preoccupation with rights has given rise to court cases and that phenomenon is undesirable from the point of view of the welfare of our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this Bill which is well overdue.  The Bill legislates for a 1990 directive, and some Opposition speakers complained about the delay in introducing it.  At the same time there is concern about the three months within which the Minister intends to make this Bill apply to the travel trade here.  The Opposition cannot have it both ways; they cannot on the one hand complain about the delay and, on the other, complain about the haste with which the Minister introduced the legislation. People intending to go on a package holiday know that if they have not made arrangements by July next, they will not be going anywhere, either abroad or touring this country, until well into the autumn.  That is why there are so many television stations advertising the packages that are available.  The implementation of the provisions of this Bill in three months time will have little effect on those who have booked their holidays.  A person going on a package holiday must book early in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is right in saying that as a result of this Bill there will be accuracy and clarity in the content of brochures and promotional material. Many brochures are heavy on coloured pictures of beautiful scenery and the like and light on explaining what the package involves and how the prices change from one month to another.  If <Col N="601" /> information in brochures is clearer it will be a help.  We have all heard about the small print in contracts, but one would need a magnifying glass to see exactly what one is committing oneself to when signing up for a package holiday.  I hope the Minister will ensure that the print in those brochures is big enough for people to read them in order to understand what they are signing up for.</P>
    <P>When I was planning to go to America I hired a car at what I thought was a particularly attractive rate, but when I got there I discovered that if I did not take out additional insurance and returned the car with the slightest scratch, $200 or $300 would be added to the cost.  In addition I had to bring it back to the place from which I had hired it.  There are other arrangements whereby one can hire a car at one airport and leave it at another.  The people organising the car hire made it clear to me that the car had to be returned at a particular time and if I wanted to keep it an extra day or two the cost would rocket.  People have also had the experience of taking a package holiday to a resort that looked particularly attractive in the brochure only to find that the hotel was partly finished and next door there were builders using jackhammers and making a terrible racket.  In other resorts one might be placed in accommodation beside some of the lager louts that we recently had experience of at the last soccer international match in Dublin.  In attractive looking places like Magaluf people complain that they would need a bodyguard to go out in the evening to any of the restaurants or hotels.  We have all heard of such complaints and I hope this Bill will adequately deal with these problems.</P>
    <P>More protection obviously means an increase in the price of the holiday because of the added cost of insurance. Most people realise it is wise to be properly insured when they go abroad, and if the cost of the insurance can be contained in the initial expenditure that is all the better.  The Minister will have to keep a close watch on the additional <Col N="602" /> insurance costs and monitor any additional costs that may be applied to contracts following the passage of this Bill.  I say that particularly because we live near a large country that offers a great deal of very attractive packages. For £70 one can be flown to Manchester, Luton or Gatwick where the competition for business is intense and there is a huge range of offers.  We do not want our tour operators to face even more intense competition on price when the Bill comes into operation.</P>
    <P>While we are delighted with the peace dividend it is worth reminding ourselves that there is also an international airport in Northern Ireland.  The Minister should correspond with his counterpart in the Northern Ireland Office to ensure that the rules will apply equally to those travelling through that jurisdiction.  It is important that there is a level playing field.  While competition is desirable and the Bill provides for consumer protection, tour operators in a neighbouring jurisdiction may take advantage of it with the result that consumers will travel 100 miles to take advantage of a far better deal.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies questioned the timing of the Bill and mentioned this may cause problems but I do not think it will have any great effect in the coming holiday season.  Having waited five years I am delighted it has been introduced and I am sure it will be passed through the House today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to transpose an EU directive into Irish law.  It is important that the same regulations apply in all member states. The Bill provides for the provision of information by the organiser and retailer to the consumer who will be at liberty to transfer his business to a third party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Great emphasis is being placed on tourism development with each country seeing itself as a holiday destination. Although my own country does not have a coastline or high mountains it still has <Col N="603" /> much to offer in terms of fishing, walking holidays and places of historical interest.</P>
    <P>While the Bill provides for consumer protection it will also place a great responsibility on tour operators.  I understand that of the 322 tour operators in the country about 200 are small with two or three employees.  The Bill should not impose heavy demands on them.</P>
    <P>The legal eagles could have a field day having regard to the frightening increase in litigation in recent years as compared with other countries.  In this regard many bed and breakfast establishments provide fishing equipment, boats and trekking ponies to people who may not be very skilled.  I perceive problems in terms of litigation.  The downside to this Bill is that it may seriously curtail the efforts of those who are trying to develop their businesses.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate and appreciate the constructive manner in which comments were made and the general support expressed for the Bill. A number of questions were asked and some Deputies suggested amendments to certain sections.</P>
      <P>Before addressing these I reiterate by way of general comment that it is important to bear in mind that the primary purpose of the Bill is the transposition of the EU directive on package travel, package holidays and package tours into Irish law.  Ireland is obliged to transpose this directive by virtue of her membership of the European Union and by enacting this legislation we are fulfilling our obligations in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What we are seeking to do is strike a balance between the rights of the consumer and the cost to the travel trade. We have found this balance.  I understand that the travel trade, with which my Department has had a number of rounds of consultations, is generally <Col N="604" /> satisfied with the Bill.  A number of matters remain the source of concern for the trade.  However, while there is some flexibility in implementing the directive it is limited.  We must implement both the letter and the spirit of the directive.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan and a number of other Deputies asked that the commencement order bringing the Bill into operation should not be made until three months after the Bill has been enacted.  A number of aspects have to be balanced.  First, as was pointed out by a number of Deputies, we are over two years late in bringing this directive into operation.  It is important to give consumers the protection afforded by the Bill as soon as possible.  On the other hand the travel trade must be given adequate time to prepare the ground in relation to the accuracy of brochures on the shelves and other matters. The travel trade knows that this Bill is on the way and is already making the necessary preparations.  At the same time it is important that it should have adequate time to prepare fully for the new requirements under the legislation. I am sympathetic to the request made by Deputy Brennan and other Deputies and have taken due note of it.  It will not require an amendment to the Bill as it refers to the timing of the order which will be made bringing the Bill into operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan's point about the lead-in time for implementation of the Bill is linked to another point made by some Deputies regarding retrospection. In other words, what will happen if, after the Bill comes into operation, a customer picks up a brochure in a travel agency which was issued before the Bill became law?  Once the Bill is enacted my Department will be contacting travel agents and tour operators to draw attention to the new requirements.  During the lead-in time the onus will be on travel agents to ensure that they stock only brochures which comply fully with the new requirements.  I will ensure that the lead-in time is fully adequate for this purpose.  In the interest of consumers it <Col N="605" /> would not be reasonable that it should exceed three months.</P>
    <P>On the question of whether travel agents should not be liable for misleading information in brochures, it is a requirement of the directive that brochures be fully accurate.  The directive makes both the organiser and retailer liable to a consumer who relies on the brochure.  This is necessary for the consumer. A number of Deputies mentioned that exaggerated claims are often made.  This point is covered by the Bill. The consumer is entitled to be offered a fully accurate description of the package he is paying for.  It will be a defence for the retailer to show that he did not know and had no reason to suspect that the brochure was false or misleading.</P>
    <P>There could also be a situation where a travel agent knowingly distributes a misleading brochure produced by a tour operator outside the jurisdiction.  In those circumstances the consumer should be able to take action against the travel agent because nobody else would be available to the consumer to take action against.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan asked that the Bill be more specific on business travel in order to clarify that it is not a package. I am satisfied that the Bill before the House covers this point adequately.  It was carefully drafted to ensure that business travel does not come within the definition of &ldquo;package&rdquo;.  The important point is that business travel is not prearranged. The guidelines which will be issued by the Director of Consumer Affairs on what constitutes a package will make it clear that business travel is not covered.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies asked whether this legislation will apply to people who offer bed and breakfast type accommodation. I can understand the reasons for concern as this kind of accommodation has become increasingly popular in recent years.  However, the concern is not well founded.  The provisions of this Bill will not apply where bed and breakfast accommodation is offered on its own &mdash; in other words, to the vast <Col N="606" /> majority of cases.  The legislation will apply if the accommodation is combined with transport or with some other tourist service which accounts for a significant proportion of the package.</P>
    <P>Transport, in this instance, obviously does not include services such as picking up someone from the local bus or rail station.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Or the pub.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Such a service would be ancillary to the accommodation.  It would, however, include the provision of train tickets &mdash; this would mean that an inclusive package would be created.</P>
      <P>Other tourist services in this regard could include activities such as golf and fishing.  People on these types of breaks will have spent significant amounts of money and it is only right and proper that the consumer should have protection in these circumstances, whether they are staying in bed and breakfast accommodation or in hotels.</P>
      <P>Where bed and breakfast accommodation in Ireland is being provided as part of a package organised abroad, it is the organiser in that country, Germany for instance, who will have to comply with the provisions of the directive as enacted in that country.  In these circumstances, the person who provides bed and breakfast accommodation here is unlikely to need any additional insurance cover over that which they have already.</P>
      <P>I would stress that this is consumer protection legislation which highlights the onus on the package provider to ensure that the product sold, and the manner in which it is sold, is satisfactory. While there is a greater onus put on package organisers, nonetheless consumers will have to prove their claims and the organiser will not be liable where the consumer himself or herself is at fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is one of a number of measures aimed at protecting consumers. The European Commission has been very active in this field in recent <Col N="607" /> years and in February this year my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, made regulations implementing the Directive on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts.  The Director of Consumer Affairs will also be taking these regulations into account in his implementation of this Bill when enacted.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill regarding the information to be provided to the consumer about health formalities required for the journey and the stay is taken directly from the EU Directive. What is in question here is that an intending consumer should be informed if there are particular requirements of the authorities in the country to be visited or any countries through which the consumer would pass in the course of the journey in respect of innoculations or vaccinations.  It is sufficiently clear in my view that the health requirements in question are those imposed by the national health authorities in the various countries.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have raised the question as to whether youth exchange organisations come within the scope of this Bill.  The short answer to that is that they do.</P>
    <P>These organisations are engaged in the business of selling packages to the public on a full time basis.  Consumers are entitled to the comfort of knowing that they will have the protection of the legislation both from the point of view of getting what they pay for and having their money secure in the event of the organisation in question being unable to meet its financial obligations.  This is all the more necessary given that what we are talking about here, very often, are under age minors.</P>
    <P>This treatment of educational and youth exchange organisations is consistent with the attitude taken by other member states, none of whom have excluded it from their legislation transposing the directive into national law. However, school tours, scout camps and pilgrimages are quite a different matter. They are organised on an occasional <Col N="608" /> basis only and as such will be excluded from the requirements of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean the annual pilgrimage is out or just the occasional one?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>It depends on how religious one is.</P>
      <P>Even if the current Bill were never introduced, all foreign travel, including that organised on an occasional basis as described above, comes within the scope of the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982 and must be sold only by a tour operator or travel agent licensed and bonded under that Act.  Anyone &mdash; and that include voluntary bodies, schools and pilgrimages &mdash; organising foreign travel must do so through a licensed travel agent or tour operator in order that people buying the travel may have the protection of the Act even if it takes place only once a year.</P>
      <P>I note the suggestion for amending the definition of &ldquo;travel agent&rdquo; in the Bill.  I will look at this point again on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the concerns that have been expressed about the safety of Irish holidaymakers travelling abroad.  This Bill is meant primarily to transpose the EU Directive on Package Travel into Irish legislation.  It is not a vehicle to introduce wider measures.  Nonetheless, the legislation will place a greater onus on the travel trade to ensure that all the elements of the contract with the consumer, including those relating to accommodation, are properly performed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill transposes EU Directive No. 90/314/EEC into Irish law.  Deputies have commented about the delay in implementing the directive.  This was due in the main to the need for a comprehensive consultative process.  There have been extensive rounds of consultations with the travel trade and with carriers. The complexities of the directive also meant that my Department had to consult with the EC Commission to seek clarification on a number of points.  Those <Col N="609" /> are the reasons it was not implemented before now.  It is now being done because there is a new dynamic Minister in the Department who took the bull by the horns and decided to bring the Bill before the House and get it passed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I want to say to Deputy Molloy, who raised this question, that his former Leader when Minister was President of the Council of Ministers and had every opportunity, during his period in office, to bring this directive into Irish law as soon as it was passed.  It ill becomes the Deputy to criticise delays on the part of others when his party delayed also.</P>
    <P>One of the points discussed with the Commission was the period specified in section 15 in regard to last minute reservations. The Commission informed us that, bearing in mind the other provisions of the directive, member states are allowed to decide the timeframe on this matter.  A number of Deputies have suggested that a period of 14 days should apply.  The Bill provides for a seven days period.  However, in view of the points made by the Deputies, I will look again at the matter on Committee Stage and also at the point raised by a number of Deputies about defamation.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have expressed concerns about the possibility that implimentation of the directive will result in large increases in holiday prices.  I do not expect any such large increases as a result of this legislation.  Additional costs, if they arise, will be because of the need for package providers to have additional insurance cover in respect of the activities of providers of accommodation abroad.  The travel trade business is highly competitive and this will have its own effect on keeping prices steady.</P>
    <P>Deputies referred to possible large increases in prices &mdash; increases of up to 40 per cent in insurance costs were mentioned. Concern was expressed that this could result in small travel agencies going out of business.  I do not accept that this will happen and it is completely unrealistic to suggest that prices of <Col N="610" /> packages will escalate by anything of this order.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the increased costs to the package provider, when spread over the large number of packages sold over the year, will result in a negligible increase in prices, if any.  Even if there is a small increase in prices I am satisfied that the additional improvement in the protection of the consumer is worth this increase.  The Director of Consumer Affairs, who will be administering this legislation, when enacted, will be extremely vigilant to ensure that the introduction of the Act will not be used as an excuse to increase holiday prices unnecessarily.</P>
    <P>Deputies mentioned the need for an arbitration system.  There is an existing arbitration scheme administered by the travel trade itself in respect of foreign travel.  Consumers can also have redress to the small claims court for claims up to £500 in respect of any package for which they have contracted.</P>
    <P>The need to transpose this directive presented me with the opportunity to amend a small number of sections of the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982.  It allows me to eliminate a number of anomalies which have come to notice in the light of implementing the 1982 Act.  Carriers have heretofore been exempted from the provision of that Act.</P>
    <P>The current Bill applies to all package organisers, including carriers who put packages together for sale.  In addition, where a carrier puts packages together which include overseas travel, the exemption under the 1982 Act is now being removed.  It will be necessary for all such carriers to be licensed and bonded under that Act in future in respect of that element of their business. This will level the playing field between carriers and the tour operators with whom they compete.  It will also give consumers who book with carriers the protection of the 1982 Act.</P>
    <P>Problems were experienced with the operation of the 1982 Act in identifying precisely what was encompassed by overseas travel.  It referred only to travel <Col N="611" /> outside Ireland.  That Act, as amended by this Bill, will in future apply to all travel commencing in the State to destinations anywhere in the world outside the State or outside Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>In recent decades, tourism as a leisure pastime within the European Union has expanded and developed beyond recognition. More than 180 million people within the Community take their holidays away from home each year. This is in addition to those travelling for business, professional and educational reasons.</P>
    <P>It was clear that the different measures adapted at the level of the member states were not working as well as they should and, in the interests of developing policies for protecting the consumer, it was necessary to have common rules and a common framework for holiday packages in all member states.</P>
    <P>This is important legislation which will improve the protection of consumers in Ireland buying holiday packages and will raise the standards of service to all holidaymakers.  It should be welcomed not only by consumers but by all in the trade.  It gives clear guidelines to package organisers on what is required by them and on the extent of their liability.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is seldom, having read a report, I agree with the sentiments expressed by its authors.  People enter politics for various reasons and one of the key reasons I am in politics is to work to achieve a pluralist, fair and honest society in which everybody has equal opportunities.  Citizens should be entitled to the opportunity of employment. To be deprived of this opportunity is to condemn the citizen and their family to a life that is unfulfilling. Life on the dole is not what we wish for any of our citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I give full recognition to report No. 4 of the National Economic and Social Forum which was debated before I was re-elected to the Dáil.  Much work was put into that report entitled Ending Long-Term Unemployment and the task force was established as a result of that report.  I am a member of a Government party and it is important that I, my party and our partners in Government deal with the problem of unemployment in order to bring real meaning to these <Col N="613" /> people's lives and give them their due entitlements.  I am delighted to be part of a Government of renewal in whose programme there is a commitment to adopt new approaches to resolve the sad and endemic problem of long term unemployment.  I pay tribute to all involved in the preparation of this report.</P>
    <P>I represent the constituency of Dublin South Central, which is mainly working class, with huge housing estates in Crumlin, Walkinstown and Drimnagh. The Templeogue district is slightly more affluent, an area in which civil servants and teachers reside.  In some areas of the inner city part of the constituency there is 85 to 90 per cent unemployment. From my work as a politician I have great insight into the lives of people and I am not happy with the standard of living of many of my constituents. I hope the Government will work to raise the standard of living of these people.</P>
    <P>One may wonder why there is such high unemployment in certain parts of the country and no doubt there are different reasons.  It is important to look at some of the communities that have been devastated by unemployment. There is a common thread running through communities that have been devastated by unemployment.  In Sheriff Street in the north inner city people experience the difficulties that result from long term unemployment.  That problem did not exist in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s because Sheriff Street is near Dublin Port which was a major employer of labour from the locality.  In the south inner city in those days motor cars were assembled in the Brittan Plant on the Grand Canal, Donnelly's factory in Cork Street provided substantial employment and Keeffes, the knackers &mdash; which would not be allowed to operate today &mdash; produced glue and also gave substantial employment.  There was also a very lively and labour intensive rag trade.  When one compares what happened to the communities in and around Sheriff Street on the north side and Cork Street on the south side <Col N="614" /> one notes that these communities enjoyed high employment from local indigenous companies but the changes in the methods of production and in transporting goods from one country to another resulted in what we have inherited today, unacceptably large numbers of people without employment.</P>
    <P>In some of these areas unemployment is endemic, there are families where the father and mother never worked whose children are experiencing the same difficulty in gaining access to the workforce. The report before us tries to address these problems: it highlights the long term unemployed, the partnership areas, which are the disadvantaged areas and the programme which will be put in place in those areas.  We must address ways of creating employment in communities where employment existed in the past.  To highlight the evil in the past is to highlight the sad reality of life in these communities.</P>
    <P>Drug abuse is rampant in the inner city portion of my constituency of Dublin South Central.  I am a politician, not a sociologist, and to be unemployed does not necessarily mean that you will be a robber or a drug addict.  However, in communities where there is almost nothing but unemployment the depression, hopelessness, alienation and marginalisation of these communities leads some, sadly, into drug addiction. As a consequence the community becomes more and more a victim of circumstances. As politicians we have no way of going back to the old days, we can only go forward.  In parts of my constitutency morale is so low it cannot go any lower and the political task for us in addressing the task force on long term unemployment is to raise communities off their knees and to bring them back into the mainstream.  Depressing as the scenario is in parts of my constituency and other areas it is important to point out that there is still a very vibrant and important lifeline for politicians in how we structure our response to this crisis in the communities.  Even in communities suffering from crime, vandalism and <Col N="615" /> poverty there are incredible people ready to work with those agencies of the State who will provide a helping hand. We must grasp this nettle to give those communities the support they need to raise themselves above their present level.</P>
    <P>Very often I am criticised for being an atheist and someone who has no faith in anything except what tomorrow brings but it is impressive to work alongside the Little Sisters of the Assumption in Cork Street.  It is worth recording that those at the coal-face giving hope to people who sometimes feel that there is none are very often nuns, priests and Christian Brothers who have adapted to local conditions and work and live, eat and suffer with people in inner city flat complexes and have nothing in their lives except this burning commitment to their religious vocation to try to raise the quality of life for many of these people who are out of work and whose prospects are dim.</P>
    <P>My first political experience of the response to a social crisis was in the South Brown Street family centre, a centre run by nuns.  They were ahead of the posse in their thinking and their family centre worked miracles with its clients.  I saw the effect of programmes on women from the most disadvantaged areas who would have been intimidated by a politician, who would not have looked a politician in the eye.  Self-development courses help women to gain self-confidence.  They give people hope for the future.  The Mother McAuley Centre in Drimnagh, which is partly funded by CROSSCARE, is doing excellent work.  The number of women participating in adult education courses and schemes is admirable. There are voluntary agencies in Bluebell and Rialto which are complemented by the statutory agencies. One body which has led the way in original thinking is the City of Dublin vocational education committee.  Pearse College on Clogher Road has done marvellous outreach work in disadvantaged <Col N="616" /> communities.  As a result people are better prepared to seek employment.</P>
    <P>There is no point in reading the contents of the report on to the record.  The Government must bite the bullet and implement the recommendations in the report.  EU funding will not last forever. The Minister must look carefully at the monitoring system which will be put in place.  While thousands of people were probably gainfully employed in community employment schemes and SES schemes in the past, sadly I witnessed some schemes which did not do anything except waste people's time, effort and energy.</P>
    <P>I come from a working class family where unemployment was not a problem. I spent three years in Africa and on my return to Ireland I was unemployed for a short period.  During that time, I had the experience of drawing the dole in Werburgh Street Exchange. We all learn from our experiences.  My experience hardened, honed and prepared me as a politician and I say to the House that this report must be implemented.  We must go forward and break the cycle of poverty which is linked to the long term unemployment crisis which confronts us.  We must start tackling the problem in a serious way and help those huge sectors in society who are in a poverty trap due to their inability to obtain employment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDavern" hpid="Mr. Davern Mr. Davern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davern</NameTxt>
      <P>I empathise with Deputy Byrne.  A number of years ago we boasted that 6,000 people were employed by Guinness.  Another 400 people are to be laid off in the next few months.  That is not anyone's fault but is as a result of automation.  There were relief schemes in rural areas for many years.  Someone invented a JCB and only two people were needed to do work which required ten men previously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Smithfield market and Finglas areas I saw young people with the ability to ride horses bare back.  I was fascinated.  They had not been given any training but had a natural ability to ride. I spoke to one of the clergymen Deputy <Col N="617" /> Byrne mentioned about trying to get them to work in riding stables.  The idea was tried out but unfortunately there was no work ethic in the family concerned. The work commenced at 6 a.m. and lasted until 6 p.m. and they would not stay.  We must break the unemployment culture.  The Minister is aware that we can do that by educating not just the young but adults.</P>
    <P>Many men worked in coal mines in my constituency and would not work at anything else.  There is much rural unemployment.  I have a sneaking admiration for those who do nixers.  A man who did that was helping his family. He could not get full-time employment but he earned a few extra shillings. Perhaps it was his money for a drink, a bet on a horse or a packet of cigarettes and the rest was given to his family.  I do not condemn a person for doing that. Unfortunately others do not take that initiative.</P>
    <P>Recently a relatively young man in his thirties came to see me.  He could not pay his mortgage even though it was at the relatively cheap rate brought in by the great Fianna Fáil Government in 1989.  His repayment was £20 per week. If he were renting the house, his rent would have been higher.  He asked me where he could get £20 per week out of his unemployment benefit.  That frightened me and I suggested he should clean windows.  He was a young man who could not find a nixer to enable him pay the mortgage on his house which would be repossessed by the local authority concerned.</P>
    <P>In 1937, 2,500 people sat the leaving certificate examination and in 1954, 5,000 people sat it.  This year over 96,000 people will sit it.  There are fewer educated people unemployed.  Education is not the sole answer but it is a major contributing factor towards solving unemployment. A wider range of skills is needed for those who wish to leave school after completing the junior certificate. Last week there was a rush of people in rural areas looking for young people to drive tractors.  They could not find people with the ability to drive a <Col N="618" /> tractor.  Some young people aged 23 and 24 had not driven a machine in their lives.  They did not have the basis skill of driving a dumper on a site.  They came from families with a history of unemployment and never had an opportunity to learn any of these skills.  We need to look at the vocational education system.  Students who obtain top grades in the leaving certificate are well able to look after themselves.  The humiliation experienced by many students who cannot keep up with that level causes many of them to drop out of school at an early stage.  More practical subjects should be introduced, not only in traditional skills such as carpentry, stonemasonry and others currently being taught in vocational schools, but students should be taught a general skill which would ensure they would be useful and could easily adapt to using various types of machinery and different work, such as mixing cement and other building work, regarded as low skilled.  There are great opportunities for people with appropriate skills to gain part-time employment in those areas.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to two disincentives in the system, which apply more particularly to the short term rather than the long term unemployed.  A person with a reasonably large family who is not particularly skilled is better off today unemployed than employed earning a weekly income of less than £200.  Such people would earn only £10 per week more than the income they would receive if unemployed.  That apparent difference of £10 per week would ensure that the employed person would not be entitled to a medical card because it is means-tested on gross earnings, nor would he or she be entitled to a full rent allowance which is also calculated on gross earnings.  Such a person would also be liable for water service charges based on gross earnings, irrespective of whether he or she is brought to court for not paying them.  The Minister must address this area.  Many people want to return to full employment but cannot afford to do so.  Even if people had an extra £10 per week and paid additional <Col N="619" /> rent for their houses, if they had three or four children they could not afford not to have a medical card.  People on short and long term unemployment appreciate the value of medical cards and should be allowed to retain them until their children are over 18 years of age and past a dependency stage.  If the unemployed were guaranteed the use of a medical card on return to work, the majority of them would return to full-time employment at whatever level of pay offered.</P>
    <P>Many people on low incomes whose children caught the 'flu earlier this year found it difficult to cope.  Many of them were concerned about the expense of calling out their doctors to treat their second or third child with the same illness. They also faced chemists' bills amounting to £40 or £50.  That may not appear a large amount compared to figures mentioned in the House, but it is to somebody with only £20 a week to deal with an emergency.  That is a major problem which can lead to people not merely being depressed about their circumstances, but encourages them to take a retrograde step of returning to a position where they can enjoy the comfort afforded by a medical card, irrespective of whatever loss of dignity arises from being unemployed.  We should adopt a combined approach through education and incentive schemes to protect those who must face the challenge of returning to employment and cope with the uncertainty associated with it, particularly the long term unemployed. We must ensure that those people are protected by our system and afforded every safeguard so that they are encouraged to move forward to full-time employment and lead meaningful and useful lives.  I hope the scope of the task force which produced the interim report will be widened and will consider all the matters I raised today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TheresaAhearn" hpid="Mrs. T. Ahearn Mrs. T. Ahearn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. T. Ahearn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on our major national problem, unemployment. Unfortunately, while we debate <Col N="620" /> many issues in the House we get few opportunities to speak on the issue of most concern to us all, the reality of which we see in our constituencies.  During the past number of years while we were aware of the escalation of the problem, rarely has it reached the floor of the House except by way of reference to the monthly unemployment reports. That should not be the case.  Irrespective of what procedures exist in the House, we should have scope to debate issues of such national concern as unemployment.</P>
      <P>It is appropriate to give public representatives an opportunity to outline the realities of unemployment to Members. Deputies have given examples of people who are unemployed, the difficulties they encounter in seeking employment, the problems experienced by families and the efforts made by local communities. Those issues should be debated on the floor of the House.</P>
      <P>Like Deputy Byrne, I found the interim report interesting.  It brought home to me two important points.  It is sad to read the depressing statistics revealed in the report.  However, we did not need a report or a Central Statistics Office to realise this is the case as we are all aware of the problem in our constituencies and localities.  This report encountered the same problem as others on unemployment, it could not provide a magic solution.  All Governments must face the reality that there is no magic solution to the unemployment problem but it is helpful that the National Economic and Social Forum carried out an in-depth report on the subject.  I agree with the decision of the previous Government that a task force should have been set up to examine the recommendations of the report of the National Economic and Social Forum and to examine in depth an important part of the problem, long term unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of unemployment in the European Union is nearly 11 per cent and, sadly, the national level is almost 15 per cent, but in many constituency areas that percentage does not portray <Col N="621" /> the reality.  In some areas of my constituency the level of unemployment is over 23 per cent.  South Tipperary, like other areas, experienced an industrial downturn and employers who try to increase their workforce face continual obstacles.  As Deputy Davern said, the reality is that in many cases it does not pay people to work.</P>
    <P>I am glad I represent one of the constituencies which received good news recently with the announcement that an American company is coming to Carrick-on-Suir, an unemployment blackspot. I pay tribute to all who helped to attract that important industry which is attuned to the talents and skills of people in Carrick-on-Suir.  It is welcome that it has the potential to provide 150 jobs.  I am glad that my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Bruton, had the privilege of announcing the establishment of that industry, but that does not take from the credit due to people who, over a period of time, carried out a good deal of groundwork and perhaps entered into delicate negotiations to entice that company to come to Carrick-on-Suir. Such developments may be rare but when they happen we are always very proud.  Nonetheless, it has been bad news for many other constituencies where industries with a tradition of employing large numbers of people no longer need such a large workforce because of automation and/or different market demands.</P>
    <P>The realisation of all the implications of employment is not brought home unless one visits the unemployed in their homes.  There is no dignity in having to remain at home all day.  With unemployment comes hopelessness, despair, lack of enthusiam.  Unfortunately, it becomes almost a vicious circle.  Before being elected to this House I taught in a school where a large percentage of pupils' parents were unemployed and, sadly, I discovered almost a sense of hopelessness, an acceptance on the part of those pupils that they would continue in the same vein as their parents.  The sad fact is that unemployment in a home begets further <Col N="622" /> unemployment because of the attendant sense of hopelessness and despair.  It is only natural that children will find it difficult to believe they can succeed where their parents have not.  The vast majority of parents are placed on a pedestal by their children.</P>
    <P>An economic problem very quickly becomes a social one.  I am glad that at least we are doing something to tackle it, that it is a priority of this Government and that this report contains some very good recommendations.  It is crucial that the report is not ignored and that its recommendations are acted on immediately.  We shall never prove whether those recommendations are worthwhile without putting them into effect.</P>
    <P>This report deals with the long term unemployed only.  It is a startling and depressing reality that 49 per cent of our unemployed have not been employed for two years and it has been proved that anybody unemployed for two years or more has a 74 per cent chance of never being employed again.  That 74 per cent figure alone is an example of the damage wreaked through long term unemployment.  Unfortunately, anybody can find themselves in that category very suddenly.  Two years can pass very quickly when one waits month after month for the announcement of a new scheme, of some company locating locally or of a local employer expanding his business, writing endless letters of application and receiving letters of refusal.  Before one knows what has happened, people have drifted into long term unemployment.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the recommendations of this report endeavour to tackle this major economic and social problem.  I have already referred to the social problems within the home, the sense of hopelessness and despair which percolates beyond the home into the community. With unemployment comes ill health, poverty, crime and violence, all graphic proof of the despair felt by families in this position.  It involves not just an economic cost but a social one to local communities and the nation as a <Col N="623" /> whole.  It also has a health cost because it is not healthy, mentally or physically, to be out of work, not having the privilege of meeting people in the workplace or the dignity of earning an income for one's family.</P>
    <P>Crime and violence also stem from unemployment.  Most of us are familiar with the maxim, &ldquo;the devil makes work for idle hands&rdquo;, which unfortunately has been proved to be true.  While we may implement measures to reduce violence and crime generally, the most important objective is to give people work and a decent way of living.  Fathers and mothers want the dignity of being able to work for their family.</P>
    <P>Following the publication of the report of the National Economic and Social Forum on ending long term unemployment the then Government decided that the report should be studied by a task force with a view to advancing proposals for better targeting and more effective services for the long term unemployed.  The nature and causes of long term unemployment were studied in depth in the preparation of this report which makes depressing reading.  The first point is that our long term unemployment rate is greater than the unemployment rate in many other OECD member states.  The point is made also that the longer a person is unemployed the more difficult it will be for him or her to find employment again.</P>
    <P>It is important to investigate the age group affected most by long term unemployment, ranging between 25 and 44 years.  These are the most important years in life, when most people marry and rear children.  They are the most demanding years financially.  For example, whether a couple live in a local authority house or a private dwelling it must be furnished and maintained and facilities provided.  In addition, it is the period within which children will be attending school and, irrespective of State support, there is no such thing as absolutely free education.  The age <Col N="624" /> group most affected by long term unemployment is also that with the greatest financial demands during children's teenage years, when they should be encouraged into wanting to work, reaping not alone its financial benefits but personal satisfaction.</P>
    <P>The report demonstrates the cost of unemployment in ill health, crime, violence and poverty.  A Government must take very positive steps to meet the needs of employers and potential employees.</P>

      <P>Last night I complimented the Minister, Deputy Lowry, for getting a commitment from the EU that grant-aid of £21 million would be available for a peat-fired generating station in the midlands.  I realise that this will be put out to public tender and I would like to impress on the Minister the advantages of using the existing power station located at Rhode, County Offaly, as the site for any new peat-fired station.  I do so for the following reasons.  First, the tremendous need to retain jobs in both Bord na Móna and the ESB in the Westmeath-Offaly region, an area where the number of jobs in these industries fell by 1,500 in the past ten years.  In 1984 there were approximately 2,100 people employed by the ESB and Bord na Móna in that region.  In 1994 there were 500 people employed by those two companies.</P>
      <P>The second reason is the central location of the station with 35 million tonnes of peat available to be delivered by the existing rail network to the power station.  The third reason is the availability of a suitable site of 110 acres with infrastructure of cooling towers, workshops, boiler rooms, toilet and shower facilities, etc.  It would be a shame if those excellent facilities were bulldozed. The fourth reason is that there are power lines capable of transmitting the power generated to the user without any need for planning permission, compulsory purchase or any of the other difficulties associated with erecting new power lines.  All those are already in place serving the Rhode power station and should be utilised in any new development in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fifth reason is that there is an adequate water supply to the site. Members will be aware that to generate <Col N="626" /> power water is needed for cooling purposes and such a supply may not be available to any other site.  The sixth reason is that there is a trained staff available who have given commitments of revised staffing levels for a refurbished and extended plant at Rhode. That valuable asset should not be overlooked. The seventh reason is that there is a site where planning permission would be more likely to succeed in a reasonable timeframe than going for a green field site.  We are all aware of the difficulties associated with any major development in a green field site, particularly a power station.  Planning permission to extend the existing power station at Rhode would be provided in a much shorter timespan than for a green field site.</P>
    <P>The cash bonus of using the site of the existing power station at Rhode could be up to £30 million less than using a green field site.  At this time when the viability of the plant is in question surely it makes sense that any savings that can be made should be utilised to the full.  By using the existing site we have the potential to save £30 million to the Exchequer and it should be considered. I ask the Minister, and the Minister of State, to bear those poins in mind when the tenders for the plant are considered in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>The decision by Fianna Fáil to propose a Private Members' Motion to Dáil Éireann in respect of the Government's handling of ESB negotiations is nothing short of disgraceful. Not since the time of the late Seán Lemass has there been any serious attempt to address the issue of what the State sector is all about.  The consumers of State services and State sector employees have a common interest in ensuring quality and service for all our public services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An analysis of the sector highlights numerous similarities in the problems affecting semi-State companies such as large debts, high costs and, above all, a lack of clear guidance over the years from the shareholder, namely, the State <Col N="627" /> as to the primary purpose of the business. It is critical that at a time of great transition and change, right across the European Union, that clear leadership and guidance be given to the future direction of State companies.</P>
    <P>In just three months since assuming office the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, has decided to make our semi-State companies competitive, efficient and with the ability to hold their share of consumer support in the years ahead. He is a competent and decisive individual, not a hard man as portrayed by Fianna Fáil, who understands the need to take a business-like approach to ensure the core business of the ESB is put on a firm financial footing.  This is in sharp contrast to Fianna Fáil-led Governments who adopted a policy characterised by political patronage. Fianna Fáil has always been more concerned about who was a member or a director of the board as a means of rewarding political allegiance rather than with the proper well-being of the company.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that Deputy Brennan and Fianna Fáil have not learned any political lessons in recent times particularly when one considers they had decided to oppose this Government on every policy issue for the sake of opposition as if it was never in Government itself.  It is time Fianna Fáil woke up to commercial reality in the market place.  I am surprised that Deputy Brennan, a former Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Commerce, would not understand that reality.  The Government and the Minister, Deputy Lowry, are dealing with a difficult situation which they have inherited from successive Fianna Fáil Ministers who talked about the problems of the semi-State sector but have achieved little to bring them into line with our EU competitors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the House would not want the ESB, or any other State company, to engage in the traumatic experience which Aer Lingus had to endure.  I call on management and unions of the ESB <Col N="629" /> to continue to adopt a common sense approach such as that of the Minister to resolve the problems by mutual agreement in order that the maximum employment can be protected and the consumer can purchase electricity at the cheapest possible rate.</P>

      <P>Of all the essential services there is none that the present-day average family is more dependent on than the ESB which has responsibility for delivering power and energy to the homes of almost every family in the country.  We have learned from past experience that if there is any disruption in the supply of electricity, the entire country can be thrown into chaos.  Fortunately for a number of years we have had few disruptions and we have become used to a constant supply of electricity for industrial, commercial and domestic use.</P>
      <P>It must be the policy of every responsible Government and Minister to deliver a high quality service at the lowest price possible for the benefit of the consumer.  Low cost energy is absolutely essential if industry and business is to compete and survive; it is of tremendous advantage to the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Electricity prices have been stable for a number of years and this has been due mainly to the stabilisation of fuel prices on the international market and the strong demand for electricity.  This has been appreciated by consumers and families as any increase in the price of electricity impacts directly on their spending power.  It is disturbing, to say the least, to hear the main Opposition party advocating an increase in the price of electricity to consumers.  Does it not realise that such a price increase is a burden on families and, in particular, on <Col N="630" /> the old and infirm who use more electricity and need more heat than the average person?</P>
    <P>The Minister is to be complimented on the responsible way in which he addressed the implementation of the proposal of the Cost and Competitiveness Review.  I am particularly grateful to him for the interest he has shown in the turf generating station in Gweedore. Last November the previous Minister, Deputy Cowen, decided that 1995 would be the station's last year of operation. Naturally this came as a shock to the employees and the 140 families who have supplied turf to the station for the past 35 years.  A few weeks ago I was deeply disappointed to see an ESB advertisement in the local paper which stated that only 4,000 tonnes of turf would be accepted in the Gweedore station during the 1995 season.  This was totally against the spirit of the 1994 decision to keep the station open during the 1995 season.  I brought this advertisement to the attention of the Minister and it was subsequently withdrawn.  The least the families who have supplied turf for the past 35 years should expect during the station's last year of production is to be treated in the exact same manner as they were treated previously.  I ask the Minister and the ESB to treat the turf producers in Gweedore in the same way as they have in previous years.  In the past number of years approximately 9,000-10,000 tonnes of turf were accepted by the ESB for the generating station and the same amount should be accepted this year.</P>
    <P>Having discussed the matter with the Minister today, I am happy that there will be no forced redundancies in the station.  He informed me that he is confident the workforce can be reduced through early retirement and voluntary redundancies.  Some of the staff in the station are nearing retirement age but there are also young and middle aged staff who have financial responsibilities, mortgages and families and it would not be acceptable if they were forced to take redundancy.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="631" /> The Minister is aware of the contribution made by the ESB to the local economy of Gweedore and is conscious of the effect of the closure of the station on the economy.  I compliment him on suggesting to the ESB that a task force should be established with representatives of various interests and perhaps Údarás na Gaeltachta with the intention of supporting local development with the aid of a financial contribution of approximately £0.5 million from the ESB.  The Minister has informed me that he hopes a scheme will be devised to compensate local turf producers who have depended on the ESB for their livelihoods for the past 35 years.  These producers do not participate in a redundancy scheme and a compensation scheme should be set up to look after their interests in the years ahead.  Many of these people are middle aged and older and they will find it very difficult to obtain alternative employment.  I urge the Minister and the ESB to deal generously with these people under any compensation scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Our public enterprises are vital to the State's economic development and prosperity.  The entry into force of the EU deregulation legislation means that we stand at a cross-roads. We can move towards wholesale privatisation &mdash; the road travelled by many Fianna Fáil Deputies &mdash; or revitalise our public enterprises so as to prepare them for competition.  Alternatively, we can maintain the <i>status quo</i> and hope for the best.  If I recall correctly, this is the Fianna Fáil way. Democratic Left is not in the business <Col N="632" /> of <i>status quo</i> politics.  We recognise the vital role played by public enterprises and that the role is changing.  Our view goes far beyond the simplistic approach adopted by Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Public utilities are not simply service providers; they have a wider role to play as engines of technological and organisational innovation.  They are also the appropriate vehicles for necessary State intervention in the economy.  This is why Democratic Left remains fundamentally opposed to any dilution of the role played by public enterprises.  The State has an obligation to support and, as far as possible, to protect the position of public enterprise.  However, public enterprises also have an obligation to the State and, through it, to its citizens.</P>
      <P>For too long one social partner has been omitted from the equation, that is the consumer.  The Government is committed to the introduction of a Bill of rights for consumers to guarantee standards of service from semi-State companies. By anybody's standards, such a Bill is long overdue.  After all, it is the consumer, who has been ill served in the past, who will eventually decide the fate of our public enterprises.  Given Fianna Fáil's track record in protecting consumer interests &mdash; for example, the Telecom price increases &mdash; it is little wonder that Deputy Brennan should propose to solve the ESB's problems through the quick fix of a price hike. Will that be fine for the workers and, if so, which workers has he in mind?  Has Fianna Fáil not yet realised that workers and consumers are the same?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Public utility consumers are ordinary people &mdash; social welfare recipients, PAYE workers and small businessmen. Fianna Fáil in Government put the squeeze on these consumers for many years.  Democratic Left, together with its partners in Government, intends to ensure that public enterprises are consumer friendly.  It is ironic that Deputy Seamus Brennan should pay homage to the concept of social partnership while at the same time ignoring one social partner &mdash; the consumer &mdash; and <Col N="633" /> attempting to sow dissent between the others.</P>
    <P>The reality is rather different from the picture painted by the Deputy.  The social partners have been fully involved at every stage of the ongoing discussions and will continue to be involved.  The Government has a dual role.  As the major shareholder in the ESB, it has an obligation to represent the interests of taxpayers and consumers.  It also has an obligation to act as a facilitator, a role which has been demonstrated by the Government.  The ESB must be prepared for competition, which necessarily involves cost cutting and reorganisation, or we can stand by and watch as it is sacrificed to the pressure of market forces. It is undoubtedly easier to preserve the <i>status quo</i>, to await rather than anticipate change.  In deciding to pursue a proactive course and to prepare the ESB for inevitable competition, the Government took a courageous decision which will bear fruit in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Brennan seriously believe the ESB's problems, identified by independent consultants, can be resolved by a price hike?  I would be interested to see Deputy Brennan's calculations. How does he propose addressing excess costs estimated at £120 million per annum?  The Deputy's motion seeks to have it both ways.  He agrees the company must be positioned for the future, but condemns the Minister, Deputy Lowry, attempting to do so.  To use a term familiar to psychotherapists, Fianna Fáil is &ldquo;in denial stage&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The Irish market is small by European Union standards. Generation currently accounts for approximately half the ESB's costs and in this area the ESB is vulnerable to international competition following deregulation.</P>
      <P>I will turn now to the question of time, something which Fianna Fáil appears to believe is in ample supply. I have news for the Deputies opposite. European Union deregulation waits for no company or Government.  In seeking to focus the attention of all concerned on achieving most of the proposed rationalisation within two years, the Government has anticipated the position that lies ahead.  We all know the cost will be high, but postponing the moment of reckoning will favour neither workers nor consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In confronting the challenges of deregulation the Government recognises that the ESB cannot be viewed in isolation from potential competitors. Unless a competitive framework is established the ESB will simply disappear in the ensuing free-for-all which in the short term, would mean devastating job losses.  In the medium term, it will mean higher prices for the consumer since the law of the economic jungle will <Col N="635" /> inevitably result in a new monopoly.  In the long term, it will mean higher prices and lower standards of service for business.</P>

      <P>I thought I had heard the bizarre and unexpected in this House, but Deputy Byrne is to the right of Genghis Khan.  In all his flowery rhetoric he forgot to mention that we are talking about 2,900 redundancies.

      <P>I want to make the position clear.  In his negotiations Deputy Cowen had reached an agreement on a time limit of four to five years in which the report's recommendations would be implemented.  We all accept that difficult decisions must be made, but Deputy Byrne kaleidoscoped and encapsulated that time into two years. In the week of his party's conference, he is blithely throwing 2,900 jobs to the wolves claiming it is for Europe and competitiveness.  There is no doubt we all agree that change is necessary at the ESB.  It must be positioned for the future and work practices must be brought into line with procedures elsewhere in the electricity industry.  That is why we support in the proper timeframe the cost and competitiveness review. However, I question the logic of the proposal to shed 2,900 jobs from the ESB.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is similar to a Frederick Forsyth novel.  If it was formulated and put into print, the Deputy would not believe what he said.  At a time of very high unemployment, it does not make sense to shed jobs in commercial semi-State bodies.  Under current plans it is proposed that, with the 2,900 jobs in the ESB, Telecom Éireann should shed up to 3,000 jobs while Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna and An Post have all shed large numbers of workers.  In all, the semi-State sector has eliminated 15,000 jobs.  It is time we had a public debate in this House about the rationale of job shedding in the commercial semi-State sector.</P>
      <P>Over the last 70 years the ESB has developed and expanded and has shown great skill and expertise.  It has the capacity and desire to make an enormous contribution.  It should be unambiguously challenged to maintain and create new self-sustaining employment. It is morally, socially and economically foolish to wantonly destroy jobs if at the same time we maintain that we want to address the serious unemployment crisis and maximise employment in the short and medium term &mdash; the unemployment problem is primarily a medium term one.  Since 1980 there has been a one third fall in the number of births.  Our annual increase in the labour force, if this trend continues, will not be sufficient in ten years to meet the expansion in demand for labour.  Therefore, within a decade immigration is likely to replace emigration.  Given those demographics, destroying jobs now for a return in the next century is hardly compatible with stated intentions to increase action on unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Oireachtas has also to debate plans for public utilities.  Privatisation has not proved successful in Britain. <Col N="638" /> Daily we read, hear and see reports about what they have got out of privatisation in the UK.  They have bad delivery of service, huge wage increases for those in charge of public utilities, massive unemployment in them and a decreased level of consumer services. That is the course Deputy Eric Byrne of the Democratic Left advocated this evening, blithely talking about market forces and competitiveness, the buzz words, when what we need is a balanced approach.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that there is a political dimension to this.  The ESB group of unions met the Minister of State, Deputy Emmet Stagg the day they met the Minister Deputy Michael Lowry &mdash; one does not know what to look for from him because he changes his tune according to the script supplied to him. It is interesting that the Labour Party decided to put down a marker.  Let us add our marker to that of the Labour Party, or perhaps they could join with our caveats and worries about this matter. It is morally and socially wrong to shed 2,900 jobs and pay massive amounts of money to &ldquo;get rid of people&rdquo;.  In five, six and seven years time the same ESB and a different political master or, dare I say, mistress &mdash; it has the wrong connotation &mdash; will be demanding extra productivity and extra energy and re-employing, on contract or otherwise, many of the people whom it cost this State massive amounts of money to pay off.  We are taking the wrong route in many of the commercial semi-State companies if we choose massive unemployment without looking at the long term consequences of it.  It is time for a public debate about matters such as this in order to map out clearly where we are going.</P>
    <P>My colleague from Laoighis-Offaly, Deputy Pat Gallagher, also represents a constituency to which matters such as this are of grave importance.  The Democratic Left are now a case that cannot be recovered from when Deputy Pat Rabbitte is the banker's friend and Deputy Eric Byrne is the friend of big <Col N="639" /> business and of Europe advocates shedding jobs and has no care for the ordinary person.  There is only one party with which we can throw in out lot on this issue.  I say to the Minister of State, Deputy Emmet Stagg, to Deputy Pat Gallagher and many others that this is foolish nonsense, upsetting a well thought out, well researched and well prepared agreement already in train under a previous administration.  We walked up the aisle with the Labour Party and the nuptials were not performed, but when we were negotiating together we discussed the position of the commercial semi-State bodies, and never did we envisage dropping the four to five year plan and shedding jobs within two years like confetti after a wedding.</P>
    <P>I strongly support our spokesperson whose case is well researched and well founded.  We have, as one might say in country language, a clean pair of heels on this issue.  The previous incumbent of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications had a clear plan agreed with Labour.  When I, with Deputy seuamus Brennan and others of my party, talked with the Labour Party's three members, Deputies Quinn, Taylor and Howlin, our line on this was agreed.  Our line is not the line now being peddled by the Minister, Deputy Lowry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The ESB is one of Ireland's premier semi-State organisations. It has given unrivalled service to the people for almost 70 years.  It fulfils its statutory obligation by supplying 1.3 million customers in all parts of the country over a distribution network of almost 200,000 kilometres, with almost 10,000 staff.  Its annual gross income is close to £1 billion.  By any standards, these are phenomenal figures that put the ESB in the top league of Irish companies. The ESB has never received a State subsidy and is required by obligation to break even on its annual financial accounts.  It constantly does this and runs one of the most powerful corporate <Col N="640" /> entities in this country.  The ESB has always been innovative and has often blazed the trail, both nationally and internationally, for other Irish companies.</P>
      <P>Despite the financial obligation on the company to break even, Ireland consistently has the lowest electricity prices in Europe, much better than the European average.  This is surely an excellent statement on Irish energy policy over the years and confirms the key role played by the ESB in sustaining this policy.  The demand for energy and electricity supply is a barometer of economic growth.  This demand has levelled off from a high of almost 10 per cent in the 1970s to an average growth of 5 per cent per annum in the 1990s.</P>
      <P>The ESB is a 100 per cent State-owned company and has a monopoly on the supply and distribution of electricity. This, obviously, gives it a very protected environment in which to operate. Consequently, in the world of competition and the necessity to ensure that goods and services produced and delivered in Ireland are internationally competitive for economic growth and job creation, it is vital that the ESB should at all times recognise that it has a fundamental duty to be extremely competitive. It must, therefore, run a very efficient company.  For the past five years it has been working on and encouraging energy efficiency within the organisation and has been supported in this by successive Ministers and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past we had both the Culliton and Moriarty Task Forces which gave clear pointers when reviewing our industrial policy that it was critical to have a competitive economic environment in order to sustain job creation and underpin economic growth.  Consequently, there is no room for complacency within the ESB, within the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, or within Government. Neither is there an opportunity within Government to have a three party approach to managing either the <Col N="641" /> country or energy matters.  We must live in the real commercial world.</P>
    <P>While we must discharge our public service obligations there is a clear onus on the Government, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications and the ESB to operate in a competitive commercial environment.  Commercial enterprise will be the hallmark of future development.  We have to take cognisance of the situation in Europe where markets are being liberalised and where competition is being forced, through rapidly changing technology, at an alarming pace.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the ESB would be a competitive organisation the previous Government, of which I was proud to be a member, pioneered a cost competitive review involving the ESB management, the ESB unions and the energy division of the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications. The purpose in adopting this tripartite approach was to take full cognisance of the Culliton and Moriarty reports but, more particularly, the McKinsey report which pinpointed the need for the company to live in the real world and to reduce its cost base accordingly.  McKinsey recommended a reduction in the workforce of up to 2,900 people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is against this background that the Government must deal with the matter, not by adopting a tripartite approach but in a single-minded fashion to achieve the necessary cost reductions while ensuring that the ESB remains a major flagship corporate entity delivering to the consumer a continuous, sustainable energy supply at the cheapest possible rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is obvious that the Government is not at one on how targets should be reached and the ESB should be treated. The structure for tripartite negotiations which was so efficiently put in place by the former Minister, Deputy Cowen, <Col N="642" /> seems to have been destabilised by the Government.  On the one hand the Minister, Deputy Lowry, has made a robust statement that targets in terms of reductions in staff must be met over two years while on the other there are tensions within Government with different views being expressed by both the Labour Party and Democratic Left.</P>
    <P>The ESB unions attended separate meetings on the same day in the Department with the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, and the Minister.  Over a period of eight years I had the privilege to serve in six Government Departments and during that time there was never an occasion when deputations met a Minister and his Minister of State separately. Either the Minister and Minister of State met them individually with departmental officials or, alternatively, they met them together.  This is the only way business can be done.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have parties in Government, Ministers and Ministers of State second guessing one another and impeding progress in dealing with any matter.  This is both ludicrous and ridiculous because it creates confusion for those involved in negotiations. It seems that the Minister came out of his corner rearing to go and looking for the boxing gloves but when he turned around the Minister of State was already wearing them and shadow boxing with the other side.  This is not the way to do business and it sends a poor signal to the semi-State sector and the public at large from this three faction Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A partnership approach must be adopted in dealing with these crucial industrial and other issues within the ESB.  The failure to identify common interests will not serve the interests of either the company or the consumer. When in Government in 1987 Fianna Fáil established a social partnership and despite the best efforts of Fine Gael and others this social partnership has been <Col N="643" /> sustained over the years.  The <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> which was negotiated by Fianna Fáil pinpointed the need to introduce the concept of social partnership at plant and enterprise level and to create an ethos to ensure that the Government, employers and employees would confront the challenges of the future and that no one would have a veto on the question of change as otherwise stagnation would be inevitable in our economic development.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Minister of State are privileged to serve in a Department which has responsibility for so many State agencies which can make a key contribution in achieving economic growth and commercial co-operation on all parts of the island.  The ESB has a key role to play in this regard.  The time has come, particularly since the peace initiative was undertaken in August last year, for greater collaboration and co-operation with the various public utilities in the North of Ireland, in particular the Northern Ireland Electricity Board. The interconnector with Northern Ireland should be restored to deliver supplies from Northern Ireland to the north west.  The European Union has a duty and responsibility to underpin this type of operation and collaboration to ensure equality of opportunity on the island of Ireland, in terms of industrial development and job creation.  The ESB has a key role to play and the Department should act as a catalyst in ensuring that it fulfils this role.</P>
    <P>When in Government Fianna Fáil sowed the seeds for this co-operation and, under the leadership of the former Taoiseach, Deputy Albert Reynolds, created the climate and the environment for peace.  Many of the plans laid while Fianna Fáil was in Government should now be brought to fulfilment. As far as Fianna Fáil is concerned, the ESB is an excellent organisation which has played a key role in our economic affairs.  It has a fundamental duty to be cost competitive in the delivery of an energy and electricity <Col N="644" /> supply to the people.  It must reduce its cost base and be maintained as a major flagship industry.  The principle of social partnership which Fianna Fáil has cultivated since 1987 must be allowed to permeate the crucial negotiations currently taking place within the ESB so that the organisation, its management and staff, in co-operation with the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, can create the structures that are so vital for the supply of energy into the next millennium.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Fáiltím roimh an díospóireacht seo a bhaineann le Bord Soláthair an Leictreachais, cad tá in ann dó agus cad a tharlóidh ó thaobh phraghas na haibhléise sa tír seo.</P>
      <P>This is a timely and important debate. Neither the Fianna Fáil motion nor the Government amendment goes to the heart of the matter that must now be tackled and resolved in the interests of domestic, industrial and commercial users of electricity.  That is the reason the Progressive Democrats has tabled its amendment which cuts through the waffle in both the Government amendment and the Fianna Fáil motion and which calls on the Government to introduce genuine competition in electricity generation and supply and to accelerate the restructuring of the ESB to achieve cost efficiencies and in the meantime to withhold approval for any electricity price increase.</P>
      <P>There has been far too much foot dragging in the adoption of the essential rationalisation of the ESB's operations with their consequent cost penalty for both household, industrial and commercial electricity users.  After all, it is an ESB consultant's study, McKinsey, which has pointed out that the State owned electricity generation and distribution monopoly is carrying excessive costs of £10 million per month.  This places a major burden on all electricity users and underlines the scope for greater competitiveness in industry leading to greater job creation on the one hand and reduced electricity bills for household consumers on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> Whereas the Minister, Deputy Lowry, talked tough recently on the urgency attaching to the implementation of the rationalisation plan that is necessary to guarantee that these excessive costs will be tackled, within the past week it is obvious that he has effectively conceded ground to the ESB and his stated intention to see the rationalisation programme implemented within two years is unlikely to be realised.  Instead of giving such a definite commitment the Minister told the House last night that he wanted to achieve most of the savings required within a two year time frame.  That is a recipe for drift which will allow the excessive costs to persist beyond the two year timeframe.  This matter is of far too great an importance to the competitiveness of industry, the security of jobs in export companies and the financial welfare of every household to be allowed to drag on in this way.</P>
    <P>The Progressive Democrats Party is extremely concerned that behind all the pious platitudes uttered by the Minister about achieving economies, deregulation in electricity generation and the new deal for electricity consumers his party, Fine Gael, has effectively thrown in the towel at a political level to its partners in Government, the Labour Party.  The details of such an arrangement were spelled out clearly by me a week ago when I highlighted the extraordinary preconditions the Labour Party sought to set down in regard to the ESB when it held tentative negotiations with the Progressive Democrats in the run-up to the formation of the Government last December.</P>
    <P>During those discussions the Labour Party negotiators, who included the Minister for Finance, made it clear that the unions within the ESB would be allowed to dictate the agenda relating to the implementation of the rationalisation programme and that the political price to be paid for the eventual adoption of that programme and the necessity to shed in excess of 2,000 jobs in the process would be that the ESB would be allowed to continue to enjoy a virtual <Col N="646" /> monopoly in electricity generation notwithstanding the requirements of European Union competition law.</P>
    <P>In particular I drew attention to the Labour Party assertion that the ESB unions had been given assurances that the two new power stations would be built by the ESB at Ringsend as part of the trade-off for those unions accepting the rationalisation proposal set out in the cost and competitiveness review.</P>
    <P>What is quite extraordinary since I issued that statement is that there has been no denial whatsoever of its contents from either the Minister, Deputy Lowry, the Labour Ministers or from the ESB trade unions.  It is clear from the Minister's speech last night that there has been a total cop-out by him in terms of indicating whether this situation will actually prevail.  Indeed, when seeking to deal with the issue in the final part of his speech it is quite clear that the Minister and his advisers resorted to a scissors and paste approach because there are gaps which clearly indicate that certain paragraphs from the intended script were removed at the last minute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">

      <P>The Minister makes the ridiculous statement that what he has to consider is whether the ESB should be allowed build these two extra power stations at Poolbeg and whether they will be able to operate them as cheaply as a competitor.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats strongly believe that what the Minister should do in this context is refuse to give the ESB the go ahead for the two new power staions at Poolbeg and set in train the procedures to have an open competition for the provision of extra electricity generation and supply on a green field site. Extensions to Poolbeg can be made in later years after the electricity market has established private power producers supplying the national grid.</P>

      <P>The Minister chose to ignore the very serious allegations which I made in regard to this matter a week ago.  I repeat that if it transpires that the price of implementing the rationalisation deal and the removal of the current cost penalty of £10 million per month for Irish electricity consumers by the ESB is the complete subversion of European Union competition policy in Ireland, then undoubtedly there will be serious repercussions for both the Government and the ESB in terms of European Union competition law.  The EU is already flexing its muscles in this regard.  In his contribution last night the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>In parallel with pressing for liberalisation by means of the draft directive, the Commission has also initiated legal proceedings alleging that existing legislation in Ireland and four other member states confers exclusive rights for importing and exporting electricity contrary to the requirements of the Treaty of Rome. Ireland is defending the Commission action on the grounds that it is based on a mistaken interpretation of existing statutory provisions and that the relevant provisions in the ESB legislation do not infringe Treaty obligations.</P>
      <P>Where will we stand in the eyes of the Commission with regard to our obligations under the Internal Market if the Minister does not proceed with the requirements to open the electricity industry to competition?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that there is scope within the existing ESB operations for cost savings totalling £120 million per year, it would be highly imprudent of the Government to accede to the demand by ESB management and unions for a price increase in electricity. I welcome the Minister's statement to <Col N="648" /> the House last night that there is no question of conceding a price increase to the ESB at this stage.  Given that there is a deadline of 31 May for completion of the negotiations on the implementation of the rationalisation plan set out by the Cost and Competitiveness Review, I would also like the Government to spell out its intentions in relation to pricing policy by the ESB in the wake of such an agreement being reached.</P>
      <P>In my time as Minister for Energy, I made it known that I saw considerable merit in private sector construction, ownership and operation of new large and small generators.  Under the scheme I was considering, it would be open to any company to offer to sell power to the ESB in competition with the ESB's own generating company.  I thought it might be necessary to separate the ESB generating section from the transmission and distribution section but no decisions were made in regard to that matter.  In my view, the arbitrator would need to be a regulatory body, completely independent of the ESB.</P>
      <P>I am concerned at the Minister's reference to the power procurer function operating at clear arms-length from the rest of the ESB.  This is an extraordinary proposal that emanates from the ESB itself and is contained in its own consultant's report.  What private power company would go to the expense of preparing a tender if the adjudicator was attached to the State's own generating company with whom they would be in competition, a State company that had a monopoly in generation and supply since the foundation of the State and which would continue as the State monopoly transmission and distribution company?</P>
      <P>I am amazed that the ESB is setting this agenda.  It has a weak Minister in a rainbow coalition which depends on two left-wing parties to prop it up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

One of the speakers on the opposite side of the House seems to be about to join the Labour Party judging by her contribution and the contribution of another Deputy is very much in line with the agreed policy of the Government.  I am glad they are both close to me on that matter.</P>
      <P>In the time available to me I will reply on behalf of the Government to the key criticism made by the Opposition.  I would identify four main themes running through the Opposition attacks. The Government is condemned for damaging the CCR and for allegedly climbing down on its direct and frank communications with the ESB.  We have also been accused of a lack of clarity and muddle in our State enterprises policies with specific examples cited in relation to the ESB.  Furthermore, the Opposition portrays the Government as riven by ideological differences.  Finally, doubts have been expressed about the timescale for the CCR savings and the job losses identified as necessary by McKinsey and Company.  The summary I have given of the Opposition case against the Government does more than justice to what was, at times, a contradictory and confused attack.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, with the full support of the Government, has already set out in detail his thinking about his duty to communicate with the chairman of the ESB on matters of public policy and when the interest of the consumer is at stake.  This initiative has resulted in an accelerated clarification process of the <Col N="651" /> issues involved but this beneficial sequence of events could not be described in any way as leading to the disruption of the social partnership in the ESB.  Negotiations have already resumed and my Department will be participating in forthcoming meetings of the steering group.  The Government looks forward to a positive and successful outcome to these negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has tried to depict the Government as having no coherent strategy and showing a lack of direction in its handling of the semi-State bodies under the aegis of the Department. These criticisms are difficult to fathom, since many of the problems that have been identified precede the creation of the present Government.  The policy agreement between the three parties in Government recognises that the management of change in our State enterprises represents a formidable challenge.  The prize for the Government, if these challenges are met firmly and successfully, is that the State enterprises will be revitalised.  They will be more responsive to customer needs and the increased effectiveness in their performance will benefit the economy as a whole.</P>
    <P>In the ESB's case, the Government has a clear and coherent strategy.  We wish the ESB to be more efficient and effective by reference to the lessons to be learned from best practice performance in other utilities.  We envisage that our strong commitment to social partnership, as exemplified by our support of the CCR process, will facilitate and encourage the efforts of management and employees to strengthen the ESB, preparing it for the challenges which are bound to come from the development of a Single Market in electricity.  My Department is represented on the steering group of the CCR; it will continue to play a role calculated to assist the progress of negotiations in a positive fashion.  However, the responsibility for the detailed negotiation and implementation of change in the ESB rests, quite properly, with the management and <Col N="652" /> unions.  My Department will continue to monitor progress and give policy guidelines appropriate to the facilitation of current phases of the CCR.</P>
    <P>As the Minister has stated, the immediate short term gains for the electricity consumer and the taxpayer are expected to flow from the CCR. However, the other main plank of Government policy is our intention to modernise the electricity sector, in keeping with the best strategies on offer from other OECD countries.  We believe that the ESB should remain in public ownership, but that it should be equipped to face the challenges of competition in the new EU Internal Market in electricity.</P>
    <P>The proposals on restructuring of the electricity sector are being developed in light of the emerging position in the EU Council of Ministers.  The highly interconnected continental electricity system has particular features and problems which has led to the Commission pressing ahead with the liberalisation of the electricity market.  We believe that small isolated systems such as Ireland's require special provisions and, on that basis, we continue to press Ireland's case within the Council of Ministers.  We are also defending Commission proceedings against us regarding exclusive rights on the importing and exporting of electricity.</P>
    <P>While small isolated systems such as Ireland's have special problems which we hope will be accorded unique treatment in the proposed electricity directive, there can be no avoiding the prospect of competition in power generation. For this reason the Minister has outlined proposals on creating a new power procurement function which would be charged with purchasing all power generated.  We are hopeful that our approach will allay the concerns expressed by the IEA and others about the impartiality and independence of power procurement responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is no confusion in the Government's mind about the ESB's internal structure.  We are not departing from <Col N="653" /> the previous Government's decision of May 1993 on the internal structure of the board.  The ESB will remain a vertically integrated utility with essentially a business unit structure designed to stimulate more efficient performance, to ensure cost transparency and to respond to the wide range of consumer needs. This structure, however, has to be adjusted to take account of concerns that the power procurement function must operate equitably and impartially in the new market place.</P>
    <P>The Opposition has tried to create the impression of ideological differences in the Government's ranks.  I assure the Deputies opposite that there is solidarity in the Government on our approach to the ESB and State enterprises generally.  The three parties took great care to reconcile their diverse philosophies in the Programme for Government which stresses the need to revitalise State enterprises within the framework of managed change.  All our policy initiatives in relation to the ESB since taking office are consistent with that programme.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to doubts expressed by the Opposition about a speedy timescale for the implementation of the CCR savings, and questions raised by Deputy Brennan about the underlying economics of such savings. Now that the potential for savings has been identified by McKinsey, the Government believes that no time should be lost in negotiating required changes in the ESB to accommodate the efficiencies possible.  While we recognise that negotiations are bound to be difficult, we consider that the progress made in the ESB under the umbrella of social partnership will facilitate a positive outcome.</P>
    <P>As to the economics of achieving savings in the ESB and the anxieties about job losses, there is no doubt that there are painful choices to be made. However, if the ESB can be made more efficient in a short timeframe, the payback for its internal finances will be a speedy one.  The Government also believes that the savings achieved in the <Col N="654" /> ESB will result in benefits to the wider economy, which, as a recent ESRI study suggested, should manifest themselves in increased long term employment.</P>
    <P>I suspect that Deputy Brennan is uncomfortable with some of his arguments regarding the achievement of savings in the ESB.  Is the Deputy suggesting that the price of electricity should be allowed to rise with the attendant adverse effect on householders, social welfare recipients and the business community?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">

    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Mr. Stagg Mr. Stagg">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Stagg</NameTxt>
      <P>Would any sensible politician not side with those intent on bringing about managed change in the ESB which will result in gains for the consumer and the wider economy and strengthen the medium and long term prospects for the company?  I am sure that consumer interests find it difficult to understand Deputy Brennan's doubts about the economics of cost savings in the ESB when the consequences of a failure to act firmly and quickly could push up the price of electricity.  It is Deputy Brennan who needs to re-examine his economic philosophy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan's motion has failed to dent the Government's solidarity.  In this Government, partners are treated as equals.  The Minister, Deputy Lowry, and I work as a team in our Department and will continue to do so.  We face difficult challenges in the ESB and elsewhere but we have the determination and policies to surmount them.  The Government's amendment reflects a commitment to the interest of consumers and sustainable employment within the ESB.  Moreover, we believe that a revitalised ESB will be a key player in a modern electricity market, characterised by keenly priced electricity and a high quality service to the consumer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the unions and management of the ESB for the positive way they are facing the challenge of the inevitable changes ahead.  I commend <Col N="655" /> the Government's amendment to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatGallagher" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly) Mr. P. Gallagher (Laoighis-Offaly)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Laoighis-Offaly</i>): The motion before the House asks us to condemn the actions of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. That is playing politics with a very difficult and vital issue which was tackled by the last Government and is continuing to be tackled by this Government. The Minister, Deputy Lowry, and Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, inherited this problem and both Ministers have worked well to get to grips with it.  Far from condemning the Minister, he deserves our compliments and appreciation for coming to terms so quickly with such a difficult brief. Through his meeting last week and the meetings between the Minister of State and representatives of the ESB unions, we are moving closer to a resolution of the problem.  That was evident this week with the recommencement of the CCR negotiating process.  I understand that both sides were happy with the outcome of last week's discussions.  Such intervention is in the interest of the management, workforce and consumers.</P>
      <P>The amendment in the name of Deputy Molloy reflects the philosophy of the apostles of unbridled competition and deregulation in our neighbouring island.  In Britain the unfettered deregulation of public utilities worked against the interest of consumers and the national interest and hence there is less accountability, costs are dearer and there is lack of uniformity.  In many utilities massive numbers of jobs are being shed at workforce level while the managers of these companies award themselves huge increases.  We do not want to see that happening in this country.  I am delighted to support the Government amendment which endorses the approach of the Minister in encouraging and facilitating the achievement of efficiency, effectiveness and future employment in the ESB.  Those aims were well addressed by the Minister and Minister of State in their contributions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="656" /> The CCR process is a difficult one and I compliment everybody who had the courage to get involved in it.  I hope by May it will lead to a position whereby we will have a clearer idea of the future strategy for the ESB and electricity generation.  I sincerely hope that peat generation will continue to play a very important part in the proposed plan.  It has been the policy of successive Governments that peat should form part of the fuel mix for electricity generation.  I and people in my constituency know better than most that this policy, which was enunciated by successive Governments, has been applied with reluctance for decades by ESB management. They have neglected over a long period of years to strive for efficiency, new technology and investment in peat generation.  As a result we have seen the run-down of peat stations in the midlands. Under successive Governments representatives from my constituency have had to plead with Ministers for Energy to save particular stations.  The ESB should not have allowed the position to deteriorate to such an extent.  It should have invested in technology and kept the operation up-to-date.  We cannot change the past but we can look to the future.</P>
    <P>As a nation we developed peat technology and gave it to countries such as Finland.  With the assistance of Bord na Móna we then had to go back to those countries for the most up-to-date technology in the peat generation area.  In 1993 Bord na Móna submitted its proposal to the Government for the new 120 megawatt peat powered fire station in the midlands.  I was delighted that proposal submitted last autumn was included in the National Development Plan and that a sum of £21 million in Structural Funds under the energy sub-programme of the Community Support Framework was made available subject to the satisfactory outcome of the cost benefit analysis and socio-economic issues.  I understand it is being given very favourable consideration by the European Commission.  The Minister <Col N="657" /> recently met Commissioner Wulf-Mathies to discuss a number of outstanding concerns and I look forward to a positive outcome to the negotiations in the near future.</P>
    <P>As I wish to share my time with Deputy Broughan I will conclude on the following point.  A communication I received from a member of the ESB workforce who was very active in trying to secure the future of the company stated:</P>
    <P>The present exercise involving the Department of Energy, the ESB and the Trade Unions is unique in the history of industrial relations in Ireland. It is a new appraoch to the whole area of dealing with the rationalisation of a company the size of the ESB.</P>
    <P>The joint approach arose from a Review of Relationships conducted under the chairmanship of Peter Cassells following the strike in 1991.  The concept requires the support of all to ensure its success.  It is an opportunity for the Government, the Trade Unions and the employers to show that participation is the best way forward.</P>
    <P>That type of positive attitude is what we need to ensure the success of the ESB not the political point scoring evidenced in Deputy Brennan's motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I echo the comments made by Deputy Treacy on the ESB's fine service over 70 years in this nation. It transformed the nation perhaps more than any other organisation between 1930 and 1955.  I welcome the efforts of the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications, Deputy Lowry, and his Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, to reposition the ESB and make it more cost effective and efficient in an era of new technology and deregulation. Obviously, the Ministers have a clear duty as representatives of the shareholder to position the organisation in such a way that it can take maximum advantage of the new competition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As my colleague said, it is unfortunate that Deputy Brennan has played <Col N="658" /> politics with the future of this vital public sector industry.  I hope he does not share Deputy Molloy's outlook where EU deregulation is used as a stalking horse to try to create conditions where the public sector can be smashed and privatised and the massive economies of scale resulting from takeovers by foreign companies will ensure there will be very little competition here and we will be at the beck and call of the multinational utility.</P>
    <P>I welcome, in particular, the reassurance given the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, on transmission and distribution in the future.  The Labour Party's view is clear.  We support the efforts of the Minister in partnership through the CCR to negotiate the repositioning of the ESB to meet the challenges ahead. It is clear from the consultants' report that there are excess costs and whether the figure of £120 million is correct remains to be seen.</P>
    <P>Clearly, energy costs have a fundamental role in our industrial base.  To make progress we have to embark on a policy of repositioning the organisation. I welcome the Minister's comments on the central power procurer and also on the transmission network.</P>
    <P>The ESB's network of shops enables people to easily buy electrical appliances cheaply on hire purchase and I caution the Minister about dismantling that network.  I commend the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should reflect on his tactics.  If his objective was to accelerate the rationalisation programme, clearly he has failed.  Both sides had been making steady progress in their discussions, and had accepted the unanswerable case for a thorough change in the ESB as it prepares itself for the increased competition that will come with the Single Market.  If the Minister wanted to give a message to the ESB and the workers, there was a far more sensitive way to make the changes he hoped to make rather than through outright confrontation and megaphone diplomacy across the airwaves.</P>
      <P>Obviously, the Minister was not in tandem with the spirit of the social partnership which was well known to the previous Minister, Deputy Cowen, who was also Minister for Labour.  In this instance the Minister treated the ESB with great disdain and it is to the credit of the ESB workers that they acted responsibly in the face of extreme provocation.  They were subjected in a terrible way to a lecture from the Minister. Is it any wonder, therefore, that the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Spring, should have put the Minister on a leash with Deputy Stagg wagging his tail?  To shed 2,000 jobs within two years is a daft aspiration. Massive social consequences would follow.  This demand was made in an uncaring way, without thinking of natural wastage or waiting for the ESB workers to place their offer on the table and without taking account of the positive proposals emanating from the discussions. In short, the Minister's intervention was a monumental cock-up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We live in a competitive environment and must be prepared to look at change as a challenge rather than as a threat. To achieve this there must be Government leadership, the semi-State sector must follow a strategic management <Col N="660" /> initiative and there must be a commercial mission statement for all of these companies including the ESB.</P>
    <P>Competition is the principal agent of change in the electricity industry worldwide. Although the ESB is a fully integrated electricity business, it still enjoys a monopoly.  Industrial growth, particularly multinational investment, has been very significant in the last decade. Other countries compete with us for these investments and we must always realise that the price of electricity is one of the competitive factors in attracting industry here.  The ESB must consolidate its position as a truly international player in the electricity business.  In fairness to the ESB, it has taken a very commercial approach to cost reduction and containment in the last few years, using strict budgetary controls and cost and price targets.  Over the years, the ESB has targeted all the main cost factors in its business from the cost of money, to the cost of fuel and in particular the cost of labour.  It has reduced these costs significantly and it is almost ten years since it had a price increase. During this period, the price of electricity has been reduced on no fewer than three occasions.  The price of electricity in Ireland is now 35 per cent in real terms below what it was in 1985.</P>
    <P>Competitiveness is a long term stratey and the long term financial viability of the ESB must be preserved.  The company has no equity capital from Government or other sources and consequently the financial strength of the company is essential in order to enable development funds to be borrowed competitively in world markets.</P>
    <P>Investment in modern generating stations and distribution systems should be commensurate with this cost reduction and with efficiency in the ESB.  Ireland is a peripheral nation.  We are far removed from the markets of Europe and this creates major impediments for our competitiveness.  We must get all other elements right if we are to compete internationally and serve the huge European market of 320 million <Col N="661" /> people.  I urge the Minister to tread warily.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank those who took part in the debate.  Despite what some speakers said, it was a serious debate and one well worth having considering the scale of change involved. The Minister, Deputy Lowry, is very upset with me.  In his angry reaction to my few words last night he was obviously upset at having to dance to the Labour tune on the ESB talks.  His very angry speech showed the depth of his hurt at having to back down and adopt a social partnership approach to the negotiations.</P>
      <P>He accused me of being an ineffectual member of the Government during my term of office at the Department of Tourism, Transport and Communications as it was then.  That is simply political rhetoric.  During my term I was one of the first Ministers to address the emerging difficulties at Aer Lingus.  I took substantial action on an array of other semi-State companies, including CIE, An Post, Telecom Éireann.  RTE and others.  My record of action stands. I recall disposing of the B &amp; I ferry company successfully, establishing the Irish aviation authority and taking dozens of other initiatives.  At the end of the Minister's term of office I will be quite happy to compare his list of action taken with my record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has accused me of playing politics with the ESB.  He needs to be reminded that it was not I who interfered with the ESB but it was his undue interference with that letter, as he sped off to the United States, which led to the unions withdrawing from the talks. To accuse me of playing politics is totally contradictory.  The Labour Party rowed in and further politicised the talks.  The Minister was forced to back down from the position he took in his letter to the ESB chairman which, in unambiguous terms, stated that the £120 million cost savings were to be achieved over two years.  After the Labour Party dictated policy the Minister had to water down his unrealistic demands but <Col N="662" /> in the process he created a dangerous misunderstanding at the ESB as he appears to have told the unions one thing when he met them, accompanied by the Labour Minister of State, Deputy Stagg and gave the ESB management a slightly different version, or so I understand from briefings I have had.</P>
    <P>The Minister appears to be confused about the proposed price mechanism for the ESB.  One day he appears to say it will be approved once cost savings are achieved.  I have the references for that. Another day he says it will be approved when the cost savings are implemented. Which is it?  This confusion is not helping the ESB but damaging its reputation. The Minister has presented the company as something of a burden, as if it is badly run.  At one stage he talked about &ldquo;turning around&rdquo; the ESB as if it was a company in distress.  He has presented it as a company that is falling apart.  It is not.  However, his speech last night shows him to be inconsistent.  He decided to change his tune and decided it was a sound company financially when a few days before it needed &ldquo;turning around&rdquo;.  He claimed it would have no problem borrowing the £250 million necessary to fund the 2,900 redundancies proposed over two years.  Which is it &mdash; a company that needs turning around or one that is so financially sound that it is able to borrow £250 million?  We cannot have both stories.  Which one represents the true position?</P>
    <P>The ESB must find £650 million to refurbish its network.  This high level of capital expenditure is not normal as the Minister claimed it was.  It is deferred capital expenditure.  The ESB already has large borrowings.  The Minister presents borrowing money as the way to solve the problems.  He knows better than I that that is financially irresponsible. He stated clearly that the £250 million will be found from some internal resources and through borrowing.  He proposes to borrow the money to pay for the redundancies.  It is unwise for the ESB to borrow this money and to try to do so over two years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> The scale of change proposed is enormous and to try to do it in two years would have been totally unrealistic. That is why I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, for hauling the Fine Gael monster off our backs.  The Government must explain if it is sensible to axe 2,900 jobs at a cost of £250 million.  If there is £250 million to spare, is that the best way to spend it at this time?  Will some or all of these people be re-employed if there is an increase in electricity or if the ESB expands, as it proposes to do, into telecommunications, retailing, new contracts and general expansion work?</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be very confused about how the difficulties arose in the first place.  At one stage he said that, following his intervention, the talks were back on course.  The talks were on course until the Minister intervened and meddled in the process so he does not deserve our thanks for getting them back on course.  He took them off course with his dangerous letter to the ESB chairman.  It was a dangerous exercise. The Minister did not climb down but thankfully was hauled down by a rather sensible Labour Party on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister also claimed in his defensive comments last night that his Department has no direct role in the ESB talks about change.  His Department is represented on a tripartite committee that monitors progress on the talks.  What did he mean when he said he had no direct role in the changes taking place in the ESB?  If he has no direct role, why did he write to the chairman? Is he suggesting that the talks are not a tripartite process but a matter for the Minister of the day because he reserves his right to intervene?  The ESB talks should not have come off the rails and there is no doubt but that the Minister pushed them off single handedly.  His undue interference has resulted in a politicisation of the ESB.  It was not my motion which politicised it but the Minister's letter in which he suggested that <Col N="664" /> unrealistic things should happen over a two years period.</P>
    <P>The story is clear: the Minister was forced to climb down by his coalition colleagues.  Last night I called on the Minister to tell the House why the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg, met the ESB unions before he did and why he was at the Minister's meeting with the ESB unions.  What was the role of the Labour Party last week in the ESB negotiations?  Is there any connection between the Minister of State, Deputy Stagg's replacement on Kildare County Council and the policy of the Labour Party in regard to the ESB at present? The House needs an answer to these questions.</P>

I reiterate my fears that the Minister appears to be set on a course of dismantling the ESB to which Fianna Fáil is opposed.  Our policy is clear.  We believe in the introduction of gradual competition in generation in keeping with EU requirements. The Minister needs to clarify if all his comments on the ESB represent a negotiating position.  He should tell us if the Labour Party agrees with his timeframe. Has it been discussed at Cabinet or is it just the Minister's policy?  Why is there deafening silence from Democratic Left who usually, at the prospect of 2,900 redundancies, would be apoplectic and up in arms?  It is clear that there are serious ideological fault lines in the <Col N="665" /> Government and the earthquake cannot be too far away.</P>

      <P>Three Dublin north city partnerships &mdash; Ballymun, Finglas and Northside, with the unanimous support of the elected members of Dublin City Council, have joined to express concern in a single voice for the unemployed and youth of the north city areas of Dublin.  The three partnerships have already shown outstanding leadership in developing an imaginative strategy for the north city by capitalising on Dublin Airport and the facilities in its hinterland.</P>
      <P>With the support of European Union urban funding they could further stimulate further development by the use of seed money on readymade factories for incoming companies and local enterprise.  North city areas are starved of investment in local amenities and do not benefit from the special tax designated status of the inner city.</P>
      <P>The partnerships plan to use some of the European Union urban funding to upgrade the town centre of Ballymun and the shopping centre in Darndale.  In the Darndale-Belcamp area &mdash; under the EU Urban Initiative &mdash; they propose to refurbish the Darndale Tenants' and Residents' Association offices to provide office space for groups with associated activities, to refurbish the existing youth services premises so that training programmes can be developed, to expand the Mustard Seed Development Centre to enable them to provide pre-employment training for local men and women and to develop and expand the shopping centre in Darndale, which needs to attract further basic services such as a doctor, chemist and much-needed post office.  Darndale also needs a community park with outdoor sports facilities since its particularly large child population needs a purpose-built community play centre to provide a greater service for children and run parenting skills courses for parents with very young children.</P>
      <P>The Northside Partnership has now been extended to Kilbarrack, Raheny, Donaghmede and Baldoyle and in the past two years has helped over 1,000 people to get jobs.  They have earned the right to be heard and to have their recommendations carefully considered by Government in the selection of the Dublin area to benefit from the EU Urban Initiative.</P>

      <P>As leader of Dublin City Council, I was proud to secure the <Col N="669" /> support of all my colleagues in having the north side &mdash; Coolock, Finglas and Ballymun &mdash; selected for the new EU Urban Initiative, modelled on the Leader programme applicable to urban areas with a population in excess of 100,000.  Since Dublin city represents one-seventh of our total population, it was felt this was the best recommendation for submission to Brussels.</P>
      <P>It was felt the north side of Dublin city should be designated as an urban area under this initiative for the following reasons.  First, the Darndale Resource Centre and Darndale-Belcamp initiative made an excellent, brillantly researched submission deserving careful consideration.  Second, the levels of long term unemployment and social deprivation on the north side of the city are unparalleled in any of our other urban regions with a similar population. For example, in several parishes represented by the three partnerships involved, unemployment stands between 45 and 75 per cent, with accompanying problems of social deprivation, such as joyriding and drug abuse, further exacerbating them.  Third, the physical environment of these north side districts, especially with their thousands of flats and maisonettes, renders it almost impossible to maintain or develop a good social infrastructure, as a certain number of residents are transient.</P>
      <P>Despite the outstanding work of the three partnership companies involved the area in question is the most underfunded in terms of EU, Structural and support funding.  In the last period of EU Structural Funds Dublin city received less than 75 per cent of its per capita share of national funds.</P>
      <P>I campaigned in Cork city last summer for our Labour Party candidate.  I understand the needs of Cork's north side.  I also understand the needs of the Clondalkin-Tallaght area.  At this juncture I wonder if the most reasonable resolution would be if the three areas under consideration, were put forward for full Urban funding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Carey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying on behalf of the Minister of State who is in Brussels.  I thank Deputy Broughan and Deputy Sean Kenny for raising this important matter.</P>
      <P>Urban is a European Union initiative intended to help find solutions to the serious social problems in many depressed urban areas.  It will provide support for schemes for economic and social revitalisation, the renovation of facilities and infrastructures and environmental improvement.  It is intended for areas within cities which have a population of more than 100,000, preferably in Objective I regions and sufering from high rates of unemployment, a decaying urban fabric, poor housing and a lack of social facilities.</P>
      <P>Priority will be given to integrated innovative programmes which have a demonstrable added value and help create local employment.  In exceptional circumstances, smaller cities could be taken into account.  It is expected that 15.5 million ECU or approximately £12.5 million will be available to Ireland under the initiative in the period up to 1999.</P>
      <P>The Department of the Taoiseach has responsibility for Urban because of the close links between the process and the objectives of the initiative and those of the local urban and rural development programme.</P>
      <P>Proposals for inclusion in the Urban application were received from the cities of Dublin, Cork, Galway and Limerick in September 1994.  While all the cities did not meet the strict population criteria, the intention was to give maximum opportunity to interested groups and organisations.  Some 44 applications were received from local authorities, other organisations, community groups and individuals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The application of the initiative in Ireland has been under discussion with the European Commission since the latter part of last year.  These discussions will be progressed as quickly as possible in order to finalise the areas in which we <Col N="671" /> will participate.  Discussions will continue with the Commission and I hope the issue can be finalised in the near future.  As this is an EU initiative, the final decision rests with the Commission.</P>

In any event funding will be available for the areas of Ballymun, Finglas, Coolock, and Darndale-Kilbarrack through the local urban rural development programme. Since Deputy Broughan made a proposal I will bring this information to the attention of the Minister and ask him to consider it favourably.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for coming in to respond to the debate.  I hope he will not read a standard reply written prior to my putting the case and that he will listen to what I have to say.</P>
      <P>For the past ten years ever since former Deputy Barry Desmond was Minister for Health I raised this case with every single Minister for Health.  It concerns a young man in Galway about 24 or 25 years of age whose mother and all his family believe that the three-in-one injection is the cause of his mental and physical retardation.  His mother has campaigned during the past 11 years, without making any real progress, to establish if her son is in his present condition because of the batch of vaccine administered to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She is a personal friend of Mrs. Best who fought a similar case in Cork and achieved success in the courts.  It is tragic that this case which was put before the committee of experts many <Col N="672" /> years ago has been dismissed by them and has not been reopened or properly examined at offical level.</P>
    <P>During those years little bits of information were extracted.  It has been established that a register was kept in those years.  What the lady wants is the number of the batch of the vaccine which was administered at the time her son received the three-in-one injection in Galway in early 1970 when he was about six months old.  It would have been administered on three different occasions.</P>
    <P>The Western Health Board, the Department of Health, the committee of experts, the doctor who administered it all say there are no records of Patrick's name.  Dr. O'Callaghan who administered the vaccine has written a letter &mdash; which I have here &mdash; confirming that she administered the vaccine and said that in those years families living in remote areas had the vaccine administered in the home.  If it had been administered in the clinic in Galway city it would have been included on the register.  It would have been helpful if it was established that his name was on the register but the fact that the doctor confirms that she administered it is adequate.  About 250,000 injections would have been administered out of that one batch.  The lady wants to know if the vaccine came from batch 3741.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister if his Department accepts that the whooping cough vaccination was administered to this person by Dr. O'Callaghan in early 1970 when he was about six months old.  Will he indicate whether the vaccine injected in this case came from batch 3741?  Is he aware that this person is severely physically and mentally retarded, has the intellectual capacity of a two year old and is about the size of a six year old? This is a tragic case.  His mother is convinced the reason her child is in this state is that he suffered as a result of a bad injection.  Why does the State not help this lady and inform her of the number of the batch?  The vaccine was administered in 1970, it is not that long ago.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="673" /> I appeal to the Minister to commit himself to make the resources of the State available to ensure a thorough search is undertaken to obtain the number of the batch.  That is the purpose of this question.  It has nothing to do with the register or anything else.  I have followed up all these issues over the years and progress has been slow.  If I can obtain the number of the batch we can move on from there.  A legal team is working on this case but it has been refused the information.  We have got ambiguous answers.  When asked about the batch number the reply received was:</P>
    <P>We have been in contact with Welcome Ireland Limited, suppliers of the vaccine, during the time in question. However, they have informed us that the only feasible way that information on batch numbers could be obtained is for the board to check records at individual immunisation sites.  As outlined in No. 1 above these records have been checked for the time period specified and no entry on the above named could be found.</P>
    <P>We know the time the vaccination was administered.  If he is not listed on a register so be it, but they must know the number of the batch out of which 250,000 injections were administered in Ireland at that time.  Will the Minister indicate if he will put the resources of his Department at the disposal of this family in their search to establish rights for their child who has been so badly affected by this injection?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> This is the conclusion of the expert group set up to examine this matter.  The following information answers one of the questions raised by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1993 the then Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, met the Irish <Col N="675" /> Association of Parents of Vaccine-Damaged Children to discuss issues relating primarily to the findings of the Expert Medical Group on Whooping Cough Vaccination.  Following this meeting and consultations between the Department and members of the expert medical group, the Minister agreed to release the files of the group to the people concerned. A full copy of the expert medical group's file on this person was sent to his mother in June 1993.  The documents on the file confirm that the family doctor administered the diptheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccine, the record shows that the vaccine was administered.</P>
    <P>The Minister also agreed to assist the association in obtaining medical records of individual children which were not available or may not have been used in the assessment by the group.  The health board responded that it had no information regarding the vaccine administered to this person.  This is not a simple matter.  The health board does not have the information and it cannot provide what it does not have.  The Department also wrote to the manufacturer requesting information on batch No. 3741, the vaccine batch which the Supreme Court held was liable for Kenneth Best's brain damage.  The reply from the manufacturer indicated the batch was produced around March 1968 but that, because of the passage of time, it was not possible to establish during what subsequent period it was distributed to specific parts of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <P>I am aware that this sad case has been raised by Deputy Molloy on many occasions and I am sure he will accept that everything possible has been done by successive Ministers and the Department to establish all the known facts.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I demand that the children from Swords and North County Dublin attending Fingal Community College be allowed their right to an education in decent facilities.  I want the staff of this college to be given the opportunity to teach to the maximum of their ability and the parents to know that their children are availing of their constitutional right to a proper education. I further demand that the Minister sanctions and approves the new building for Fingal Community College and that it is allowed go to tender immediately so that work can commence without delay.</P>
      <P>The college opened in September 1985 with 85 pupils from Swords and the surrounding areas.  Since 1990 a total of 550 students have completed their education in the present building.  With the present school population of 465, this gives a total of 1,100 students who have endured totally inadequate resources. The pupil-teacher ratio is 28.5:1 while the playground area is only one-tenth of an acre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="677" /> I wish to highlight the disadvantages of the present building.  There are 15 prefabs on the site, only two of the rooms in the main structure are capable of holding a class of 30 students, there are no sports facilities, no sports programme and no school grounds.  In addition the heating is totally inadequate, there is no insulation in the main building, no storage space and the corridors are only five feet wide.  This causes great pressure and stress for all concerned.  There is only one toilet for ten male staff, three cubicles for 200 girls and two cubicles for 265 boys. Fifteen classrooms are housed in prefabricated buildings which have poor ventilation and inadequate heating. There is a high noise level because of the absence of soundproofed walls and this is seriously affecting the education of the students.  Access to nine of the prefabs is by means of steps which are potentially dangerous and specialist rooms have to be used for teaching general subjects.  This effectively results in other classes being denied access to computers and video recorders.</P>
    <P>There is often a shortage of seating and desks in the rooms, remedial classes are sometimes taught in a woodwork room which is not suitable and electrical equipment and overhead projectors are stored alongside dangerous chemicals in the science room.  The severe overcrowding on the corridors where pupils must eat their lunches on wet and cold days constitutes a serious safety hazard. The assembly hall is divided by partitions into three classrooms which cannot be considered suitable for teaching while the makeshift library is situated in a converted passageway in the assembly hall.  I have already outlined the appalling toilet facilities which could be closed down if the school really pushed for it from a health point of view.</P>
    <P>The staff room is inadequate for the needs of the teachers, there is a lack of storage space and as there is space for only eight tables teachers cannot correct homework.  There are no facilities for meeting parents on an individual basis and meetings with them take place in <Col N="678" /> the public eye in the corridor.  This is an outrageous situation.  There is no career guidance room or area, no metalwork room &mdash; this subject is not taught &mdash; no PE hall, no physical education programme and no music room.</P>
    <P>I am not laying responsibility specifically on the shoulders of the Minister but this is a catalogue of shame for any Government.  County Dublin vocational education committee has brought this project to the stage where it can go to tender.  Now that the difficulties in regard to the site have been clarified, I want the tender to be approved and work to start so that the present and future pupils of Swords and North County Dublin are given their constitutional right to a decent education which we, as a civilised society, should provide.</P>

      <P>Architectural planning for the extension of 2,608 square metres has been completed.  In addition, 642 square metres of the old vocational school will be refurbished.  The estimated cost of the project is £2.6 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I requested permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment because of a reply I received to a question I tabled to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry yesterday.  I asked him when he will provide funding to deal with the environmental problems in Country Monaghan as outlined in the farm waste study financed by the 1991-93 INTERREG allocation.  The Minister's reply stated:</P>
      <P>I understand that an application has been made to the Department of Energy by private sector interests to treat farm waste on a commercial basis and to supply electricity generated from the process to the Electricity Supply Board.  Monaghan County Council, who commissioned the farm waste study referred to, are awaiting the outcome of this application before considering the matter further.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances the question of funding by my Department for the processing of farm waste does not arise at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="680" /> Monaghan County Council are not awaiting the outcome of that report. The council's technical officers are aware of the outcome since the Department of Energy issued its press release on 7 March and I informed them the application to generate farm waste, namely, poultry litter, mushroom waste and compost, was unsuccessful.  This was a great disappointment to the people in County Monaghan where there is also a serious problem with pig slurry.  The farm waste study clearly demonstrates that it could be difficult to maintain the present level of production, not to mention the proposed expansions unless a system for recycling waste is put in place.</P>
    <P>The Department of Energy and the ESB initiated an alternative energy requirement competition last year for the provisions of 75 megawatts with a breakdown of 30 megawatts for windfarm, 20 for combined heat and power, 15 for biomas waste and 10 for small scale hydro schemes.  As a result of the competition announced on 7 March, 34 proposals were selected to be offered power purchase agreements, but the Monaghan application was unsuccessful. The breakdown is interesting, it included ten windfarm, eight combined heat and power from hospitals, Guinness, McArdles and the breweries, five liquified fossil gas from Wimpey dumps and landfills and one waste 150 kilowatt.</P>
    <P>I could not understand why Monaghan County Council's application was unsuccessful, but in reply to a question to the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications which I tabled today, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The sole criterion for the selection of projects in the alternative energy requirement competition was the amount of grant requested by project applicants per unit of electricity output. There was no scope in the scheme to take into account other issues such as local environmental benefits, job creation potential nor the origin of project proposals.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> That is disgraceful for an area that provides more jobs <i>per capita</i> in the food processing sector than any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>I do not blame this Minister any more than other Ministers.  In recent years there has been a complete breakdown in communications between the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Transport, Energy and Communications, Tourism and Trade and the Environment who, from a tourism point of view, should have an interest in dealing with excessive levels of farm waste. A Teagasc report clearly indicated a serious difficulty in this area.  It is disgraceful that companies such as Wimpey and Guinness are considered more important than areas of Monaghan that are suffering serious environmental problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiamhBhreathnach" hpid="Ms Bhreathnach Ms Bhreathnach">
      <NameTxt>Ms Bhreathnach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to the debate on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  The County Monaghan farm waste study which was commissioned by Monaghan County Council was carried out by Teagasc.  The report with recommendations was officially launched in April 1994.  The study's recommendations cover a range of issues, the implementation of which fall to be considered, as appropriate, by the Departments and State Bodies concerned, by Monaghan County Council, and by the waste producers. The recommendations included a feasibility study to evaluate possibilities for a centralised agricultural waste processing facility, environmental targets for water quality and phosphorous surpluses, waste management and nutrient management planning on farms, upgrade waste management facilities on farms, a unified approach from mushroom industry to management of spent compost, and a survey of soils and landscapes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Monaghan County Council sought funding to carry out a feasibility study for a centralised waste processing utility in County Monaghan.  The estimated cost is £100,000 to £200,000.  Under INTERREG II &mdash; recently approved &mdash;<Col N="682" /> an allocation of some £50,000 has been earmarked for this study.</P>
    <P>Regarding agriculture, the Government is conscious of the need to tackle this source of pollution and the main measures being used are the rural environment protection scheme, part of CAP reform which provides grant-aid to farmers for implementing environmentally friendly farming practices &mdash; the scheme includes waste management planning and limits on the application of nitrogen and phosphorous in the interest of improving water quality; a scheme of investment aid for the control of farm pollution &mdash; this involves provision of waste storage facilities and fodder storage facilities and includes waste disposal conditions restricting spreading of waste between 1 November and 31 January and the emptying of storage tanks by 31 October each year; and a code of good agricultural practice is being prepared which will be circulated to all farmers later this year. A composting organic fertiliser processing plant in County Monaghan was opened in October 1994.  This project uses poultry manure to produce a fertiliser used by a number of golf clubs and municipal authorities in the UK.  It obtained financial assistance from INTERREG, Forbairt and Enterprise Equity.  Under this Department's Operational Programme for Agriculture, Rural Development and Forestry 1994-99, the processing of farm waste could be considered on a pilot basis in order to assess the feasibility of establishing waste treatment facilities on a commercial scale.</P>
    <P>In June and July 1994, the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications introduced a scheme for the use of non-fossil fuels, including recycled wastes, in electricity generation and I understand that Monaghan County Council made an outline application to the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications to supply electricity to the ESB.  Soon afterwards, an alternative proposal to treat the waste on a commercial basis and supply electricity to the ESB came from the <Col N="683" /> private sector.  When the county council became aware of this proposal, which appeared somewhat less complex and more profitable than their own, they withdrew their outline application and informed the ESB of the position.</P>
    <P>I understand that Monaghan County <Col N="684" /> Council still awaits a reply regarding the success, or otherwise, of the private sector application.  Accordingly, the question of funding this project by the Department does not arise at this time.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 March 1995.</P>

      <P>The conclusions of the recent G7 ministerial conference in relation to the information society programme, do not, of themselves, give rise to a requirement for implementing legislation since Ireland is not a member of the group. However, to the extent that any new consensus on this agenda may emerge in the European Union, I will of course legislate as required.  I will continue to monitor developments in this regard.</P>
      <P>I welcome the increased urgency in meeting the challenges raised at the recent G7 meeting.  In particular, I support the early development of the global information society, recognising the benefits this will bring to individual consumers, as well as to the broader Irish economy.  In particular, I welcome the significant growth the developing information society will bring to the Irish telecommunications sector, by expanding the number of everyday uses of the underlying infrastructures.  It is widely recognised that improvements in the number and quality of telecommunications services benefit business and boost economic growth.  Linking Ireland to the global marketplace, via advanced telecommunications networks, will counteract the disadvantage of our peripheral location.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 20, 22 and 35 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of the alternative energy requirement scheme were announced by me on 7 March 1995.  I authorised the ESB to offer power purchase agreements in respect of 34 projects, totalling <Col N="515" /> 111 megawatts of electricity-generating capacity using alternative energy sources.  This includes 10 wind farm projects with a total capacity of 73 mega watts.</P>
    <P>The scheme was set against the policy background of developing our indigenous energy sources, diversifying our energy supply sources and contributing to the strategy of limiting carbon dioxide emissions.  Electricity production from windpower and other non-fossil fuel sources will result in a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions where such production replaces electricity production from fossil fuels.  Assuming that all of the windpower projects proceed, it is estimated that their annual electricity output would avoid the emission of approximately 180,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide, compared with corresponding output from oil-fired plant.  However, it must be recognised that the cost of electricity generation from alternative energy is higher at present than that from fossil fuels and there may be environmental impacts associated with alternative energy projects.  Such impacts may be assessed as part of the normal planning process, to which the projects are subject.  As regards costs, further technological development, together with greater operating experience may bring alternative energy costs down towards the cost of fossil fuels. However, it is not possible to accurately predict these trends nor trends in future fossil fuel prices.</P>
    <P>The sole criterion for the selection of projects in the alternative energy requirement competition was the amount of grant requested by project applicants per unit of electricity output. There was no scope in the scheme to take into account other issues such as local environmental benefits, job creation potential or the origin of project proposers.  However, it is not true to say that the scheme has failed to encourage Irish jobs and investment. Irish participants are associated with many of the projects and there will be <Col N="516" /> further opportunities for Irish participation at the construction phase.  Furthermore, this scheme was a first step in the development of opportunities for alternative energy and the experience gained by Irish participants will be of benefit for the future.</P>
    <P>A review of strategy in relation to the development of alternative energy sources in the light of the experience of the alternative energy requirement scheme is now under way.  This review will include an examination of appropriate criteria for the selection of projects. Following completion of this review I intend to announce new targets for alternative energy development by the end of this year.</P>
    <P>While biomass projects did not succeed under the recent scheme I was impressed by the potential of biomass to make a contribution to energy supply while, at the same time, solving environmental problems and creating jobs. Therefore, I will be bringing forward a special scheme for biomass as soon as possible.  When the arrangements are finalised in the coming months, I will make a further announcement.</P>
    <P>Until these new schemes are announced there is no provision for the ESB to accommodate unsolicited requests for grid connection and power purchase agreements.  However, arrangements for such requests are being considered in the context of ESB restructuring, as part of overall arrangements for the procurement of independently-produced electricity.</P>
    <P>The annual output of the Bellacorrick wind farm since commencement of operations in 1992 is as follows: 1992, 4.9 gigawatt hours &mdash; million kilowatt hours; 1993, 15.8 gigawatt hours and 1994, 18.7 gigawatt hours.</P>
    <P>The average annual cost per unit is a commercial contractual matter between the wind farm and the ESB.</P>

      <P>Detailed studies have shown that a link with the United Kingdom mainland is technically feasible.  However, an economic feasibility study of the project has indicated that, in order to underpin the project economics, significant grant-aid would be required.  Studies indicate that for the project risks to be acceptable, external funding in the order of 50 per cent would be required.  It is unlikely at this stage that the project could proceed in the absence of such funding.</P>
      <P>However, with the recommissioning of the North-South interconnector, interconnection between Great Britain and Northern Ireland will result in the ESB network being connected with the greater United Kingdom/European interconnected grid.</P>
      <P>This could increase competition in the electricity supply industry in Ireland and open up opportunities for the ESB to compete in the United Kingdom. However, given the size of the proposed Northern Ireland-Scotland interconnector &mdash; 250 megawatts &mdash; the extent of any such trading would be limited.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 15 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>The Kinsale Head and associated Ballycotton gas fields are expected to be depleted in the next five years or so.  It is difficult to be precise as regards the depletion date as that depends not only on the amount of gas reserves remaining in the reservoirs and how much can be technically produced but also on the economics of producing and selling the gas.</P>
      <P>To provide gas supplies when Kinsale Head/Ballycotton are depleted and to provide an alternative supply in the event of any disruption of that source prior to depletion, Bord Gáis Éireann has provided a gas interconnector between Ireland and the United Kingdom.  In the event of further indigenous gas supplies being discovered, the interconnector can be used to export any gas surplus to our requirements.</P>
      <P>From late 1996 it is expected that Bord Gáis Éireann will have to import some of its gas requirements through the new pipeline as the Kinsale Head/Ballycotton supplies will be decreasing from that date.  According as the Kinsale Head/Ballycotton fields decline there will be an incremental increase in gas flows through the new pipeline each year from 1996.</P>
      <P>The interconnector is also designed to provide infrastructure for the development of the gas industry.  In addition, in line with Government policy, BGE will facilitate gas producers in the Irish offshore.</P>
      <P>The pipeline part of the interconnector project was completed and commissioned by BGE in December 1993. The compressor station in Scotland is mechanically complete and commissioning is excepted to be completed by 31 May 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since December 1993 small volumes of gas have been transported through <Col N="519" /> the pipeline.  In addition, the pipeline has provided security of supply facilities to protect BGE's core market of 230,000 customers should there be an interruption in supplies of gas from Marathon at Kinsale Head/Ballycotton.</P>
    <P>The estimated final cost of the interconnector project will be within the approved budget of £287 million, of which £91 million will be provided by the European Union by way of grant from the REGEN initiative.</P>
    <P>The price of gas moves in line with world energy prices.  Gas will have to remain competitive with other fuels, otherwise it will lose its market share.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the results of the Dublin Chamber of Commerce survey which <Col N="520" /> covered the week 13-17 February 1995. I dealt with the substantive issues arising from this in my reply to Deputy Callely of 21 February 1995.</P>
    <P>Since that date, I have met with the chairman and chief executive of An Post and emphasised the priority I attached to improving the quality of delivery service in the Dublin business areas, including Dublin 6.  The chief executive informed me that extra staff and vehicles have already been deployed in the Dublin business areas in order to improve the time of delivery for customers. Further discussions regarding specific proposals for each Dublin business area will take place this week between the company and the union representing the staff working in the delivery offices serving the Dublin business areas.  Both the company and the union fully understand the urgency of improving the time of delivery for business customers and fully agree that customers' needs must be met.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that there were specific problems in the Dublin 6 area last week.  I also expressed my concern to the chairman and chief executive about these difficulties.  An Post informed me that they drafted in 30 extra staff to the Dublin 6 area on 22 March 1995 and all the backlog in mail there has now been cleared.</P>

      <P>The Gweedore generation station commissioned in 1958 had by 1994 exceeded its design life by 11 years.  As a result of this, dwindling turf supplies and the high cost per unit of electricity the then <Col N="521" /> Government in November 1992, decided that an orderly wind down of the station should go ahead.</P>
      <P>In accordance with a commitment already given the station will continue to operate until the end of this year. Turf suppliers, workers, unions and management are aware of the situation and the chief executive of ESB has given an undertaking that there will be no forced redundancies.</P>
      <P>In addition, the ESB intend to put in place a strategy for local community development which would include compensation for local private turf cutters as well as enterprise options for the wider community.

      <P>I recognise the strategic national value of the seabed area under Irish jurisdiction and am anxious that offshore geological mapping of the total area be undertaken by the Geological Survey of Ireland. However, this is an enormous task and will take many years to complete.  Discussions with the Marine Institute and other interested parties are currently devoted to seeking ways of expediting this major undertaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The marine geology section of the Geological Survey has been engaged in offshore mapping for the past 20 years. <Col N="525" /> Maps of the Irish Sea and the area off the south coast &mdash; as far west as the 8 degree meridian &mdash; have been published on a scale of 1:250,000.  The Galway Bay area map is currently in preparation.</P>
    <P>The future work programme of the marine geology section is set out in the survey's five-year plan 1995-99.  The main elements of this programme for the next five years are as follows: digitised data compilation covering the work of the last 20 years is being completed as a matter of urgency, in order to make data more readily available to customers; map production on the scale of 1:250,000 will target the coastal area of western Ireland &mdash; this near-shore mapping will cover only a small proportion of the national territory; studies and advisory services on offshore deposits of heavy minerals, lithothamnium, sand and gravel and engineering projects will continue and studies on geological aspects of coastal zone management will be pursured.  Details of the five-year plan are outlined in the annual report of the Geological Survey of Ireland for 1994 which was published on 22 March.  A copy of the report has been placed in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>In recent years Bord na Móna has undergone a major rationalisation process which has resulted in the workforce being reduced from 4,800 in 1987 to approximately 2,270 currently.  This was accomplished largely without serious industrial relations problems.  However, despite the considerable improvements in bringing its operations back into profit, the board continues to be in a serious financial situation because of its very high level of debt.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="526" /> At the end of its last financial year, 31 March, 1994, Bord na Móna had total net borrowings of £172 million all of it guaranteed by the State, and a negative net worth of £72.4 million.  The board engaged financial consultants to look at the financial position of the company. The consultants reported in 1993 and identified £126 million of the debt as hindering the company's intention of getting its core milled peat business move towards generating electricity at world energy prices.  I am currently in discussions with the Minister for Finance in relation to the financial structure of Bord na Móna and I will shortly be in a position to put forward proposals to Government.</P>

      <P>The Government's policy with regard to telecommunications is to have high quality telecommunications infrastructure and services available throughout the country at the most competitive possible rates.  Whether this is achieved through the use of fibre optic cable, radio or other means is, under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983, a matter for the commercial judgment of Telecom Éireann. They have informed me that there already is a significant amount of fibre optic cable and radio links installed in the Border region and that continuous upgrading is planned over the next few years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition I can advise the Deputy that the six Border counties will be included in the INTERREG Programme of the European Union under <Col N="527" /> which indicative funding of £8 million will be available for telecommunications in the Border regions.  This is subject to satisfactory proposals which comply with the conditions of INTERREG coming forward from Telecom Éireann.</P>
    <P>As part of the preparation of the submission for INTERREG, Telecom Éireann has already been in contact with a number of development agencies to discuss infrastructural requirements in the areas with a view to promoting economic activity.  Arising from these discussions a number of infrastructural projects, which include fibre optic routes for high quality transmission and diversity of routing, have been put forward for further assessment of their economic benefit and contribution to the Border regions.</P>

      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring to the European Commission proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision on the development of a trans-European airport network.</P>
      <P>This proposal provides that the trans-European airport network shall comprise airports of common interest situated within the territory of the Community which are open to commercial air traffic and which comply with certain specified criteria.  Inclusion of airports in the network is a prerequisite to enable these airports to qualify for EU funding.</P>
      <P>The proposal is at present being considered by the European Parliament and the Council's working group.</P>
      <P>Knock and Galway Airports are licensed for commercial air traffic and are listed in the Commission's proposal as part of the trans-European airport network.  This will render these airports eligible for EU funding, when the decision is adopted by the European Parliament and the Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that at the six regional airports, including Knock and Galway, the 1989-1993 peripherality programme provided for a comprehensive range of investments in facilities and the upgrading of assets at a total cost of over £21 million.  As a result of this investment, the regional airports have the capacity <Col N="529" /> to cater for significant increases in traffic volumes, which should enable these airports to make a major contribution to regional development in the areas in which they are located.</P>
    <P>While inclusion in the trans-European network will render the airports eligible for EU capital assistance, policy is being directed towards increasing traffic at these airports and further assistance for capital investment is not envisaged at the present time.</P>

      <P>There are nine airports in the State which provide scheduled air passenger services &mdash; the three State airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork, which are managed by Aer Rianta on my behalf; and the six privately owned and operated regional airports located mainly in the west.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there is a co-ordinated approach in the marketing of the State-owned airports.  As part of its management responsibility, Aer Rianta promotes traffic at Dublin and Cork Airports.  These two airports have a high volume of originating and destination traffic in their hinterlands.</P>
      <P>Shannon Airport, because of the low density population of its hinterland, does not have a significant volume of originating and destination traffic in its catchment region.  This means that the airport must be vigorously marketed abroad.  The promotion of traffic at Shannon is the responsibility of Shannon Airport Marketing, which was set up with effect from 1 October 1994 following the Report of the Shannon Traffic Development Task Force.</P>
      <P>The promotion and marketing of the regional airports is a matter for the owners of these airports.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="530" /> There are no limitations on the capacity which may be offered by airlines operating into or out of Irish airports.</P>

      <P>The capital cost will be in the region of £90 million (1993 prices) and £21 million in EU financial assistance has been sought towards the project.  At the request of the European Commission a socio-economic cost benefit analysis has been completed.  Such an analysis is standard practice for all major projects. The analysis was conducted by an independent firm of consultants, National Economic Research Associates (NERA), whose appointment was approved in advance by the EU.  The Commission has now received the full study and its formal decision on funding is expected shortly.</P>

    <P>It is Government policy to contribute <Col N="535" /> to the EU target under the Altener programme, of tripling electricity production from renewables by 2005 using 1991 figures as a base.  Under the current AER scheme, assuming that all projects proceed, the electricity generated would represent a 35 per cent increase on present production from alternative sources.</P>
    <P>At present the percentage of total ESB requirements produced by alternative energy sources is of the order of 7 per cent which compares favourably with some of the other EU member states.</P>

      <P>The continued use of peat for electricity generation is a vital element in our national emergy policy particularly for security of supply purposes.  Peat and natural gas remain our only indigenous sources of fuel and, with the projected decline in our natural gas reserves, peat could well <Col N="538" /> be the only source of indigenous fuel by the turn of the century.  The importance of peat, therefore, from a security of supply point of view, cannot be understated.</P>
      <P>My commitment to the continuation of the peat industry in this country is evidenced by my initiatives in pursuing, as a personal priority.  EU support for the proposal for the construction of a new 120MW peat fired power station. This station is crucial to the future viability of Bord na Móna.  Bord na Móna estimate that it requires minimum sales of 3 million tonnes of milled peat to the ESB to achieve viability over the coming years.  The new station will have an important role in this regard in that it will be designed to take one million tonnes of milled peat per annum.</P>
      <P>My meeting earlier this week with Commissioner Wulf-Mathies in Brussels changes decisively the prospects for an early favourable outcome to the Commission's assessment.  I am also in discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, in relation to the financial structure of Bord na Móna and I expect shortly to be in a position to put forward proposals to Government on this matter.</P>
      <P>In relation to the draft directive on the liberalisation of the EU electricity market, my Department has made our position on peat very clear to the other member states and I am confident that our views will be accommodated in the final directive.</P>

      <P>An Post's proposals for closure of 550 subpost offices contained in the company's viability plan of 1991 was referred to <Col N="539" /> consultants for a socio-economic assessment of the impact of closures on rural communities.  An Post was requested not to proceed with these proposals pending consideration of the consultants' report.  During Private Members' Business on 18 October 1994, the House was informed that the consultancy report had been overtaken by events. That is my view also.</P>
      <P>An Post's current policy, with which I agree, in relation to the closure of post offices and sub post offices is to review whether there might be reasons to consider closure when the incumbent postmaster or postmistress retires or dies.</P>
      <P>However, postmasters and postmistresses are appointed on an open ended contract and there is no upper age limit at which they must retire.  It is not therefore possible to predict the number who may resign their position in any one year.  Consequently the company cannot provide estimates for closures in the years 1995 to 1997 as requested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>When a vacancy occurs and when no family member wishes to continue to run a sub post office, An Post carries out a review of the operation.  Where the review shows that the amount of business being carried out at an office is not sufficient to give a postmaster/ postmistress a long term sustainable living, a decision may be made to close the office and transfer business to a neighbouring office, thereby improving their long term income.  In a case where there is no other post office within a reasonable distance, An Post fills the vacancy and keeps the office open, regardless of low business volume.  Three-quarters of all post offices reviewed over the past decade have, in fact, remained open.</P>

Ireland's geology together with the current price of energy makes it unlikely that geothermal energy will be developed in Ireland to any significant extent in the foreseeable future.

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that a certificate of tax-free allowances issued to the taxpayer's husband in respect of the farm early retirement scheme on 7 December 1994. The certificate which was based on his return of income for 1993-94 granted him tax-free allowances of £5,500 at Table R, 27 per cent.  However, the certificate was subsequently returned by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry indicating that it was the taxpayer rather than her husband who was in receipt of the scheme pension. Consequently, a Form 12A, application for RSI number and certificate of tax-free allowances issued to the taxpayer on 23 February 1995.

The inspector has also advised the taxpayer to forward her Form P60, certificate of pay and tax deducted, for 1994-95 after 5 April 1995 so that her liability for 1994-95 can be reviewed.  Any overded-uction of tax for 1994-95, which may have occurred, will be refunded to the taxpayer at that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick-East</i>): The accident and emergency department of Beaumont Hospital provides a 24 hour service. Because of the nature of the work, it is not possible to predict the workload of hospital accident and emergency departments at any particular time.  At all times, however, priority is accorded to those patients most in need of medical attention.  Because of the unpredictable nature of the workload which may present, it can happen that on occasion patients must be placed in temporary accommodation pending the availability of more appropriate beds.  Every effort is made to keep this practice to a minimum.</P>
      <P>All patients, whilst in the accident and emergency department, are under the care of medical and nursing staff. Every endeavour is made to make patients as comfortable as possible and this includes the provision of food to patients while they are awaiting a hospital bed.</P>
      <P>The position regarding the accident and emergency departments is monitored by my Department on an ongoing basis.  In this regard shortly after coming into office I approved a sum of £850,000 as an immediate response to recent problems experienced by the Dublin accident and emergency hospitals.  Difficulties which have arisen recently have not been caused by a shortage of acute hospital beds but are due to insufficient step-down facilities for patients who are no longer in need of acute hospital care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Beaumont Hospital there has been a number of occasions in <Col N="545" /> recent months when, owing to the accident and emergency department being particularly busy, some patients have been accommodated on trolleys for a period until a bed has become available. To counteract this, elective admissions have from time to time been cancelled. Five-day wards have been opened as seven-day wards, there has been more regular liaision with general practitioners and an action plan has been put in place to ensure that beds are made available at the earliest opportunity for patients admitted through the accident and emergency department.</P>
    <P>Beaumont Hospital was opened in November 1987 as a 600-bed hospital. The approved number of beds has since been increased to 621.  The hospital's full approved complement is in use for patient care.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy of my continuing concern that the accident and emergency hospitals in Dublin are enabled to respond effectively to the demands placed upon them and that I will continue to monitor the situation with a view to taking further action if required.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East)</i>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 50 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mammography screening involves the carrying out of mammography on a mass population basis to detect breast cancer in non symptomatic women. There has been considerable debate and discussion regarding the effectiveness of mammography screening in reducing mortality from breast cancer.  However, there is general agreement that mammography screening programmes are not effective in reducing mortality in younger women.  For this reason mammography screening programmes tend to be directed at women aged between 50-65 years.  It is essential to establish whether a reduction in the mortality rate can be achieved in Ireland.  For these reasons, my Department has been <Col N="547" /> supporting the Eccles Breast Screening Programme, which is one of a network of pilot schemes on breast cancer being carried out within the European Union.</P>
    <P>The objectives of the Eccles Breast Screening Programme are:</P>
    <P>&mdash;to evaluate the impact of mammographic screening on mortality from breast cancer among Irish women:</P>
    <P>&mdash;to document compliance with a breast screening programme in Irish women;</P>
    <P>&mdash;to compare the sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of the mammography programme with that reported internationally.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will wish to know that using age standardised data from the southern tumor registry, Ireland ranks fifth within the European Union in terms of incidence levels behind Holland, Luxembourg, Belgium and Denmark.</P>
    <P>With regard to mortality levels, provisional figures for 1993 show that, of a total number of 647 women who died from breast cancer in Ireland, 229 were aged between 45-64 years.  This represents approximately 35 per cent of the total.  While mortality from breast cancer is not separately identified in published Eurostat data, World Health Organisation statistics for 1990, based on age-standardised data, indicate that breast cancer mortality rates are lower in Ireland than in the United Kingdom or Holland.</P>
    <P>The Deputy may be aware that a National Cancer Registry was established in January 1994.  This will enable my Department to provide accurate and comprehensive statistics on national incidence and mortality levels.</P>
    <P>The <i>Government of Renewal</i> programme contains an undertaking to expand the Eccles Breast Screening Programme on a phased basis to cover those women in the high risk group nationwide.  A report on the programme's second round of screening was completed at the end of 1994 and <Col N="548" /> submitted to my Department.  This report is currently being evaluated and assessed.  I expect to be in a position to announce a decision on the phased expansion of the programme in the near future.</P>

      <P>The incidence of births of children with Down's Syndrome varies considerably both from year to year and between regions.  There is no evidence available to the Department which suggests that the incidence of such births is increasing.  However, I have asked the Department to review the current arrangements for the collection of the relevant data.</P>

      <P>All practical aspects of introducing the new leaving certificate Phase 1 syllabus, including the provision of the necessary in-career programme, were considered by a special implementation group which I set up for this purpose in 1994.  The group was chaired by the chief inspector of the Department of Education and included representatives from the joint managerial bodies, the Irish Vocational Education Association, the Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools, the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, <Col N="553" /> the Teachers' Union of Ireland and the National Parents' Council &mdash; Post-primary. The group met four times up to 28 November 1994 and its agreed first report was published on 9 December.</P>
      <P>All relevant issues, including the context of the examinations &mdash; oral, aural, practical and written &mdash; were considered by the group.  As regards the provision of the in-career programme, the report of the group indicated that the delivery of the programme should take place in the last term of the 1994-95 school year and the first term of the 1995-96 school year.</P>
      <P>At its meeting on 1 February 1995 the Advisory Committee on Post Primary In-Career, which includes representation from the Partners in Education, considered specific dates for the provision of the in-career programme.  The dates proposed by the Department were agreed by the committee.  Following this, the timetable for the programme was published to schools on 10 February 1995.</P>
      <P>It is appreciated that there are difficulties attaching to the proposed timetable; the reality is that difficulties arise with all alternatives.  It is for this reason that my Department engages in a full consultative process with the different partners.  Some small modification of the proposed timetable are being considered but it is not practicable to amend substantially the programme at this stage.  The programme has been designed to minimise overall disruption at school level, having regard to the range of activities, such as the examinations, which must be accommodated. The general question of when it is best to schedule in-career programmes is recognised as an important issue and is receiving careful study; plans for 1996 will take account of the experience this year.</P>

      <P>Under the new staffing arrangements for primary schools, teaching posts which would have been lost due to declining enrolments are being retained in the system.  This will allow the pupil teacher ratio to be reduced from 23.4:1 in September 1994 to 22.9:1 in September 1995.  It will also facilitate substantial improvements in the special education area, and in schools which are designed as disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the above improvements, there will, of course, be a number of schools where teaching posts will be no longer warranted because of declining enrolments, as a result of which the teachers concerned will be redeployed under the panel arrangements. Details of these schools on a county basis are being compiled at present in my Department, and will be forwarded to the Deputy at a very early date.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance from August 1985 to 18 May 1994.  Following investigation of his case, a deciding officer assessed him with means of £144 per week from that date, derived from the benefit of his wife's earnings from self employment.  This assessment exceeded the maximum weekly rate payable in his case and, accordingly, payment ceased from 18 May 1994.</P>
      <P>This decision was subsequently appealed by the person concerned and his means were reduced to £130 per week from 18 May 1994.  However, this decision given by the appeals officer on 12 October 1994 did not entitle him to any payment as his means still exceeded the rate applicable in his case.</P>
      <P>The person concerned reapplied for unemployment assistance on 20 December 1994 and a deciding officer assessed him with means of £130 from that date.  The means are again derived from the benefit of his wife's earnings from self-employment.  As the means exceed the maximum weekly rate payable in his case, he is not entitled to payment of unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will already be aware from the reply issued to him on 22 July 1994, to his previous inquiry in the matter, my Department is cognisant of the revision, from 1 January 1994, of the rates of commission set out in the agreement on maximum rates of remuneration for life business operated by the Irish Insurance Federation.</P>
      <P>With regard to the effect of these changes on the incomes of individual insurance intermediaries, I do not have available to me data on income levels of insurance intermediaries.  However, I believe it is reasonable to assume, from the exceedingly low level of correspondence received in my Department to this issue, that the overall incomes of insurance intermediaries were not significantly adversely affected.</P>
      <P>With regard to the question of impact on consumers, it is my understanding that the reduction in commission payments was intended to neutralise the effect on insurance premia paid by consumers of changes in the way insurance companies are taxed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that the reduction in insurance commissions, provided for <Col N="560" /> in the revision of the agreement, applied only to life assurance policies with a savings element.  Term assurance policies (i.e. pure life protection policies without any savings component) were not affected.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of increases in the cost of premia for life insurance policies from January 1994 to-date, I understand that rates of premia for term insurance have fallen over the period in question.  Rates of premia for savings policies vary, depending on the degree of risk or security chosen by the investor, so that no comparison of rates is readily available.  However, I understand that there was no discernible upward movement in these aggregate rates over the same period.</P>

      <P>Aer Rianta's core business is the management and development of the State-owned airports at Dublin, Shannon and Cork.  While the primary focus of the work of the company's board and management must continue to be on that core business, my Department has encouraged Aer Rianta to continue to seek out oportunities for alliances and business ventures involving a mix of public and private sector enterprise and finance.  Any joint ventures must of course be on a commercial basis and protect both the State's and the company's interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Rianta has concluded a number of joint ventures in Ireland.  These include a joint venture company with Campbell Bewley, viz. Aer Rianta <Col N="562" /> Bewley, which now operates the catering concession in Cork Airport.  This joint venture also operates catering outlets at both London Stansted and Southampton Airports.  In 1992 Aer Rianta established a joint venture with a US mail order firm, DM Management, to create new opportunities for the Shannon mail order operation.  In 1993 a joint venture was formed between Aer Rianta and Europarks Limited to develop a site adjacent to Cork Airport as a business park.</P>
    <P>More recently, Aer Rianta has had a substantial involvement in the development of a new company at Dublin Airport, Airport Baggage Services Limited, which provides porterage and left luggage facilities at the airport.  This project arose out of Aer Rianta's participation in the social dialogue initiative and was undertaken in conjunction with the Ballymun job centre.  The company currently employs 13 people from the Ballymun live register.</P>
    <P>Finally I would point out that Aer Rianta's joint ventures in overseas markets have in some instances generated new business for Irish suppliers and contractors.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 74 and 79 together.</P>
      <P>The Whiddy Island oil terminal has been inoperative since the tragic events surrounding the <i>Betelgeuse</i> in 1979. Since 1986, when the terminal came into State ownership, it has been managed, on a care and maintenance basis, by the Irish National Petroleum Corporation Ltd.</P>
      <P>Since 1990, part of Ireland's strategic oil reserves have been stored at Whiddy.  The Government recently decided that facilities to provide continuous access to those oil stocks should be installed.  This will involve the installation of a single point mooring (SPM) which is seen as the most cost-effective way of restoring proper loading and discharging facilities.</P>
      <P>The Government is committed to exploring opportunities for the resumption of commercial activities at the terminal by a third party.  The installation of the SPM will facilitate such a use and discussions have taken place with interested parties.  It would not be appropriate to give details of these discussions for reasons of commercial confidentiality.</P>

      <P>Reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel is carried out in the United Kingdom (Sellafield) and France (Cap la Hague).  As the Deputy is aware the British Government decided on 15 December 1993 to grant authorisation to British Nuclear Fuels to allow the THORP plant at Sellafield to operate.  THORP started operations in March 1994 after an unsuccessful High Court challenge and has been gradually increasing operations to reach full capacity over a two year period.  I am not aware of any plans in the UK or France to further expand their nuclear reprocessing facilities or plans in other EU member states to carry out nuclear fuel reprocessing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the decision of the British authorities to proceed with THORP, the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland extended its monitoring programme to take account of the plant. The results of such monitoring will be scrutinised by the RPH on an ongoing <Col N="567" /> basis and I can reassure the Deputy that the results will be communicated to the Irish public in realistic terms.  I have asked the RPH to forward the most recently available results of this monitoring to the Deputy.</P>
