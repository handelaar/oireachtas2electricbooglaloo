      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the reports in the British media and the letter from Patrick Mayhew in the morning papers, does the Taoiseach believe that the real obstacle to inclusive talks is the internal difficulties in the Tory Party and the lack of support for John Major?  There are still some difficulties to be resolved in the peace process and I ask the Taoiseach to make a statement to the House on these issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be useful if the Taoiseach made a statement on these matters.  Members on this side of the House are trying as far as possible to be totally supportive of the line being adopted by the Taoiseach but many different lines have been coming from Westminster and we have to respond to <Col N="1802" /> the various people in Northern Ireland who are interested in seeing inclusive talks get under way as quickly as possible. It would be helpful if the Taoiseach took a lead in these matters.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not particularly helpful to ask a Member of this House to speculate about the internal affairs of a party in another jurisdiction.  The expression of views on such matters is outside the proper province of Members in this jurisdiction.  However, as I repeatedly said at Question Time in reply to other questions, I pay tribute to the courage and vision of the British Prime Minister, Mr. John Major, for his input to the peace process.  I have seen much evidence of his commitment to ensuring that the peace process works.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the points made by the Taoiseach about the British Prime Minister.  We owe him a great deal of gratitude for the courage he has shown in regard to the peace process.  I wish the Taoiseach well in his important meeting today.  Will he urge Sinn Féin to use its influence with the IRA on the decommissioning of arms as a gesture to the people of Ireland, and not merely as something required by the British Government?  They owe it to the people to make a move on decommissioning arms.</P>

      <P>I wish to raise a procedural matter with the Taoiseach.  I understand that over the next number of days the Whips and various Government Ministers will be asking the Opposition to have Second Stage legislation completed in two weeks.  We want to cooperate fully in that matter.  Will the Taoiseach give us an assurance that no Bill will be completed?  The agreement is to take the Second Stage of Bills and that they be considered in Committee during July and September.  Ministers are asking the Government Whip that some of the very important Bills be put through fully.  Our understanding was that the Second Stage of Bills would be taken in the House, that they would be referred to committees and that debate would not be guillotined.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to fix the total number of Members of Dáil Éireann in pursuance of subsection 2 of Article 16.2 of the Constitution and, in pursuance of subsection 4 of the same Article, to revise the constituencies in respect of which Members are elected to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>The constitutional requirements in relation to membership of the Dáil and in relation to constituency formation may be summarised as follows: the number of Members must be fixed from time to time by law; there must be at least one Member for every 30,000 of the population and not more than one for every 20,000; the ratio between the number of Members to be elected for each constituency and the population of each constituency as ascertained at the last preceding census shall, so far as it is practicable, be the same throughout the country; the Oireachtas must revise the constituencies at least once in every 12 years with due regard to changes in distribution of the population; and the number of Members to be returned for any constituency must not be less than three.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These constitutional provisions were considered by the courts in two well known cases in 1961 &mdash; the High Court case of John O'Donovan <i>v.</i> the Attorney General, and the Supreme Court reference case relating to the Electoral (Amendment) Bill, 1961.  In neither of these cases did the courts <Col N="1808" /> quantify the precise degree of equality of representation which is required by the Constitution, although the judge in the O'Donovan case appeared to suggest that a departure of about 5 per cent from strict mathematical parity would be acceptable.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the question of equality of representation in the subsequent reference case, the Supreme Court stated that it could not lay down a figure above or below which a variation from the national average is not permitted.  The court stressed that the practical considerations which ought to be taken into account, and the weight that should be attached to them in departing from strict equality of representation, are primarily matters for the Oireachtas and should not be reviewed by the courts unless there is a &ldquo;manifest infringement&rdquo; of the relevant Article of the Constitution.  The court concluded that the test to be applied is whether the failure to maintain the ratio between the number of Members for each constituency and the population of each constituency involves such a divergence as to make it clear that the Oireachtas has not carried out the intention of the relevant constitutional provisions.</P>
    <P>In each revision of constituencies effected between 1961 and 1980 the limit of 5 per cent, suggested in the O'Donovan case, was adhered to. However, in the revisions carried out in 1980 and since, which have been based on the recommendations of independent commissions, more substantial departures from mathematical equality have been provided for.  The maximum departures in schemes recommended by previous commissions were 7.6 per cent above the national average in the Louth constituency in 1990 and 7.9 per cent below the national average in the constituency of Mayo East in 1983.</P>
    <P>The census taken in 1991 showed that in some constituencies the number of persons represented by each Dáil Member was considerably above the national average while in others it was well below that average.  In Dublin, for example, the departure from the <Col N="1809" /> national average in Dublin North was approaching 12 per cent above that average while the departure in Dublin South-Central was almost 6 per cent below.  The situation was also unsatisfactory in other parts of the country, notably in the Tipperary North and South constituencies which had departures from the national average representation per Member in the region of 9 per cent.  There were also serious disparities in Mayo, Galway and Kildare. Thus, a revision of constituencies is now mandatory under the Constitution.</P>
    <P>A constituency commission was set up by the previous Government in November 1994 to advise on this matter and its recommendations have been accepted by the Government.  The recommendations are being given effect in this Bill.  They represent a package of proposals the Oireachtas is invited to accept by passing the necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity to thank the chairman of the commission, Mr. Justice Richard Johnson, and the other members, for the way in which they did the job given to them.  Revising the constituencies is always a difficult and thankless task and, no matter what arrangement is recommended, it is certain that it will not please everyone. Nevertheless, all Members will acknowledge that the commission carried out its task in a conscientious and impartial manner and it is right that we should record our appreciation of its work.</P>
    <P>The Electoral Bill, 1994 provides for the establishment, on a statutory basis, of an independent constituency commission to prepare proposals for the revision of Dáil and European Parliament constituencies.  It provides that the commission will be set up on the publication of the census report following each census of population, with the same membership and essentially the same terms of reference as the Dáil commission which has just reported. The statutory commission will have to invite and consider submissions and report to the Ceann Comhairle on each <Col N="1810" /> occasion within six months of its establishment. The report will be laid before the Dáil and Seanad and its implementation will continue to require legislation. The debate on the Electoral Bill, 1994 will provide an opportunity to comprehensively review the experience of constituency commissions over the period of almost 20 years during which they have functioned and to consider any changes of a procedural or other kind which may be appropriate.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to comment at any length on the provisions of this Bill.  The constituencies proposed in the Schedule are precisely those recommended by the commission.  A copy of the commission's report was circulated to each Member of the Oireachtas last month, with a set of maps.  An explanatory memorandum has been circulated with the Bill and a set of maps illustrating the proposed constituencies has been deposited in the Oireachtas Library.  Smaller scale maps have also been circulated to each Member.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill, total membership of the Dáil will remain at 166 and the total number of constituencies will remain at 41.  There will not be a change in the number of different sized constituencies &mdash; there will continue to be 14 five-seater constituencies, 15 four-seaters and 12 three-seaters.  Overall, the Bill provides for changes in 21 constituencies and for an average population per Member in each constituency ranging from 6.8 per cent above the national average in the Louth constituency to almost 5.8 per cent below the national average in the Sligo-Leitrim constituency.</P>
    <P>The principal changes provided for are the reduction by one seat each in Mayo and Tipperary and the allocation of an additional seat each to Galway and Kildare.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area, there is no change in the existing allocation of 47 seats or in the number of Members to be returned for each of the existing 11 constituencies. There are boundary changes in nine constituencies, with the largest transfers of population being made to <Col N="1811" /> include all the Ballyfermot-Cherry Orchard area in the Dublin Central constituency and all the Blanchardstown area in the Dublin West constituency.</P>
    <P>The main boundary changes outside Dublin follow from the changes in seat allocations.  County Mayo will become a five-seat constituency.  Galway East, which will become a four-seater, will gain areas from Galway West, including Athenry, Craughwell, Gort, Kinvara and Clare Tuam.  There will be a transfer from the Tipperary South constituency, which is being reduced to a three-seater, to Tipperary North of an area extending from Slieveardagh in the east to Hollyford in the west.  Tipperary South will also return part of the Ballymacarby-Nire area to the Waterford constituency.  Kildare will regain the area in the east of the county which is now part of the five-seat Wicklow constituency and will be divided into two constituencies.  The three-seat Kildare North constituency will be based on Naas, Celbridge, Leixlip, Maynooth, Clane and Carbury while the three-seat Kildare South constituency will be based on Athy, Kildare and Newbridge.</P>
    <P>The other boundary changes outside Dublin comprise the transfer of the Rathvilly-Hacketstown area of County Carlow to the Wicklow constituency and the transfer of the Borlin valley from the Cork North-West constituency to Cork South-West.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Bill, the new constituencies will come into force on the next dissolution of the Dáil: they will not have effect in the pending by-election in Wicklow or any other by-election that may arise in the lifetime of the present Dáil.</P>
    <P>The constituency commission was appointed by the previous Government and its terms of reference were drawn up by it.  The Government has accepted all the commission's recommendations. Under the Constitution, the ultimate responsibility rests with the Oireachtas. In the Bill, the Government recommends that the commission's proposals should be implemented without any <Col N="1812" /> change.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

Because this is often a thankless task we rely on the independence and integrity of the commission to produce the best possible provisions having regard to its terms of reference and the constitutional requirements.</P>
      <P>Times have changed.  There was a time when the rafters and temperature would have been raised and there would have been convulsions at proposals to transgress provincial boundaries, join areas with no homogenety and parcel out constituencies as Deputies selfishly considered whether votes would be hijacked.  That was the subject of acrimonious debates.  Some Members will recall that the former Minister for Local Government, Kevin Boland, committed venial sins in the late 1960s while more serious, lethal or mortal sins were committed in 1974 &mdash; this was christened the &ldquo;Tullymander&rdquo;&mdash; aimed at keeping Fianna Fáil out of office for all time but they did not have that effect.  It is an indication that times have changed when this Bill will be enacted without much commotion.</P>
      <P>It is ironic that it was Fianna Fáil which established the electoral commission in 1977.  Following the acrimonious debates I have referred to and the desire in Fianna Fáil to try to make the other parties as pure as possible, having regard to their natural inclination to portray innocence and their historical inclinations for misdemeanour, it is ironic that it was Fianna Fáil who set the trend in terms of taking out of the hands of politicians the revision of constituencies and placing it in the independent hands of a commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not often praised for the way we do things but it is important to place <Col N="1813" /> on record that it was our party that made that change.  While I am sorry the Minister, Deputy Allen, had to deputise for the Minister for the Environment, I think Deputy Howlin will accept that we brought a repentant Labour Party to the confessional.  We had no idea that the purification process which we commenced about 20 years ago could have reached the present stage where the Labour Party is a &ldquo;sin no more&rdquo; or &ldquo;cannot do wrong&rdquo; party.  However, that is a matter for another day.</P>
    <P>There are now three new constituencies, 20 constituencies remain unchanged and changes have been made to 18 constituencies.  The tradition has been &mdash; the Government recommends this &mdash; that the Dáil accepts without change the commission's proposals. It should be borne in mind that while that has been the practice up to now constitutional provisions allow for the Oireachtas to make changes if necessary. On the basis of comments made, it may be necessary to make minor changes.  In supporting the Bill we recommend that if there is all-party agreement on minor changes they should be made.  For instance, in Tipperary a parish is divided, with one part in south Tiperary and the other in north Tipperary.  There is local agreement and, as far as I am aware, among the politicians, that all the area should be in one constituency, in this case probably in north Tipperary.</P>
    <P>I welcome to north Tipperary my old friends in Gortnohoe, Glengoole, Killenaule, Ballinure, Boherlahan and Clonoulty as well as the new areas, Donohill, Annacarty, Hollyford and Cappawhite.  We look forward to getting to know all the people in those areas in the near future.  Notwithstanding tradition and not wanting to deviate from the recommendations made by the commission it is open to the House, where there is agreement, to accept changes.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the court cases in 1961 and the necessity for equality of representation, that is, the same number of votes producing an equivalent number of seats in each area. <Col N="1814" /> Previously there was a tolerance of 16 per cent which operated in favour of sparsely populated constituencies, those with difficult terrain, and that made sense to a certain degree.  Today we must consider electoral reform in a different way.  There has been a constant shift in population to the east and coastal regions.  In many circumstances under the commission's terms of reference it is almost impossible to devise constituencies with some degree of homogeneity, allowing for the possibility of being served in a reasonably comprehensive way.</P>
    <P>We have no difficulty with the commission's proposals on the Mayo constituency, having regard to the terms of reference, constitutional requirements and change in the distribution of population. However nobody will argue that it would be satisfactory to have the entire county in one constituency, with five Deputies covering an area from Achill Island to Ballaghaderreen and from north of Clifden to the Sligo coast and north of Ballina.  The requirements of serving a constituency, attending to 17 committees of the House and, perhaps, ministerial and EU obligations, taking into account the distance that must be travelled, pose questions on how we prepare for electoral reform having regard to the constitutional and other considerations.  That is an impossible geographical entity in terms of demands on public representatives. Other constituencies, such as Galway West, have similar problems.</P>
    <P>I am not trying to use this debate to promote single seat constituencies or transferable votes.  I have no preconceived notions in this regard.  There are many strengths in the present system. There is an opportunity for all the major parties to be represented in all constituencies. There is no possibility that a Government will be formed without representation in particular regions, which is possible under single seat arrangements.  The terms of reference agreed between parties put unreasonable requirements on independent commissions in drawing up constituencies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1815" /> I had experience of the Cork North Central constituency last autumn.  In Bishopstown, south of the river, and in rural areas I met people who did not feel very comfortable in their new constituencies. Regard must be had to local feeling and attitudes in considering electoral reform.  Under the 1994 local government Bill I proposed putting the commission on a statutory basis.  I look forward to the enactment of that Bill so that there will be a permanent structure that will introduce automatic changes in the event of a change in the census of population.  In the meantime we should consider introducing flexibility in the terms of reference of the commission so that there will be a better arrangement for new constituencies in future.</P>
    <P>In all debates on electoral reform politicians make suggestions about voting at weekends and the best way to assist electors.  Will the Minister follow the approach we adopted towards reforming the electoral system to ensure a more simple and user friendly system in terms of the register of electors, the provision of better facilities for illiterate voters, the use of photographs on the ballot paper and the speeding up of the count.</P>
    <P>I am especially interested in ensuring that long drawn out counts which put tremendous strain on people are avoided.  There is no need for them when modern computerised systems are available.  There is no reason we cannot move progressively towards automated counting systems and we are making a start with a computer programme which will assist in the counting of votes.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party will be supporting the general provisions of the Bill. We would like a debate not only on major electoral reform for the future, but on increased flexibility for the commission and a much more likely outcome for homogeneity in terms of how constituencies will be drawn up.  We know from campaigning in Wicklow the extent to which people living in Kildare do not feel comfortable in the Wicklow constituency.  There are many similar <Col N="1816" /> cases around the country.  I am not condemning the work of any earlier or present commission.  The terms of reference of the commission, notwithstanding the provision of the Constitution, spancel it too much.  We should open up the debate in fairness to the public, local communities and the understanding and knowledge we have of constituencies. Where electoral candidates are changed from one area to another they do not enjoy continuity and there is no sense of purpose in terms of boundary changes. I suggest some minor amendments only in circumstances where there is agreement among parties at local level.  I hope that will be the position to ensure there will not be a party political change in any sense of the word.</P>
    <P>We will try to achieve that as amicably as possible.  I mentioned one specific area &mdash; my colleagues mentioned others &mdash; merely to indicate that we are prepared, notwithstanding the traditional acceptance by the Dáil of the commission's reports in total, to support minor agreed changes.</P>

Dá ndéanfaí é sin, fiú amháin ar phointe an-bheag ar fad, níl aon dabht ach go mbeadh an Teach seo lán de Theachtaí agus moltaí acu chun athruithe a dhéanamh.

Is maith an rud é gur ghlac an Rialtas leo agus ba chóir don Teach glacadh leo inniu.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the Progressive Democrats I welcome the introduction of the Bill.  We welcome the decision of the Government to accept the full recommendations of the commission and not to seek to make any changes.  We believe an important principle has been <Col N="1818" /> established since the revision of constituencies was handed over to an independent electoral commission, that the Dáil on each occasion has accepted the full recommendations made by previous commissions except on one occasion where the recommendations did not form the basis for any legislation.  There was a change of Government, a new commission was set up with new terms of reference and a new Bill was produced. There is no point in dwelling on that but where a commission's report has been the basis of legislation, the recommendations of the commission have been fully implemented.  That is an important principle and it should continue to be followed.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith referred to the position that obtained before the task was handed over to an independent electoral commission which makes recommendations to assist us in fulfilling our constitutional duty to revise constituencies following the taking of a census of population.  This is to ensure that we comply with the constitutional requirements which were interpreted on two occasions by the courts and that we comply with the constitutional requirement that constituencies be revised at least every 12 years.  Those obligations are being fulfilled and in that regard an independent commission and principle were established some years ago to assist the House in fulfilling the obligations of the Oireachtas.  The position prior to that was unsatisfactory and those who were Members at that time will recall the acrimonious debates each time the party in power attempted to introduce constituency revision proposals that were more beneficial to the party in power than to the Opposition. The most blatant example of this was during a Garret FitzGerald-led Government when a Labour Minister for Local Government supported a gerrymander at which I, as local government spokesperson for Fianna Fáil expressed amazement, especially as Garret Fitzgerald was on the record as condemning previous cases of gerrymandering which were minor compared with the gross <Col N="1819" /> attempt to distort the process by that Fine Gael-Labour Government.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith sought an accolade for Fianna Fáil for establishing the Electoral Commission for the revision of constituencies.  I was Minister for Local Government at a time when, following a census of population, it was deemed necessary to carry out a revision of constituencies and I was urged by Fianna Fáil members to carve up the constituencies in the manner attempted by the former Deputy Tully.  I did not undertake that task.  There was a change of Government at that time and, unfortunately, the incoming Government succeeded in such a revision of constituencies. However, I led a campaign in that regard within Fianna Fáil and recommended to Fianna Fáil supporters at an Ard-Fheis that we should abolish the system whereby parties in power could seek to alter constituency boundaries to their advantage.  The former Deputy Tully's gerrymander was based on a wrong premise and backfired on him, he did not allow for a swing in voting patterns.</P>
    <P>I am proud of my achievement in swining support at the Ard-Fheis to support my proposal and under the subsequent Jack Lynch-led Government the necessary legislation was introduced. I played a major part in ending that disgraceful practice, but my proposals did not receive general support from the parliamentary party.  Therefore, I am not sure if Deputy Smith can justify seeking an accolade.  While it may appear from the record that Fianna Fáil supported such a change, it was Fianna Fáil supporters, not the parliamentary party; who influenced the decision.  Thankfully, the time has passed when Members can put forward proposals in the House to change constituency boundaries or sit on the back benches smiling contentedly because they have influenced the Minister to introduce legislation to suit them.  We should not revert to such a system.</P>
    <P>When Pádraig Flynn was Minister for the Environment changes were made in <Col N="1820" /> County Mayo which confound the imagination but, fortunately, that matter was rectified in the commission's report. Large sections of County Galway were transferred to Mayo to maintain a six seat constituency.  Most political observers found it difficult to justify those changes but the commission's report was accepted by a Government of which I was a member.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed the Government does not propose establishing the Electoral Commission on a statutory basis because most politicians are tempted to deal with matters in a way that favours their party.  If the commission is not established on a statutory basis, a Government can adopt its proposals without taking into account the recommendations of an independent commission. Will the Minister inform the House why he has not introduced the electoral Bill that proposed the establishment on a statutory basis of a commission to review constituencies?  As that legislation was published some time ago, there is no justification for it not being introduced.  Its terms of reference were used as the basis for the commission which reported in 1995 and this legislation proposes the implementation of that commission's recommendations, but the legislation to establish a commission on a statutory basis has not been introduced.  I hope there are not ulterior motives for the delay.  The Minister stated that Bill is awaiting a Second Reading.  As it is a 1994 electoral Bill, the Government has had many opportunities to introduce it.  It could be taken on its own or in the context of a general electoral Bill proposing other important matters, which have also been put on the long finger.  I understand that Democratic Left are examining the references to payments to political parties in Part III of that Bill.  As Democratic Left is a small party I am sure proposals in that regard will be fair to all parties. The proposals in the existing Bill are unfair to small parties.  I understand Deputy De Rossa is proposing changes to the legislation to ensure fair play for all parties and I hope the Government <Col N="1821" /> will table amendments in that regard. However, that does not explain the delay in bringing forward proposals to establish the Electoral Commission on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to refer to any one of the specific proposals other than to say that my party made a submission on what we considered to be reasonable and fair, taking account of existing constituencies, the population figures in the most recent Census and all the possible practical options available to such a commission.  We note the recommendations of the Electoral Commission which are not totally in line with our suggestions.  While we would expect that, nonetheless, on this occasion, we are satisfied our suggestions were fully taken into account.  It redounds to the credit of this Electoral Commission that it has accepted suggestions and voiced its appreciation of the number of suggestions made to it by political parties, individuals and other organisations. People sometimes feel their submissions are not heeded by commissions of this type.  Therefore, it gives some satisfaction to note the attitude prevailing among the membership of that commission under the chairmanship of Mr Justice Johnson who have done a very good day's work for democracy.  It is only right that our thanks and appreciation be expressed to them all here.</P>
    <P>My party accepts the report.  We do not wish to comment on where lines should or should not be drawn.  There are obvious anomalies to which one could refer, for example, why part of County Clare should be retained in Limerick and the like, but it is adequately explained.  Anybody who considers all available options and the prevailing population figures will readily see that changes in one area will have a dramatic effect elsewhere and can change the ratio pattern of a constituency to such an extent that it can lead to a chain reaction among others. Therefore, it is the whole picture that must be examined and, looking at the recommendations of this commission, <Col N="1822" /> my party is satisfied to accept and commend them.  We are prepared to accept and support the Bill before the House. However, we shall oppose vigorously any suggestion that there be alterations. If there were to be any cosy arrangement between the larger parties to seek to amend this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The timing is important in that none of us wants anything to occur which would unnecessarily precipitate an election.  The terms of the report of this commission and contents of the Bill will come into effect only at the next general election.  If a general election was called before enactment of this Bill it would be held on the basis of the existing constituencies and the constitutional requirement in regard to the Census figures &mdash; the ratio of Deputies per head of population &mdash; would not be fulfilled.  It was important that time was not wasted between publication of this report and the introduction of the Bill.  I thank the Minister and Taoiseach, who promised he would seek to introduce the Bill before the summer recess.  It will have our full support.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of contributing to this debate.  A Bill such as this is traditionally accepted by this House.  Deputy Michael Smith said he would like to see some amendments proposed.  While all Members would welcome minor amendments it is very difficult to know where to stop, each Member wanting his or her amendments accepted.  That is not a <Col N="1823" /> road one can travel despite being sorely tempted.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy gave the House an interesting insight into occurrences during his term of office as Minister for Local Government for which I thank him.  He informed the House of the important role he had in preventing Fianna Fáil from gerrymandering constituencies. In the same breath he credited the present European Commissioner, former Deputy and Minister Pádraig Flynn, with influencing the boundaries commission with regard to the Mayo constituency on the previous occasion.  Perhaps he had not completed that work before leaving for Europe.</P>
      <P>Of course, amendments are relevant to all politicians.  While on Member may be quite happy with the manner in which his or her constitency has been redrawn, another Member of the same party or of a different party, might not be at all happy with the revision.  I daresay such opinion is influenced by the manner in which that Member may have represented or worked in the area being transferred to another constituency.</P>
      <P>I detected a sigh of relief from Deputy Molloy that this Bill would become law before a general election.  I would not be at all perturbed if a general election were held on the basis of the constituency I have represented for the past five years, though it is the one represented by Deputy Molloy, from which the House can draw its own conclusions.</P>
      <P>I understand the Constitution stipulates that our constituencies should be revised every 12 years.  I strongly advocate that constituencies should remain unaltered for 12 years, thus allowing any Member a reasonable period within which to get to know the people he or she represents and <i>vice versa.</i>  It takes a certain length of time to build up a rapport with one's constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the commission on the completion of their very difficult task. On several occasions I submitted suggestions but not this time because my previous ones were not taken into <Col N="1824" /> account.  Nonetheless I recognise it is a very difficult task for anybody to redraw constituency boundaries consistent with the population ratio per Deputy, given natural boundaries and so on.  I compliment the chairman, Mr. Justice Richard Johnson, Mr. Brendan O'Donoghue, the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad, all people well qualified for the task. However, there should be some input by a retired politician, such as an eminent former Member of this House, who would have the requisite political expertise and experience in this area.  I do not mean an active politician but perhaps a prominent former Member of this House &mdash; I am not suggesting anyone in particular &mdash; who would know what it was like to represent a constituency and would be aware that a major redrawing of the constituency might have a devastating effect on a Deputy. A person with political experience should be a member of the commission to inform the other members about the reality of politics.  Most Deputies unaffected by boundary change's have little understanding of the effect it can have on other Deputies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ryan for calling a quorum, thereby allowing many other Members to hear my contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general public do not have any sympathy for Deputies adversely affected by the revision of a constituency. Deputies have a moral duty to continue to represent the constituencies to which they are elected until the next general election, irrespective of the fact that when this Bill is passed, people in large areas of those constituencies will be unable to vote for their original representatives. That is a serious aspect of the commission's work.  It is comparable to a farmer leasing land for five years, planting crops on it and caring for it during that period who then must allow <Col N="1825" /> somebody else to harvest those crops. That farmer would be very irate in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>These changes may be unconstitutional but I do not intend to challenge the constitutionality of the Bill.  I will accept the changes that have been made by the commission in regard to Galway West.  I will continue to work in the area to which I was elected and in the new areas assigned to me.  Vast areas of the Galway West constituency including Athenry, Kiltullagh, Carrowbane, Craughwell, Ballinderreen, Kinvara, Ardrahan, Gort, Beagh, Kilbeacanty, Peterswell, Castledaly and Kilchreest have been transferred to the constituency of Galway East.  Other areas in the middle of the county including Corofin, Belclare, Ballinderry and Annagh have also been transferred to Galway East. That is a clear breach of the natural and council boundaries.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why the commission takes areas from one part of a constituency and adds areas to another part.  I welcome the fact that Caherlistrane and Headford are being transferred from Mayo West to Galway East in addition to Kilconnell and Milltown. That is an admission of the mistake made on the last occasion the boundaries were changed and I thank Deputy Molloy for his remarks in regard to that.</P>
    <P>There is not any consistency in the commission's work in regard to the constituencies. The summary of the report states that 20 constituencies are identical in name, area and representation to the existing constituency.  There are 21 constituencies in which there have been either minor or major changes.  That is unfair because there should be as few changes as possible, except where required by the Constitution, which demands a review every 12 years.  There should be a set period of time in which constituencies are left unchanged.  That would be welcomed not only by constituents but also by their representatives.</P>
    <P>We must accept these changes and get on with the task of representing our constituencies.  I am sure other Deputies <Col N="1826" /> will want to make comments on the Bill. I am sure Deputy Gregory will have much to say about the changes in the boundaries.  We must forget about the difficulties that may ensue as a result of these changes and continue the work of representing the areas in which we have been elected.  We must also try to establish ourselves in the new areas assigned to us.  Instead of representing a five-seat constituency for the next two years, I will be representing a six-seat constituency which I believe is unique in political terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McCormack for sharing his time with me.  I make this contribution based on my knowledge of my constituency and its needs.  I made a submission to the commission requesting it to retain Tipperary South as a four-seat constituency. I regret the commission could not justify leaving the constituency with four seats because it was impossible to retain three seats in Tipperary North. That made it imperative to transfer one seat from my constituency to the constituency of Tipperary North.  That was done literally by drawing a line through a map of the county in such a way as to justify the third seat in Tipperary North. I understand the commission's brief was to have three, four or five seat constituencies. They could not have a six seat constituency in South Tipperary and a two seat constituency in North Tipperary. A section of the population would have to be transferred to the North Tipperary constituency to justify its third seat.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that under the Constitution ultimate responsibility rests with the Oireachtas.  Deputy Michael Smith suggested that anomalies could be removed with the agreement of all the political parties but it should be possible to alter the constituency boundaries of North Tipperary and South Tipperary without encroaching on the county boundaries of the surrounding constituencies.  The anomalies created could be addressed in this way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to divide the parish of <Col N="1827" /> Ballingarry which is unfair, irrespective of where the district electoral divisions are drawn.  It is a matter of serious concern to those who represent an area when electoral areas are removed from county council administrative areas.  The people feel isolated and almost disenfranchised. The people in Cappawhite and Donohill district electoral divisions have no affinity with North Tipperary and will protest strongly that changes have been made without reference to them.  The boundaries have been changed without regard to their normal hinterland and their affinity to their county town and the county council area that has represented them for years.</P>
    <P>Without disturbing the distribution of seats that the commission wishes to achieve and without disturbing the electorate if there is political consensus among the constituency representatives it would be possible for the Government to address this anomaly.  I have the maps of the two areas and the population of the district electoral divisions involved. I suggest that Ballingarry and Modeshill be transferred to Tipperary North, eliminating the division of Ballingarry parish and that Cappawhite and Donohill be returned to their natural hinterland in Tipperary South, by so doing, the commission would achieve what it set out to do.  I would not have the audacity to make a suggestion that would give me political advantage and the same applies to my constituency colleague, Deputy Theresa Ahearn.</P>
    <P>There is no political advantage in transferring district electoral divisions from one constituency to another but it is more advantageous to the people concerned. Do we disregard the views of people and ignore the fact that we are dividing a parish and removing an electoral area from the Cashel administrative areas and another from the Tipperary county council area because it suits a commission?  I appreciate that the independent commission had to address the imbalances in constituencies and that North Tipperary would not have a third seat unless the population <Col N="1828" /> was increased.  Population was transferred from South Tipperary to justify the third seat in North Tipperary but I regret that South Tipperary lost a seat.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister look at the proposed boundary changes and how district electoral divisions have been divided? For example, a district electoral division that comes down into the town of Cashel, the heartland of South Tipperary has been transferred to North Tipperary.  The changes I suggest make eminent sense.  I would be remiss in my duty as an elected representative &mdash; I will always have to battle for my seat &mdash; if I did not make a case for these people. We should not disregard their views about being part of their normal hinterland. We should try to ensure that these proposals are acceptable to all in Tipperary, North and South and I am sure political agreement can be reached.</P>

      <P>I compliment Mr. Justice Richard Johnston, Mr. Kieran Coughlan and Ms Deirdre Lane and other members of the commission for the work they put into it.  It is a difficult task, almost like a rubic cube because when you change constituency boundaries it has a knock-on effect throughout the country.  The commission has made a brave effort to get things right.</P>
      <P>Deputies raised detailed points on the effects of the proposed changes in their own constituencies and I think it is right to do that.  Fortunately, the changes in my constituency are not of great significance for sitting Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the electoral Bill.  1994, which is awaiting its Second Reading.  It will establish on a statutory basis an independent constituency commission, which is long overdue.  There have been significant population changes &mdash; in the past six months one can begin to see the effects of inner city renewal in Dublin.  The apartment <Col N="1829" /> blocks are beginning to fill up resulting in a spin-off effect on local shops and businesses.</P>
    <P>The census on which this report is based is already out of date as far as my constituency is concerned and probably the north side of the city also, as there has been a significant increase in the number of people living in the inner city.  I would welcome the establishment of an independent constituency commission on a statutory basis to review the situation periodically so that population changes could be identified immediately and constituency boundaries changed if necessary.</P>
    <P>In regard to the constituency of County Mayo, where I worked for some time, I agree with the remarks of my colleague, Deputy Michael Smith.  The workload of all Deputies is particularly heavy, but I have a certain sympathy for rural Deputies who must travel to Dublin and back to their constituencies.  I particularly sympathise with those Deputies who will be elected for the constituency of Mayo.  This is a huge county and it is particularly difficult to get from one extreme of it to the other. It is, therefore, an enormous task and a huge strain for one Deputy to cover the whole of that county and represent his constituents as he will be expected to do.</P>
    <P>The constituency of Dublin Central is another one that fascinates me.  Every time we have a change in electoral boundaries this constituency changes, and it is on the move again.  I am sure Deputies Gregory and Costello will speak in more detail about this.  Fixing electoral boundaries is a difficult task, and if one starts at one end of the country it has repercussions all the way up, but people who know Dublin will be scratching their heads in wonderment at the change there; I gather the constituency is now ten miles long and that there is no similarity between one end of it and the other.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCormack mentioned my colleague, Deputy Michael Smith, in the course of his comments to the effect that <Col N="1830" /> he, Deputy McCormack, did not believe any changes should be made.  In fairness, what Deputy Smith had in mind was that electoral boundaries should be changed where parishes are at present divided.  I agree with that.  There is no reason to split a parish in rural Ireland in two, even if it makes the figures add up.  If we can get all party agreement in the House, parishes that are divided should be put in one constituency; I do not believe that will make any significant difference to the political situation in constituencies.  In an area which is to become part of my constituency, ten houses have been excluded and I cannot understand that.  I thought initially that it was a mistake but it seems that is how the map was drawn.  If the ten houses were part of Dublin south east it would mean that the whole of the housing estate in question would belong to the same constituency.  Unless there is a very good reason we should not do so. I would not be against the idea of changing them with the agreement of all sides.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCormack also said that because only a politician would understand the pressure and strain under which politicians work, a politician should be appointed to the commission. I have to differ with him on that.  Ms Deirdre Lane and Mr. Kieran Coughlan, who are members of the commission, are sympathetic to Members of the House and understand how heavy their workload is and the pressures on them.  Furthermore, it would damage the independence of the commission to include a politician and that would do none of us any good.  If a politician were appointed by a particular Government, members of Opposition parties might feel that the constituencies would be drawn in favour of the Government.  For that reason I do not believe the commission should include a politician.  The commission works well at present and the members are from different walks of life.  They all have a very good idea of the work of politicians.</P>
    <P>Although the census taken in 1991 is out of date, certainly in parts of Dublin, <Col N="1831" /> I welcome the Bill which is timely.  I hope it will be speedily implemented and that it will resolve many of the problems in certain constituencies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ryan for allowing me to share his time.  It gives me the opportunity to make a few comments when I would otherwise have had to wait most of the day to get a time slot in which to speak.  There have only been a few speakers so far but it is interesting that two of them referred to the fact that I intended to speak.  It is obvious that the word is out that something unusual has again happened in Dublin Central.</P>
      <P>My first comment on the report of the electoral commission is to welcome the reunification of Ballyfermot and Cherry Orchard.  It is something that community badly needed in order to be properly represented in this House.  The people there deserve that, and the problems that need to be addressed there can only be done if they are part of one constituency.  This, therefore, is a positive step.</P>
      <P>The commission's report stated that it was one of their objectives to unite natural communities.  What is unusual is that on the north side of the city the commission does not appear to have had that objective.  It seems to have attached no importance to this on the north side but has dissected communities from Phibsboro down to the docks area.  The commission appears to have a laudable objective in one part of the city but does not have the same objective in others.  On the north side the commission has ignored all natural boundaries, it has ignored the local electoral areas and, in most instances, it has followed sections of railway track to draw boundaries.  I find that approach extraordinary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constituency of Dublin Central is 8½ miles in length which is not very long for a rural constituency.  However, a constituency of such dimensions in the city centre, consisting of a pocket of the <Col N="1832" /> inner city on the north side and stretching out to a recently built suburb on the south side, seems unusual.  The commission found it necessary to justify not just those changes but changes made by the 1990 commission which have been compounded on this occasion.  I did not contribute to the debate on the changes in 1990 as so many Members attacked them I felt they would be reversed.  The commission's report referred to the criticisms but I was native enough to think they would take them on board.  I am disappointed with what I hope is an independent and objective process.</P>
    <P>The report states that although criticisms were made in the House no amendments were proposed.  That is hard to take.  I accepted the view that it was an independent commission and it would not be proper for the House to amend an &ldquo;independent&rdquo; report, yet the commission offers that as justification for compounding the extraordinary changes made on the last occasion.  I make these comments in the hope that they might have some effect on the commission in future.  The House behaved correctly on the last occasion despite what Deputy Molloy referred to as changes which &ldquo;confounded the imagination&rdquo;.  They certainly confound the imagination in Dublin Central.  The position of the House was that this was an independent report and that when the commission reviewed the changes it would take on board the fair comments made during the debate.  Unfortunately it did not do so.</P>
    <P>All recent Governments have treated the inner city as an area with special problems which require special strategies. The boundaries were defined in such a way as to implement policies which might help disadvantaged communities in those areas but the commission do not appear to have been aware of Government policy on the inner city.  The area is divided between five Dáil constituencies &mdash; Dublin Central, Dublin North-Central, Dublin-North West, Dublin South-Central and Dublin South-East.  That fits into the traditional policy of ignoring the inner <Col N="1833" /> city and treats it as an area where people do not live.  The objective of the commission was to unite natural communities. Clearly the view of the commission was that people in the inner city, the original Dublin Central, do not count to the same extent as people in other areas.</P>
    <P>I address the following questions to the members of the commission and perhaps in its next report which, if I am not a Member of the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be all right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory Mr. Gregory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The members of the commission read the comments made in the House on the last occasion and perhaps they might do so again.  On whose initiative are the constituencies lines drawn?  Deputies mentioned areas where the lines drawn are extraordinary. Were the boundary lines of Dublin Central, as they appear in the report, taken from one or any of the submissions made?  Were they taken from one member of the commission who had technical expertise available to him?  Do the members of the commission have the skills, expertise and knowledge necessary to drawn specific constituency boundary lines which have huge implications for communities and those who try to represent them?  If the members of the commission have doubts about any of these questions, are they considering recommendations to ensure objectivity and independence in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the view expressed that where there is political agreement on changes these should be made in the House.  Reports would be open to abuse.  Despite the fact that my constituency is probably the one most drastically affected, the most the House should do is send back the proposals to the commission with the comments made by the various Members.  If, on foot of that, the commission make minor changes, so be it but for the political groupings in the House to come together and reach agreement on <Col N="1834" /> changes would be a bad precedent and it would be wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeCostelloLAB" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also a Member for that most distressful of constituencies, Dublin Central, which seems to be at the receiving end of the knife every time the boundaries are revised.  There is an inordinate degree of change in the constituency. The only way boundaries can be properly revised is by an independent commission.  Previously the Minister for Local Government had responsibility for revising constituencies at least once every 12 years, as provided for in the Constitution.  It would be difficult to set up a more independent commission than this one which will include a judge of the High Court, the Ombudsman, the secretaries of the Department of the Environment and the Clerks of the Dáil and Seanad.  I strongly disagree with the suggestion that there should be some political involvement in the revision of boundaries.  Politicians and political groups should have no involvement in this matter other than the right to make submissions to the commission. It is important not to turn back the clock but seek to improve the system. The first commission was set up in 1980, the second in 1983, the third in 1988, the fourth in 1990 and the fifth in 1994.  This gives an average of one commission every three years over a 15 year period, which is well within the constitutional requirement that constituencies must be revised at least once every 12 years.</P>
      <P>The purpose of boundary revisions is to ensure that constituencies have adequate representation and are given a proper service.  Given the major changes in Dublin Central, consideration must be given to whether constituents in this area have adequate representation. Boundaries should only be changed when necessary to ensure stable representation for constituents.  This will give local representatives an opportunity to provide a service for their constituents and give time to constituents to decide whether they are being given a proper service.  Further consideration must be given to this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1835" /> As the results of a census of population are not available for three or four years, any decisions in the meantime in regard to the revision of boundaries do not accurately reflect the position in many areas.  For example, in the past few years many new apartment blocks have been built in Dublin Central and there has been a huge expansion in the local authority housing programme since the Government came into office. This means that the thousands of people living in these buildings are not recorded in the census and will not be taken into consideration by the commission when carrying out its revision of the boundaries.  During the period 1960-89 the population in the areas along the canals in the north and south inner city declined by 50 per cent.  There has been a sharp reversal in this trend in recent years and the large pool of new voters now living in these areas will not be taken into consideration by the commission in its revision, thus creating an imbalance.</P>
    <P>It seems from the terms of reference that Dublin Central, which is the most unstable constituency in the Dublin area, will become a cohesive and stable constituency.  One of the new terms of reference states that areas should be contiguous, that they should be adjacent to and run into each other in a natural form.  Apart from the East Wall, the Dublin Central constituency stretches from the River Liffey on the north side to the sea and out to Chapelizod.  The part of the constituency on the south side is not parallel to any populated area in the north side because the Phoenix Park is opposite Ballyfermot and Cherry Orchard.  It is impossible to see how these areas are contiguous.</P>
    <P>The commission must have regard to geographic considerations, including significant physical features.  In its report the commission says it has noted that it is required to have regard to significant physical features, which could include roads, railways etc., whereas previous commissions were required to have regard only to clearly defined <Col N="1836" /> natural features, for example, rivers, lakes and mountain ranges.  A river is a clearly defined physical feature.  There are rivers in Dublin such as the Dodder, the Poddle and so on but most people would say the Liffey is a significant feature.  If that is one of the terms of reference of a clearly defined physical feature, of which the commission must take cognisance, how in God's name can one section of the constituency be on the south side and the other at a long distance not geographically related?</P>
    <P>The obvious starting point for any commission would have been the River Liffey.  On the north side of the Liffey there is a huge urban area and on the south side there is a similar type of urban and suburban geographical area. One ought to start from the Liffey and move south on the one hand and north on the other.  That starting point would be strengthened by the fact that the greatest increase in population has been in the suburban areas in the south and the north counties.  As one moved out from the Liffey one would be able to form cohesive constituencies and to accommodate the increasing population on the peripheries because that is the area of greatest growth.  All logic would suggest that the River Liffey is the natural boundary in Dublin.  The constituency of Dublin Central should be the most stable and unchanged while on the south side Dublin South-East should be the one with most change.  However, the opposite is the case and Dublin Central becomes the cockpit.  Whatever is required from the north side or the south side a chunk of Dublin Central is used to facilitate it.</P>
    <P>Since the last boundary revision five constituencies have been altered.  I find it difficult to understand the new terms of reference and the <i>modus operandi</i> of the commission.  East Wall is a natural part of Dublin Central but its population of 3,503 is being brought into Dublin North-Central.  East Wall and North Wall are contiguous areas and anyone operating in the locality would say they should be left together.  A railway line running through East Wall and <Col N="1837" /> North Wall is regarded as the boundary rather than the area being an essential part of the north inner city.  East Wall and North Wall are part of the local electoral area but they are being divided for the general area in this discretionary fashion.</P>
    <P>The area of Mountjoy and half of Phibsboro is divided.  Electoral areas are divided to make up a new general election area.  A population of 6,577 people are being changed to Dublin North-West and a chunk is taken away from the local electoral area of Cabra.  This is a further intrusion in the local electoral areas.  No cognisance has been taken of how that affects a constituency and the ability of Deputies and local councillors to represent the area.  There is a direct link between both in terms of representation.</P>
    <P>On the other side of the Liffey there are enormous gains.  A population of 16,494 is added to Dublin Central &mdash; an increase of 6,000 in the constituency. There had been a fall in the population although the census of population does not reflect the increase since 1990.  What has happened in terms of adding on Cherry Orchard and joining upper Ballyfermot to lower Ballyfermot is a natural progression.  Undoubtedly, that area is now a cohesive unit on the south of the Liffey but is not a cohesive unit in terms of being linked to the north inner city and Cabra.  It is good that Ballyfermot is not divided between Dublin West and Dublin Central as in the last election, they are all in one constituency. Traditionally Ballyfermot and Cherry Orchard were part of a south side constituency.  The first time Ballyfermot and Inchicore became part of Dublin Central was at the last election. It would have been natural that they would be part of a south side constituency; Dublin West would be the obvious constituency.  While that constituency is being made more cohesive in terms of the area being assigned to it, it will make it even more difficult because there is now almost an equal division between the north and the south side but <Col N="1838" /> far apart for the purposes of proper representation for the people.  The next time there is a boundary revision if could mean going back to the drawing board and another carve up, the people on the south side could be included with another constituency and chunks of the north side could be assigned to other constituencies.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to fathom why Dublin Central has to be changed so drastically each time there is a boundary revision.  It is difficult to understand how the terms of reference correspond to the manner in which the redrawing has taken place. In any future boundary drawings will the commission look seriously at the Liffey as the natural boundary for moving into the south and north sides of the city in terms of putting together a structure that could last virtually forever because the Liffey will be there forever? The city sprawls north, south and west but the central area is cohesive.  The obvious place to start is not in the northern suburbs and move in, as happened on the last occasion, but to start at the Liffey and move out.</P>
    <P>We should also look at the range of services provided and how the State Departments look at the city as a whole. For example, the partnerships is one type of unit in operation but obviously the commission has not taken cognisance of that because it operates in a variety of constituencies.  It operates on the north and the south sides in a fairly coherent fashion but following the changes in Dublin Central it does not reflect the territory of the inner city partnership.  The Garda stations and the health boards operate in certain defined areas but, of course, the boundary revision draws across their operational areas.  All the other services provided by the State are not taken into consideration. I realise they are not part of the terms of reference but they could be considered because they give a community cohesiveness by being represented by the services on the one hand and the political representatives on the other and it allows for stability in <Col N="1839" /> terms of broad democratic representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelAhern" hpid="Mr. N. Ahern Mr. N. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the commission on the work it has done, although I do not agree with everything stated in its report in which it is clearly stated that it has an advisory function. It has been suggested that, with all-party agreement, changes may be made.  I see nothing wrong with this.  There is no point in expressing reservations if one is not prepared to take the next logical step, which is to try to have alterations made.  While it is accepted that the commission is independent in the exercise of its functions, no individual or committee is perfect.  It appears there are anomalies.</P>
      <P>Some Members seem to be opposed to the idea of making changes or of political involvement.  I would not go along with that.  While the commission is independent in the exercise of its functions there is a political input through the involvement of the Department of the Environment which considers how the suggestions of the commission should be implemented. Although the commission will consider the findings of any studies carried out it would be naive to think there is no political involvement.</P>
      <P>In the past we had seven, eight and nine-seat constituencies.  It then became the trend to opt for a smaller number, to the point where the majority of constituencies were three-seaters in the late 1960s and early 1970s.  Since the decision was taken to appoint a commission to deal with this matter there has been a reversal of this trend.  It must be questioned whether this is due to its terms of reference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are reaching the stage where we will have a European style parliament and Governments will appoint committees to do more of the work.  This means that Members will spend less time in their constituencies.  Despite this trend commissions have moved away from three-seat constituencies in favour of four or five-seaters.  This matter will <Col N="1840" /> have to be considered.  While members of the commission may argue that their hands are tied we are sending conflicting signals.  I am not trying to make the argument that we should have single seat constituencies but I would not be in favour of four and five-seaters.  It would make more sense to have three-seat constituencies in rural and some city areas.</P>
    <P>In chapter 1 the commission recommends that the total membership of Dáil Éireann should remain at the present level, that the seats should be arranged in 41 constituencies and that the number of three, four and five-seat constituencies should also remain the same.  In the case of Dublin, the Minister of State said that there will be no change in the existing allocation of 47 seats or in the number of Members to be returned for each of the existing 11 constituencies.  This gives the impression that there will be no change in the position and that if there were to be an increase in the number of Deputies or constituencies there might be a hullabaloo in the media.  I suggest, however, that fundamental changes are recommended in a number of areas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Smith mentioned that in the past this matter was the subject of acrimonious debate when it seemed various parties wished to gerrymander or &ldquo;Tullymander&rdquo; constituency boundaries. I do not know if it would be possible to do this to look after any particular party; one could certainly look after individuals.</P>
    <P>Major changes are recommended in some areas.  I do not fully understand how the commission determined what the boundaries should be.  The electoral area boundaries for Dáil and local authority elections should be the same.  This would make sense to local communities and everyone involved in politics.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the constituency of Dublin Central which has been severly affected.  Some people outside the House claim it has been butchered.  In the case of Dublin the commission makes a number of suggestions. The possibility of joining parts of <Col N="1841" /> north Wicklow with areas in Dublin was considered and rejected.  Given that many people from Bray commute to the city the notion that it should be joined with parts of Dublin would not be nonsensical, but I am sure there are logical reasons for rejecting it.</P>
    <P>In the case of the constituency of Dublin Central, as Deputy Gregeory mentioned, the commission almost tries to apologise for taking a certain line.  It mentions that many of the submissions it received were critical of what happened on the previous occasion.  It refers to the natural boundaries it considered for Dublin Central and states that having considered these matters it decided not to accept them because it would have meant making substantial changes.  However substantial changes will be made anyway.  I accept it is difficult for a commission such as this to find a perfect answer and to make decisions that are agreeable to everyone.  From the submissions made to it, the commission realises there is a problem with Dublin Central.  It set out the different scenarios and made a decision knowing it would not be agreed to by many people.</P>
    <P>I represent the neighbouring constituency of Dublin North-West.  I will not lose out as a result of the changes.  Some people would say I owe my political existence to the changes made on the last occasion.  It is difficult to see the logic behind some of the changes proposed and I fully understand why Deputies Costello and Gregory are unhappy with them.  It is not the name, Dublin Central, that poses the problem, although it might have been more honest if the name was changed.  There is a suggestion that nothing is changing but huge changes are being made.  If the name was changed they might be given official recognition and their might be sympathy for those who feel aggrieved.</P>
    <P>The original boundary between Dublin Central and Dublin North-West was Iona Road.  That was an unnatural boundary which cut through a parish. The natural boundary is the canal and the railway line at Whitworth Road, <Col N="1842" /> which is only 200 yards away.  I had hoped the boundary would be changed to Whitworth Road which is the local authority boundary.  That would make sense and nobody could logically argue against it.  However, the boundary extends beyond the canal, to the North Circular Road, including a section of the inner city ward and parts of Phibsboro in the Cabra ward.  On the North Circular Road or Cabra Road one house may be in the new Dublin North-West constituency while the neighbouring house may be in Dublin Central.</P>
    <P>I welcome the people in those areas to Dublin North-West.  I will try to represent them well, as my brother has done for a number of years.  I doubt that he has made enemies in the area.  It is difficult to understand why the commision extended the constituency because the original arrangment, without the North Circular Road and Phibsboro areas was satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Gregory's remarks about concentrating political effort in the inner city area and about the East Wall.  In Dublin North-West the main area of underprivilege is Ballymun and at local authority level a special committee deals with that area. It is proposed that part of the inner city be included in that constituency. However representatives may not pay much attention to this area as they may believe it will not be retained on the next occasion.  Their main concentration will be on Ballymun.  This change will add to what everyone recognises is a problem in the inner city.  The inner city committee of the local authority was originally composed of representatives from two constituencies but now it will involve five or six constituencies and representatives will have only a minority interest in it.</P>
    <P>I understand the reservations of Deputies from areas such as Mayo, a constituency that spans 140 miles.  Problems will also arise in Tipperary.  The commission readily accepts it is an advisory body, and if there is all-party agreement, I see nothing wrong with <Col N="1843" /> making changes to ensure everybody is happy.</P>

      <P>This is a debate on survival.  It is obvious that the only contributions on Second Stage are from Deputies from constituencies affected. Even if I do not agree with the outcome of the review, I thank the commission for its work.  It was a difficult and thankless task.  I accept its recommendations are impartial and are the best options in the circumstances.  As a Deputy who represents one of the constituencies that will be greatest affected by the review &mdash; Tipperary South &mdash; I nevertheless acknowledge the commission's work.</P>
      <P>It must be accepted that political careers may be destroyed by the stroke of a commission pen, although we will all fight against that irrespective of the input a Deputy has made in a constituency over the years, his dedication and the good work he has done, his political career may end as a result of this review. Some Deputies will inevitably lose out because, for example, in the case of Mayo six into five will not go and in south Tipperary three into two will not go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the opportunity to debate the commission's recommendations. Tipperary South is one of the constituencies most affected.  Those of us who represent Tipperary South have lost 9,379 people, well over a quota, from our constituency.  That means saying good bye to many whom we enjoyed representing.  Their problems and concerns were ours.  We were delighted to share in their successes.  We visited their schools and joined in their activities in their local community centres.  We met them personally, visited them when they were sick and met them on sorrowful and joyful occasions.  Ours is a human relationship and one I would have liked to continue.  We have bult up a solid trust and suddenly we fine we cannot work together any more.  When this Bill is passed I will have to say goodbye to the people of Ballysheehan, Clogher, <Col N="1844" /> Clonoulty East, Clonoulty West, Gaile, Graystown, Killenaule, Nodstown, Ballyphilip, Buolick, Crohane, Farranrory, Fennor, Kilcooly, New Birmingham, Poyntstown, Cappagh, Curraheen, Donohill, Glengar and Ballymacarbry. I listed those towns to bring home to politicians the extent to which Tipperary South has been affected. Those rural parishes will be transferred from Tipperary South to Tipperary North and Ballymacarbry will be transferred to Waterford.  It will represent a massive break of friendship and trust between those people and their representatives. I am saddened because I want to continue to represent those people.  They elected me to this House and put their trust in me.  I enjoyed sharing their concerns and successes, but that will no longer be the case because of the pen that drew the line across the map.</P>
    <P>The commission emphasised that when drawing up new boundaries account was taken of practical and geopraphical considerations.  On either of those counts it is difficult to accept its recommendations regarding Tipperary South.  Irrespective of what line is drawn across the map we must use the road network and we will have to drive through Tipperary North to reach parts of Tipperary South.  That is neither practical nor has it geographical merit. It is the result of the commission's review.  There is no logic in it.  It will not suit the representatives or the people living in those areas.  We will have to drive to Killenaule in north Tipperary to reach the village of Ballingarry which will be included in the Tipperary South constituency.  There is no logic to that division.</P>
    <P>I admit that we did expect some changes in Tipperary South.  We know that Tipperary North does not have a sufficient population to retain three seats.  I believed that Tipperary South would have been left a four-seater constituency and that additional areas of population would have been transferred to it.  The revision of the boundaries will be drastic for people with a natural <Col N="1845" /> affinity with south Tipperary.  They have always been part of that constituency and it is their natural and traditional homeland, but as a result of the stroke of the commission's pen, for no reason other than to supply population, they will be in the Tipperary North constituency. My colleague mentioned Donohill and Cappawhite.  The Tipperary North constituency boundary will fall almost within the speed limit area outside Cashel town and come within four miles of Tipperary town.  Those of us who were born and reared and have lived in Tipperary know how unnatural that division is.</P>
    <P>There is another severe disadvantage. The whole local authority area was within the constituency, but that will no longer be the case.  Part of the Tipperary South local authority area will be transferred to the Tipperary North constituency. That will pose difficulties for public representatives, but we can imagine the difficulties it will pose for the people, among whom there is much confusion. Some of them understood that they would be transferred to the Tipperary North local authority area.  It is illogical that they will have to approach south Tipperary county councillors and north Tipperary TDs.  Efforts should be made to keep the local authority areas intact.  Unfortunately, the greater part of the Cashel local authority area will be in Tipperary North.  People in Tipperary South are disappointed, angry and confused as a result of the commission's review.</P>
    <P>Our democratic system is becoming more confused by the hour with regional bodies, health boards and local authority services located in different Dáil constituencies.  It is a maze of confusion. It must have been difficult to design such confusing divisions for various services on a small island.  I do not know how we would operate if the island was any bigger.</P>
    <P>The local authority area in south Tipperary will be divided between Tipperary North and Tipperary South. We will have to travel to Waterford to go to the FÁS headquarters, turn <Col N="1846" /> towards Kilkenny to go to the regional headquarters of the health board and travel to Thurles and Waterford to get to the Revenue Commissioners.  We have approximately seven postal codes and different health board areas, but amazingly, not a Government office.  I want the Government to consider decentralising a Government office to south Tipperary.  We have to travel north, south, east and west to the headquarters of various bodies, with none located in south Tipperary.  We will not tolerate that position much longer.  We have excellent towns, services and facilities, a first-class workforce and a beautiful environment which is an ideal location for a Government headquarters. When the Bill is passed all we will have is a stripping of towns from our constituency by the commission pen about which many of the people in Tipperary South are shocked.</P>
    <P>If Members were honest they would admit that we must tolerate political apathy and this has been increased by the manner in which the Tipperary constituencies have been divided.  People want to vote for the representatives they know, but they will no longer have that opportunity.  Many of the people forced into other constituencies may not vote in future elections.  Irrespective of geographic or practical considerations, the objective of constituency revision should be to maintain people's interest and trust in the political system.  People are confused and believe they are mere numbers that can be transferred to wherever there are not enough people to make up two, three or four seat constituencies, but they will not tolerate such treatment.  People have affinity with certain areas and it is unwise to transfer them to other constituencies where they will feel isolated from political representation.  Of course, what is one person's loss is another's gain and the areas of south Tipperary to which we will have to say goodbye will be well represented by our colleagues in north Tipperary.  Nevertheless, we must fight our case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1847" /> Members have questioned whether the Minister should accept amendments if those representing the constituencies involved are in agreement about the changes.  Deputy Ferris proposed that Cappawhite and Donohill should be retained in Tipperary South and that Ballingarry and Modeshill should be returned to Tipperary North.  While I do not like relinquishing any part of Tipperary South, I do not have a difficulty with Deputy Ferris's proposal.  He was correct in stating that such a proposal will not be politically advantageous for anybody.  Cappawhite and Donohill are located outside Tipperary town, are included in south Tipperary local authority and the people living there do not have a natural affinity with north Tipperary.  If the Minister accepts Deputy Ferris's proposal, I will support it but if too many parishes are juggled around it will give rise to problems.  As there were serious imbalances in constituencies, the work of the commission was necessary but difficult, particularly if one is not familiar with an area.  It would be impossible to please everybody.</P>
    <P>We are honoured to have the Ceann Comhairle as one of our representatives in south Tipperary.  I am sure all Members would wish to be in his position in that he is automatically returned to the House.  I wish him many more years of service and hope I will be here as a colleague.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The status of south Tipperary will be adversely affected by the reduction in the number of seats.  South Tipperary <Col N="1848" /> has good representatives and it is regrettable that this change is necessary to back up other constituencies.  Unfortunately, the commission did not consider natural boundaries and hinterlands in south Tipperary and many of our constituents are unhappy with the outcome. Nevertheless, the commission completed its task and its report has been accepted by the Government.  I would like to continue to represent those who have been transferred in north Tipperary. I thank them for their support and trust in the past and I am sure they will be competently represented by my colleagues in north Tipperary.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's response to the proposals on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate and to thank the members of the Dáil Constituency Commission for their deliberations though I disagree with their ultimate findings in regard to the Mayo constituencies which, as the House will know, have been badly affected in this latest revision.  From now on Mayo will be a five-seater whereas previously it comprised two three-seater constituencies.  I know my colleague.  Deputy Morley, who is absent because of illness, would like to express his thanks along with mine to the people of our former constituency. It was a pleasure to work with them.  I hope we represented them well although they may have differed with us from time to time, but only when playing in GAA matches.  That County Mayo will be reduced to one five-seater constituency means one Member will lose his seat but that is a feature of life in politics.  We will have to struggle on because it appears we cannot propose any amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would appear the commission could have allowed the <i>status quo</i> remain, or could have combined a portion of Sligo <Col N="1849" /> with Mayo, which would have caused problems for Sligo-Leitrim.  Bearing in mind its expressed wish not to breach county boundaries, I suppose its ultimate decision was the only viable option.</P>
    <P>A county the size of Mayo in Leinster would probably have 50 Deputies, and in Munster would have nine Deputies. Mayo, the third largest county, has its representation reduced to five Deputies. This means Deputies may have to travel in excess of 100 miles, say, from Blacksod to Ballaghaderreen.  However, that is part of political life and I know the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Higgins is fully aware of the problems we shall encounter in our constituency in the future.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that account was not taken of geographical areas in addition to population, especially in a county like Mayo, certain parts of which are very poorly populated.  We cannot blame former commissions for not having foreseen an insufficient representation in our county the population in the west generally, expecially in Leitrim, having diminished considerably.  It is unfortunate that there was not greater cognisance of the geography of any given area.  Henceforth, I dare say we will not encounter problems <i>vis-à-vis</i> parish boundaries and the like.  Our main problem will be that of representing the electorate of County Mayo adequately. Having already given examples of how a comparable electoral area would be represented, the House will readily appreciate our problems.  It is unfortunate that this has happened to County Mayo.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> We are dealing with the report of a five-member commission here which leads me to wonder &mdash; when the seven-member commission in Portlaoise made such a ridiculous decision &mdash; whether I can appeal to anybody to request this five-member commission to re-examine how it has illogically treated Carlow, our second smallest county?</P>
      <P>Chapter 2 of its report under the subheading Terms of Reference, on page seven, subparagraph (c) reads:</P>
      <P>the breaching of county boundaries shall be avoided as far as practicable.</P>
      <P>Of course &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; is as long as a piece of string.  Nonetheless, arguing later about various options open to them, the members of the commission were able to argue in defence of county boundaries while totally ignoring that aspiration when it came to County Carlow.</P>
      <P>Constituents have asked whether I made a submission to the commission. It did not cross my mind to do so.  It would not have occurred to me that it would decimate the second smallest county by transferring 3,500 people from Carlow to Wicklow.  Carlow comprises one-third of the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny, Kilkenny having two votes for every one of ours; if you like, one could maintain that we are a little prop in that constituency.  The widely expressed fear is that Carlow would wind up after the next election without any Deputy as all of them could represent Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1851" /> The five wise members of the commission on page 20 of their report, dealt with the possibility of adding five seats to Waterford and went on to discuss two possibilities &mdash; one being to transfer the towns of Carrick-on-Suir and the southern environs of Clonmel or, second, the Glenore, Mullinavat, Mooncoin area of County Kilkenny.  They went on to say:</P>
    <P>None of these options appears to us to be satisfactory.  Further adjustment between Waterford and Tipperary is particularly difficult by reason of the physical features involved, a factor adverted to in submissions.</P>
    <P>Even west Wicklow is separated from east Wicklow by physical features.  It is of no benefit to Carlow to have to get over a physical barrier which affects the county.</P>
    <P>The commission's report went on to state that adjustment between Kilkenny and either Tipperary or Waterford would involve a new breach of a provincial boundary as well as a county boundary and that there appeared to be a more appropriate way of dealing with the rather high average population per Member in the Carlow-Kilkenny constituency. I do not know why the commission was so concerned about the fact that Carlow has a greater population per Member than that laid down. Nobody is complaining and perhaps we should be nearer a 30,000 average.</P>
    <P>The commission did not consider breaching a county boundary in Kilkenny or in the Tipperary area. Obviously, the Carlow boundary does not matter.  In regard to County Dublin, where there are several constituencies, the report states that a transfer could be made from the constituency of Dún Laoghaire, which includes parts of the environs of Bray, and could supply the necessary population.  It stated that, on balance, it felt it would be preferable to retain the county boundary in that case and treat the Dublin area as a distinct unit.  Dublin, which has several constituencies, can and must be protected to retain the county boundary, yet Carlow <Col N="1852" /> is given only 3,500 people out of the second smallest county in the country.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the logic applied in those three cases.  The commission stated that the county boundary must be protected in Kilkenny-Tipperary and that in Dublin, to assist Wicklow, the constituencies on the borders of Wicklow cannot be included because they must protect the county boundary of Dublin.  The solution, a sensible one in the view of the commission, was to transfer some of the population numbers from Carlow.  That is totally unacceptable.  If the commission's report had not made any reference to protecting Kilkenny and Dublin I might accept that some constituency had to be adversely affected but I cannot understand how five intelligent people could contradict themselves so severely in the decision they made.</P>
    <P>The commission report states that the final decision in regard to accepting its recommendations is a matter for the Oireachtas.  The commission is an independent body.  Deputy Molloy seemed to question the honesty of this Government in not interfering with this decision &mdash; although he almost canonised himself because of his actions when he had responsibility for the revision of constituency boundaries.  The Government cannot interfere with an independent review and it is foolish of the commission to state that the final decision is a matter for the Oireachtas.  What can the Oireachtas do?  Who will stand up and say to me that they will give me a share of their constituency?  That will not happen.  People can hide behind the fact that this will be a decision of the Oireachtas and I will have to accept it.</P>
    <P>To add insult to injury the commission further stated in its report that it noted that the boundaries of 56 towns were extended in 1994 for the purposes of local elections and that, in the case of Carlow and Drogheda, the added areas extended into adjoining counties, Laois and Meath respectively.  Typical of Carlow's luck, the commission considered that it would be premature to take account in its recommendations of <Col N="1853" /> boundary extension which at present apply only to local elections.  The environs of Carlow Town are more greatly associated with Carlow than with Laois.  In fact, some of the houses in Graighcullen are in the Laois constituency, which is an absolute farce.</P>
    <P>We are now in a position where we may not have any elected representative from Carlow following the next general election.  The commission should not have treated a small county like Carlow the way it did when one considers that it went out of its way to protect Dublin, which is already divided into several constituencies, Kilkenny and Tipperary, where the county boundaries had to be observed.  Why did Carlow not receive the same treatment?  It seems to me that small counties are regarded as unimportant.</P>
    <P>To use football language, the commission should be given the red card. The Taoiseach should suspend it from bringing its own terms of reference into disrepute.  As far as I am concerned, I will give all its members a free transfer to Honolulu on a one way ticket because of the way they have treated Carlow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity of making a contribution to the debate on this report.  I listened with interest to the contributions this morning.  I cannot understand how Members can claim we should make submissions to the commission if the commission is independent. During my 13 years in politics, I never made a submission to any commission on any constituency boundary although I have never been satisfied with the constituency boundaries created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the past 13 years I have been privileged to represent the people of Galway East which is a three seat constituency. A number of changes have been made during that period of time. Following my election to this House in 1982, and my subsequent election that year, changes were made which transferred the north eastern part of our <Col N="1854" /> county to the constituency of Roscommon. That divided in two the parish of my colleague, Tom Hussey, who is at present a councillor in Galway County Council and a former Member of this House and Senator.  I believe that was a disgraceful decision.</P>
    <P>A subsequent change was made which involved the former Minister, Mark Killilea, MEP.  His parish was divided in two which meant that some of his neighbours were unable to vote for him in an election.  Again, that was a disgraceful decision.  The previous commission decided to transfer parts of our constituency, including Miltown, Kilconnelly, part of Dunmore, Levally, Kilshanvy and Kilbennan and Sylane to Mayo East to underpin that three seat constituency.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues in Mayo East who have so well represented the people of that area, namely, Deputies Tom Moffatt and P.J. Morley and Minister Jim Higgins.  I am delighted, with my two colleagues in my constituency, to welcome them back and we look forward to doing what we can to enhance the representation they have provided over the past number of years. That commission decided also to transfer parts of west Galway, including Headford, Caherlistrane, Beaghamore and Belclare, to the constituency of Mayo West to underpin that three seat constituency.  I would have expected in subsequent changes that those areas would automatically be returned to their original constituencies, but that is not what this commission proposes.</P>
    <P>The commission has decided to return to Galway East the part of east Galway that was transferred to Mayo East, to take one half of the area that was transferred to Mayo West from west Galway and transfer it to Galway East and the other half to Galway West, thereby dividing that area into two.  I cannot understand how anyone would arrive at that solution.  I welcome the areas that have been added to my constituency.</P>
    <P>The constituency of Galway East stretches from the Shannon on the eastern part, across the entire county <Col N="1855" /> boundary of Clare right to the sea in the south western part and comes along by the seashore into the beautiful town of Kinvara and up along the main road into the beautiful village of Ballindereen until it comes into oyster country at Kilcolgan Bridge.  It takes a turn to the right towards east Galway and heads down for Craughwell, skims the town of Athenry, going north within half a mile of the town of Athenry and takes an immediate sharp right back towards east Galway for about two miles.  It goes for another mile and pretends to go west and takes another sharp right turn which brings it around the town of Monivea, on towards Belville towards Turloughmore, but excludes those areas, and links up with Ballyglunin, Cummer, Belclare down through Sylane and cuts across to Ballindine at the Mayo border.  The constituency goes along the Mayo border from Ballindine over to Ballymoe at the junction with Ballinlough, Roscommon and Mayo, up along by the River Suck up to the town of Ballinasloe and on by the Suck to the River Shannon.  We have the sea, all of County Clare, Counties Tipperary and Offaly and much of County Roscommon and half of County Mayo touching Galway East as well as the boundary of Galway West.  Galway East has been deemed to warrant an extra Deputy and will be a new four seat constituency.  I cannot understand how a particular part of the county, which I know very well, is no longer in the constituency.</P>
    <P>Independent commissions are wonderful and bureaucrats are great people but their interest is in concluding a job to a high professional standard.  When it comes down to the demographics and the proper proportional and totality of representation the people deserve, independent commissions have not the capacity to deliver a structure that is in the best interest of the maximum number of people.</P>
    <P>The town of Athenry has been returned to Galway East, half of the parish is already in Galway East but the <Col N="1856" /> remaining portion is in the constituency of Galway West even through those people live three miles east of the town of Athenry and the town is in Galway East.  People from the townlands of Ballydavid, Gurrane, Mountain North, Mountpelier and Castlellen are within one mile of Monivea, and some of them are within a mile of the town of Athenry.  Monivea which is north of them is in the electoral area of Ballinasloe which is in Galway East, the town of Athenry south of them is in the electoral area of Loughrea which is almost entirely in Galway East but they are deemed to be in the Galway West constituency.</P>
    <P>They are in a political vacuum and disenfranchised in that they have the right to vote for people who are many miles from them.  Their social and commercial life is associated with the town of Athenry and they are proud of their parish, its culture and its traditions &mdash; it has a tremendous religious history and a unique military history and it has the longest medieval town walls in the British Isles.  Although they live in the parish of Athenry they are not allowed to exercise their franchise in their traditional hinterland.  I cannot understand how a commission will consistently come up with these situations and allow them to continue.  I can understand that a commission can reach a decision for convenience but when people are consistently excluded from their natural hinterland and their traditional representatives we are doing them a great disservice.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for this House to accept this report, the Government has already accepted it which means that this House can debate it.  Will the Minister advise me whether we can table amendments to the Bill because I do not want to be out of step with the correct parliamentary procedures &mdash; I am not worried about being politically correct but I want to be legally, constitutionally and parliamentary correct.  I want to ensure that the people affected in the area along the Athenry-Monivea Road, stemming from Dillons Cross, perhaps <Col N="1857" /> 200 to 300 people, will be able to vote for local candidates rather than having to vote for very fine candidates who live miles from them.  The line should be firmed up.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand how the decision to form this new constituency of Galway East in this way was arrived at.  I have no difficulty with the decision taken &mdash; I have represented the people of my constituency for 13 years and I will offer myself at the next election and if they consider that I am good enough to represent them I will be delighted to continue to do so.  The proposed constituency division has gone all along by the Clare county boundary, down by the sea to Kinvara and has taken a right turn to the town of Athenry.</P>
    <P>Why did the commission not consider the existing boundary where Galway East divided at the end of the parish of Derrybrien, at the Slieve Aughty mountain range, at the Clare border and went northwards towards Loughrea?  Why did it not at that stage extend the constituency in a straight line from the Clare county boundary through Derrybrien, including Athenry, all the way to the Mayo boundary at Ballindine?</P>
    <P>That would have ensured a proper demographic, geographic and compatible area.  Alternatively it could have included all of the electoral area of Loughrea, ensuring that parishes and towns, including the beautiful oyster country of Clarinbridge, right down to Maree, Oranmore and back to Athenry were included in the Galway East constituency. What we have is a mishmash of electoral areas within a county.  The people from the Galway West, Loughrea, Tuam and Ballinasloe electoral areas are unfairly included or excluded from constituencies.  Democracy is vital, and proper representation is absolutely necessary.  Where possible, county boundaries should not be transgressed, and neither should local electoral areas. It is time we looked seriously at this. Had the Loughrea electoral area been included in the constituency of Galway East, Senator Frank Fahey would have <Col N="1858" /> been returned to this House as a Deputy.  His constituency has not been divided in two; 3,500 of his votes have been transferred to Galway East and 3,400 to Galway West.  The man is in an absolute dilemma.  If he goes west he will be wrong, and if he goes east he will be wrong.  His political future is doubtful. Had the area been properly divided, he and the other prospective candidates anxious to stand for election would have been given an equal and fair chance of getting elected.  We now have a huge constituency.  There is no doubt that I and the other two Deputies who represent the area at the moment will do our best until the next election when a fourth candidate will be elected.  It will be interesting to see who that fourth candidate will be.  I wish every prospective candidate well and I am sure the people will make the right decision in their own interests, as to who gets elected.</P>
    <P>I turn to Mayo, my neighbouring county.  We are now asking the people of Mayo to elect five Deputies to represent the third biggest county in the country, a county of huge diversity in demographics, in urbanisation and in ruralisation.  The county includes big towns like Ballina, Castlebar and West-port, and medium sized towns like Ballinrobe, Ballindine, Charlestown and others.  This proposal is immoral, unnatural, unfair and discriminates against the people of the county and the representatives who are expected to deliver a service to them.</P>
    <P>It is time we examined the terms of reference of commissions, and I accept that it was our party under former Taoiseach, the great Jack Lynch, that decided to set up an independent commission. Such is the generosity, the integrity and attitude of this party that it always takes a national view and does what is best for our country.  However, it is important now to look at the geographics as much as the demographics in taking future decisions.  It is unfair to expect five human beings to serve the entire county.  Mayo is big enough geographically and, like Galway and the <Col N="1859" /> other western counties, it has enough problems to merit two three-seat constituencies. I see no reason for not doing that.  It is obvious that certain political people with power at this time see an opportunity for themselves of, perhaps, winning an extra seat in constituencies like this.  I notice smaller parties giving a broad welcome to the commission's report &mdash; they also might see an opportunity of getting an extra seat in a five-seat constituency like Mayo.  However, it is unfair to people living in the third biggest county.  I wish all the people who offer themselves as candidates in that great county at the next election every success particularly the five lucky people who get elected, and I am confident that at least three of them will be from my party.</P>
    <P>It is time this Parliament, this country and the Department of the Environment, in consultation with the local authorities, closely examined the electoral situation from every point of view. It is vital that we examine the locations of polling centres.  There are parishes in my constituency where people are asked to travel up to 14 miles to vote, even though there might be a polling booth within a mile of where they live.  I suggest that the Minister for the Environment, in consultation with officials in his Department, each county registrar, county secretary, county manager, town clerk and all the elected members in each county, by which I mean all members of local authorities and all Members of the Oireachtas, carry out a critical analysis of the demographics and geographics in each county and put a draft report before a duly convened meeting of all public representatives in each county.  They should get advance notice of the draft report and have time to consider it.  They could then make recommendations to the Minister for the Environment who would draft the Bill with those recommendations in view and have it ratified.  Modern times, modern communications and the best interests of democracy demand maximisation of the interest of people in <Col N="1860" /> exercising their franchise and in ensuring that proportional representation gives the broadest democracy possible in every election, local or national, presidential or otherwise.  This nation should be based on maximum democracy rather than selective democracy.  If we put together a new system we will maximise the opportunity for people to vote in a convenient manner and the number of people who turn out at each election, strengthen democracy and generate a greater respect for public representatives in this great open democracy that we will all enjoy and are privileged to serve through this House and through other elected bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanRyan" hpid="Mr. S. Ryan Mr. S. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to make a brief contribution to this Bill.  The Bill, which I welcome, is based on the fifth commission report on the formation of constituencies. Previous reports were represented in April 1980, July 1983, November 1988 and September 1990.  The decision taken to set up the first independent commission was a very enlightened one, particularly as it removed the hands on approach by Governments and particularly Ministers for Local Government, as they were then known.  Prior to 1980 no matter what Government was in power or who was Minister for Local Government there were always charges of political gerrymandering.  Political analysts still refer to the former Ministers, the late Deputies Boland and Tully.</P>
      <P>I am glad that it is intended under the Electoral Bill. 1994 to put the commission on a statutory basis.  Article 16 2.2º of the Constitution provides that:</P>
      <P>The total number of members shall from time to time be fixed by law, but the total number of members of Dáil Éireann shall not be fixed at less than one member for each thirty thousand of the population, or at more than one member for each twenty thousand of the population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The population figure in the 1991 census <Col N="1861" /> was 3,525,719.  On that basis the number of Members could be fixed between 117 and 176.  The commission's terms of reference limit the number to between 164 and 168.</P>
    <P>Dublin city and county is represented by 47 Deputies but, with a population of 1,025,304, another seat is warranted to bring it closer to the national average. Dublin deserves no less than any other area.  Between 1980 and 1990 Dublin city and county had 48 seats and its population was 4 per cent less than it is at present.  Such a change would necessiate altering the constituency boundaries and will have to be considered given the population growth in the three new couny council areas of Fingal, South County Dublin and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. In excess of 550,000 people live in these areas.</P>
    <P>My constituency, Dublin North, and Dublin West have been affected most by the growth in population.  I endeavour to represent my constituents to the best of my ability.  In the last review, part of the electoral division of Castleknock, Mulhuddart and Blanchardstown were moved to Dublin North. Established communities were divided, many did not have an affinity with the new Deputies and did not know them. The present constituency boundary goes along the Castleknock road and Castleknock and Mulhuddart were divided. Communities in the greater Dublin 15 area campaigned for better facilities but it is not an established constituency. Communities were taken from an inner city environment, housed in some of these estates and left without proper infrastructure or facilities.  They have battled together to try to improve their lot.</P>
    <P>The great cry was: &ldquo;we need a settled constituency to help the community&rdquo;. The view was that the constituencies would be changed after the next review. The report addressed this matter and endeavoured to deal with the issue by transferring part of the Blanchardstown-Mulhuddart area, with a population of 13,847, from Dublin North to <Col N="1862" /> Dublin West.  That was the position pre-1990. Notwithstanding the fact that I received an exceptionally high vote in this area in the last election, in some areas my vote was in excess of 30 per cent &mdash; Corduff, Ladyswell and Castleknock &mdash; and have represented the area well, this proposal is in the best interest of the community in Dublin 15.  I take this opportunity to thank the people in this part of my constituency for their support and courtesy.  New contacts and working relationships were established. I recall the great campaigns against the super dump in the Castleknock and Mulhuddart area and to establish a centre in Blanchardstown and so on.  I am pleased that I have been able to work with the Communities, even in a small way, to help to improve the environment in that area.</P>
    <P>Much media attention has centred recently on the need to change the PR system.  The people voted on two occasions to retain this system.  The proposal to change it had the support of the largest party, Fianna Fáil.  The people like the present system as it offers them a choice of candidates as well as parties. It should be retained until a better system is devised.  Those who recommend change argue that the system puts too much pressure on Deputies and duplicates work.  There is a certain validity in that argument but the PR system is perceived by the public as being fair.</P>
    <P>As politicians and public representatives we must be deeply concerned at the low level of political awareness among the community in general and young people in particular.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle will have a particular interest in what I am saying.  I read with great interest a survey undertaken by the youth participation committee of the National Youth Council of Ireland and the Arklow company of the Catholic Guides of Ireland.  The results of this survey were startling and disturbing. A total of 88.69 per cent of respondents did not know the constituency of Arklow was in, 95 per cent did not know the number of TDs in the constituency and less than 10 per cent knew the name of <Col N="1863" /> a TD.  I am sure they knew the Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  I hope the concentration of political activity in the general Arklow area in recent weeks will have addressed this problem to some extent.</P>
    <P>There is a much wider problem which also needs to be addressed.  The findings of this survey could apply to any town of similar size.  Whatever the reasons for it, this low level of political awareness should concentrate the minds not only of politicians but of society in general. If this issue is not addressed it will lead to widespread political apathy and may open the door for subversive and unrepresentative groups which are waiting in the wings.  We will have an opportunity to address these issues under future legislation.</P>
    <P>It has been acknowledged by parents, pupils and teachers that the transition year operated by most schools has been very successful and has given students an opportunity to widen their education on many issues, including politics.  It is great to see students being brought into the Houses of the Oireachtas to see how they work.  Many teachers and boards of management have invited public representatives to visit schools to debate and discuss politics with transition year students.  I was very impressed with the interest shown in politics by the students in the schools I visited.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the members of the commission for compiling this report.  While it was faced with a difficult task &mdash; one will never achieve 100 per cent agreement &mdash; it has done it very well.  I compliment the various groups and individuals who made submissions to the commission.  Politics must be opened up so that people know it is not only about Deputies making speeches in the Dáil.  Having read the report, it is obvious that the commission gave serious consideration to the submissions made by individuals and community groups.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  I was amazed to hear that less than 10 per <Col N="1864" /> cent of respondents in the survey to which Deputy Ryan referred knew the name of a TD as it is obvious from the by-election campaign that people in County Wicklow have great regard for their public representative.  There may be a certain dissatisfaction with the Government but I will not go into that in this debate.</P>

      <P>I agree that boundaries can only be properly revised by an independent commission.  Even if they are not happy with all the boundaries drawn up by a commission, political parties should not have the right to make submissions as it goes against the independence of the commission.  We may blame Kevin Boland and the late Jim Tully for drawing up boundaries in an effort to keep a certain party or parties in power but if this was their aim they did not succeed.  Fianna Fáil lost out in the 1973 election following a revision of boundaries and in 1977 following the creation of many four-seat constituencies, presumably to help the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil obtained the biggest majority in the history of the State and the Labour Party lost heavily.  County Galway was divided into two four-seat constituencies for that election and Fianna Fáil secured an unprecedented three out of four seats in both east and west Galway.  This proves that people will find a way of getting what they want irrespective of the boundaries, which is only right and proper.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that the membership of the commission should include a retired politician.  This would not be feasible as he or she would be put under siege by political parties and individuals looking for certain results.  Despite the shortcomings in its report, I thank the commission for the hard work in difficult circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was decided to create an extra seat <Col N="1865" /> in County Galway on the basis of the increase in population in the city and county.  I welcome this extra seat but I would like future commissions to give more consideration to the establishment of smaller constituencies.  It is very difficult for Deputies in five-seat constituencies to attend committees, contribute to debates in the House and also deal with constituency work.  In this regard I was amazed that County Mayo has been left as a five-seat constituency. Instead of lumping together counties Roscommon and Longford, which are in different provinces, the commission should have considered making counties Mayo and Roscommon one constituency.</P>
    <P>One of the shortcomings of the commission's proposals is that many areas were put together.  Some Deputies referred to parishes being divided.  Is there anything we can do on Committee Stage where there is agreement in a parish to ensure that it is left as one unit in a particular constituency?  In the past parishes were divided when Mr. Mark Killilea, MEP, and a colleague of mine a former Minister of State and Senator, Mr. Tom Hussey, represented the north Galway area.  We now have the classic example where Senator Frank Fahey's vote in south Galway is split down the middle.  He will have a difficulty in getting to either east or west Galway in a future election.  That should not happen. I favour county boundaries and council electoral areas not being breached.  It is disastrous when a parish is divided and, unfortunately, that has happened too often.  When replying will the Minister indicate, where there is agreement at local level that parishes be maintained as a unit that they will be accommodated?</P>
    <P>I campaigned in the past for a single seat constituency system.  Fianna Fáil tried on two occasions to get the agreement of the people on that.  I have been told that if we had single seat constituencies with proportional representation it would work and might be accepted by the people.  That debate should be taken further.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> In my role as a member of the Council of Europe I was invited to observe some of the elections in Central and Eastern Europe.  There the first criteria for a party to be represented in parliament is that it should receive 5 per cent support from the electorate.  That is a good idea.  In some countries a list system operates.  In other countries &mdash; Germany is probably the best example &mdash; there is a combination of a list system and a vote of the people for individual candidates.  That would be the best system but there is no point in one Deputy or one party saying that, it would need the support of the major parties in the House.</P>
    <P>The present system where the commission decides on the number of constituencies and they changed after only five or six years is disastrous.  If we are to go along with the arrangement of 12 three-seater; 15 four-seater and 14 five-seater constituencies we should leave those constituencies unchanged for ten to 12 years and give public representatives the opportunity to build up a rapport with their constituents.  Parts of County Galway have been amalgamated with Roscommon, in some instances losing territory to County Roscommon or to County Mayo.  In the past south Galway was amalgamated with County Clare.  I welcome the fact that for the first time County Galway is one unit.  I would prefer a three seat constituency in Galway rather than five and four seat constituencies.</P>
    <P>The terms of reference are the most important item we give to a boundary commission.  In rural areas where the population is dwindling they should be compensated with an extra seat.  The question of polling stations must be examined.  Some years ago we passed legislation requiring that literature and personnel be 100 metres away from a polling station but it has not worked.  On the day of an election people do not know whether they are in the correct polling station as they are not well signposted. People should be allowed vote at the nearest polling station to them <Col N="1867" /> and should not have to travel, as happens in Galway, passing two or three stations en route.  That matter will have to be addressed first, in conjunction with political parties and public representatives in each county council area. I suggest that any changes in respect of polling stations be put to the people in a referendum, not when a general election is taking place.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to participate in the debate.  I favour what the commission recommended in that it was probably the best it could do but its terms of reference were wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I confess to having mixed feelings about this legislation.  Under existing law the changes have to be made because of population variations. I have always been an advocate of a different system here.  That system would have no place for multi-seat constituencies. Multi-seat constituencies give us the worst type of Government and, at times, give us an inferior type of parliamentary representative.  Every Member elected to Dáil Éireann should be elected in a single seat constituency.</P>
      <P>I recall in the late 1950s and late 1960s the then Fianna Fáil Governments held referenda to try to change the system to a single seat non-transferable vote.  It was unfortunate that on both occasions the proposal was defeated.  If the Government of the day had opted for a single seat transferable vote system rather than a single seat non-transferable vote system I think the proposal in each case would have been carried.  It would have been a half-way house in changing the electoral system. As I recollect, the then Leader of the Opposition in the 1960s, Mr. Liam Cosgrave &mdash; later to become Taoiseach &mdash; went against the wishes of his party in advocating that there be a single seat non-transferable vote system and he was chided and criticised severely for doing so.  In retrospect he was right and the majority of us were wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The governing of this country could be done in a more effective fashion if <Col N="1868" /> we had the single seat constituency concept, whether it was based on a transferable vote or a non-transferable vote.  I had been of the opinion that the transferable vote system would be preferable and with the passage of time, the public has become more educated and sophisticated. The single seat constituency non-transferable vote system might be the best way of electing a Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence and Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I refer the Deputy to the replies to Question No. 5 on 30 March 1995 and Question No. 126 on 9 May 1995.</P>
      <P>A fundamental review of the Defence Forces has been undertaken by the efficiency audit group.  This wide-ranging examination has identified many issues which need to be addressed so that the effectiveness and efficiency of the Defence Forces can be improved.  It is envisaged that an integrated programme of reform of the Defence Forces will be drawn up and that this will include a voluntary early retirement scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been apparent for some time that the rising age profile of Defence Forces personnel will cause operational difficulties if it is not addressed in a coordinated manner.  This is one of the areas addressed by the efficiency audit group which will need early attention. <Col N="1869" /> However, the Government has yet to consider the recommendations of the efficiency audit group including the way in which these may impact on personnel policy.  I emphasise that there will be no compulsory redundancies and that any retirements will be on a voluntary basis. The Defence Forces representative associations will be consulted on all matters arising from the EAG review which come within their scope of representation, including any proposals on a voluntary early retirement scheme.  I hope it will be possible to commence preliminary discussions with the associations later in the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the age profile of the Defence Forces is rising.  The Minister's predecessor indicated that the voluntary early retirement scheme would be introduced later this year but, pending its introduction the expected number of retirements is not materialising.  There is, therefore, an urgent need to introduce the scheme. Will the consultations and negotiations be concluded in time to allow it to be introduced later this year?  It is important to remove any doubts in view of the proposed cutbacks and difficulties the Minister is encountering in securing the necessary finance to fund such a scheme, which will be expensive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Consideration of the recommendations of the EAG is a separate matter from any adjustments in public expenditure and should stand alone.  With the Department of the Taoiseach, I am preparing a memorandum for Government in which the procedure to be adopted in making the necessary changes will be outlined.</P>
      <P>We have great regard and high respect for the Defence Forces.  This is not a matter of interfering with people who have served the country exceptionally well; we are reviewing the current position where promotional opportunities are limited, wages and salaries account for the bulk of expenditure and little is available for equipment and training.  This is causing frustration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1870" /> We will not serve the Defence Forces well if we allow the numbers to increase and fail to resolve this problem.  A group will be set up to oversee the implementation of the plan while there will be adequate discussion with the various bodies affected.  It is my ambition to ensure that this process will be well under way by the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The Minister's positive response will be welcomed.

It is essential that this problem be addressed.  It may be possible to deal with it separately from some of the other major matters on which decisions are required which may take much longer to implement.  I am anxious to obtain a commitment that the scheme will be introduced before the end of the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Defence is anxious to facilitate Wicklow County Council in the provision of a water supply scheme for the west Wicklow area.  I am advised, however, that the site chosen by the council for the construction of an impoundment dam would severely restrict military usage of the Glen of Imaal as a training area. Furthermore, the area in question cannot be declared free from unexploded ordnance and would, therefore, present <Col N="1871" /> a safety risk.  These difficulties have been explained to Wicklow County Council and the council has been informed that the Department is willing to explore any alternative options which would be mutually acceptable to the council and the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's response is disappointing although I accept some details cannot be made known for security reasons.  This matter has been the subject of ongoing discussions while approximately £300,000 has been spent in conducting a site investigation.  It was only after the go-ahead was given that obstacles were encountered.  I am at a loss to understand why it was not made known that difficulties might arise while the site investigation was being conducted so that moneys could be saved and an alternative site found much earlier given the need for a water supply in the area concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1984 Wicklow County Council conducted a site investigation in the Glen of Imaal.  When the Department became aware in 1992, when the Deputy was a member of Government, that it was proposed to construct a dam in the area in question it conveyed its objections and concerns to the council which was requested to consider alternative locations on operational and safety grounds.  It is not true, therefore, that the Department only changed its mind in the past six to 12 months.</P>
      <P>I have to consider the question of safety.  It would be irresponsible of me and the Department to give the go-ahead when we have been told by the experts that it would be dangerous to construct a dam in the area concerned and they could not give a guarantee that the lives and safety of people would not be put at risk.  The decision was not taken in the past six to 12 months; it was made clear to the council three years ago that the site in question was not suitable.</P>

      <P>I am astounded by the reply which I accept is truthful.  I approved the scheme for which we were to receive approximately £6 million in Cohesion Funds in the autumn of last year.  I am now told that, notwithstanding the submission made at the time, the local authority had been aware for a number of years of the difficulties on this site.  It is an extraordinary indictment of the council that it continues to pursue a particular line for the provision of water supply which has serious locational difficulties in terms of security. Will the Minister accept the local authority should discontinue its endeavours to locate the site in that area and look for an alternative site immediately? Will he assure me that his Department will give every support necessary to ensure the scheme proceeds at a different location?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department is willing to explore alternative options that are mutually acceptable to the council and the Department.  We are very conscious of the need for a water scheme to service the west Wicklow area and will facilitate this in whatever way possible. However, I cannot agree to a site which I have been advised by experts is unsafe. I agree there is no point in flogging a dead horse; if the site is not suitable for safety reasons we would be delighted to co-operate in finding an alternative site. There have been ongoing discussions between council and Department officials on this issue and I have been advised that the dangers involved were made clear to the council in 1992.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>In consultation with the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, my predecessor authorised the withdrawal of the Army bomb disposal team from Limerick barracks.  This team had been based at Limerick since 1974 as a response to the then perceived threat and in line with bomb disposal procedures at that time.  The recent decision to withdraw the team was taken in the light of the use of this team in the past and the current procedures being employed by bomb disposal teams.  I am satisfied that the deployment and state of readiness of bomb disposal teams throughout the country are sufficient to provide all necessary protection to every airport in the State, including Shannon.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Clohessy</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his role as Minister for Defence although it is not a great change as he was previously Minister of State.  I hope he will make progress in many areas during the term as Minister.  Shannon is an international airport and even though much of Aer Lingus traffic has been transferred from it, it is used extensively by airlines from South America, the USA and Russian republics.  There is a great concern that an accident may occur in or around Shannon Airport.  Therefore I cannot <Col N="1874" /> understand why a highly trained unit that could respond instantly to a crisis at the airport is being transferred from Limerick to Cork.  Cork is 60 miles from Limerick city and 80 miles from Shannon Airport and if there was an incident at the airport it would take some time for a bomb disposal unit to travel from Collins Barracks, Cork.  I ask the Minister to immediately rescind the decision to locate the unit in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Bomb disposal teams which operate on a 24 hour basis are stationed at five centres; Dublin, Cork, Athlone, the Curragh and Finner Camp. The position has changed in the last 21 years.  If there is an emergency at Shannon, the team based at Athlone or Cork would be called in.  I am informed by the experts that in terms of bomb disposal there is an unwritten rule to hasten slowly.  Therefore, it is not a question of the team being available in five minutes. In respect of Limerick, I checked the number of requests from Shannon for the team in recent years and between January 1992 and December 1994 there were only two calls &mdash; one was a false alarm and the second was to assist in the safe disposal of a civilian helicopter flare.  This decision taken will in no way affect security arrangements at Shannon. The use of helicopters in the event of an emergency would greatly reduce the length of time it would take to travel from Cork or Athlone to Limerick &mdash; by using normal transport means the team could be there within three hours.</P>
      <P>Many areas would like to have access to a bomb disposal unit.  Before this decision was taken a great deal of consideration was given to the matter, particularly on security grounds.  There will be no diminution of the service afforded to Shannon as a result of locating the unit in Cork.  If, for security reasons, I believed the team should be relocated in Limerick I would have no hesitation in providing for that, but on the advice I have been given I am satisfied the decision is right.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The nature of the business does not dictate that.  The bomb disposal teams in the five locations I mentioned serve the whole country.  If a request is received from Shannon the same service would be provided as if the unit was based in Limerick by using a helicopter the team would be in Limerick in 20 minutes or half an hour, about the same length of time it takes to travel from Limerick city to Shannon Airport. I understand the Deputy's concern, since he represents Limerick he naturally wants to be assured that all security arrangements are in place at Shannon Airport.  If I thought it necessary I would not hesitate to reverse that decision.  The military experts assure me it is not necessary to do that.</P>

It would be similar to the Limerick fire brigade service deciding to open an office in Kilmallock 20 miles from Limerick city.  It is difficult to accept the experts' decision.  Will the Minister reconsider the decision as it is a matter of concern for the people in charge in Shannon?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the Commission's proposal to introduce veterinary health fees for fishery products.  I am glad that in the last two weeks the proposal has been taken off the veterinary agenda following strong opposition by Ireland supported by the UK.  It is unlikely to surface again, if at all, for some considerable time.</P>
      <P>In any event, I have fundamental concerns about extending the principle of charging for veterinary inspections at point of first sale to the fishing sector. Such charges have been introduced in the meat sector and this was the Commission's rationale for seeking to extend them to the fishing sector.  The Agriculture Commissioner has, however, failed to recognise that the two sectors are not at all comparable in terms of structure and scale.  The fishing industry is small and fragmented and there are over 1,000 landing places around the Irish coast.  The administrative cost alone of collecting fees would be entirely disproportionate and the additional cost to the fishing industry would be considerable.  Existing competitive disadvantages in the marketplace, through high transport costs, poor prices and competition from outside the EU, would only be exacerbated by introducing such a levy at a time when we are actively working to overcome these disadvantages.</P>
      <P>I stress that the principle of the veterinary inspections as such in the fishing sector is not at issue.  We are committed to the highest standards of health and hygiene for Irish fishery products and fully implement the relevant EU Directives, but the proposal did not take account of the unique needs and structures of the fishing industry and on that basis could not be justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, however, the Commission has pulled back from the issue and I <Col N="1877" /> would certainly discourage reintroduction of the proposal in its present form.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelSmith" hpid="Mr. M. Smith Mr. M. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted with the Minister's response.  The proposed imposition, apart from creating an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy, would lead to an increase in the price of fish in the markets and probably to a loss of income to fishermen.  It is important for the Minister to ensure that the Commission will keep this proposal off the table because estimates indicate a veterinary inspection would cost Irish fishermen in the region of £1 million.  While I have no objection to the introduction of the best possible hygiene standards, and everybody here will support that, it is crucial that we do not introduce additional unnecessary burdens and bureaucracies into an industry which is facing mounting difficulties. Will the Minister continue to ensure that such proposals, which do not take into account peripheral countries like ours with many landing areas and small stocks, are not adopted in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 45 together.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware Shell (UK) Exploration and Development Limited announced on Tuesday evening last that it had abandoned its plan to dump the <i>Brent Spar</i> at sea.</P>
      <P>Shell informed us that it found itself in an untenable position and felt that it would not be possible to continue with sea disposal without wider support from the Governments participating in the Oslo and Paris Conventions.  The company had decided to abandon deep-water disposal and to seek a licence from the UK authorities for onshore disposal.</P>
      <P>We were totally opposed to Shell's intention to dump the redundant offshore installation, the <i>Brent Spar</i>, in UK territorial waters in the north west Atlantic some 220 miles from the north west coast of Ireland.  Such dumping would have posed a major threat to the marine environment.</P>
      <P>We had been in ongoing communications with the UK Department of the Environment and the Scottish Agriculture and Fisheries Office which holds responsibility for granting licences under the UK Food and Environment Act, 1985 seeking clarification on certain aspects of the proposal.  I also urged them not to proceed with sea disposal to afford an opportunity to the Oslo and Paris Commissions, OSPAR, to discuss the potential impact of the dumping on the marine environment and the best practicable environmental option for disposal.  We were also in communication with Shell, owners of the <i>Brent Spar</i>, urging it not to proceed with the proposed dumping.  The media and public generally were at all times kept advised of my actions in this respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission meets next week commencing Monday, 26 June, and I am satisfied that a number of the contracting parties to the conventions which had similar concerns to my own on the proposed dumping will wish to review the <i>Brent Spar</i> case and the <Col N="1879" /> future disposal of decommissioned offshore installations.  Administrative and scientific officials of the Department will be in attendance at the meeting.</P>
    <P>Under the Oslo Convention for the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, 1972 offshore installations may be dumped at sea but strictly in accordance with the terms of the convention.  Fundamentally, these terms allow for the licensing of such dumping provided that it has no negative impact on the marine environment. The Scottish office had indicated it was satisfied that the proposal complied fully with international obligations under the London, Oslo and the new OSPAR Conventions and that it was the best practicable environment option.</P>
    <P>We had available to us in considering the proposed dumping the scientific expertise of the fisheries research centre of the Department of the Marine and of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland.  On the basis of this expertise I am satisfied that the proposed dumping would not have been in full compliance with the Oslo Convention Guidelines on the Dumping of Offshore Installations at Sea.  According to these guidelines all hazardous or noxious materials must be removed prior to dumping.  The Scottish office had acknowledged that Polychlorinated By-phenyl, PCB residues and oily sludge would remain in the installation at time of dumping.  At the same time the level of radioactive scaling which would remain in the pipe lining was in excess of the International Atomic Energy Agency Basic Safety Standard Guidelines.  In general, in furtherance of the precautionary principle adopted by the Oslo-Paris Conventions and the new OSPAR Convention I could see no justification for disposal at sea.</P>
    <P>Earlier this month, the Irish Government was represented at the Fourth International Conference on the Protection of the North Sea, held in Denmark, by a senior official of the Department of the Environment.  A statement was <Col N="1880" /> submitted by Ireland to that conference strongly questioning the UK marine dumping proposal.  This concern was also reflected in the eventual conference declaration in which the majority of states agreed that decommissioned oil installations should be either reused or disposed of on land.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned earlier, I am pleased with the decision made by Sheel and trust that discussions at the forthcoming Oslo and Paris meeting can pave the way for agreement that future decommissioned offshore installations will either be reused or disposed of on land. I shall continue to use every avenue open to me to prevent the dumping of offshore installations at sea.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the decision of Shell not to proceed with the dumping of the <i>Brent Spar</i> oil rig. The episode has proved that mighty multinationals, like Shell, cannot ignore public opinion on environmental issues. Is the Minister satisfied that the Government moved early enough to deal with the matter as there appears to be a perception that it was weak and slow and only acted after Greenpeace highlighted the issue?  Is he concerned about the secrecy surrounding the proposal to dump the <i>Brent Spar</i> at sea? Does he accept that if information had not been leaked the installation could have been dumped before we had been made aware of it?  Also, does he agree that the proposed dumping would have constituted a time bomb for our marine environment?  Does he believe that the UK Government and Shell should have had the courtesy to notify him and the Minister for the Marine of such a proposal? What steps does he propose taking to ensure an obligatory notification of such proposals in future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We acted quickly on the matter.  Iceland was the first country to raise objections to dumping the installation at sea and we were the second. We objected last May, prior to the more recent publicity on the issue, we <Col N="1881" /> repeated our concerns on a number of occasions and they were communicated to the Department of the Environment in the United Kingdom, the Scottish Office and to Shell.  During the episode I was concerned about the apparent attempts to pre-empt the discussions of the OSPAR Convention next week. There appeared to be an attempt to move the rig out to sea and have it dumped in advance of next week's convention. We expressed that view publicly and to the UK authorities.  I understand a similar view was expressed by a number of other governments and I welcome the response from Shell.</P>
      <P>We were also concerned that the dumping would create a precedent because of the large number of other offshore installations requiring decommissioning in the near future.  If one disused rig was dumped at sea, it would create a precedent for dumping others. For that reason, we argued vigorously that the issue should be dealt with at the OSPAR Convention and that reuse or disposal on land would be preferable.</P>
      <P>Since the decision by Shell not to proceed with the dumping, we submitted a paper to the OSPAR Convention repeating our arguments for the desirability of land based disposal.  We were contacted today by Sweden who requested our support for a moratorium on dumping disused oil installations at sea pending the outcome of the OSPAR discussions.  We agreed to support such a moratorium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Members should be deeply indebted to the Greenpeace campaigners who shadowed the <i>Brent Spar</i> on its journey, particularly the Irish and other nationalities who risked their lives in boarding the installation.  Are such offshore installations not specifically covered in the terms of the Oslo and Paris Conventions?  Following the Swedish approach, and to ensure we do not have a repeat of the recent eposide, will this be a matter for future discussions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to a specific <Col N="1882" /> reference to offshore installations in the OSPAR Convention, the dumping of any material at sea was covered by the earlier Oslo and Paris Conventions.  The question of dumping disused oil rigs was specifically discussed at the North Sea Conference last week where dumping on land or the adoption of a reuse policy was recommended.  That recommendation is on the agenda for the OSPAR Convention and was one of the reasons we argued that the dumping should not proceed in advance of that convention. As I stated already, we submitted a paper to the Convention recommending disposal on land or the adoption of a reuse policy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Does the Minister accept that the over-the-top support of the British Government for Shell's proposed decision on the dumping of the <i>Brent Spar</i> highlights that its members are not very responsible Europeans and cannot be trusted by its neighbours.  Obviously they perceive the sea as no more than a transport route and rubbish skip for hazardous and mysterious waste?  Will the Minister seek urgent talks with his UK counterparts to ascertain how they propose disposing of the 53 oil and gas rigs they claim are obsolete?  Will their dumping affect us directly or indirectly in the future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>We dispute the conclusion of the UK authorities that the dumping of the <i>Brent Spar</i> at sea complied with the London Dumping Convention and the Oslo and Paris Conventions. The advice of the fisheries research centre and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland highlights that it did not.  Our general view is that the sea is not a dumping ground for the hazardous, toxic and radioactive materials that were on board the <i>Brent Spar.</i>  We do not accept the old-fashioned concept of &ldquo;dispose and disperse&rdquo;, that if something is dumped deep enough in the sea, it will eventually disperse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have decided that the OSPAR Convention is the appropriate forum for <Col N="1883" /> dealing with the disposal of the other oil rigs and our decision has been supported by many of the contracting parties to that Convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TrevorSargent" hpid="Mr. Sargent Mr. Sargent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sargent</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister clarify his reference to the agenda for the OSPAR Convention?  From a legal point of view there is a major difference between putting an item on the agenda and including a new section in the terms of the convention.  By stating that he will endeavour to ensure a similar episode is avoided in the future, does the Minister mean the convention will adopt a resolution or insert a legally binding section to avoid any loopholes in future?  I understand there are approximately 400 such installations which in time will face similar problems to those of the <i>Brent Spar.</i>  Will the provisions announced by the Minister last evening be relevant to them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>As I am sure Deputy Sargent is aware, the OSPAR Convention is the new convention which combines the old Oslo and Paris Conventions. The legislation to which he referred is the Dumping at Sea Bill, to be published shortly, to allow us ratify the new OSPAR Convention speedily. It is our intention that the conclusion reached by the OSPAR Convention on the disposal of offshore oil installations will bind all of the contracting parties to that convention.  We support the call for a moratorium on dumping all such installations at sea pending the outcome of the deliberations on the OSPAR Convention and, if necessary, will seek to have that policy incorporated as one of the terms of that convention.</P>

The permitted strength level for the FCA unit based in County Kerry, 15 Infantry Battalion, is 902 all ranks.

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the overall permitted strength of the FCA of 16,361 a difficulty arises.  Each unit is allotted a certain number, which means that if the allocation to one unit is increased a corresponding number must be taken from another.  As the Deputy will appreciate, there are very few units, if any, prepared to give way on their permitted strength.  In some areas in County Kerry, where there are six companies &mdash; in Tralee, Caherciveen, Dingle, Killarney, Killorglin and Listowel &mdash; there is great interest in membership of the FCA, on which I congratulate the people of Kerry.  They are already at their permitted strength of 902.  It would be difficult to increase their strength by diminishing another.  Perhaps we can re-examine the overall position.  I will endeavour to facilitate the Deputy to the greatest extent possible.</P>

      <P>Competitions for the recruitment of apprentices in the Army and Air Corps are currently under way in my Department.  This year there are a total of 30 apprenticeships available in the Defence Forces &mdash; 15 in the Army and 15 in the Air Corps.  The number is lower than in previous years due to a reduction in the number of vacancies for <Col N="1886" /> technicians in the various trades as result of low wastage in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no need to recruit motor mechanic apprentices this year as numbers are sufficient as there has been very low wastage in recent years.  There are 12 civilian teachers employed by County Kildare Vocational Education Committee at the Army Apprentice School in Naas, seconded to my Department on a repayment basis.  One additional teacher was seconded on a two-year contract, which will end on completion of the current academic year.  He will revert to the County Kildare Vocational Education Committee if the Army Apprenticeship School does not need his services, but the remaining 12 civilian teachers will remain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that his decision not to recruit any motor mechanic apprentices this year has resulted in the services of this individual no longer being required?  Will he also agree that we have obtained extremely good value for the money expended on those motor mechanic apprentices who won 11 national awards since 1986?  While we pump money into other training schemes, the end result of which is doubtful, will the Minister agree there can be no doubt about those apprentices receiving training, unequalled nationwide, since they won awards annually since 1989, and have usually come first or second in national examinations?  While the Minister said he did not intend introducing a compulsory redundancy scheme &mdash; pointing to <Col N="1887" /> low wastage as the cause of lower recruitment will he agree on the urgency of bringing forward his proposals to implement real reform within our Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of apprentices recruited annually is dependent on vacancies for technicians in the various trades and in recent years there has been a lower number of technicians leaving the Defence Forces, that phenomenon being reflected in the number of apprentices being recruited. Over the past five years the numbers have been reducing steadily simply because people have not left.  I do not know whether the EAG will recommend a change in that position but, since those entering will be young, it is unlikely they will want to leave.  The most recent teacher employed was employed on a two-year contract basis from County Kildare Vocational Education Committee.  It was obvious from statistics from the preceding five years that the number required were steadily reducing.  That was a wise decision by my predecessors.  There is little point in having people engaged there if their skills are not being used when they could be used, perhaps by the vocational education committee, somewhere else.  I share the Deputy's praise and admiration both for the level of teaching at the apprentice school and the fine apprentices it is turning out. That reflects overall the high quality of our young people.</P>

Last weekend, I attended the launch of a book in Limerick to commemorate the role played by the late Gerry O'Dwyer, one of the founder members of the Equitation School which is dear to the hearts of everyone.  It was founded by the Minister's party in 1926 and has been a source of pride for us down through the years.  I would be deeply saddened to attend a horse show at which our Army was not represented.  In certain circumstances, would the Army be prepared to have horses sponsored by the private sector?  Also, will the Equitation School consider taking on female recruits?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I have requested a review of the Equitation School.  This school was set up in 1926 with the express intention of promoting the non-thoroughbred horse and has been extremely successful in doing that. Those who regard the Equitation School as a cost to the State should recognise that when our teams go abroad and are represented by the Army Equitation School, they are advertising the Irish horse.  I hope we will have new recruits to the school this year.  I noted what the Deputy said in relation to gender balance but there is an interviewing process which must take place in accordance with normal rules applying to cadetships in the Defence Forces.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1889" /> I have spoken to the Chairman of Bord Fáilte about seeking moneys from the board for the Equitation School in its efforts abroad.  I made the point that we are promoting Ireland and that we could use the Board Fáilte symbol to indicate it was assisting in funding our terms abroad.  I do not have any major objection to sponsorship if it results in better quality horses and more riders. The school recently leased a horse instead of buying one but the whole area of funding in terms of the ongoing purchase of horses will have to be examined. We must continue to recruit new riders to ensure a constant flow of top quality riders to represent us.  There is little point in having a good rider and a bad horse representing us abroad. Equally there is little point in having a good horse and a bad rider.  We must get the combination right.  All these matters are being examined and I would welcome the assistance of Members from all sides of the House.  This is not a party political issue; it is an issue that is dear to all.  I would be happy to examine ideas or suggestions from Deputies. We are all proud of the Equitation School and we will do everything possible to assist it in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his efforts on behalf of the Equitation School.  As a Minister of State he became personally involved in this matter. As has already been said, the horse has a special place in the hearts of most Irish people.  The Equitation School will provide many opportunities for people if it is properly used and if it receives the assistance it so urgently requires. The Minister referred to bad horses and good riders.  Six of the winning horses at Royal Ascot yesterday were ridden by Irish jockeys so this is an industry we should not take for granted.  I thank the Minister for the concern he has shown in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett Mr. Barrett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  At my request we are making a special effort to recruit people with the required skills but all cadets must be commissioned in the normal way.  They are required to do all the other duties because they are Army officers.  If something happened to them which resulted in their being unable to ride, they would at least have a career within the Defence Forces.  It is only proper, therefore, to afford them that opportunity.</P>

Included in these are 186 other ranks' married quarters located outside barracks sold to the occupants under the terms of a departmental purchase scheme which was in line with the terms of a local authority tenant purchase scheme.  A further two such quarters, which became vacant after the expiry of the scheme, were sold to serving members of the Defence Forces on a competitive tendering basis.  In addition, seven officers' married quarters were sold to the occupants at prices <Col N="1891" /> advised by the Commissioner of Valuation.

      <askee>Minister for the Marine</askee>
      <Quest>the action, if any, he intends to take in view of the transportation of nuclear weapons through the Irish Sea, sailing very close to the Irish coastline exposing Irish people to a serious nuclear threat; and if he will protest in the strongest terms possible to the British Government in this regard.</Quest>
      <QRef>[11508/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore) Eamon Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a firm objective of Government policy to bring about a situation whereby it will no longer be possible for nuclear material and nuclear weapons to be transported through the Irish Sea.  We are pursuing this objective through all avenues available to us.  It will be appreciated that <Col N="1892" /> these matters are regulated by international obligations.  In order to achieve our objective we need to get the support of other contracting parties to these conventions.</P>
      <P>On the specific matter of the transportation of nuclear weapons we have taken a very strong line.  We have written to the UK authorities informing them that the recent reports on the movements of nuclear weapons by the military through the Irish Sea are a matter of serious public concern in Ireland and that such movements present difficulties for the Irish Government.  The initial response from the UK is that they no longer deploy nuclear weapons on board Her Majesty's ships but that such weapons may be transported by sea. They further state that shipments do not take place outside UK territorial waters, that safety is of paramount importance wherever nuclear weapons are concerned and that it is long-standing policy of UK Governments neither to confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons at particular times and locations.</P>
      <P>Warships, naval auxiliaries or other ships owned and operated by a state and used solely on that state's non-commercial service are normally exempt from international conventions regulating marine transport, maritime safety and protection of the marine environment. However, contracting states to those conventions are asked to ensure that exempted ships act in a manner consistent, a far as is reasonable and practicable, with the international conventions.</P>
      <P>Under existing international law warships have a right of innocent passage without notification through the territorial waters of any state.  Entry of foreign warships into Irish ports is a matter for the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Pending enactment of future international law it is Government policy to refuse entry if the vessel is carrying nuclear weapons or the visit is part of a naval exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concerns on the movement of nuclear weapons through the Irish Sea are threefold.  The transport of such materials through the Irish Sea which is <Col N="1893" /> a narrow, semi enclosed sea with densely populated areas in its environs, poses a threat to the safety of people living in these areas and to the marine environment generally.  The extent and nature of the risks posed by such transport demand advance notification of the transiting of ships carrying nuclear weapons or other hazardous materials so that early warning systems can be put in place to deal with possible marine emergencies in the event of an accident or collision.  The increasing traffic in the Irish Sea shipping lane is also a concern because of the increased possibility of accidents.</P>
    <P>I have taken a number of steps in this matter.  In keeping with the objective to ensure the highest standards of safety of life at sea, safety of navigation and protection of the marine environment the Department has been participating actively in ongoing discussions on these topics at international level.  In 1993 the International Maritime Organisation adopted the Code for the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium an High-Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks on Board Ships (the INF Code). The code regulates the construction, equipment and operation of ships engaged in the carriage of such substances.</P>
    <P>The Department has consistently argued that a range of complementary measures must be incorported in the code.  These measures include route planning, notification, restriction and exclusion of certain routes and emergency response plan.  Our efforts in this respect, for which we have support from other small coastal states, will continue. The subject is on the agenda of the upcoming meeting of the marine environment protection committee, a sub-committee of the International Maritime Organisation.</P>
    <P>More recently the Department participated in International Maritime Organisation discussions on the introduction of mandatory reporting and ships' routing systems for vessels carrying hazardous cargoes.  The former will come into force internationally on 1 <Col N="1894" /> January 1996; the later on 1 January 1997.</P>
    <P>As I said our proposed strategy is to bring about a situation whereby it will be no longer possible for nuclear materials and nuclear weapons to be transported through the Irish Sea.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Question No. 46 in my name is similar to this question but it refers to nuclear waste.  Is the Minister aware that warheads were transported on the <i>Kinterberry</i> through the Irish Sea?  Those warheads previously were moved on land but on this occasion they were transported by sea.  Was the Minister's Department notified in this regard?  If we are told in advance is there any way we can monitor this activity and, in the event we are not told, how can it be monitored?</P>
      <P>To return to my Question No. 46 on nuclear waste, what has been the result of the task force's deliberations on Sellafield-THORP?  I understand from the reply to my recent parliamentary question that the task force met on two occasions but has it come to any conclusion on the transport of nuclear waste through the Irish Sea to a place such as Sellafield?  What progress has the task force made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It was my intention to reply separately to the Deputy's question. On the question of the transport of warheads on the <i>Kinterberry,</i> the subject of Deputy Sargent's question, my Department was not notified of the intention to transport nuclear warheads through the Irish Sea, neither was the Irish Marine Emergency Service nor, as far as I am aware, any other Department of State.  We contacted the UK authorities and made it clear that we were opposed to such movement, that it caused particular public concern in Ireland and posed a number of difficulties for the Irish Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The movement of materials through seas is governed by international conventions. We have commenced the process whereby it is our intention through <Col N="1895" /> the International Maritime Organisation to seek routing procedures which would exclude the Irish Sea as a sea through which either nuclear warheads, nuclear waste or nuclear material of any kind may be transported.  We are pursuing that matter through the International Maritime Organisation.</P>
    <P>The Government has established an interdepartmental committee to co-ordinate the efforts of the various Departments which have an involvement in the Sellafield issue.  As Deputy Dermot Ahern is aware, that involves the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications, the Radiological Protection Institute, the Departments of Foreign Affairs, the Environment and the Marine.  The committee has met and has made its report to Government.  It is continuing to meet to co-ordinate the efforts by the various Departments in pursuit of Government policy on the issue of Sellafield.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that those with their hands on the levers of power in Britain have treated this country in a cavalier fashion?  I repeat the remark I made on the commissioning of THORP the day after the signing of the Joint Declaration. Would the Minister accept that the British Government has again treated this State in a cavalier fashion in that it did not notify us as a friendly neighbouring State of the fact that very hazardous material was being transported through the Irish Sea?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why was the British Ambassador not contacted by our Government to let her and the Government of which she is a representative know of the extreme disquiet of this nation at the way we have been treated in this regard?  Given that I asked this of the Taoiseach the other day but he declined to answer, will the Minister say what progress has been made as to the setting up of an intergovernmental conference on the Irish Sea, something we on this side of the House would agree with?  It seems nothing is being done in that regard. <Col N="1896" /> That is particularly regrettable given that this material was transported up the Irish Sea in the past couple of weeks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government is extremely unhappy that we were not notified of the movement of this material.  When we contacted the UK authorities they told us it is not their practice to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weapons on board ships at sea.  The movement of ships through the sea is governed by international convention, and the approach we are taking is to use those international conventions to seek a regime whereby the Irish Sea will be excluded from the movement of nuclear materials.  That will take some time and effort and will require the support of other contracting parties to the various conventions.  We have also sought to have the INF code included in two EU directives which, in relation to shipments, would require advance notification of the movement of materials which are governed by the INF code which would include nuclear waste.</P>
      <P>On the question of an intergovernmental conference, there is an intergovernmental co-ordinating group which was established by the Governments of the two countries, the Departments of the Environment and the Marine on this side and the Department of the Environment on the UK side, which has been conducting a study on the Irish Sea.  It has produced two reports already and its final report is due to be published shortly.  It is our intention to use that report as the basis for the future management of the Irish Sea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>No evidence has been made available to the Department of the Marine about an increase in sea bed levels in Dublin Bay.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there is a public perception that the causeway to Bull Island, constructed by Dublin Corporation may have increased levels of siltation in the area.  This is a matter for Dublin Corporation to investigate and they have recently commissioned consultants to carry out a study on siltation levels and other environmental impacts of the causeway.  The Department will co-operate with Dublin Corporation and their consultants in any way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled this question because, since being elected a member of Dublin Corporation in 1985, the corporation officials have refused to move <Col N="1898" /> one iota in regard to the breaching of the Bull Island causeway.  There is genuine public concern about the long-term effect of the causeway to the Bull Island which will no longer be an island if the sedimentation continues to occur as rapidly as it has done since the causeway was built.  Given that the studies will indicate there has been rapid sedimentation in the immediate aftermath of the development of the causeway, and an increase in sea bed levels, will the Minister support the breaching of the causeway?  I would welcome a clear yes or no answer from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Callely's question is premised on his assertion that the studies will indicate there is an increase in siltation.  We do not know what the studies will indicate.  Dublin Corporation has engaged consultants, and we will have to await their report.  When that report has been received, it will be for Dublin Corporation to deal with the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Excuse the pun, but the Minister seems to be somewhat at sea. There are already studies to indicate that there has been rapid sedimentation. I am surprised the Minister is not aware of those.  I appreciate that this is a hypothetical question, but given that we already have such a study and that the local yachting clubs can confirm an increase in sea bed levels, with or without a report, will the Minister support the need for the breaching of the causeway if the conclusion of the study being undertaken by ESB International confirms the existing report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonGilmore" hpid="Mr. Gilmore Mr. Gilmore">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gilmore</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible for me to answer a hypothetical question.  This is a matter for Dublin Corporation in the first instance.  It has engaged consultants who will report to the corporation which can then make an application to the Department of the Marine under the 1993 Foreshore Act.  When such an application is made it will be considered.  We have made a number of inquiries of Dublin Corporation as to <Col N="1899" /> the progress of the report and any assistance Deputy Callely can provide as a member of Dublin City Council will certainly be welcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I must express my surprise yet again at the Minister's response.  He was unaware of the rapid sedimentation immediately after the causeway was built, and now he is unaware that the study which is being undertaken by ESB International of 18 St. Stephen's Green, Dublin, only commenced this week &mdash; they were receiving submissions until this week and will not be reporting for one year.  There will be little or no progress on the study. This matter is of grave concern to the majority of people living on the north side of the city and whoever is responsible should take an interest and get a handle on the matter.

      <P>Is it true that the payment of compensation for loss of earnings to crew members of fishing vessels <Col N="1901" /> arising from the bad weather conditions experienced during November and March was limited to social welfare levels? The payments were quite small, £951, yet the bulk of the money was paid to vessel owners who received, on average, £5,000.  What was the maximum payment to boat owners? Surely the scheme was introduced to compensate people for loss of earnings because of bad weather.  Those who applied for dole did not receive any compensation, nor did those whose fishing income exceeded £2,070 for the five month period.  It seemes a miserly way to compensate fishermen whose main income would have been gained during that time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>These took account of such matters as family dependants, income from fishing and other sources and any social welfare payments received.  The maximum payment an individual crew member could receive was equivalent to what would have been his full entitlement under the social welfare system.  It was important to aid boat owners, to keep them in business and preserve jobs, including those of the crewmen.  The figures may seem more favourable for vessel owners&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The scheme, which was introduced before we took office, was administered with as much flexibility as possible.  The maximum amount paid to any single boat owner did not form part of the question and I do not have that information.  However, if it is available I will get if for the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte) Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>The High Court is the only body that permits a company to go under the protection of the court but it only does so where there are reasonable prospects that the entity, or a significant proportion of it, has a viable future.  The Deputy will be aware that a petition may be presented for the protection of the High Court by (a) the company, (b) the directors of the company, (c) a creditor or contingent or prospective creditor including an employee of the company or (d) members of the company holding not less than 10 per cent of the equity or by all or any of those parties, together or separately.</P>
      <P>By right, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment can intervene only where the petition is in respect of an insurer.  As a result of the recent court action by Irish Press plc in connection with the competition report, costs were awarded to the Department.  However, the sum involved is negligible and not of sufficient size to justify intervention by means of an examiner application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have repeatedly indicated my concern to see as much diversity as possible in the Irish media.  The situation in the Irish Press is essentially a business one compounded by industrial relations <Col N="1903" /> problems and the Irish Press titles have suffered radically declining circulation over a long period.  A recent Supreme Court decision represented a further serious setback for the group.</P>
    <P>The industrial relations record of the company over a long period has been far from good and current difficulties are a further indication of that.  The Companies (Amendment) Act, 1990, is not designed to address the issues which are evident in the Irish Press, which I do not need to further indicate to the House.  The requirements of company law in the circumstances reflect that decision.  There is no role for me, as Minister, in the process on which the company or others have embarked.</P>
    <P>In view of the decision of Irish Press Newspapers to go into liquidation I am awaiting developments and, consequently, it would not be appropriate to take immediate action until the position is clearer.  I am keeping the evolving situation under review.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

      <P>I thank the Minister for his reply.  The workers brought their application before the court today.  All parties withdrew and are to meet again at 4 o'clock this evening.  What the Minister of State said may well be the substance of the matter but I would have to take further advice on the size of the equity.  The duty of the Minister and the Department of Enterprise and Employment extends beyond what the Minister of State said.  I understand from the workers, who are members of different trade unions, that if an examiner were appointed they would regard such a person as an honest broker in this muddied and muddled situation and as one who would oversee investors prepared to invest in the company.  If the Department joined itself with the application it would be regarded as a strong, decisive and dramatic move and may prove to be the turning point in this drama.  I urge the Minister to adopt this role rather than the role of a bystander.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary concern of my Department since the dispute was precipatated by the sacking of a senior journalist has been the jobs at the Irish Press Group and the maintenance of at least some element of diversity and pluralism in the media.  These considerations must be to the fore in any decisions we take.  If it is being represented to me that a course of action is open to us which would ensure the maintenance of the optimum number of jobs in the medium term, as distinct from tommorrow or next week, and would meet the requirement, which I think is shared across the political divide, of diversity and pluralism in the media then I will follow it.</P>
      <P>On the suggestion that the Minister should be joined as an applicant in the petition for an examiner, the legislation does not contemplate this action and would not achieve the objectives we are seeking.  If I thought it would achieve these then I would be open to be persuaded by the argument.  We have to consider the knock-on consequences of any decision we take and whether the taking of it would make the position worse.  We are not of the view that it would be helpful in the present situation to be joined with this application.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern that she and, probably more important, the Minister be seen to do something in a dispute which none of us wanted and which has given rise to an unfortunate situation for journalism and politics.  The principals of the group recently said that liquidation is and was inevitable irrespective of the industrial relations complications.  I would like to be able to say to Deputy O'Rourke that we have a way out of the impasse but the fact is that it is a private company and the principals are apparently intent on making their own decision.  Deputy O'Rourke is inviting me to adopt a course of action which would involve me commenting on what I consider to be the prospects of an examiner being appointed in the first instance under the terms of the Companies (Amendment) Act and whether this would be a good move.  I do not wish to be drawn into this as those who have initiated the action presumably consider that the outcome will be beneficial.</P>
      <P>My Department and I have formed a view on the matter and the recent report of the Company Law Review Group recommends a tightening of the test on the appointment of an examiner so that the judge and court are satisfied there is a reasonable prospect of the company in question surviving.  If I follow that line of thinking certain conclusions can be inferred which I do not wish to be inferred.  The applicants in this case did not contact my Department to advise us that they were embarking on this course or to ask us to join with them in the application.  We have to make our decision on the basis of the objective facts as we see them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Rourke, I have not had much opportunity to examine this matter in the detail I would like.  I only heard a half an hour ago that this question was being taken.  I agree it is an important issue but we still have to decide whether our intervention would be constructive in all the circumstances. Unfortunately, we are not in a position to dictate decisions on this matter.  In <Col N="1906" /> deference to the Deputy, I will be very pleased to go back to my Department and examine whether an intervention by the Minister would be constructive or beneficial having regard to the overall response outlined by him yesterday.  I am happy to give the Deputy that undertaking.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his response &mdash; it is a matter of seizing the day.  This is a political matter which can be addressed in a political fashion.  If the course of action I have outlined increases the chances of retaining the jobs and securing proper investment then I urge the Minister to take it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatRabbitte" hpid="Mr. Rabbitte Mr. Rabbitte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Rabbitte</NameTxt>
      <P>I probably should have said that the appointment of an examiner is normally sought in the case of an ongoing trading concern.  From memory I do not know of any circumstances where an examiner has been appointed outside a trading concern.  The group concerned is not currently trading.  That is a material factor.</P>
      <P>I do not know of any case where an examiner was sought, appointed by the court and subsequently removed the management.  I am not sure everybody would agree, in these circumstances, that staving off the creditors for a period to allow a person appointed by the courts to examine the books of the company and probably find what most of us already have reasonable knowledge of, with the existing management, is likely to be a more beneficial outcome.  It is probably inevitable in view of the decisions threatened for 28 June.  I undertake to examine every aspect of this dispute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was referring to the electoral system and advocating that the multi-seat system be changed to a single seat system.  It is a matter of opinion as to whether there should be a transferable vote or a single non-transferable vote.  I was of the opinion for many years that the single transferable vote system would be preferable but I am open to conversion on the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A single non-transferable vote system might give us a far stronger and healthier form of Government, which is most desirable.  As individual Members of the <Col N="1949" /> Oireachtas we are inclined to think of ourselves and our own seats.  That is perfectly normal and human but undesirable where the good of the country is concerned.  We should be most concerned about a system which gives us the best type of Government.</P>
    <P>The multi-seat system is counterproductive. It is wasteful, indecisive and at the end of the day is not for the betterment of the people.  If we are to get a system which is for the betterment of the public and the country the single seat system should be introduced.</P>
    <P>The multi-seat system means that the bulk of Deputies spend considerable time performing mundane tasks, competing with the other Deputies in their constituency.  That is extremely wasteful. It gives rise to a parish pump type of politics which is highly undesirable. We are elected to Dáil Éireann by the people on the presumption that we will be parliamentarians and enact legislation which will make for a better way of life in the country.  That does not happen because of the multi-seat system.</P>
    <P>We are competing with each other to give the impression to our constituents that we are working on their behalf on an individual basis, whether it involves the allocation of moneys for houses, water schemes, roads or a multiplicity of items.  That should not be the duty of a Member of Parliament.  Our duty is to legislate and to run the country.  That task will never be performed properly while the multi-seat system is in operation.</P>
    <P>Politicians are often unaware that change is taking place.  I will give a simple example.  A by-election is taking place in Wicklow.  When a by-election took place in Wicklow 30 or 40 years ago one could easily choose the likely winner; the chances are it would have been the Fianna Fáil or the Fine Gael candidate.  Fine Gael history in by-elections in Wicklow is very good.  Nowadays it is not so easy to choose the winner. The current by-election campaign is so fluid that any one of six or seven candidates could win.  We all tell the public that our candidate will win but nobody <Col N="1950" /> is sure.  I have never encountered such uncertainty in a by-election before. There is a number of strong candidates, or perhaps it would be more correct to say that none of the candidates is very strong.  While the Fianna Fáil candidate, according to the bookies, has a 2:1 on chance, every day this week in Ascot odds-on favourites have been overturned. It could well be that we will have another upset.  That is a sign of the change in political thinking here.  The old political system is not as secure or as definite as it used to be.</P>
    <P>The Green Party has a candidate in the by-election.  I looked up the statistics for the 1992 general election in Wicklow. In that election the green candidate got 1,900 votes.  Two years later, the same candidate stood for the European elections and was elected with a vote approaching 50,000.  That was a dramatic change in two years.  Nothing remains the same.  Despite our reluctance to create change it may be wrought upon us.  Some startling results may occur from time to time such as the successes of the Green Party in the last European elections.  The result of the by-election will be known in about eight or nine days.</P>
    <P>The electoral system is not in the best interests of the public or the country because of the parish pump politics to which I have referred.  The most outstanding Member of the Dáil, during the period 1989-92, was the former Deputy Pat McCartan of Democratic Left, formerly of The Workers' Party, but in the 1992 general election he lost his seat. That is an indictment of the system we operate.  He was, probably, the most competent speaker in this Chamber between 1989 and 1992 on social, legal and economic matters be it at Question Time, on the Adjournment or when dealing with legislation.  He was an outstanding Member of Dáil Éireann. Others who had not spoken in the Chamber were re-elected.  Although it was recorded in one of the national daily newspapers that a particular Senator had not uttered a word in the <Col N="1951" /> Seanad he headed the poll.  I have been advising him since that he should not make any speeches as he will only lose votes.</P>
    <P>The moral is that the Members should remain quiet, look after their constituents and do all the menial tasks and they will be here for life unless their constituency is carved up.  That is what happened in the case of the Acting Chairman's constituency in the recent revision.  He lost some of the juiciest voting areas in Wicklow.  I sympathise with him but he is such an outstanding performer in the House that I have no doubt he will overcome any handicap and will again survive whenever the next general election is held.</P>
    <P>The system we operate is not a good one.  It is time the parties in this House did something about it but they are so protective of their seats they will not agree to make changes.  Fianna Fáil was the first to recommend changes in the 1950s and 1960s but since it no longer possesses the ability to gain an overall majority it has not pursued the matter any further.  This is a pity.</P>
    <P>In the Wicklow by-election in which there are seven candidates I hope the Fine Geal candidate will be elected.  A Bill should be introduced to ban election canvassing, the displaying of posters and the distribution of literature.  In Sweden and other Scandinavian countries political parties conduct their campaigns in a civilised way through the media &mdash; radio, television and newspapers. The first small step in this direction was taken in recent years when it was decided that canvassers would have to remain a certain distance from the entrance to a polling station to prevent scuffles breaking out &mdash; this was barbaric &mdash; as canvassers tried to convince voters that their party's representative was the best candidate.  Perhaps we will mature although I despair at times.</P>
    <P>I compliment the commission whose decision is in accordance with its terms of reference.  I am sorry that its findings do not find favour with the Acting <Col N="1952" /> Chairman &mdash; long may these commissions remain independent &mdash; but I hope in the future that we will have single seat constituencies and that commissions will revise constituencies on that basis.</P>

      <P>This merits consideration in the case of some of the larger counties, including Tipperary and Cork. What is the rationale behind not having such constituencies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Due to the decline in population it has been recommended that my constituency of Dublin South Central should be enlarged.  I welcome the inclusion in that constituency of an area that was included in 1989.  It forms part of the historic area of Dublin South Central, well represented for many <Col N="1953" /> years by the late Frank Cluskey.  I look forward to working with the people in that area whom I first met as a politician in 1989.</P>
    <P>The work of the earlier commissions has been very fair in that the number of Deputies in each party corresponds with the proportion of the vote obtained by those parties.  The number of Dáil seats held by Fianna Fáil and Labour corresponds to the proportion of the vote they received nationally, but in this Dáil Fine Gael fared better in that regard. The Labour Party received 19.3 per cent of the vote at the last election and has 33 seats in the Dáil.  In the case of the Fianna Fáil Party there is also a fair proportion of seats to the number of votes it received.  Some of the smaller parties do not fare as well and even though they receive a number of votes they are not represented in the Dáil.  Generally the system has been very fair and I have no doubt the present proposals will not change that position.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers referred to the difficulties with the PR system and nobody will dispute that it contains many faults.  The merits of the system only become fully apparent when it is compared to the alternatives.  Despite the limitations of the system, it meets the wishes of the people.  It gives the public and politicians a choice.  For example, if politicians dissent from their party they have the opportunity to put their case to the public.  There have been examples of Deputies who had disagreements with their parties, in some cases the public vindicated them while in others they voted against them.</P>
    <P>Despite the many attractions of a list system I would be concerned at the level of power in parties' central offices. Those offices are not comprised of elected people and it would be undesirable if they became excessively influential in determining the people who would be elected.  That is a matter for the public who are well able to make up their minds about whom they elect.  One of the attractions of the political system, despite its great limitations, is that most <Col N="1954" /> people have a good idea of the characteristics, attitudes and mentality of the people for whom they vote.  It is more desirable that the public find out that information personally than through the media and other organs. Despite the fact that this system may not meet the wishes of many people, in the longer term it has a lot to commend it and is much more attractive than many of the alternatives.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the portrayal of politics generally as much of it is negative and unfair, which is bad for democracy. The people responsible should be fairer in terms of the image they portray of politicians.  Broadly speaking, politicians are honest and honourable and do the best they can.  To portray them as low grade crooks is unfair and ignorant. I wonder whether people who portray politicians in such a way do so for opportunistic reasons.  It is damaging in terms of its effect on public morale and the public's attitude towards politicians. Many criticisms may be made, and virtually everybody may be portrayed as a knave or a charlatan, but there is an obligation on the media to be fair.</P>
    <P>I listened with great interest to Deputy Deasy's contribution but I do not agree with his remarks on electioneering. It is desirable that the public know politicians well, and that is the case.  I would be concerned if the only contact the public had with politicians was via radio and television.  What is the objective of those who control access to the media?  They all have an objective or an agenda.  I agree with Mr. John Waters of <i>The Irish Times</i> that there is no such thing as an unbiased media, virtually nobody is unbiased.  It is not desirable that political assessments be made as a result of television and radio coverage. Matters are very often distorted on radio and television and the full picture is not presented.  Fortunately for the most part people are shrewd and decide themselves for whom they wish to vote.</P>
    <P>On the factors that influence people in voting.  Deputy Deasy made interesting remarks that are worthy of <Col N="1955" /> considerable analysis.  I sometimes wonder whether people vote for personalities or parties, whether they are influenced by who the Taoiseach may be, or perhaps they are influenced to some degree by all these factors.</P>

      <P>I thank all Deputies who made good points on the Bill.  Many of them referred to the position 20 years ago when constituency revision was carried out by the Government of the day.  We have dealt with that matter in detail and many constituency revisions were the subject of acrimonious debate here.  The practice of appointing an independent commission to advise on constituency revision was universally welcomed.  Clearly some Deputies are unhappy with aspects of the present proposals and it is significant that many of the speakers today are from areas affected by the findings of the commission.  Some Deputies asked questions about the procedure adopted by the commission and how it set about framing its proposals.  I cannot answer those questions because I do not have any information other than that contained in the report.  The information I have is available to Deputies in the House.</P>
      <P>In the case of Mayo which stands to lose a seat, the commission considered an association with each of the neighbouring counties before concluding that the appropriate arrangement is to make the county a five-seat constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision regarding the constituencies in Tipperary is another that understandably has caused some anguish. The commission did much heart searching before making its recommendations in that regard.  I doubt if any of the alternatives it listed would attract the support of the representatives of the areas concerned.  We may not all be convinced that the areas proposed for transfer from Tipperary South to Tipperary North are the most ideal, but by spreading the pain at least the proposal has the virtue of impartiality.  The outcry would <Col N="1956" /> be louder and more justified if the proposed transfer were from one side of the county to the other, say, the eastern area of Ballingarry, Mullinahone and Fethard, the central area of Cashel and its hinterland or the western area of Tipperary town.</P>
    <P>Regarding Deputy Ferris's point, the Constitution does not permit two-seat constituencies.  It also requires that there must be equality of representation between constituencies and that must be the basis of any constituency revision.</P>
    <P>Deputy Browne referred to the commission's recommendations that will affect Carlow.  The report details the considerations that led to those recommendations. Part of east Kildare is included in the five-seat Wicklow constituency. The balance of County Kildare is also a five-seat constituency. The commission proposes some worthwhile changes in Dublin from a community viewpoint, particularly in the Ballyfermot and Blanchardstown areas.</P>
    <P>There has been much comment about Galway, but it will gain an extra seat and one would have thought that proposed change would have been well received by Deputies representing that area.  However, they have clarified that they, too, have serious reservations. That illustrates the difficulty of the task that faced the commission.</P>
    <P>The commission's report is a conscientious and impartial attempt to draw up a scheme of constituencies which will be generally acceptable within the constraints of constitutional requirements, its terms of reference and practicalities on the ground.  The commission's report rightly points out that under the Constitution the revision of constituencies is a matter for the Oireachtas and that the commission's role is purely advisory. The Government accepted the commission's recommendations in full and it considers the recommendations constitute a package to be accepted or rejected by the Oireachtas.  The Government's view is that the recommendations should be implemented without <Col N="1957" /> change.  In taking that view the Government is following the established practice of implementing in full the recommendations of the independent commission.  That has been the practice regarding reports of constituency commissions since the first one was established in 1977.  There was only one noticeable exception in 1988 when the report of the commission did not come before the Oireachtas in the form of a Bill.  The principle involved is whether we entrust the formation of constituencies to an independent impartial body or revert to the old unsatisfactory partisan arrangement.  I am glad to hear such strong support for this former view from Deputy Molloy and others, including Deputy Gregory.</P>
    <P>Time does not permit me to respond in full to the many excellent points made by speakers, but I presume I will have an opportunity to deal with those issues on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now four weeks since the <i>Irish Press</i> and its sister titles, <Col N="1958" /> the <i>Evening Press</i> and the <i>Sunday Press</i> ceased publication.  We all know that capitalism abhors a vacuum.  During the past month we have witnessed the spectacle of News International in particular trying everything from price slashing to scratch cards to fill the vacuum left by the <i>Irish Press.</i>  Should they succeed, the responsible analytical journalism of the Irish Press group will be replaced by the &ldquo;Freddie Starr ate my Hamster&rdquo; school of pseudo-journalism represented by the <i>Sun</i> and other UK tabloids.  It is in the interests of the Irish media landscape that conditions be created which would facilitate a successful relaunch of the Irish Press titles.</P>
      <P>I welcome the decision of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, to establish a commission on the newspaper industry to examine wider issues and make recommendations. I hope that commission's first task will be to monitor the allegations of predatory pricing which I consider were correctly made and levelled against News International.  Following a Government meeting on Tuesday, the Minister stated that the Government had set itself the task, among other objectives, of &ldquo;...securing the highest number of employees in a revitalised Irish Press where there is a long term future for both the business and the employees, and one that is assured commercially and financially.&rdquo; Few would quarrel with that objective. However, I argue that a relaunch of the Irish Press titles will be made more difficult if its market share has been taken up by other publications.  The Minister cannot restrict News International's entry into the Irish market.  He can ensure that all players in the newspaper market abide by the rules.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two weekends ago the <i>Sun</i> halved its price from 40p to 20p on the Irish market. I am aware that in its recent report the Competition Authority found that claims of predatory pricing against UK newspapers had no foundation. However, since its interim report was published the position in the newspaper industry has been changing on an almost <Col N="1959" /> weekly basis and I believe that allegations of predatory pricing would be upheld today.</P>
    <P>I understand that the commission's composition and terms of reference are likely to be announced within the next two to three weeks and that it is likely to sit for approximately six months.  A commission along those lines is long overdue and Democratic Left called for the establishment of such a commission at its recent conference.  The newspaper industry particularly Irish Press workers, do not have time on their side. Unless appropriate action is taken within the next few weeks to investigate new changes of below cost selling, a relaunch of the Irish Press newspapers may be untenable in terms of its market position.</P>
    <P>I am particularly concerned at the recent attempt by the <i>Sun</i> to use scratch cards as a marketing ploy.  Those cards may be in contravention of the 1956 Gaming and Lotteries Act and I urge the Minister to examine the matter and ensure that News International titles desist using such gimmicks in the future.</P>
    <P>The decision to appoint a liquidator need not necessarily spell the end of the Irish Press titles, although I believe the appointment of an examiner, currently being sought by Irish Press workers, may offer the best chance of saving the titles.</P>
    <P>I am also aware that calls have been made for the Government to grant a £10 million loan to the Irish Press group to keep it afloat in the face of liquidation. While those calls are undoubtedly well intentioned, I am not aware of members of the Irish Press management making such a demand, but if that is their thinking, they should make it public. Whether the titles are relaunched following a liquidation or an examinership, the long term future of the titles cannot be guaranteed while the current management holds sway.  Messrs de Valera and Jennings have brought a once proud institution to its knees through a combination of sheer ineptitude and intransigence and they must not be allowed to <Col N="1960" /> repeat the mistakes of the past.  The best opportunity for a successful relaunch of the Irish Press titles lies in a new management operating on a level playing field.  I hope the Minister will consider my views.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Byrne for raising this issue on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>The newspaper industry plays a vital role in covering issues important to democratic debate.  I am sure we all agree it should provide stable employment, diversity of choice to the consumer and allow expression for the varied points of view that make up a pluralist society.  It should also preserve quality and cultural expression and balance the right to privacy with the right of the public to know.  It is stating the obvious that the absence from the market of the three Irish Press titles has reduced the choice of papers available to consumers and this is regrettable.  I stated previously that the country would be a better place if a revitalised Irish Press group could have a viable vibrant and commercial future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already expressed the view that the position in which the Irish Press finds itself is essentially a business one compounded by industrial relations problems.  The Irish Press titles have been suffering radically declining circulation over a long period.  The relaunch of the <i>Irish Press</i> in tabloid form in 1988 did not assist the decline in circulation. The group has also had unhappy investment experiences with the Ingersoll Group which have gone seriously wrong.  This has led to protracted litigation. The recent Supreme Court judgment represented a further serious setback for the Irish Press group.  The industrial relations record of the company over a long period has been far from good and the current difficulties are a further indication of that.  The new situation that has emerged from the <Col N="1961" /> company means that it would be inappropriate for me or the Government to finalise a decision on the Competition Authority's recommendation until the outcome of the company's actions become clear.</P>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that my decision in relation to the alleged breaches of competition law have nothing to do with the current position in the Irish Press.  The key issue for the group is new, additional investment.  I also want to make it clear that a decision on whether the Independent group's investment in and loans to the Irish Press group are in breach of sections 4 and 5 of the Competition Act, 1991, can only be made by the courts on foot of what undoubtedly would be a lengthy court action.  A decision to pursue such an action would not offer an immediate solution to the current problems facing the Irish Press group.  I am, however, keeping the evolving position, including the implications of today's High Court application for the appointment of an examiner, under continuous review and taking appropriate legal advice.</P>
    <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the price cutting engaged in by certain titles since the Irish Press titles went off the street and the question of predatory pricing.  I refer the Deputy to the conclusions of the Competition Authority in its interim report of its study on the newspaper industry, in particular, the conclusions in regard to predatory pricing in economic and legal contexts.  In its report the Competition Authority was of the view that there is no evidence to support claims that UK newspaper groups have engaged in predatory pricing of newspapers within the State.  The Competition Authority said that to establish predatory pricing has taken or is taking place, certain strict criteria are required and had not been met in the case of UK newspapers.</P>
    <P>Predatory pricing has a precise definition. It is a policy of price cutting by a <Col N="1962" /> firm in a dominant position designed to reduce or eliminate competition with the result that the firm can reap higher profits at a later stage.  For pricing to be regarded as predatory, profits are reduced for a period so that the long term effect on the market will ensure that these profits can be higher at a later stage when competition is eliminated.</P>
    <P>To demonstrate predatory pricing, it is necessary to show that the alleged predator is dominant; that the objective of price cutting is to reduce the number of competitors by eliminating one or more of them or to weaken them to a point where they can no longer offer effective competition; and that the predator will benefit from a predatory pricing policy by being able to earn supra normal profits in the future arising from the elimination of competition.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority was of the view that UK newspapers were not dominant and that predatory pricing was not taking place in the Irish market in regard to UK newspapers.  The objective of the pricing policy of the UK newspapers was not to eliminate competitors or to deter them from competing aggressively, thereby reducing the degree of intensity of competition in the marketplace.</P>
    <P>The Competition Authority in its report distinguished between predatory pricing and aggressive price competition and its conclusion was that Irish newspapers may have suffered because of aggressive competition from UK newspapers. However, aggressive competition in a marketplace is not illegal.</P>
    <P>Given the nature of the Irish newspaper industry and the large number of titles on the market, predatory pricing by one foreign newspaper could not ensure with certainty that consumers would switch to its titles.  Therefore, the title accused of predatory pricing would not be able to make the profits necessary to make predatory pricing worthwhile and neither would it eliminate <Col N="1963" /> competition.  I have accepted the Competition Authority conclusions.  Therefore, there is no action to be taken in regard to the pricing policy of UK newspapers.</P>
    <P>Earlier this week I announced that I propose to establish a commission on the newspaper industry to examine the wider issues facing the industry and to make recommendations.  The terms of reference and the composition of the commissions are currently being finalised.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Wheelchair Access to Public Transport.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="KathleenLynch" hpid="Kathleen Lynch Kathleen Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise the issue of wheelchair access Bus Éireann's urban, as opposed to Dublin, fleet and I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise the matter.  Attempts to examine the problems of people with disability must focus on the interlocked questions of independence and economics.  More than 90,000 people live with disabilities, a disproportionate number of whom live in poverty.  Last year the Irish Wheelchair Association estimated that the unemployment rate among its members was almost 90 per cent, the highest in any group.  The stark reality is that between 50 per cent and 60 per cent of people with disability live on or below the poverty line.</P>
      <P>Poverty and dependence on public transport go hand in hand.  People with disability face economic and social exclusion and their isolation is further exacerbated by lack of accessible transport, which in most cases involves public transport.  This problem has been addressed recently in the UK where the Disabled Persons' Transport Advisory Committee made a number of recommendations aimed at improving accessibility, particularly wheelchair accessibility, to public transport.</P>
      <P>In upgrading its fleet Dublin Bus has made substantial progress in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1964" /> I understand that approximately half of its fleet conform to the recommendations of the advisory committee. However, only 12 per cent of its urban fleet comply with those recommendations and that figure will increase only with the acquisition of new buses.  The information was given in reply to a question tabled by Deputy Byrne on 21 June.  We can assume progress on the urban fleet will be painfully slow, that disabled city dwellers living outside Dublin are being discriminated against, effectively being excluded from public transport.</P>
    <P>I am acutely aware of the problems faced by disabled people living in Cork wishing to travel from one part of the city to another.  The overall problem of poverty will not be addressed unless we allow people access to employment.  If a disabled person's mobility is restricted and he does not have access to transport he cannot attend an interview for a job.</P>
    <P>I consulted some of my colleagues around the country.  I have been informed by councillor John Ryan in Limerick that similar problems are encountered by disabled people in Limerick. There is urgent need to address the overall problem of public transport for disabled people outside the Dublin area in much the same way as it has been addressed within the Dublin city area.  People with disabilities cannot await the introduction of new vehicles into the fleet.  The time has come for Bus Éireann to take seriously the concerns of its disabled customers, of whom there are 90,000 either by introducting wheelchair accessible buses or implementing the necessary modifications to its existing fleet.</P>
    <P>I spent the afternoon attending a joint meeting of the Select Committee on Social Affairs and the Sub-Committee on Development Co-operation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs that dealt with social exclusion <Col N="1965" /> occasioned by poverty.  Any examination of statistics on people with disabilities, the circumstances in which they fall into the poverty trap along with their unemployment rate must lead us to the conclusion that otherwise highly skilled educated people do not have the opportunity to integrate socially and have access to job opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EmmetStagg" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg) Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Stagg)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kathleen Lynch for having raised this matter.  The issue to which she refers is a matter for the board and management of Coras Iompair Éireann and Bus Éireann, a point stressed in the course of a reply to a number of parliamentary questions tabled on this issue yesterday, which I might bring to the Deputy's attention.</P>
      <P>The question of wheelchair accessible buses is one to which the company must give careful consideration when deciding on the allocation of available resources to meet its customer requirements. Bus Éireann, as transport professionals, is fully conscious of the demand for services accessible to people with mobility impairments, including wheelchair users.  It is also aware that it is the Government's policy that it and other transport providers, should seek to achieve the highest degree of accessibility to their services, having regard to the resources at their disposal.  Consequently, in planning and operating its urban transport networks throughout the country, the company is committed to maximising accessibility while providing an overall level of service that is at once as comprehensive and cost-effective as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am advised that, since the establishment of the UK Disabled Persons Transport Advisory Committee &mdash; DPTAC &mdash; in 1985, Bus Éireann has ensured that its city bus specifications comply with the DPTAC standards, as evidenced, for example, in the ten new <Col N="1966" /> city single deck buses introduced in Cork City in 1993.  The adoption of the DPTAC standards means that the user-friendliness of the urban fleet has already begun to improve and will continue to do so in line with the company's fleet renewal programme.</P>
    <P>Of course, the implementation of these standards does not, of itself, meet the needs of those who are wheelchair users.  Achieving this aim is recognised by Bus Éireann, and by the industry generally, as a major challenge, which poses significant practical problems.  In the first place, the generally accepted solution is to introduce specialised vehicles of low-floor design.  Unfortunately, as the market stands, I am advised these vehicles are estimated to be approximately 20 per cent more expensive than buses of conventional design normally purchased by Bus Éireann and the majority of other public transport operators.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I understand that vehicles of this type, in their present state of development, have mechanical and design characteristics which render them potentially unreliable, expensive to maintain and of uncertain longevity especially where road and street conditions are less than ideal.</P>
    <P>A further consideration sometimes overlooked is that simply providing the buses will not solve the problem. Experience elsewhere shows that successful implementation of low-floor bus services also entails a programme of significant infrastructural developments, together with vigorously enforced parking restrictions, to ensure that the buses have complete freedom of access to the kerbside so that level-boarding can be guaranteed.  Work of this nature could well prove to be even more expensive than the acquisition of the vehicles.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, and having particular regard to the company's statutory duty to balance a range of considerations in the light of available resources, Bus Éireann has advised me it has no <Col N="1967" /> plans at present to introduce wheelchair services as envisaged by Deputy Lynch.</P>
    <P>The technology of low-floor buses and the economics associated with their purchase and use are constantly improving. At the same time, new lessons are emerging from the operation of wheelchair-accessible bus services in other <Col N="1968" /> countries.  Bus Éireann is keeping these developments under review and in line with its commitment to accessible transport, will continue to review its fleet replacement policy in the light of technical and pricing developments in the low-floor bus market.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.10 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 27 June 1995.</P>

      <P>I understand that the Deputy's question refers to the decisions taken by the Western European Union Ministerial Council on 15 May 1995, to develop further the Western European Union's operational capacity.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has already informed the House, in a statement which he made on 23 May in reply to a parliamentary question, of Ireland's approach to this meeting, and the benefits for the Government of attendance, in an observer capacity, at such meetings. This ensures that we are fully informed of developments in the Western European Union which may have a bearing on the options that will arise for Ireland and our EU partners in the area of security and defence, including in the context of the preparations for the EU Intergovernmental Conference next year.</P>
      <P>The recent decisions of the Western European Union are intended to provide it with the political and military procedures and decision-making mechanisms needed to enhance its operational capabilities.  They reflect, in particular, the Western European Union's efforts to improve its ability to respond to EU requests in accordance with the Common Foreign and Security Policy provisions in Title V of the Maastricht Treaty.  Article J.4 provides for the EU to &ldquo;request the Western European Union, which is an integral part of the Union, to elaborate and implement decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications&rdquo;.  In its Petersburg Declaration of June 1992, the Western European Union decided that it should develop its operational capacity, particularly with a view to humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and crisis management &mdash; what have become known as the &ldquo;Petersburg tasks&rdquo;.  It is generally accepted that, in the new security situation in Europe, such tasks would usually be conducted at the request of the UN, the OSCE, or the EU, in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1910" /> Since the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty one such request has been made by the EU to the Western European Union, namely to provide the police element for the EU's Administration of Mostar.  Members of the Western European Union are providing police contingents for this operation.  Recently, Austria, Finland and Sweden, as Western European Union observers, announced their intention of providing police for the operation, and they have expressed their general interest in involvement in Western European Union Petersburg's tasks, based on their long UN peacekeeping and humanitarian experience.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has already indicated that the Government is considering the possibility of Ireland's participating in such humanitarian and peacekeeping tasks in a way that would be consistent with the priority that we attach to peacekeeping and humanitarian involvement in the UN context, and that draws on our experience in this area.  I understand that this issue is likely to be taken up in the forthcoming White Paper on Foreign Policy.</P>

    <P>Thirty, apprenticeship posts in the Army and Air Corps were advertised in January 1995.  The applicants for these apprenticeships have been interviewed and it is hoped that the apprenticeships will be awarded in August 1995.  In <Col N="1911" /> addition, advertisements for the award of cadetships in the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service were placed in the national press recently and it is envisaged that about thirty cadetships will be awarded.</P>
    <P>With regard to general recruitment I consider that it would be appropriate and prudent that recruitment measures should be synchronised with the major re-organisation of the Defence Forces following the EAG review.  For that reason I am not in a position to make an announcement about general recruitment until later in the year.  At that stage it is envisaged that new recruits would be selected from the panel of suitable candidates established following last year's recruitment competition.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 27 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>Statutory penalties for offences under the Fisheries Acts, which are the highest in the European Union, are specifically designed to deter illegal fishing irrespective of nationality.  They reflect our determination to ensure that all vessels fishing in Irish waters comply with fishing regulations.</P>
      <P>The penalties available to the courts for fishery offences have been substantially increased under the 1994 Fisheries (Amendment) Act.  Serious offences relating to incorrect capacity plans and undersize nets now carry maximum fines of £200,000 and £50,000 respectively. The Act also doubled the maximum fines for having undersize fish on board and logbook offences, including under-recording of catch, to £20,000. Gear and catch are automatically forfeited as well.  In addition, the 1994 Act provides for the ultimate sanction of confiscation of the vessel where the offences are deemed by the court to represent a particularly grave abuse of conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actual imposition of penalties, including confiscation, is a matter for the courts in the final analysis.  Overall the regime of fines, fishing days lost, and forfeiture of gear and catch amount to a substantial financial loss for fishermen. Fines imposed, for example, for <Col N="1913" /> under-reporting of catch are usually well in excess of the market value of the catch.  In addition to the increased financial deterrents, the Irish fisheries surveillance capability has been significantly enhanced this year with the coming into service of the two new Casa aircraft operated by the Air Corps.  This has already contributed to more focused and effective deployment of the Naval Service vessels in fisheries surveillance.</P>
    <P>Since 1991 a total of 29 Spanish vessels have been convicted on two or more occasions of serous fishing offences.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the tragic accident in Dunmore East last February, in which two canoeists lost their lives, my predecessor informed the House that he had ordered a review of the circumstances of the accident.  This review has now been completed.</P>
      <P>As was indicated to the House at the time, the review did not have a statutory basis nor was it intended to publish a report of its findings.  The sole objective of the review was to establish what lessons could be learned from the accident with a view of minimising the possibility of a recurrence of such a tragedy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Dunmore East accident review has resulted in the following safety recommendations in relation to canoeing activity on or near the sea and on large open lakes: all equipment, including canoes, helmets, buoyancy aids, paddles, cagoules and both wet and dry suits should be made more visible by attaching retro reflective tape &mdash; this would assist the rescue services in locating a person or canoe in the water, <Col N="1914" /> especially in heavy seas and poor visibility; all persons should have a whistle capable of being used in the water, which should be attached to the wrist; each canoeist should be issued with a hand flare and the leader of a group of canoeists should have at least one parachute flare; the leader of a group should carry a handheld marine VHF radio and be capable of operating it, the area of operation for canoe training should be clearly defined and the persons in charge of training should be made fully aware of such areas; a checklist of all the necessary requirements, including weather forecasts and updates as appropriate, should be complied with prior to departure; the leader of a group should inform the relevant local authorities, e.g. harbour office, pilot station, coast radio station, giving them the time of departure, area of operation, expected time of arrival, number in group and type and numbers of equipment in use; lifejackets should be worn for sea or open water canoeing.</P>
    <P>While these recommendations relate specifically to canoeing activity, the underlying principles are applicable to a number of waterbased leisure activities. The Department of the Marine has now drawn up a comprehensive set of safety guidelines, incorporating the recommendations of the Dunmore East review, for both canoeing and windsurfing. The Department is currently engaged in a process of consultation with the representative bodies with a view to having these safety recommendations implemented. This has involved meetings with the sea scouts, the Irish Windsurfing Association and the Irish Canoe Union.  It is proposed, following liaison with the Irish Windsurfing Association and the Irish Canoe Union, to issue safety leaflets in respect of windsurfing and sea canoeing in the coming weeks. The Department also proposes to meet shortly with representatives of the Association for Adventure Sports with a view to enlisting their support towards putting these recommended measures in place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1915" /> This course of action accords fully with my view, which I know was shared by my predecessor, that the most effective approach to water leisure safety is through self regulation by the various governing bodies.  Such self regulation must continue to be augmented by means of the Department's safety awareness campaign's dual strategy of alerting the watersports enthusiast to the need for safety consciousness and providing information regarding the appropriate safety measures to be taken.</P>

      <P>In November 1992 a contract was agreed between Eolas, now part of Forbairt, and the Commission of the European Communities to carry out, in conjunction with a number of project partners, a project entitled ECOPRO, Environmentally Friendly Coast Protection.</P>
      <P>The partners associated with the ECOPRO project are: the Department of the Marine: Wexford, Waterford, Kerry and Clare County Councils; the National Trust for Northern Ireland; the Department of the Environment &mdash; Northern Ireland; the Danish Coast Authority; and Coastwatch Europe.</P>
      <P>The total cost of the project was estimated at 1.8 million ECU towards which the Commission of the European Communities would contribute 0.9 million ECU.  As an associated partner, the Department of the Marine is eligible for EU funding totalling 517,233 ECU or approximately £385,000 towards its activities under the project.</P>
      <P>The overall aim of the ECOPRO project is to promote the use of soft engineering coastal protection techniques by, firstly giving reference information on the dynamics of the coast.  This will help the coastal authority and landowner to understand the nature of erosion.  Secondly, the project will detail a methodology which will enable the sensitivity of the coast to erosion to be graded and thirdly, information will be given on how to protect the coast in the most environmentally friendly way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The beach nourishment demonstration scheme under ECOPRO is being undertaken by the Department at Rosslare Strand.  County Wexford.  The <Col N="1917" /> ECOPRO scheme at Rosslare involves the provision of rock groynes to slow down the littoral drift of sediment along the beach.  Beach sediment is trapped by the groynes resulting in a widening of the beach.  Some 162,000 cubic metres of nourishment material was also provided to replenish the beach.  The initial assessment of the ongoing monitoring demonstrates the effectiveness of the scheme.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the ECOPRO works at Rosslare Strand amounts to £1.351 million approximately.  The EU is providing some £385,000 towards this total. Irish Rail is contributing £220,000 in respect of its obligations to provide nourishment at Rosslare Strand. Approximately £375,000 is being provided by Wexford County Council.  The balance, some £371,000 is being paid for by the Department of the Marine.  The additional costs incurred by the Department on the ECOPRO project for tasks such as coastline monitoring, drafting of the sensitivity index and codes of practice and the project management tasks including design and monitoring of works are being absorbed by the Department.</P>
    <P>To date some 40 per cent of the Department's expected EU contribution has been received i.e. some £154,000.  A second instalment of 40 per cent is expected shortly.  The remaining 20 per cent will be paid by the EU upon completion of the project which is scheduled for mid 1996.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Marine (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under European Union fleet policy the capacities of member states' fishing fleets are constrained by decisions taken in the context of multi-annual guidance programmes which set tonnage targets overall and for individual fleet segments.</P>
      <P>In Ireland's case, the programme set an overall target of 51,000 tonnes with individual targets for the following four fleet segments: pelagic; Irish Sea demersal; West Coast demersal; and beam trawler.</P>
      <P>A target of 19,500 tonnes was set for the pelagic segment of the fleet.  This reflected the fact that the fishing activities of a large number of Irish boats were appropriate to more than one fleet segment.  Dryhold pelagic vessels which fish for herring and mackerel during the winter and spring also fish for demersal species during the remainder of the year.  In calculating the capacity appropriate to each segment these vessels were divided proportionately between the pelagic and demersal fleet segments.</P>
      <P>In January 1992 the actual tonnage of the pelagic segment of the fleet was assessed at 20,905 tonnes.  This figure included the Refrigerated Salt Water &mdash; RSW &mdash; tank boats, which are dedicated pelagic boats, and the appropriate proportion of the mixed dryhold pelagic &mdash; whitefish fleet.</P>
      <P>In the mid-term review of the programme between Ireland and the Commission last year the overall fleet target remained unchanged for Ireland. However, the Commission agreed to reduce the number of fleet segments to three which more accurately reflects the mix within the fleet: beam trawler; pelagic; polyvalent &mdash; or multi purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new polyvalent segment includes <Col N="1919" /> all whitefish vessels and other multipurpose vessels such as dry-hold pelagic vessels.  Consequently, the pelagic segment now comprises RSW pelagic tank boats only.  The current tonnage within this segment stands at 18,668 tonnes. With the planned introduction of the remaining three new tank boats later this year, the tonnage figure is set to increase to 19,500, which is in line with the programme target for end 1996.  We have therefore, in practice, reached the target for the pelagic segment.  Consequently all future proposals to introduce new tank boats will only be considered on the basis of 100 per cent tonnage replacement from within the pelagic fleet.</P>

      <P>The Department of the Marine's key policy objective in relation to maritime safety is to ensure that the highest standards of safety are set and enforced, in order to minimise the risks to human safety on our seas, rivers and lakes. These standards must apply throughout the year, and not just in peak periods of activity.  In response to the Deputy's question I consider it to be important, particularly in the interest of the general public's peace of mind and confidence in our high standards of maritime safety, to put new measures clearly in the context of the existing regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish-registered passenger vessels are <Col N="1920" /> subjected anually to thorough inspection by the Department's Marine Survey Office for the renewal of their passenger and safety certificates.  These vessels are required to be equipped, maintained and operated to the highest international standards.  Foreign-registered passenger vessels using Irish ports are also inspected at least once a year. Passenger boats, namely vessels carrying not more than 12 passengers are licensed for a period up to a maximum of two years.</P>
    <P>The International Maritime Organisation &mdash; IMO &mdash; which draws on worldwide maritime expertise and opinion, is the source of the vast bulk of Ireland's maritime safety rules.  Its Safety of Life at Sea &mdash; SOLAS &mdash; convention forms the cornerstone of maritime safety regulation throughout the world.  Ireland is an active participant in the IMO, and I am committed to ensuring that the Department continues to give priority to introducing into Irish law the IMO's constantly evolving safety.</P>
    <P>The European Union is playing an increasingly important and involved role in the area of maritime safety.  This involvement was given increased impetus as a result of the <i>Braer</i> oil spillage off the Shetlands in 1993, and more recently after the <i>Estonia</i> passenger ferry disaster.  In June 1993, the Council of Transport Ministers endorsed the Commission's communication &ldquo;A Common Policy on Safe Seas&rdquo;.  This document provides the framework for the introduction of a range of regulatory measures governing maritime safety.  On 15 September next the EU Directive on reporting arrangements for vessels carrying dangerous or polluting goods into or out of European ports comes into effect.</P>
    <P>On 1 July 1996 a Council Directive on Port State Control which will introduce a strengthened regime of mandatory inspection of visiting foreign vessels comes into effect; on the same date a Council regulation on the IMO's International Safety Management &mdash; ISM &mdash;<Col N="1921" /> Code designed to enhance the safe management, operation and pollution prevention of Ro-Ro ferries will be introduced on a mandatory basis for ferries operating in Community waters.</P>
    <P>On the domestic front the 1992 Merchant Shipping Act provides me with the basis for introducing safety regulations in a number of sectors.  In this regard I can inform the House that the Department is currently drafting two sets of regulations under the provisions of the Act.  One will give effect to the recommendations of the Castletownbere accident investigation report, and is designed to enhance the safety of the public and crew of small passenger boats.  The second set of regulations will bring all commercial sea angling vessels, regardless of size or distance travelled from land, into a uniform mandatory safety regime.  It is proposed to introduce the passenger boat and sea angling regulations with effect from 1 January 1996.</P>
    <P>Regulatory measures cannot provide the solution to all maritime safety problems. There are some sectors, particularly the rapidly expanding area of leisure craft, where legislation would be neither appropriate nor practicable.  The main thrust of the Department's efforts in this area is to alert water sports enthusiasts, and the general public, to the need for safety consciousness, and to provide information on appropriate safety practice.  This objective is achieved through the Department's annual water safety awareness campaign, by means of radio and newspaper advertisments, distribution of safety posters and leaflets, and search and rescue demonstrations and information meetings.  The awareness campaign, which is launched every Easter to coincide with the seasonal increase in water-based activity, has been considerably strengthened and has benefited from a threefold increase in funding over the last two years.  Additional elements in this year's campaign include the proposed launching of safety leaflets on canoeing and windsurfing and the <Col N="1922" /> publication of a code of safety for pleasure craft.</P>
    <P>It is my objective to ensure that the Department will continue to maintain the highest possible standards of maritime safety.</P>

      <P>The gross capital cost of completing the proposed Loran C navigation station at Loop Head is currently estimated to be in the region of £4.375 million. However, an increase in this figure is likely due to anticipated further delays in the civil works programme arising from a High Court decision, delivered on Tuesday last, to grant local objectors to the project a judicial review in relation to the Commissioners of Irish Lights' legal powers to erect the Loran C mast.  The extent of the increase in the capital cost will depend on the period of time for which the civil works will be delayed and this will be dictated by the duration of the legal proceedings.</P>
      <P>Under the terms of the binding international agreement which Ireland entered into in respect of the north-west European Loran C navigation system, the French and Dutch Governments are to contribute 50 per cent and 5 per cent respectively, towards the capital cost of the Irish station.  In addition, the main equipment manufacturer has agreed to rebate the Irish Government a substantial amount.  The eventual capital cost of the proposed station to the State will, therefore, be reduced accordingly.</P>

      <P>The Commission's proposal on additional financial aid for fisheries surveillance has just been circulated.  The details of the proposal, including funding levels, remain to be negotiated and settled over the coming weeks and months.  This development was noted at the Fisheries Council last week.  Ministers reaffirmed last December's commitment to provide additional financial resources with particular reference to the considerable cost of EU fishery surveillance borne by Ireland.  A specific budget line for our operating costs will additionally be provided for the first time.  I also succeeded in getting Council to agree to a firm deadline of October for decision on the financial package.</P>
      <P>The Commission has proposed a total envelope of expenditure of 205 million ECU over the five years beginning 1996 and has pencilled in a figure of 10 million ECU to assist with Ireland's operating costs.</P>
      <P>In negotiating the details of the package, we will be bidding for the maximum possible allocation for Ireland based on our quantified assessment of the additional capability required at sea and on land.  Given Council's acknowledgments of Ireland's particular surveillance responsibilities and given our track record of effective expenditue under the previous surveillance package, I am satisfied that the necessary resources will be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>The Department has no plans to undertake any new works in County Kerry during 1995.

This funding is fully used up on undertaking development works at the State owned fishery harbour centres and completing phased development works at a number of other strategic harbours including Union Hall, Kilmore Quay and Burtonport. There is insufficient funding to allow for any other development works this year.  The Department is prepared to provide engineering advice and to carry out works on an agency basis if requested to do so by other bodies such as An Roinn Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta.  That being said, the Department is also aware of Kerry County Council's development priorities and will give them full consideration in the light of funding available in 1996 and subsequent years.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 39 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1925" /> In May 1994 the Department signalled its intention to introduce new regulations governing the safety of sea angling boats.  It is intended that the regulations which will apply to all sea angling boats carrying sea anglers for reward will be introduced with effect from 1 January 1996.</P>
    <P>At present the operation of sea angling boats which do not travel more than three miles from land and which do not carry more than 12 passengers is covered by safety guidelines issued by the Department of the Marine.  Those boats which carry more than 12 passengers or which travel more than three miles from land must have a Loadline Exemption Certificate which sets down conditions under which a vessel may operate.  An angling boat will only be granted a Certificate if it has been surveyed by a Marine Surveyor from the Department.  There is agreement among all representative bodies on the need for a statutory basis to regulate the safety of all angling boats.</P>
    <P>The new regulations will cover such matters as stability and freeboard, construction and maintenance, life-saving applicances and fire-fighting equipment, etc.</P>
    <P>The introduction of these regulations has been the subject of ongoing consultation between the Department of the Marine and sea angling representative bodies over the past 12 months.  I am aware that the Irish Federation of Sea Anglers has expressed concern about the likely implications of some of the proposed safety requirements for its sea angling competitions.</P>
    <P>While I appreciate the importance of these competitions for the tourism industry, and would not wish to see them cancelled because of the introduction of the new regulations, my paramount concern is for the safety of sea anglers.  I must ensure that all boats being used in these competitions meet the highest standards of safety.  The Irish Federation of Sea Anglers have put certain proposals to the Department whereby small boats would be exempted from some of the provisions <Col N="1926" /> of the new regulations for the duration of competitions provided alternative equivalent safety measures were in place.</P>
    <P>The Federation's proposals are being examined in detail at present, and the Department will be in contact with the Federation and the other representative bodies in the coming weeks.  I want to assure the House that the Department will do its utmost to ensure that the sea angling competitions go ahead in 1996.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1929" /> The first report of the group entitled <i>Research and Monitoring on the Irish Sea (May 1993)</i> gives an inventory of research and monitoring projects which have been undertaken.  The second report entitled <i>An Integrated Science Programme for the Irish Sea: a review of current activities and future needs</i> which became available in February 1995 analyses requirements for scientific information on the Irish Sea.</P>
    <P>The group completed its deliberations, on schedule, in May 1995.  The third and final report to be entitled <i>An integrated Science Programme for the Irish Sea; synthesis and recommendations</i> identifies specific projects that warrant priority in the future.  The report is now being edited prior to printing.  I expect that it will be submitted to me and my Ministerial colleagues at the Department of the Environment here and in the UK by mid-July 1995. At that stage decisions will be taken on bringing forward the recommendations in the report.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Marine (Mr. Gilmore)</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share the Deputy's concerns in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Sea has been used for the <Col N="1931" /> shipment of spent nuclear fuel and plutonium to and from Sellafield for several years.  The transport of such materials through the Irish Sea, a narrow semi-enclosed sea with the densely populated areas in its environs, poses a threat to the safety of people living in these areas and to the marine environment generally.  The ever increasing shipping traffic on the Irish Sea also presents a risk.  The implications of an accident or collision need no spelling out by me to this House.  At a very minimum, we need to have advance notification of the transiting of a ship carrying nuclear fuel through the Irish Sea so that contingency plans to deal with possible marine emergencies and to effect immediate response can be put in place. This matter is being pursued on an ongoing basis with the UK authorities. Concerns of small island developing states and other coastal states world wide, with regard to the transportation of nuclear materials between Japan and the UK and France led to the adoption in 1993 of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) Code on the Safe Carriage of Irradiated Nuclear Fuel, Plutonium and High-Level Radioactive Wastes in Flasks on Board Ships (the INF Code).  The Code lays down standards for construction, equipment and operation of ships engaged in the carriage of irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and high-level radioactive wastes.  I am somewhat reassured by the fact that the relevant requirements of the INF Code must be met and registered as such with the UK Marine Safety Agency.</P>
    <P>In ongoing discussions at international level on the INF Code the Department has consistently argued for the following additional requirements to be put in place: decisive route planning and notification and consultation with coastal states while in transit; the restriction and exclusion of certain routes; an emergency response plan in the voyage plan in respect of the ship and cargo; and a compulsory requirement to salvage radioactive material <Col N="1932" /> and predetermination of responsibility for this in the voyage plan.</P>
    <P>Our efforts in this respect, for which we have some support from other island states, will continue.</P>
    <P>Other significant steps have been taken at international level.  Mandatory ship reporting systems for ships carrying dangerous goods will come into effect on 1 January 1996.  On 1 January 1997 measures will be put in place to allow for the adoption by the IMO of ship routeing systems including areas to be avoided.  At present such measures may only be recommendatory.  We are also pushing to have the INF Code incorporated into two EU Directives dealing with reporting arrangements for ships visiting Community ports or transiting Community waters.  This would at least ensure that all types of radioactive and nuclear wastes being carried on ships would have to be notified in advance and would allow for early warning systems to be put in place.</P>
    <P>As I have said, these are our minimum requirements given the prospect of continuing traffic on the high seas of radioactive materials.  As you are no doubt aware this Government is opposed to the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel and are seeking the closure of the Sellafield/THORP plant and the halting of any future expansion there. An interdepartmental committee on the Irish Sea has been established in order to progress Government Policy on Sellafield and the Irish Sea in line with the commitments given in the <i>Government of Renewal</i> policy document.</P>

      <P>The position is that there are no special income tax allowances for unmarried couples living together.  In this context, I would point out that tax law follows the general law relating to marriage. The basis on which the married person's tax free allowance &mdash; and double rate bands &mdash; is given derives from the Supreme Court decision in Murphy <i>v.</i> the Attorney General &mdash; 1980 &mdash; which held that it was contrary to the Constitution for a married couple to pay more tax than two single people living together.</P>

An Expert Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems has been established.  This group will <i>inter alia</i> be looking at the treatment of cohabiting couples.  I will consider the recommendations of the group in this area carefully.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> The total bed complement for the new Tallaght Hospital is 513.  This figure was derived from the 1992 review of the Tallaght Hospital project carried out by the Dublin Hospital Advisory Group under the chairmanship of Professor David Kennedy. The report of the advisory group formed the basis for the Government decision in 1992 to proceed with construction of the hospital.  The Tallaght Hospital board is charged with the planning and equipping of the new hospital within the total bed complement.</P>
      <P>A number of approaches to designating the specialty breakdown of beds within the total complement of 513 beds are now being considered by the Tallaght Hospital board.  This examination will need to take into account, <i>inter alia</i>, the specific needs of the Tallaght catchment area and the rapidly evolving patterns of practice in acute hospital medicine. The final assignment of beds by specialty within the overall agreed complement will be a matter for ratification by the Tallaght Hospital board.</P>

Application forms for the schemes were posted directly to all herdowners with separate help sheets/terms and conditions advising applicants on how to submit the various forms.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately a producer cannot be considered for payment under the European Union regulations unless an application form is submitted.  The responsibility must rest with the applicant to ensure that the correct application form is lodged with the Department.</P>

Gradually, over that period of 20 years, the station has fallen into disuse as its purification system has been superseded by new technology.</P>
      <P>I understand that the co-op has been considering disposing of its interest in the property for some time.  If present efforts to find a new lessee are successful BIM advise that it will look favourably on any request to waive the lease condition that the station be used exclusively in connection with the fishing industry.  This would allow for alternative development of the site.  The present condition of the station is acknowledged to be unsatisfactory and in the event that a purchaser is not found in the short term, BIM will pursue alternative options with the Co-op to remedy the present state of the premises.</P>

      <P>Under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1992 boats used to carry passengers for reward are required to be inspected and licensed by the Department.  This requirement applies to all boats plying to offshore islands or rivers, lakes and canals, boats carrying sightseeing groups and boats carrying people to their place of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A passenger boat licence may only be <Col N="1946" /> granted after the vessel has been inspected by a marine surveyor from the Department of the Marine and found to be suitable.  A licence may be granted for a period not exceeding two years.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Marine in conjunction with the Garda and the harbour authorities operates a very thorough enforcement programme to prevent the illegal carriage of passengers. In addition, the Department's water safety awareness campaign urges the general public, through radio advertising, safety posters and leaflets, to check that boats they propose to travel on are licensed.  I am satisfied that all the necessary measures are being taken to detect the illegal operations of passenger boats.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for very severe penalties for the illegal carriage of passengers including fines of up to £5,000 or imprisonment for up to two years.</P>

      <P>The only authorised dumping of sewage sludge a sea in Ireland is that which is done by Dublin Corporation.  The dumpsite is located some 14 miles south-east of the Kish lighthouse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1947" /> Subject to Dublin Corporation continuing to meet the terms of its licence under the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, its annual permit would be renewed for the years 1996, 1997 and 1998.  The estimated total amount of sludge to be dumped would be subject to a maximum of 340,000 tonnes for each of the years 1996, 1997 and 1998.</P>
    <P>As stated in a written reply of 18 May to the Deputy's parliamentary question on the subject, monitoring of the status of the dumpsite used by Dublin Corporation was carried out by staff of the Fisheries Research Centre of the Department in 1993.  The dumpsite is dispersive in nature and the monitoring revealed that there was no significant impact on the sediment or water quality in the area with no evidence of the buildup of sludge material on the sea floor.</P>
