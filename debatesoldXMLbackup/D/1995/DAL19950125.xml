      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 4 and 5.  It is also proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that (1) the proceedings on the Report and Remaining Stages of No. 4, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.45 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only those set down by, or accepted by, the Minister for Finance; and (2) Private Members' Business shall be No. 10 and the proceedings thereon shall be brought to a conclusion at 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach ensure that the Government will pause and reflect before taking precipitate action on the educational grants issue, particularly third level grants, which goes against the combined weight of all the expert opinion in this area?  It would be helpful if the Taoiseach indicated to the House his views or the early decisions he intends to take on this matter.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Garda were aware for some weeks that a crime of the magnitude of the one committed last night was about to happen, that they had alerted certain vulnerable people?  If that is the case, does the Government plan to improve the existing criminal justice provisions to ensure that they are adequate to deal with racketeering of this kind?</P>

      <P>At this stage I can do no more than say that an armed robbery took place at 6.30 p.m. yesterday at the Brinks-Allied premises at Clonshaugh and that a substantial sum of money was taken.  It will not be possible to say how much money was taken until the sums involved are verified with the various institutions which had consigned cash to the premises at Clonshaugh.  A full Garda investigation got underway within minutes of the robbery taking place.  The Minister for Justice has been in direct contact with the Garda Commissioner and has reported twice to me on the progress being made in the investigations. I appeal to anyone who may have information which would be helpful to the Garda Síochána in identifying the perpetrators of this crime and recovering the money to assist the Garda Síochána in every way possible. It is through united community action that we will be able to get information which not only will deal with the perpetrators of this crime but will deter further attempts of this serious nature.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I note the Taoiseach did not deny what I said, that the Garda were aware that a crime of this kind was planned for some weeks.  When will the Government be bringing forward proposals to establish the fraud agency mentioned in the Programme for Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not be so quick to draw inferences of an alarmist character from comments I have made here.  The position is that the Garda, of course, have information on an ongoing basis about threats of crime in general but it would be quite wrong to say or to infer that the Garda had any specific information in respect of this particular crime.  I did not say that and I do not think anyone would realistically expect that they did because if they had, it would not have occurred.  It is common knowledge that the Garda have general information all the time about threats from particular groups of criminals. I can say that they had indications in general but no indications in particular about this crime.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, work is proceeding on the fraud legislation.  It will be ready later this year.  If the Deputy will bear with me while I find the relevant text.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Legislation drawing on the report of the Law Reform Commission to update the law in regard to fraud is being drafted.  Work on the preparation of a general scheme of a Bill is at an advanced stage but, as the House will be aware, the general scheme of a Bill is an early stage in the process.  The next stage is the drafting of wording for specific sections and that has not yet commenced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMartin" hpid="Mr. Martin Mr. Martin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Martin</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the Taoiseach's stated commitment to making this House more relevant to the people outside it and to involving Deputies in the formulation of legislation, would he be agreeable to allowing time for a debate in this House on the implications of the de Buitléir report for so many sectors in our society and in relation to the third level grants structure?  Surely that is a reasonable request.  I have been inundated with requests from Members on my side of the House who want a debate on the implications of this report and permission for it should be forthcoming from the Government side.</P>

      <P>On a more serious note, given the fact that a women's group is being threatened with eviction in this State because it is providing information in relation to the termination of pregnancies in England, will the Taoiseach confirm to the House that this long promised legislation to allow Irish women travel to England, fully counselled, with full information and, hopefully, with their medical records, will be introduced in this session?  The legislation which was almost ready before the fall of the last Government should not be put on the long finger.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the serious concern being expressed here and indeed in many other countries with regard to the <Col N="8" /> common fisheries policy, does the Government propose to follow through on a commitment of the previous Minister for the Marine, Deputy Andrews, and publish a White Paper on this topic?

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that any surveillance must have a statutory base and the Minister is dealing with the matter in the proper sequence in that he is taking powers to make an order which will give a statutory base for such surveillance and protection, but without the steps that the Minister first intends to take in regard to making a protection order under the legislation.  There would be no legal basis for any surveillance.</P>

      <P>On equality legislation, <Col N="10" /> what is its standing now?  As the Taoiseach will know, there is grave concern among many women's organisations since the full gender equality section was dropped from the Programme for Government.  That section was a copy of what was in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> Has the Government dropped the section completely, are there other proposals for it or is it still interested in the issue?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCormack</NameTxt>
      <P>When the debate adjourned last night I was making the point that the appointment of Ministers of State can have positive effects and should not be portrayed in a negative light as it was by some Opposition speakers.  I gave the example of Deputy Mary Harney who was a Minister of State from 1989 to 1992.  She overcame difficulties in her Department to achieve notable success in her office and, with the experience and reputation she gained as Minister of State she went on, not so long afterwards, to become leader of her party.  Another example is Deputy Mary O'Rourke who expected to be a Minister in the last Government but was only appointed a Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment where she achieved notable success both in the Department and at the Select Committee on <Col N="11" /> Enterprise and Economic Strategy.  As a member of that committee I watched her contribution at close range as she guided the Consumer Credit Bill through.  These are just two examples which show why we should not be negative about the appointment of Ministers of State.</P>
      <P>Judgement on the appointment of the two Ministers of State should be suspended until they deliver.  They have a role they are well equipped to play, and considerable scope for initiating and implementing policy which will make this country a better place in which to live.</P>
      <P>Deputy Avril Doyle is a former Minister of State at the Department of Finance who had responsibility for the Office of Public Works and the Department of the Environment in 1986-87. This Bill will make it possible for Deputy Doyle to be appointed a Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications with special responsibility for public services. She will also co-chair an interdepartmental committee on the commemoration of the famine.  This post is important because the policy agreement, a Government of Renewal, places considerable emphasis on changes in institutions of State to make them more responsive and accountable.  A high degree of co-ordinated action in different policy areas will be required to achieve these changes and enable the Government to meet its commitments.</P>
      <P>The Government will set an agenda for action on these matters and it will be the responsibility of Deputy Doyle to have this programme carried out.  I am confident Deputy Doyle's efforts will make a real difference in the quality of service to the public and restore faith in our public institutions.  This concerns every citizen of the State.  The appointment is, therefore, valid and justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have known Deputy Donal Carey for many years and have a particular interest in his appointment as a Minister <Col N="12" /> of State.  He has been a public representative for 21 years and a Member of the Dáil since 1982.  He is widely experienced and I welcome his appointment as Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and the Gaeltacht with special responsibilities for co-ordinating the Government's commitment to western development and urban renewal. His responsibilities will include co-ordinating support for the implementation of the action plan being prepared by the Western Development Partnership Boards, responsibility for overseeing the implementation of a pilot programme for the development of a more integrated approach to public service in rural areas, and special responsibility for the development and improvement of living conditions on our offshore islands.  Deputy Carey will also chair an inter-departmental committee to examine the problems facing island communities and the ways in which these difficulties can be overcome.  Offshore islands have been neglected for a long time by various Governments.  I am delighted that Fine Gael, in Government, has seen fit to appoint a Minister with responsibility in this area.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom freisin comhgháirdeachas a dhéanamh leis an Teachta Carey ar a cheapadh mar Aire Stáit i Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Má tá jab le déanamh, níl fear níos fearr ná an Teachta Carey chun a chóta a bhaint de agus an obair a dhéanamh, mar a rinne sé sa toghchán i Maigh Eo Thiar nuair a togh-adh an Teachta Ring.  Bhí mé ag obair leis an Teachta Carey ag an am sin agus tá mé cinnte go ndéanfaidh sé jab maith.</P>
    <P>I am sure Deputy Carey will be of great help to my overworked colleague, the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Michael D. Higgins. The appointment of a Minister with responsibility for the Gaeltacht, western development and the islands illustrates the Government's commitment to ensuring that all areas benefit from opportunities for growth and employment. The appointment of Deputy Carey at this time is of great significance <Col N="13" /> as this is a vital period for the west.  It is a watershed for the region.  We are at a point in history where we must start to recover or fade forever.  I can assure the House that we in the west have no intention of throwing in the towel.  The people of the west are greatly encouraged by the commitment of this, the first Government to appoint a Minister for Western Development and I am delighted this step has been taken.</P>
    <P>This appointment also coincides with a major drive and determination within the communities of the west to help themselves by organising community and self help projects.  This is exemplified by the Bishop's crusade for the survival of the west which reflects what is happening in every community in the west.  Most communities have produced their own action plan, encouraged by the availability of EC funding.  What is vital is that the Government is now appointing a Minister with direct responsibility for co-ordinating the efforts of the Bishops and the communities in the west to give them hope for the future.</P>
    <P>Other parts of the country have special problems but nowhere else has the population dropped consistently in every country over the past 50 years. With the exception of Galway City the population in Connaught has declined dramatically.  Since the census of 1926 Leitrim has lost 30,606 people, a drop of 54 per cent; Mayo has lost 61,977 people, a drop of 36 per cent; Roscommon has lost 31,659 people, a drop of 38 per cent; Sligo has lost 16,632 people, a drop of 23 per cent.  A recent survey carried out in 30 schools in Connemara indicates that the school-going population will drop by 25 per cent by 1999. Leenane, that beautiful village where the film, &ldquo;The Field&rdquo;, was shot, will only have eight school-going children in 1999.  Rosmuc, a Gaeltacht area where Padraic Pearse's cottage is and where he learned Irish, will have only eight school pupils by 1999.  The number of pupils in Cornamona will drop from the present 86 to 30 by 1999 and the school-going population in Clifden, the capital of <Col N="14" /> Connemara, will drop from 263 to 190 by 1999.  Those are the findings of a scientific study of all the schools in Connemara.</P>
    <P>I am delighted we will have a ministry with special responsibility for western development and I have every confidence that, on his appointment, Donal Carey, in co-operation with the many voluntary agencies and community initiatives, will carry out this function with commitment and put the west back on the map.  In anticipation of this appointment I ask him now to take immediate steps to extend the Eircell national grid to all other areas in Connemara. In Clifden doctors and other business people who provide a service to the offshore islands have great difficulty in doing so because the area is not in the Eircell grid.  That should be a priority for the new ministry.  I will be glad to liaise and help and make a public commitment to do so in efforts to develop the west.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his introductory statement in the Fine Gael document <i>Let's Bring Out the Best in the Country</i> states: &ldquo;I believe our first aim must be jobs for all our people&rdquo;.  That statement takes on a whole new miniing with the institution of two new ministers of State &mdash; we now know what he really meant, jobs for his own people. Further on in that document, he states that we must restore trust in politics.</P>
      <P>However, his actions speak louder than words.  Trust even among his own supporters is not being restored by his cynical cronyism.  He further states:</P>
      <P>We must make our system of Government stable and accountable with politicians who can be trusted and we must manage our economy on the basis of fair competition and not for the benefit of the inner circle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the actions of this Taoiseach and the Bill before the House evidence of people who can be trusted?  Ask Fine Gael backbenchers, Members who aspire to be Ministers, former Front <Col N="15" /> Bench spokespersons and former Ministers, if an inner circle in that party is being looked after?  The new commandments of this Government are openness, transparency and accountability but how soon they were cast aside when self-preservation became the order of the day.  Like beauty, the principles of Fine Gael are skin deep, no sooner was Deputy John Bruton ensconced in the Taoiseach's seat than he proceeded to look after his own men.  He was not wanting in casting aside the hard working effective performers in the front line of Fine Gael during the past six to seven years such as Deputies Dukes, Shatter, Flanagan, Deasy, Jim Higgins, Jim O'Keeffe and McCormack among others.  Why did he do so?  Was it because they were not lapdogs?  Deputy Michael Noonan survived the cut and I wish him well in his important portfolio. I presume he was brought in to pacify the other elements of the party.  I can presume only that the Taoiseach did not want experienced members in Cabinet with him in fear of rocking the boat with his present partners.</P>
    <P>Labour, the party of total righteousness and moral rectitude did not and have not officially at ministerial or advisory level made a squeak in the face of this cynical action.  Having wrestled with their conscience, no doubt, their conscience lost.  As long as they held on to their six ministries and their ministries of State, all was well.  However, last evening on the news, that independent chairman of the Labour Party, Deputy Kemmy, fired a shot across the bows of the Labour, Fine Gael and Democratic Left Ministers.  What will Deputy Kemmy do?  He said he will vote for the Bill.  Do honour and principle not mean anything or only what he wants them to mean at any given time?  In the final analysis the Labour Party has told the taxpayers clearly that it does not care about the extra cost as long as the Fine Gael Party is kept happy and stays in Government.  It will facilitate that Party in sorting out its internal problems as <Col N="16" /> long as it does not cost it any of its positions. What total cynicism.</P>
    <P>Members of the Democratic Left Party had a great deal to say on all sorts of matters during the past few years. One came to expect from them only the highest levels of correctness.  Were they, fooling us?  We have not heard from them since &mdash; we have not heard from them on these extra appointments. When push came to shove they insisted on their pound of flesh and as it turned out they got more than a pound.  Deputy Rabbitte, a Minister of State, has even got a programme manager, new ground broken by a reforming Minister of State. As yet they have not explained their acquiescence to the comfortable arrangement that put this Government together at the taxpayers' expense.  For their part, political cynicism and looping the loop has reached new heights.</P>
    <P>In the document <i>A Government of Renewal</i> we were informed that increases for Ministers recommended by the independent review body were not to apply.  Was this to save money &mdash; a mere £50,000 net?  It was not, but to give the impression that this Government cared and was intent on transferring the savings to the needy in our society.  What really happened is that this Government has increased the cost of administration to the Exchequer by a plethora of appointments to their offices from outside the Civil Service.  Like confetti at a wedding there were appointments of programme managers, advisers and personal assistants as well as two additional Ministers of State with attendant staff.  Those actions have been seen for what they are, naked political expediency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey is an honourable, hard working public representative who has made many excellent contributions on various Bills.  He has been placed in an invidious position, which he does not deserve.  The Taoiseach was in a bind when he realised he had to agree to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle remaining in office and, without blushing, found the simple solution of creating another ministry of State.  The Taoiseach called <Col N="17" /> it Minister of State for the West, but had he forgotten the west before this Ministry was created?  Did it suddenly jump up in front of him?  Many fine Deputies from the west have been highlighting the problems of that region for years. On every occasion on which he has spoken during the past seven years Deputy Jim Higgins has highlighted those problems.  Deputies Connaughton, McGinley and McCormack live in the heart of the west.  Why did the Taoiseach not think of appointing some of those Deputies who know the problems facing the west?  The answer is quite clear and I do not need to spell it out.</P>
    <P>It seems that Wexford is a special county blessed with two Cabinet Ministers and a Minister of State for Pandora's box.  Deputy Doyle's portfolio is embracing more and more as time goes on.  The Lord above, Deputies Bruton and Doyle are the only ones who could tell us the real reason for the creation of that office.</P>
    <P>I wish Deputies Carey and Doyle success in their portfolios and know they will do a good job even in the difficult climate of confusion and twilight they will find themselves in.  Having spent 11 months as Minister of State I have come to appreciate the excellence of our civil servants and their dedication to serving the country no matter what political hue rules.  The action of the Government in employing unestablished civil servants as programme managers throughout the Civil Service will not, in the long run, be in the best interests of the country.  To date between 90 and 100 unestablished civil servants have been appointed and further appointments will be made.  I am sure people will be interested to know who has been appointed to these important offices.  I shall name the programme managers and special advisers in the different Departments.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht has appointed Caoimlin Ó Drisceoil as his programme manager and Colm Ó Briain as his special adviser.  In the Ministry of Equality and Law Reform Mr. Richard Humphreys is special adviser and Miss Anne Kinsella <Col N="18" /> is to be appointed as partnership programme manager in the near future. The Minister for Education has appointed Mr. Pat Keating as partnership programme manager.  No special adviser has been appointed yet but I am sure one will be appointed soon.  The Minister for Finance has Ciarán O'Mara as programme manager and Brendan Lynch as special adviser.  I am sure Deputy Hogan will get a special adviser in due course.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and thank Deputy Ahern for his complimentary remarks.  Would that he had the allocation of jobs.  I have no doubt I would not be perched up high on the back benches but down on the Front Bench where Deputy Hogan is now. Unfortunately I do not quite accept the degree of political motivation or interest he has in the welfare of Deputies Higgins or O'Keeffe or other members of Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>The remarks in relation to political opportunism, nepotism and naked political expediency would sound fine if we did not look at the recent track record of the party which sat on this side a mere four weeks ago.  It is worth remembering that in the days when it lost its mandate to govern and was dead, Fianna Fáil did as Fianna Fáil do and appointed people in that short period of time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hold no brief for the Minister.  Deputy Cowen made ten appointments to various bodies and agencies under his remit as Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications. The Taoiseach, who had clearly lost his mandate and was heading a discredited Government and a party in disgrace and who described himself as a caretaker Taoiseach, appointed two Senators, clearly jeopardising the incoming Government and deliberately making it extremely difficult for the new Government to enact legislation in the Seanad.  The comments from Fianna Fáil sound rather hollow.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern in his contribution gave his own political perspective and listed the various appointments so far.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">

    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>His briefing document was relatively sparse when it came to Fine Gael appointments, whatever about the other partners in the Coalition. He discovered that Fine Gael is not guilty of splurging or extravagance at cost to the taxpayer.  The one thing of which we can be reasonably sure is that, while the whole principle of programme managers and advisers will be adopted by Fine Gael in Government, there will be no splurge, no extravagances and no extravaganza; it will be done within reason and with all due responsibility.</P>
      <P>This Bill is contentious but was not needed because we have now entered a new welcome era.  The past six weeks marked a watershed, a new development in politics.  There has been a transition, a handing over of power, a change of office, without a general election, the use or expansion of the role of Government under the Constitution. That is extremely welcome because it means we are using the democratic process to the full.  Also to be welcomed is what happened in the past month, the transfer of power and a new Government coming together, which sends a clear message to any future Government contemplating doing something reckless or ditching a Coalition partner overnight.  It will clearly be seen that there is an alternative among the membership of this House, that alternative Governments can be put together and work and I believe this Government will work.</P>
      <P>Having said that, it is my belief there was no need for what happened.  We came here on the week of 14, 15 and 16 November last for what might be described as a routine week, we were on the countdown to Christmas, there was no general election on the horizon.  Suddenly a torpedo was fired into the bowels of the last Coalition Government and, lo and behold, it was gone.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main Opposition party must appreciate and understand the culture of coalitions because they have not <Col N="22" /> understood them to date.  The genesis, the origin of that party suggests that in every era when it was involved in coalition or partnership Governments, for a limited period, it failed to comprehend the basic, underlying principles on which coalitions work.  It happened in the 1930s when the Labour Party was seen as a short term prop, when the rug was pulled beneath them and the overall majority was gone.  It recurred in the era of the takeover by the former Taoiseach when a reasonably good Fianna Fáil/Progressive Democrats Government was torpedoed almost before the Taoiseach took office when he described it as a temporary little arrangement.  It happened on the last occasion when, during the summer, we were treated to megaphone confrontation, with the Tánaiste at one end of the world and the Taoiseach at the other rowing over the presidency of the High Court.</P>
    <P>There will be no rug-pulling in this Government, of that I am absolutely certain; because it is my firm belief that it was formed in a spirit of partnership, co-operation and understanding, that there will be consensus, compromise, common sense and that this Government will last.  Irrespective of the comments of Deputy Michael Ahern, I am personally delighted for the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton because, for once, the breaking ball bounced in his direction. I am delighted he is Taoiseach.  It is significant that he comes into office at a juncture when his very qualities, steadfastness, honesty, openness, accountability, ability and experience, were never more required.  The electorate are not seeking anything spectacular. I think they are looking for a safe pair of hands, for steady management, for an elimination of own goals, certainly, they do not want any scandals. They can rest assured that under the Taoiseachship of Deputy John Bruton there will be no scandals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton assumes the office of Taoiseach at a crucially important time because if ever politics was at a low ebb it is now.  All one need do is look at the <Col N="23" /> opinion polls, the voting patterns, the downward spiral, the downward trajectory: in the European elections 42 per cent of the people voted; that means six out of every ten stayed away; in itself that is frightening; when one reaches that level, democracy is under threat.  In opinion polls, the likelihood is that every second person asked will say they did not vote in the last election, probably in the previous one and will not vote in the next one.  To an extent that explains the contradictions in the two opinion polls published last weekend.</P>
    <P>Deputy McDowell described the manufacturing of two additional Ministers of State as &ldquo;necessity being the mother of invention&rdquo;.  That was a bit rich coming from a party that invented itself out of spleen and spite because it could not get on with the party from which it grew and emanated.  That was a bit rich coming from a party that decided, not so long after its formation, that it would take God out of the Constituation but discovered that was not very wise politically, so God was restored to the Constitution.  That was a bit rich coming from a party that went into office in 1989 with a party it had vilified right up to the three heaves during the early 1980s.  That is a bit rich coming from a party that had the option of coming into Government, rendering it a four-party Government, within which they could have been the safe ballast in the ship but chose to indulge themselves in Opposition, to remain out, yet they would have got a very reasonable deal from all the Coalition partners.  However, for reasons of so-called ideology, dressed up in all its preciousness, they decided to remain out because they want to indulge themselves in combat, in competition with Fianna Fáil on the Opposition benches, when they will try to wrest those extra seats which will give them further Opposition seats, poised for a return to power after the next general election. That is putting the country first.</P>
    <P>I am amused at the contentious objections coming from Fianna Fáil; they <Col N="24" /> would say that, would they not?  They have described this as a Cabinet Government.  I looked at the list of Cabinet advisers, Michael Doherty and others, to the former Taoiseach, all appointed at the taxpayers' expense, in many cases, to undertake the mundane of mundanities.  Again, no concern whatever was expressed then.  I looked at the list published in the <i>Sunday Trib-une</i>, on the eve of the collapse of the previous Government, when board after board of semi-State agency after semi-State agency, regional technical colleges, Dublin Institute of Technologys, every college was filled, when the primary criterion was not qualification, not academic achievement, not professional excellence but the cumann membership card.  That was the criterion used.  The people will judge for themselves.</P>
    <P>I welcome these ministerial appointments because they are necessary but if the demand arises &mdash; and I mean this in all sincerity &mdash; I would not rule out the possibility in future of additional Ministers of State.  If one looks at the pattern of commercial and social development here, year in, year out, one will immediately see we are handed out a multiplicity of directives and instructions from the European Union.  For example, to date, the Department of Enterprise and Employment has taken on board 1,088 directives from the European Union, the Departments of the Marine, Foreign Affairs and Finance, has each taken on board 1,148 directives from the European Union. One can go through each and every Government Department, when it is obvious that more and more directives come from Brussels which impinge on, interact and interface with the lives of our people here, requiring hands on management by Ministers and Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>In particular I welcome the appointment of these two additional Ministers of State.  The other day I was reading Robert Keyes's <i>Ireland, A History</i> emanating from the BBC and RTE series. For example, the first Fianna Fáil <Col N="25" /> Cabinet in 1933 comprised of ten Ministers; from that it grew to 15; thereafter there was the introduction of Ministers of State; it is an evolving process, one that will continue to develop in the future, provided there is justification.  I believe there is justification for these two appointments.</P>
    <P>I look at the population figures, already given by Deputy McCormack. For example, between 1926 and 1991 208,759 people have left.  In County Cavan there are now 129 fewer townlands than in 1926; in Donegal there are 170 fewer, Monaghan 90 fewer, Galway 224 fewer, Leitrim 145 fewer, Mayo 175 fewer, Roscommon 148 fewer and Sligo 67 fewer.  That amounts to a total of 1,148 townlands gone to the wall &mdash; dead empty, desolate, barren.  We have a Chernobyl here, a catastrophe unfolding before our eyes.  The position requires redress and we have a need for the appointment of a Minister with responsibility for western development. Indeed, I hope in time that post might become a senior ministerial post because I believe the position is drastic enough to require one.</P>
    <P>I come from the county of Davitt.  He was born 150 years ago into a small farm in Strade in County Mayo.  He was pitched out on the side of the road, left homeless without shelter, he went to Manchester and his eternal dream was to come back and rid this country of the scourge of landlordism.  He did that in my county in Irishtown by setting up the Land League in 1879.  Having regard to Davitt's dream today, I wonder if his work was in vain, particularly in relation to the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I asked the then Taoiseach in this House a number of months ago to give me details of full-time and part-time farming figures and they make very salutary reading indeed.  In 1951 there were 22,246 farmers in Galway and in 1986, almost ten years ago, that figure had fallen to 11,933.  In Roscommon in 1951 there were 12,966 farmers and in 1986 there were 5,542.  In Sligo in 1951 there were 9,068 farmers and in 1986 <Col N="26" /> there were 3,569, one-third of the number in 1951 remained and two-thirds had left.  In Leitrim there were 8,000 farmers in 1951 and in 1986 there were 2,043, three out of every four farmers had left.</P>
    <P>In my county of Mayo in 1951 there were 24,528 farmers and in 1986 there were 9,462.  In 1951 there were 77,048 farmers in Connacht and 32,943 in 1986, half the farming population have left.  A whole way of life, a culture and existence has gone to the wall, been wiped out never to be restored.  The frightening thing about that is that the trend is accepted as irreversible.  I do not accept that.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that the President called a meeting of the Council of State yesterday evening to discuss her presentation to this House and the word is that the emphasis will be on the diaspora, the Irish overseas community, the people of Irish extraction, the people in exile, the real Ireland.  If one examines where those people originate from, one will find that some of them instead of being in Belmullet are in Boston and others are scattered throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Measures should have been put in place to stem the flow of migration, to create employment and to develop the indigenous and natural resources, about which we have been scolded for their non-development over the years.  If the necessary imaginative policies had been put in place over the years by successive Governments, this human catastrophe need not have happened.  That is why I welcome the appointment of the Minister of State, Deputy Carey.  That is why I look upon it not simply as a token appointment because I can assure the House that Deputies from the west will be looking for action.</P>
    <P>We want a programme of action, a timescale, an agenda and, above all, we want results.  We want the position monitored.  I welcome the opportunity of contributing to the debate and I have no doubt that the ministerial appointments will be vindicated in due course. The appointment of Deputy Carey in particular is a significant, timely and historic one.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to participate in this Debate.  I listened carefully to what Deputy Higgins had to say.  Coming from the west of Ireland I, like you Chairman, share his views that the west has special needs and I will deal with this issue later in my contribution.  I have always respected what Deputy Higgins had to say in this House, but I recall his trenchant and critical remarks following the formation of the previous Labour-Fianna Fáil Government, particularly regarding the number of advisers, programme managers, etc.  I ask my friend, Deputy Higgins, to be consistent.  In the past he spoke out for the truth.  I was sorry that he was not rewarded in some way, but maybe he is better off to distance himself from his current regime which has done tremendous damage to the image of what was to be an open and transparent rainbow coalition.  It has made a major blunder in respect of the first legislation it introduced.  Members of the public to whom I have spoken cannot understand the need for it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach on his accession to the highest office in this land &mdash; it was a special moment and I listened with great interest to him &mdash; spoke with great conviction, emotion and certainly he sounded sincere.  He referred at the time to the meaning of the title Taoiseach. He said: &ldquo;In Gaelic Ireland, the Taoiseach was one who led by example rather than by exhortation, by character rather than coercion and who exercised such authority as he had, as a service to <Col N="28" /> the people&rdquo;.  In creating two new ministerial posts, appointing additional special advisers, programme managers and so on at huge cost to the taxpayer, the Taoiseach has led by example and, without coercion, his fellow members of Government have indeed followed suit.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's speech was short and the importance of his words carried increased weight given its brevity.  The first words of any person attaining high office always take on an added significance for they are generally sober thoughts delivered at an important moment in our history.  That sobriety, as we heard last night and today, was short lived.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in a speech on 15 December especially emphasised one word, &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo;, which will be the theme for my contribution.  The Taoiseach used the word &ldquo;simplicity&rdquo; three times in two sentences.  He said, &ldquo;in the same way that [he sought] simplicity in the Office of the Taoiseach [he sought] simplicity in Government and national policy.  Good Government [he said] is a public service and it should be kept simple&rdquo;. Now we know that those words meant nothing.  They were empty words. This is a very poor start by Deputy Bruton, whom I respect and the Irish people have seen through this charade and hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>In his speech he went on to say that, &ldquo;the Government must go about its work without excess or extravagance and as transparently as if it were working behind a pane of glass&rdquo;.  Nobody could but agree with these lofty sentiments and at the time everybody probably did agree with them.  Those of us who did can only be astonished at the turnabout of events.  Let us remind ourselves of the facts and consider such simplicity at work.  The Taoiseach's predecessor found that two Ministers of State were sufficient to help in running his Department, but that is not so for Deputy Bruton.  As he said, he likes things simple, so he appoints four Ministers of State to his Department.  What about the additional office accommodation and back-up staff that will be <Col N="29" /> needed following those appointments? For example, Deputy Doyle will need offices in three Departments, the Taoiseach's, Finance and Transport, Energy and Communications.  As one of my colleagues said last night, it is one of the greatest examples of job creation &mdash; jobs for the boys and girls.  No doubt the employment figures will reflect that at the end of the month.</P>
    <P>The title of my successor in the office of European Affairs brings to mind a passage from John B. Keane's fictional political letters on the appointment of a Minister of State.  In that letter the fictional Taoiseach is offering an appointment to a Deputy and states: &ldquo;What would you say, Mac,&rdquo; said he &ldquo;to Minister of State for Bogland areas?&rdquo;&ldquo;I would love it,&rdquo; McFillan answered &ldquo;although it sounds a bit bare&rdquo;.  &ldquo;All right&rdquo;, the Taoiseach said, &ldquo;how about Minister for bogland areas with special responsibility for game and wildlife?&rdquo;&ldquo;Beautiful, absolutely beautiful&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;the greater the number of words after the name, the better, this will really impress the constituents&rdquo;.  I note with some amusement the title given to my successor in the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for European affairs.  The new post is now titled &ldquo;Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for European affairs, with special responsibility for the IFSC and local development initiatives and at the Department of Foreign Affairs with special responsibility for European affairs generally and preparation for the Intergovernmental Conference in 1996&rdquo;.  That certainly should go down well with the constituents.  John B. Keane will be proud of it, perhaps it might lead to the publication of another book from that esteemed author.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I will wait patiently. There are even more interesting simplicities to come from the new Government. We now have a major new development &mdash; deviation from the norm &mdash; in the appointment of a Minister of State to the Government as well as two new junior Ministers.  The public should be made aware of what is involved in these appointments.  Deputy Rabbitte's special appointment came about because of the arrogance and stubbornness of Deputy Spring, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the Labour Party.  Deputy Spring was badly treated, we are told, by the Fianna Fáil Party.  The evidence from the negotiations with the rainbow partners show clearly that he is the real bully boy of this period in political life.  Deputy Spring's philosophy &mdash; and no doubt that of his advisers &mdash; is very simple, namely, &ldquo;let us be flexible, transparent; let us have real partnership as long as I get my way&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any sense of fair play and justice Deputy Rabbitte was entitled to a Cabinet position, but that was not to be as far as the Labour Party was concerned, the party of partnership.  It was very happy to move to the left, but would gladly leave Mr. Rabbitte behind. According to commentators, Deputy Spring did extremely well; he was praised extensively in the media for how well he did.  He pushed Deputies John <Col N="32" /> Bruton and De Rossa to the wire and got his way.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the crux of this debate.  These new junior Minister posts were created as a result of the strategy of Deputy Spring and the Labour Party in the negotiations on forming the rainbow coalition.  He got the plum jobs &mdash; Finance, Foreign Affairs and Environment &mdash; and then the patching up operation began.  Deputy Bruton and the Fine Gael Party gave in to the bully boy tactics because they were desperate for office; otherwise they were in serious trouble, something which has been accepted by the public and the media.  There is no doubt the Fine Gael Party was up against it &mdash; a Labour Party with all its arrogance determined to call all the shots and ensure it would dominate the new Government.  The result was the creation of the post of the so-called high chair junior Minister at the Cabinet table.  The Labour Party was quite clever and indeed careful that it would not be left hanging on waiting for the unfilled positions.  Again, the Fine Gael Party was to suffer.  The Labour Party's handlers won again and Deputies Doyle and Carey were hung out for public attention, taking the focus off the perpetrators.  The pattern of subtle deception has fooled some of the people all the time and all the people some of the time, but the Labour Party's veil of so-called integrity is slipping lower and lower.  The public has seen through this charade.  This well orches-trated and produced farce will ensure that the Labour Party will fool none of the people none of the time.  The public will be waiting for its members when we next go before it to let them know what it thinks of their integrity.</P>
    <P>Where are all the voices of conscience, the men and women of principle in the backbenches of the Labour Party?  We heard them often enough on the plinth over the last number of years. Where are all the men and women who stand by truth and standards in high places?  Where is Deputy Kemmy?  We heard some feeble words from him on the nine o'clock news last night, his <Col N="33" /> usual comments &ldquo;I don't like it, but I'll vote for it&rdquo;.  Where were all the Deputy Kemmys in the past week to stand up for the truth on this matter of national interest?  I can only presume that those backbench Deputies are afraid to speak out against their leader and the advisers who, again, have won the day.</P>
    <P>As far as the Fianna Fáil Party is concerned it is agreed that this is an abuse of power and we will rescind this decision if given an opportunity in the future, and I have no doubt that will happen before very long.</P>

      <P>We will revert &mdash; and we have given a commitment in this regard &mdash; to the previous position in respect of the number of Ministers of State, that is 15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agree with the role given to Deputy Carey who will have responsibility for the Western Development Board.  That position should have been allocated in the 15 appointments.  We heard a great deal from Deputies who spoke on this debate about the needs of the west.  Deputy Carey is a very able and deserving person, but the Government should be honest in regard to his appointment.  It was signalled publicly that the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle was earmarked for Deputy Carey. The Taoiseach announced it as a matter of fact.  The truth of the matter is that he could not remove Deputy Jacob from that position because the Standing Orders of the House would not allow it. As an afterthought a new position was invented &mdash; Minister of State with responsibility for the Western Development Board.  Why was this an afterthought? As one who hails from the west, I believe it was a major insult to <Col N="34" /> the people from the west that this job was created as an afterthought to satisfy a political requirement of this new &ldquo;Government of Renewal&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Seán Donlon, a highly qualified person, will be the new Taoiseach's programme manager and special adviser on Northern Ireland.  The Government will have difficulty explaining to the public how it justifies his excessive salary of £80,000, in effect, a double salary.  One can imagine the smoke filled rooms with people huddled together to devise a solution which would keep the public from questioning the new appointment. Why not be open and transparent and admit, if it is what they believe, that this man is the right man for the job in the absence of Dr. Martin Mansergh who played such a central role in the development of the peace process?  Why not admit the truth?  He is from the private sector where he commands a very high salary and is not interested unless the remuneration is sufficient.  To pay him and to accept the consequences would be too honest.  The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and their team of advisers thought it better to devise a mechanism of deceit.  They are not fooling the public on this issue.  Their plan has failed and the people will not be fooled because what has happened in regard to this appointment is clear.</P>
    <P>The final dilemma to be resolved was to satisfy the Tánaiste, the Labour Party and the Department of Foreign Affairs that Mr. Donlon would not shift the power and influence in relation to Northern Ireland from Deputy Spring in the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The solution was to do another deal and appoint a new secretary within the Department of Foreign Affairs in the hope of keeping Deputy Spring happy. It is a sad day when jobs and the balance of power between the parties in Government are the overriding criteria and motivation in dealing with such a central issue of Government policy, namely, how the Northern Ireland peace process is dealt with by the Government.  I have the greatest respect for the official in question in the <Col N="35" /> Department of Foreign Affairs.  He is a person of great ability and integrity.  It is a disgrace that his name has become embroiled in this political power game.</P>
    <P>I come now to Deputy Rabbitte, special Minister of State.  Why does the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, have a programme manager? I understood the role of the programme manager was to ensure that the Programme for Government was adhered to and that all planned legislation was dealt with.  Why is there a need for a second programme manager at the Department of Enterprise and Employment? The appointment of two more Ministers of State will have follow up consequences; it will mean at least four new private secretaries.  Deputy Avril Doyle will be based in three Departments. I can only describe Deputy Doyle as &ldquo;Wonderwoman&rdquo; because she will need wings to get around the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  She will not have time to stop anywhere along the way.  It is as well that she has responsibility for energy because she will need plenty of it.</P>
    <P>The contributions by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, and Deputy Avril Doyle last night have not helped to enlighten this House or the public as to what is happening here.  They have led to more confusion.  Like other Ministers of State, Deputy Doyle will be in different Departments and different buildings and new offices will be required.  She will have no real power and there will be chaos and confusion.</P>
    <P>Let us remind ourselves of the wise words of the Taoiseach on his election, about the need for simplicity in Government, national policy and in the Office of the Taoiseach.  He said that good Government is a public service and it should be kept simple.  The word &ldquo;simple&rdquo; has many meanings, one of which is &ldquo;of little value&rdquo; or &ldquo;weak in mind&rdquo;. In that sense, we can truly say his <Col N="36" /> Government is simple.  We are only a wet, dank and miserable week into the first parliamentary session and this is the first legislation it has introduced. This does not augur well for the future. The public is not fooled by this legislation introduced by the Government of renewal.  If this is the best it can do, I await with interest its other good ideas.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to contribute to this debate on the appointment of two new Ministers of State.  I have no difficulty in agreeing to the appointment of these two Ministers of State because they will carry out jobs in need of urgent action.</P>
      <P>Because I come from the west I shall deal specifically with the appointment of the Minister of State with responsibility for western development and rural renewal.  I will put in context the need for such a Minister of State and the need for radical and urgent action in the west.  People do not realise the extent to which the west is out of kilter with the rest of the country.  In 1990 when the national plan for 1989-93 was published a good socio-economic analysis of the various subregions was carried out. Regrettably, because much of it was embarrassing to the then Government, there was no such socio-economic analysis of the subregions for the 1994-99 national plan.  I suspect it was not done because it would have proved a further embarrassment to the Government. As bad as the position was in 1989-93 it would have appeared much worse in 1994.  It would have been shown that the west had gone into an even greater decline since the national plan of 1989-93.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to draw the attention of the House to the bishops' commission which worked for over two years and carried out an analysis of the problems of the west.  That commission drew its <Col N="37" /> conclusions from extensive consultations with various interest groups and individuals who operate in the west.  I also participated in a number of such consultations.  The commission produced a very interesting report, <i>A Crusade for Survival</i>, which was launched in Castlebar, and had two main conclusions: it recommends the setting up of a western development board and also that the Government appoint a Minister who would co-ordinate the work of such a western development board.  The report states:</P>
    <P>Finally, we recommend that a member of the Government should be given special responsibility for development of the West of Ireland in accordance with the priorities recommended in this report.  We envisage that the proposed western development board would be responsible to the designated Minister.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on making this appointment and making the Western Development Board responsible to this Minister.</P>
    <P>We must profile the west.  Recently, much has been said of the population decline in western counties, the worst decline occurring between 1986-91. Many people say that the population in the west was always in decline, but that is not so.  It declined between 1900 and 1961 but it stabilised thereafter.  The populations of Counties Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, with perhaps the exception of Leitrim, stabilised between 1961 and 1987.  The 1991 Census frightened people as it showed that in five years County Roscommon had lost 5.4 per cent of its population; incidentally, there was no population decline in the years 1981-86, in fact there was a marginal increase.  The same is true of County Mayo.  In the years 1986-91, the population of Counties Mayo and Leitrim declined by 4.3 per cent and a staggering 6.1 per cent, respectively.  These figures frightened most people.</P>
    <P>Emigration and population is being revisited on the region again on a large scale.  One would have to look back to <Col N="38" /> the 1930s to find comparable figures.  I do not accept the argument made by many people that there always has been decline in the west.  Economic policies introduced in the late 1950s and operated throughout the 1960s and 1970s at least stabilised matters.  We did not have sufficient growth in population during that period, but nevertheless the population remained stable.</P>
    <P>It is against that background that the bishops published their report last February. The then Taoiseach, responded by announcing in Castlebar that the Western Development Board, referred to in this report, would be set up.  However what the Taoiseach did not say at the time &mdash; this was remiss of him &mdash; was that a member of the Government would be given specific responsibilities for the co-ordination of that work.  In that context I welcome most warmly the appointment of Deputy Donal Carey. Deputy Carey is from a west of Ireland constituency although the county he lives in is in the province of Munster. He lives in County Clare which has all the characteristics and problems that bedevil counties Mayo, Sligo and Roscommon and other western seaboard counties.  He is more aware than most people in this House of the problems he must tackle.  Deputy Carey is particularly well suited and qualified, from his experience on the ground, to do the job and I welcome him.</P>
    <P>I will give Deputy Carey a little advice &mdash; I know he will take it.  He should take a broad objective look at all the existing State agencies that serve the west to see if they can deliver a better service.  While much funding has been made available for the west, at least on paper, in recent years, much of it has not been well focused and has not given the desired results.</P>
    <P>I welcome the new industrial policy published this week by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton.  Nine State agencies will be involved in the operation and co-ordination of that policy which, I hope, will produce 100,000 new jobs within the next five years.  A close <Col N="39" /> look should be taken at the way these State agencies will create jobs in the west.  I call for a tighter focus in this regard.  State personnel working in these agencies should be given a specific objective or target for the creation of, say, 10,000 jobs in their region and at the end of five years they should have to show the economic impact in the community, county or part of the subregion. That is very important.</P>
    <P>The new Minister of State must also ensure that the west retains its Objective 1 status for European Union funding. As a result of economic development in some areas by the year 1999 or sooner many parts of Ireland will no longer be considered Objective 1 regions.  The Dublin area will certainly lose its Objective 1 status, as will many other regions.  It is very important that the whole country does not lose its Objective 1 status.  There are only 25 people per square kilometre in the western region, the national average is 51 people per square kilometre while the average throughout the rest of the Community is 150 people per square kilometre. That is why, above all other regions, we must retain our Objective 1 status well into the first half of the 21st century.</P>
    <P>Rural renewal tax incentive schemes should be introduced for the west for instance to encourage our many exiles to invest here.  People in the United States, the United Kingdom and other places would like to invest their money at home but we provide no incentive for that.  That ought to be considered because an enormous amount of money could be put into the region from this source, and we must create the climate by which it can come in.</P>
    <P>There should be proper incentives for the service industry.  We tend to depend on the manufacturing industry for job creation, but the service industry is a much greater creator of jobs.  We must ensure that as part of a new development policy for the west the services <Col N="40" /> industry, particularly the area of telematics and modern technology, is considered. These are a few words of advice to the incoming Minister.  I would draw the attention of the House to the need for a greater level of investment in the western region.</P>
    <P>I hope the new Minister of State, on the setting up of his Department, will receive adequate funding to carry out his work.  Imagination and new approaches are needed, but these will be of little use unless adequate resources are made available.</P>
    <P>I have tried to give some profile of the problems in the west which has a population structure that is much older than in the rest of the country.  It has only half the national density of population and is twice as dependent on agriculture as the rest of the country.  The average income is about 80 per cent of the national average and about 45 per cent of the Community average.  Many groups such as small farmers receive much less than 80 per cent of the national average income.</P>

      <P>I support the appointment of the two Ministers of State, both of whom will have very important tasks to perform.  Before I go into detail on the role they will play I would first point out that the Fianna Fáil Party did not intend to oppose these appointments but because a smaller party in Opposition, the Progressive Democrats, opposed them, the once great Fianna Fáil Party decided it would not be upstaged.  The great malaise of this once great party is its inability to make a decision and stick by it.  That is the weakness that resulted in it sitting on the Opposition benches, that led to its fall from Government.  As a result of this weakness we saw former Government Ministers of the Fianna Fáil Party on bended knees pleading with their tutor for their Christmas report, that he was to write up, all except one, as being grossly incompetent.  That is what we were told at the committee of inquiry. When eventually he agreed, they thanked him profusely.  The public who <Col N="41" /> listened to the report of that committee were shocked at the way our country was being run.</P>
      <P>We see this weakness again in contributions from Fianna Fáil Deputies who talk about bullying by their partners in Government.  A partner in Government which expresses its view is not engaged in bullying, it is showing strength.  Partners must be able to discuss their views and come to a compromise.  A party cannot run away and say it is being bullied.</P>
      <P>Yesterday it was amazing to hear Deputy Michael McDowell sing the same song as Deputy McCreevy.  Of course, this is hardly surprising as their parties were originally one.  Deputy Cullen saw the light before his colleagues and joined Fianna Fáil.  I have no doubt that the remainder of the Progressive Democrats Deputies will join Fianna Fáil.  There are none so blind as those who will not see.</P>
      <P>I wish to refer to the appointment of Deputies Avril Doyle and Donal Carey as Ministers of State.  Deputy Doyle is an extremely competent Deputy and even though she has a wide brief I have no doubt she will clear the dust from the desks in her Departments and that in many cases sparks will fly.  Many people will say this is not before time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is proposed to appoint Deputy Donal Carey as Minister of State with responsibility for western development and rural renewal, two areas which have been neglected by previous Governments during the past seven years. Thousands of families in rural Ireland have been grossly neglected by previous Governments.  Their incomes fell below the poverty threshold, yet they received no support.  These people pleaded on their knees to be allowed to raise their families and to be given an opportunity to earn a livelihood in their areas but all their pleas went unheeded by previous Governments: even the plan put forward by the Bishops went unheeded. Hundreds of people here had to leave rural areas because no one would listen to their pleas or put in place worthwhile proposals which would give them the <Col N="42" /> livelihood to which they felt they were entitled.</P>
    <P>When we refer to the west people think we are referring to counties Mayo, Galway etc.  They seem to forget that there are 12 western counties, including my county, Cavan, and Monaghan.  I know from personal experience that rural Ireland has been ignored&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that roads in rural areas have been totally neglected. When I was an Opposition Deputy all my calls for assistance for these areas went unheeded.  Now that my party is in Government I expect that problem to be dealt with.  Before the change of Government people expected to wait 20 years before the roads in their areas would be improved.</P>
      <P>It is unfortunate that I do not have more time to deal with this very important issue.  It is not acceptable that the people in rural areas should have expected to wait 20 years for these improvements when successive Governments since 1987 ensured that large urban areas were given proper services. This is not democracy in operation.</P>
      <P>Children in rural areas have to wear wellingtons when walking to the school bus &mdash; the buses cannot traverse the roads &mdash; and many doctors are refusing to make house calls because they are afraid their cars will not make the journey. Many households do not even have a water supply while other families have had to leave the land because adequate grants were not paid under the headage scheme.  Successive Governments neglected rural areas because they knew that their votes were in the large urban areas.  People in rural areas are extremely important to this country, which was built and serviced by people from small farms in rural areas.  That neglect will be corrected by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Carey represents a Munster constituency but I have no doubt that he has ample knowledge and stamina to <Col N="43" /> harness all the goodwill which exists and to bring about rural renewal for people who believed they had been forgotten. He will be a shining light for these people and give them hope for the future.</P>

      <P>The lovely titles being given to the proposed two new Ministers of State conceal the real reasons for these appointments.  I have no objection to the individuals involved.  I know both Deputies, have great regard for them and recognise the contributions made by them in this House and by Deputy Doyle in the Seanad.  However, it is obvious that if the attempt to appoint Deputy Carey as Leas-Cheann Comhairle had succeeded there would be no proposal to appoint a Minister of State with responsibility for Western Development and Rural Renewal.  It is extraordinary that the failure to remove Deputy Joe Jacob from the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle &mdash; a position which he has held with great distinction &mdash; has led to a political exercise which at the end of the day is primarily aimed at paying a dividend to two people who were clearly unhappy and aggrieved by the treatment meted out to them by the Leader of their party, the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no objection to the appointment of Deputy Carey as Minister of State with responsibility for Western Development and Rural Renewal but the reasons for his appointment do not give me any great hope about commitments, real or imaginary, by the main party in Government.  Previous Coalition Governments led by Fine Gael treated the west in a disgraceful manner. The first evidence of this was reflected in the number of people from the west appointed to Cabinet positions. The Cabinet is where the real power lies <Col N="44" /> and where decisions on finance are made.  Compared to Fianna Fáil's commitment in Government to the west and the number of Fianna Fáil Ministers from the west and midlands, there was clearly no commitment among previous Coalition Governments, of which Fine Gael was a member, to the west.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise some of the difficulties endured by people in the west.  As many speakers said, in recent years we witnessed a serious decline in social and economic activities and in its population.  In the Longford-Roscommon constituency, another business is on the brink of collapse.  The Shannonside milk powder plant is about to go to the wall for the simple reason that one of its major shareholders, Midwest Co-operative, which has a 27 per cent shareholding in the company, has decided to pull the rug from under its own company and for purely commercial purposes, ignoring any social requirements for the west of Ireland, sell its milk into Nenagh.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that many of the people central to the development of the west of Ireland are silent at this time.  I have called publicly on the President of the IFA, who comes from the west of Ireland, to make a clear and definite commitment in this regard.  He has a special role in that it is farmers who are engaged in the co-operative movement to a large degree and, more particularly in this case, milk producers. It is necessary for him to ensure that Midwest is encouraged to send its milk back into Shannonside, thereby saving the 70 or 80 jobs that are now threatened. That would undoubtedly have a favourable economic impact upon the wider community, including farmers.</P>
    <P>I am conscious, of course, that the President of the IFA, Mr. Donnelly, is a director of Nenagh Co-operative which has now entered into an arrangement to accept milk supplies from Midwest.  I am also conscious of the fact that the manager of Midwest is involved in the Western Enterprise Board.  These people are engaging in rhetoric while, at the same time, working in the opposite direction <Col N="45" /> because of the nature of the positions they hold and the necessary confrontational situations that arise while serving two masters.</P>
    <P>People in this situation should declare where their loyalties lie.  This House debated an ethics Bill during the last Dáil session.  Clearly, if a politican was involved in some of the activities now being promoted, which are contrary to the best interests of the people of the west of Ireland, there would be an outcry. The same obligation should be placed on people who hold high public office in an unelected area but whose power of influence is such that they can cause differences to arise which create serious hardship and economic decline.</P>
    <P>People holding high office should set aside their personal commercial interests and their desire for profit as a matter of urgency and recognise the social consequences of their actions.  It is unfair if people in employment are being asked to accept what is almost below a reasonable wage for the purposes of maintaining jobs.  It is also contrary to what I would describe as the use of a resource called labour which is about human beings whose expectations should be one of a decent wage.</P>
    <P>Over the years school transport has been threatened because the numbers required to comply with the regulations governing school transport cannot be met due to depopulation.  School transport services may have to be terminated if pupil numbers fall below the requirement.</P>
    <P>Reviews are undertaken from time to time to justify the retention of two teacher schools.  This instils fear in local communities who wish to see the retention of their two and three teacher schools.  There will have to be a change in the pupil numbers requirement in these schools to protect the jobs of the teachers.  The arrangement entered into between the unions and management must be reviewed for the simple reason that the population is declining and that impacts seriously on the numbers of teachers in schools with the subsequent damage to the quality of education.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> Post offices have been closed also.  I hope the Chief Executive of An Post will never again announce the reopening of a post office on a high profile radio show.  Deputies from the west of Ireland requested the Chief Executive of An Post to retain the post office at Carracastle.  Those requests were refused until the Chief Executive appeared on a high profile morning radio show and announced that the post office was being kept open.  There should be no personal opportunities or wish for gain on the part of chief executives of semi-State bodies.  They must do what is right, recognising the social and economic requirements that must be taken account of in any decisions they make.</P>
    <P>The Shannon designation programme, which I recommended to the former Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy O'Rourke, was taken on board by her.  A number of meetings have taken place and the intention is to ensure that the river Shannon is classified as an area of great resource from a tourism point of view and to ensure, by offering the right incentives, that people invest in it.  I hope that will not be forgotten by this Government and by the new Minister for the west if he is appointed.  I hope the new Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry will take a personal interest in the problems of Shannonside.</P>
    <P>There are many more comments I would like to make in regard to forestry, roads and the planning laws that are being implemented by people who have very little understanding of the importance of living in the countryside and retaining and developing rural life.  The attitude of Fine Gael to Shannon Airport and the urbanisation of people by forcing them into towns are matters which must be taken into account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  I congratulate the Taoiseach and the new Government on being selected to govern the country for two <Col N="47" /> and a half years, all going well.  I am disappointed that we do not have a Minister or a Minister of State in rural County Cork.  The Taoiseach has concentrated on urban areas and massive population centres and forgotten rural County Cork in his ministerial appointments. That is of great concern to the people of Cork.</P>
      <P>I would not be consistent if I did not oppose these appointments and the procedures being adopted by the Government. At the time of the appointment of Deputy Reynolds's Government I made a similar statement.  I do not oppose the Members appointed, Deputies Carey and Doyle.  I wish them every success and we on this side of the House will co-operate with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of two additional junior Ministers and programme managers and the setting up of more Dáil committees by the Taoiseach is nothing short of naked hypocrisy given the true record of Fine Gael in Opposition on those issues.  On many occasions when he was in Opposition the Taoiseach was quite critical of us when we were in Government.  These appointments have nothing to do with good Government. In a country of fewer than three million people the appointment of 15 senior Ministers, 17 junior Ministers, numberous programme managers and advisers and committee members is an abuse of power and will lead to a corruption in Government.  It is &ldquo;jobs for the boys&rdquo; the purpose of which is to keep everyone quiet at their firesides.  Practically two-thirds of the new Administration is in some type of job from chairman of a committee to convenor &mdash; what I call stamp-licking &mdash; whose function is to call meetings.  Everybody gets a shilling to keep the Government in position and not rock the boat.  There will be no Government backbenchers who will criticise the Government for fear of losing their little jobs.  It is about &ldquo;little jobeens&rdquo;.  This is what government in this country has come to and it is of grave concern to me and the honest, <Col N="48" /> decent people we are sent here to represent.</P>
    <P>This is an attempt by Fine Gael to appease all its Deputies and supporters in the wake of the disastrous rainbow Coalition negotiated by Fine Gael.  It gave away all the key Ministers.  It is ironic that even some of the junior Ministers in Democratic Left and Labour have bigger budgets and more important portfolios than many of the so-called senior Fine Gael Ministers.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party introduced the multitude of advisers and programme managers to provide jobs for their friends after the last general election at the taxpayers' expense.  Now Fine Gael and Labour have followed suit.  The new Ministers and programme managers will require offices, in some cases, more than one office, in different Departments. According to an article in last Sunday's <i>Sunday Business Post,</i> the Taoiseach. Deputy John Bruton has facilities at the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Justice besides his other accommodation at St. Stephen's Green; Deputy Gay Mitchell has two offices, one at the Department of Foreign Affairs and the other at the Department of the Taoiseach; Deputy Austin Currie has offices in three Departments, Health, Education and Justice; Deputy Avril Doyle will have offices in three Departments &mdash; the Taoiseach, Finance, Transport, Energy and Communications; Deputy Donal Carey, whom I wish well, will require offices at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht; the standard position applies to Deputy Seán Barrett; Deputy Bernard Allen will have offices at the Departments of Education and the Environment as well as an office here. The whole thing is questionable.  If the Departments are as busy as we are told they are, how can a Minister do business and keep an eye on his brief in four offices at four different Government Departments?</P>
    <P>In the past, £5 million was wasted on Government jobs.  I understand that will double.  It seems to be thought in this House and in parts of the country that <Col N="49" /> this House should be as busy as the House of Commons, the governing body in the UK.  The House of Commons has approximately 600 representatives representing 57 million people.  If we are to be cost effective, do our job properly and give value for money to the hardridden taxpayer, we cannot identify with the House of Commons.</P>
    <P>The question of Government transport has been contentious and should be looked at.  I believe in the introduction of two litre State cars for Ministers of State.  We have heard stories about abuses involving private drivers who, in some cases, are brothers or sisters of Ministers.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear the Government's proposal for a third banking force.  Is the ideology of the left wing parties influencing the right wing of the Government?  There is no room here for a third banking force because, rather than improving competition, it would result in a more inefficient banking service. This is proposed not on the basis of economics but to satisfy the ideologies of the other parties.  We are all aware that the market dictates interests rates and there are plenty of people who can examine the matter if the margin of profit is too high and banking becomes costly for the customer.</P>
    <P>We have heard much about county roads.  Now that we have a budgetary surplus the Government has a once off opportunity to make a contribution towards county and secondary roads which are in a deplorable state of repair. When we were in Government we were reminded day after day about the roads. I sympathise with Deputy Durkan in having to reply to this debate.  However, I know where his heart is and that he will use his influence to see that there is an additional allocation for county roads.  As many county councils have not yet been made aware of their funding for 1995 the Minister still has the opportunity to make that extra money available for roads.  A good road structure will mean lower costs for business and make rural areas more attractive for the development of industry.</P>

      <P>My opposite number, Deputy Charlie McCreevy, asked yesterday why these positions were not seen as important three weeks ago when the initial announcements were made. Why did they, when in Government, not see the importance of creating these posts?  At this stage they must be asking themselves that.  The Government may have thought of these vital issues late, but it thought of them, and no one would suggest there is no need for a Minister for rural development and resettlement.  The sentiments expressed by the last speaker underline such a need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know the Member opposite will not take it personally because it is not meant personally, but nothing amazes me so much as the transformation of Fianna Fáil when it moves from one side of the House to the other.  What was acceptable a month ago is unacceptable now.  This phenomenon is not new.  I have noticed it since I came into this House 13 or 14 years ago. When it is sitting here it has no difficulty in accepting anything put forward and Members will nonchalantly waltz through the division lobbies and defend everything with their lives.  However, when they move to the Opposition benches they suddenly develop consciences and start to raise questions on openness <Col N="51" /> in Government, as they did yesterday.  I was surprised to hear my good friend, Deputy McCreevy, say that it was not so much a place at the trough as the identity of the diners.  It reminded me of a herd of buffalo who had been stampeded from their usual watering place and had withdrawn to a nearby hillside from where they mounted an offensive against those who had taken over their position.</P>
    <P>It is very amusing and I know, a Chathaoirleach, you must find it amusing that that great party, the Fianna Fáil Party, has a much more sensitive conscience in Opposition than in Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Keeffe raised very good points and the case he made underlines the need for the creation of the ministries that the Opposition are wrongly criticising.  Anyone who knows rural Ireland knows well that the population has been sharply dwindling in a line west of Athlone, and even to the east of the Shannon the population in rural areas is declining.  There is a number of contributory factors as mentioned by Members.  A watchful eye has to be kept on two teacher schools, the rural post offices and Garda stations.  There is a general feeling that people should not live in rural areas, that instead they should be places to where urban dwellers or people from elsewhere could spend holidays.  That is very romantic but I do not think we can afford such luxury in this small country.  We have had the tradition of a rural population for as long as history and I honestly believe there is no case to be made for <Col N="52" /> denuding the countryside of its population.</P>
      <P>The creation of a ministry to address that problem is long overdue and I reject the criticism levelled at this Government for doing so.  I also reject the suggestion that it was an afterthought, at least the Government thought of it.  At the first attempt to address a problem, one has to sit down and think.  Furthermore, Jim Connolly of Rural Resettlement Ireland stated at a recent conference that he had targeted the issue of the Government appointing a Minister for Rural Development.  He rightly did so, equally correctly he recognised the legitimacy and urgent need of doing so as we do.  I am sure the Opposition will do so in due course, the same applies to the appointment of Deputy Doyle.  Both Deputies have given excellent service and have tremendous experience and I think they will justify the trust placed in them.  I think in time the House will look back at those appointments and say they were appropriate for the time.  We need one representative for each province to ensure the development of rural areas, I have held that view for a long time. It will be beneficial in future to have a Minister or Minister of State located in each province with responsibility for a network that goes directly to the European Union for funding.  There is nothing wrong with that as I think our job is to ensure the improvement of the quality of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was concerned at the Opposition's criticism of the formation of committees. I found it very difficult to keep a straight face because it appeared that Fianna Fáil would not participate in the committees or would not be available to act as chairpersons or convenors.  I am not sure if that is true but that is the impression I got from their criticisms.  It appears that they went slightly over-board and threw out the baby with the bath water, admittedly, however, they did not suggest that they would not be available to act as convenors or chairpersons in the event of being asked.  It would be a break with tradition if they <Col N="53" /> were not and I hope that their criticism of the committee system does not mean that it will be left to the Government to fill all the positions.  However, I am sure we will be further enlightened on that.</P>
    <P>The comments of my colleague on the Committee of Public Accounts, Deputy Sean Doherty, were equally valid and entertaining as always.  He referred to the Fine Gael Party's attitude to Shannon Airport but it was surely delivered tongue in cheek because when that great party was in Government I recall they took a decision which was not to the eternal benefit of Shannon and I do not know why the matter should have been brought up now.  One can only assume it was done with tongue in cheek.  The committees will improve the efficiency of the House and will be of vital importance in dealing with regional issues, such as Shannon, which will arise in the future.  Such issues could be aired in a committee rather than have the Government bring in proposals or spend time kite flying, as has been the practice in the past and have the Opposition adopt various stances in order to determine in advance what the Government was likely to do.  We can all benefit from an expanded committee system.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Members of the Front Bench opposite who were appointed in recent weeks and wish them well.  In the heat of the moment in the political arena we often lose sight of the target but in the democratic system it is important to recognise the role played by the Opposition and the Government.  Our intentions are honourable but we will be forthright and hard hitting when necessary.  We are not in the business of whingeing and I know that will not be the response of the Opposition either.  The appointments which are the subject of this discussion will be seen as both necessary and worthy.  As time goes on they will become a focus in their own right for people's recognition.</P>
    <P>I hope the Opposition will recognise that political capital is not readily <Col N="54" /> gained from every issue.  In the democratic system we tend to take full advantage of every opportunity but I suggest that the opportunity is not as great as it seems on this issue.  That will be borne out as time goes on.</P>
    <P>When the House approves the appointment of the two Ministers of State they will attend to their duties which undoubtedly they are capable of doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Browne.  I congratulate the Minister of State and members of the Government and sympathise with those who did not make it on this occasion despite the valiant efforts of Deputy Bruton to accommodate almost everyone. I assure the Minister of State that my role and that of Fianna Fáil is to support any measures that deserve support but as I indicated, my colleagues in Wexford who are in Government will probably all hold office assuming this Bill is rammed through.  I will support anything that is good for my constituency and country but I will keep a close eye on performance and activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many are called but few are chosen was the traditional advice given to aspiring politicians.  Deputy John Bruton has chosen everyone who bothered to call him.  The Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Bill is as unnecessary as it is unwanted.  The existing quota of 15 Ministers of State has been adequate if not generous.  In 1980 when the number of Ministers of State was increased from ten to 15, Fine Gael and Labour opposed the move.  It is ironic that as reported in Volume 318 of the Official Report Deputy Peter Barry said: &ldquo;I do not believe any Member would pretend that there was any other reason for the appointment of the extra five Ministers of State than the fact that there are political debts to be paid off&rdquo;.  I am sure he would say the same today and that the Minister of State believes that.  He put up a stout defence.  That he finished speaking before his time expired clearly indicates that he lacked conviction but <Col N="55" /> he deserves congratulations for a valiant effort.</P>
    <P>The reasons so forcibly given by Deputy Barry, Fine Gael and Labour for not increasing the number of Ministers of State are an unanswerable argument against this Bill.  Whatever the political reality 15 years ago it is a certainty now that the Taoiseach is squandering public money to pay for political favours. Cronyism, Tammany Hall politics, cheap strokes and other catcalls have been the mainstay of the Government's political lexicon over the past 15 years. How power corrupts and how quickly.</P>
    <P>The origins of this Bill go back to the formation of the Government.  Deputy Harney, who for a time was engaged in the negotiations, referred to the matter on the morning the Government was formed.  Neither major party in Government was prepared to give Democratic Left a fair crack of the whip.  The clear expectation was that when either Democratic Left or the Progressive Democrats Party was chosen by Fine Gael and Labour as the third coalition party, room would be made at the table for them.  In the case of the Progressive Democrats the onus would be on Fine Gael and if Democratic Left was chosen the onus would be on the Labour Party. Democratic Left was chosen and two seats at Cabinet was the irreducible minimum demand for its participation in Government.  That was made clear from the beginning of the negotiations. Neither Democratic Left or Fine Gael had counted on the greed and selfishness of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party caused the collapse of one Government and twice pulled out of negotiations to form another Government with Fianna Fáil.  At the eleventh hour the intransigence of Deputy Spring and his party threatened to abort the rainbow Coalition.  The sticking point was not partnership or policy but place.  The Labour Party's insatiable appetite for ministerial office would have to be satisfied, or else.  Deputy Spring was prepared to cause a general <Col N="56" /> election rather than yield one of his party's six seats at Cabinet.  Proinsias De Rossa could come in on his own or not at all.  The attitude of the Labour Party was: what we have, we will hold.  It appears that partnership government was no more than a flag of convenience for the Labour Party; significantly, when dealing with a smaller party, it was no longer convenient.  Because the spot-light had been placed on the issue, on the morning of the formation of this Government, a compromise was forced, a shambolic compromise &mdash; what it gained in ingenuity it lost in integrity. The invention of a half Cabinet seat for Deputy Pat Rabbitte made a laugh of the man and the job; some would say: &ldquo;the price of silence&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>With the benefit of hindsight I believe the negotiations to form this rainbow Coalition will be seen, not as the end of the beginning but as the beginning of the end.  Indeed it was the unwillingness to yield a second Cabinet seat to Democratic Left that this Bill had to be introduced here &mdash; creating additional Ministers of State is the trickle-down effect of how this Government was formed. The Taoiseach had to make up to Democratic Left, allocating them three Ministers of State in addition to one and a half Cabinet seats.  The bottom line for the Taoiseach was rewarding his own faithful within Fine Gael, those Deputies who had held faith with their Leader during those dark days had to be rewarded.  Considerations of good Government and the public purse would not stand in the way.  It is interesting to note that four of the six Democratic Left Members have places in Government. How many disappointed Fine Gael backbenchers are there, particularly when they consider that Democratic Left have fared much better?</P>
    <P>I clearly remember the formation of the last Fine Gael-led Coalition in November 1982 on which occasion Deputy John Bruton and his Fine Gael colleagues also refused to face down Deputy Dick Spring.  The predominant issue at that time was public spending, <Col N="57" /> Fine Gael having been committed to eliminating the budget deficit within four years.  Labour said &ldquo;no&rdquo; and Fine Gael backed down.  That was the beginning of the end of that Government; it never recovered credibility, never really tackled the problems that had blighted this country in the 1980s when the national debt doubled.  In the 12 intervening years it appears that Deputy John Bruton has learned nothing and forgotten nothing.</P>

      <P>In reply to a written question I had tabled to the Taoiseach yesterday, No. 57, the Taoiseach refused to stand over a commitment to fund a pivotal project in New Ross.  During the term of office of the previous Administration an absolute commitment was made to allocate funding of £250,000 to the John F. Kennedy Trust.  New Ross, County Wexford but the present Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, has welshed on that.  He will say only that the trust application will be considered if funding is available.  Anyone with any experience in this House knows precisely what that means; the people of New Ross will know also.  Ministers Howlin, Yates and Doyle, will have to engage in a lot of damage limitation very quickly.  The people of Wexford are wondering already what their platoon of Ministers is doing for them; it would appear their main occupation is tripping over each other.  The contrast with the preceding three years could not be greater when, during this time in the Departments of Agriculture, Food and Forestry and the Environment, Deputy John Browne was a model of service to County Wexford.  He is already sorely missed.</P>

      <P>The present Bill gives a new meaning to the saying: &ldquo;we have one for everybody in the audience&rdquo; because we appear to be rapidly reaching the point at which there will be some position for everybody sitting on the Government benches.  At present there is before us a proposal for the appointment of two additional Ministers of State.  Presumably, there will also be proposals for the appointment of additional chairmen of committees and so on.  One party in Government has two-thirds of its membership officeholders, totally unprecedented. It would be fair to say that were it not for the constitutional provision we would also have additional full Ministers.</P>
      <P>When the present Government was in Opposition they were very strong on integrity in Government, on openness and accountability, very strong on the need for reform of the Oireachtas to ensure that it rendered the people a better service.  They were very fussy about State expenditure and travel irrespective of how good and/or rewarding they may have been.  Now it appears there is no problem in spending money on the creation of additional jobs to overcome political difficulty.  In this context it is fair to say also that we are not merely facing additional wages or salaries for the people involved but are also facing the inherent huge staff costs in the provision of additional advisers and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have already said, it is a good <Col N="60" /> thing that there is a constitutional limitation on the number of Ministers who can hold office at any one time.  It is a disappointment to me that, in the case of Deputy Pat Rabbitte, an effort was made to endeavour to circumvent that limitation by creating a Minister, who is not a Minister, one who can take full part in discussions at Cabinet but who will not be a Minister because, wisely, the Constitution precluded the appointment of any more than 15 Ministers in any Government.</P>
    <P>My second criticism is of the method by which this was done, which was invidious and unfair, unfair because the relevant Ministers of State were named before the decision in principle and the change in the law was effected by the Oireachtas.  That was the wrong way to have conducted that business, was wrong and unfair to the individuals in question, wrong and unfair in that it amounts to an abuse of the Oireachtas itself.  Rather the Taoiseach and Government should have awaited the decision by the Oireachtas to enact this Bill before having nominated people to these positions.  They should have first got that decision, which would have been the correct procedure, the correct manner, in which to have conducted that business.  Instead, what did they do? They named two people, knowing them to be decent people, and that, therefore, none of us would want to imply any criticism of those individuals.  I have the height of respect for Deputies Doyle and Carey.  In the case of Deputy Doyle, I was a Member of the Seanad when she was also a Member and I accept that she is diligent, hardworking and committed to the Oireachtas.  In the case of Deputy Carey, ba dheacair domsa rud ar bith a rá in aghaidh Cláiríneach.  Fáiltím, más mall féin é, roimh an gcinneadh a rinne an Rialtas urlabhraí don iarthar a ainmniú.</P>
    <P>I welcome the idea of a Minister of State who will co-ordinate all the policies on the west, although I would have preferred if the west was not a factor in the nomination and we had looked, as did Fianna Fáil at nominating someone <Col N="61" /> to consider the whole question of the rural areas which are generally in decline in the east, south, west and north.  I am disappointed that as an afterthought the west was thrown a sop with the appointment of a Minister of State but that it does not seem to have been a major mainframe policy of the Government to examine how tax, social welfare, transport, environment, industrial and other Government policies impinge on the rural areas.  That leads me to wonder whether the Government concept &mdash; I am not referring to Deputy Carey &mdash; of the solution to the problems of rural areas is to throw in a few more small presents and not undertake a complete review and major policy to ensure that all parts of the country operate on a level playing pitch.</P>
    <P>I dtaca leis an nGaeltacht caithfidh mé a rá go gcuireann sé an-iontas orm, le 17 Airí Stáit ann, nach bhfuil aon Aire Stáit go bhfuil cúraimí na Gaeltachta ann féin leis féin aige.  Sin rud a bhí ag an Rialtas deireanach: go raibh Aire Stáit na Gaeltachta nach raibh cúram ar bith eile air.  Níl sé sin fíor sa chás seo agus, arís, caitheadh an Ghaeltacht isteach mar fo-rud ag an deireadh i ngeall go raibh casaoid ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin go raibh céim síos uair amháin eile tugtha don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht sa tír seo: nach raibh aon Aire Stáit i Roinn Ealaín, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta agus nach raibh aon Aire Stáit le cúramaí na Gaeltachta a dhéanamh.  Tá an Ghaeltacht ag titim siar ó thaobh teanga de agus ó thaobh daonra de.  Níl aon phleananna nua á fhorbairt chun í a chosaint.  Caithfidh mé a rá nach cosúil go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ná an Ghaeltacht an-árd ar liosta tosaíochta an Rialtais seo.</P>

Sílim <Col N="62" /> féin, ar mhaithe leo féin agus ar mhaith le Tithe an Oireachtais, go mba cheart dóibh an Bille a tharraingt siar; athmheas a dhéanamh ar na ceapacháin ata déanta acu; déanamh cinnte go bhfuil Aire Stáit ag freastal ar chuile Roinn Stáit; agus déanamh leis an uimhir a bhí ann cheana, sé sin 15 duine.  Ach in éagmais an Rialtas é sin a dhéanamh, caithfidh mé a rá go gcuirim fíor-fháilte roimh an ngeallúint atá tugtha ag ceannaire an pháirtí seo againne, Páirtí Fhianna Fáil, go ndéanfaidh sé an Bille seo a aisghairim nuair a thiocfaidh muidne i Rialtas arís.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to preface what I say by reading an extract from the Official Report on 13 December 1979. The then Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>It is clear at present that, because of the expansion of work in the various Government Departments and because of the intense increase in the demands made on Minister on the domestic scene, and especially because of the demands made on Ministers in regard to attendances at EEC meetings, additional Ministers of State are required.  However, I think we can discuss that situation when we come before the House with the legislation when the Dáil resumes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that time the then Taoiseach was announcing the appointment of ten Ministers of State.  I am sure one of the Wexford Deputies will vividly remember that one of the Ministers of State at the time was Deputy Lorcan Allen. Subsequently, in March the Taoiseach announced five additional Ministers of State.  I listened to Deputy Doherty's contribution and he was one of the Ministers of State announced in March 1980 as well as the former Minister, Padraig Flynn, who subsequently went on to greener pastures in Europe.  At that time the justification for creating the additional ministerial posts was the volume of work and EEC business. Surely the workload has expanded since <Col N="63" /> then and there is even greater justification for these ministerial appointments. Surely time does not stand still. We are all aware of the concern in the west of Ireland, the bishops' concern about what is happening there and that the western community must be revitalised. We applaud the decision of the present Administration in appointing Deputy Carey as Minister with responsibility for western development and rural renewal.</P>
    <P>Rural Deputies are conscious of what is happening to the social fabric of rural Ireland.  We have all been concerned for some time about the retrograde step to close post offices in rural areas.  The post office is a focal point of many rural communities and when hard-headed financial decisions were made to close some of them consideration was not given to the significance of the social impact of such closures.  I would like my colleague, Deputy Durkan, in his new capacity as Minister of State to address that area.  I congratulate my two colleagues on their ministerial appointments. It is worth researching whether it is possible in the long term for the Department of Social Welfare to give a subvention to some post offices to enable them survive.  In many cases a small sum of money is required.  There must be some mechanism to provide for them.  We cannot talk about rural renewal and development if we close down rural Ireland.  I do not intend to elaborate on the impact that would have on many communities, but I hope, having regard to the profile of the proposed Minister of State, Deputy Carey, this area of rural renewal will be considered. It is not enough to pay lip service to that idea, we must address it by doing something for people living in rural areas.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the concern of the rural publicans who visited this House yesterday. In my area and in other rural areas quite often the pub is a focal point for meetings.  It is like a social centre where bachelors go to have a few pints, to dance and be part of the social scene.  If they did not frequent pubs they would <Col N="64" /> probably be at home depressed.  As a member of the select committee which considered the legislation on drink driving, who spoke about what was likely to happen if it proceeded and questioned the merits of some of its provisions, I regret that the Minister did not recognise the importance of what some Members said.  It is regrettable that if one questioned the provisions of that legislation one was considered to be condoning people drinking to excess and then driving.  Deputies who questioned those provisions were not condoning that, they were asking for sanity to prevail with regard to that legislation and, regrettably, it did not prevail.</P>
    <P>Having regard to that legislation and other changes, a commission is investigating the number of Circuit Court sittings around the country.  One of the areas in my constituency, Rathkeale, will be affected by this.  The Circuit Court meets on three or four occasions a year and those meetings are important for the communities in which it meets. Those meetings are a focal point and are important for the people involved, such as local solicitors, defendants and others who need to have access to the Circuit Court.  It is important because of its close geographical confines.  If there are changes what will happen?  People will be sent to Limerick city, Killarney or Tralee, putting unnecessary expense and time constraints on everybody.  All this may happen because some enlightened person believes we must reduce the number of Circuit Court sittings. Yet, on the other hand &mdash; solicitors will verify this &mdash; there is a backlog of cases in those courts.  I fail to understand the logic behind this decision as a great deal more manpower would be required to staff the extra resources.  The people of that community are concerned about the decision and that is understandable. Such developments tear the life out of rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>We all applaud the appointment of Deputy Doyle as Minister of State with special responsibility for consumers of public services.  We are all aware of the impact of the public services on our <Col N="65" /> roles as politicians and on the consumers of those services.  Members of local authorities will be aware of the importance of providing a professional service for the consumer.  While the office of the Director of Consumer Affairs deals with matters pertaining to consumers' rights, there is a need for a Minister of State with overall responsibility for co-ordinating the public services. We all want efficiency.  The great buzz words these days are &ldquo;accountability&rdquo; and &ldquo;transparency&rdquo; and to achieve those objectives we must appoint somebody to monitor and co-ordinate the activities of the public service. I applaud the decision to appoint Deputy Doyle to that position, she will do a great job.  Whatever exercise she was asked to carry out as a backbencher she applied herself to it zealously and I have no doubt she will do likewise as Minister of State.</P>
    <P>I am amused at the hypocrisy which has emanated from the other side of the House in regard to this Bill.  Members opposite have focused on the increase from 15 to 17 in the number of Ministers of State.  They are very fortunate in that they have been given an opportunity to discuss the matter.  In 1980 when the question of the appointment of five additional Ministers of State arose the Opposition was not allowed to discuss it.  The Ceann Comhairle announced it and said there could be no discussion on the matter.  Deputies opposite at least have an opportunity to discuss the matter now, they should not be hypocritical of the morality of what we believe to be right.  There is no point in talking about western development and bringing life back to the west if we do not send a signal to that community that we are serious in our intent.  What can be more serious than the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for western development?</P>
    <P>One of the most important features of any public service department is the question of privacy for members of the public.  I have put that matter on this month's agenda of my council on the basis that I believe many people wishing <Col N="66" /> to discuss planning or housing applications in their local authorities are not afforded the privacy they deserve.  I have seen people standing in line waiting to have private matters dealt with. We must be conscious of this problem in the public service, it must be addressed by a Minister.  At the end of the day, the consumer is right and should be provided with an adequate service.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if Deputy O'Keeffe was serious when he talked about our attitude to Shannon.  What he said was a load of nonsense.  It was as if he was padding the speech and wondering what he should say to have a lash at the other side.  The people in the mid-west know this Government is committed to expanding the life of Shannon.  We saw classic proof of that recently when the Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications &mdash; a native of the mid-west &mdash; announced the allocation of £8 million to diversify activities in Shannon. I applaud that decision.</P>
    <P>The ESB has a mandate to expand and diversify into other areas and we have seen the results of its mandate recently in regard to fisheries, from which they are backing off now.  I believe the ESB has taken out shares in Farranfore Airport and I wish that airport well, but we must be consistent in this regard.  If a semi-State body decides to take out shares, whether £10,000, £15,000 or £100,000, it sends out a signal. To be fair this should happen in the case of all airports, otherwise we should not go down that road.  The long established airports in Dublin and Shannon must receive proper signals.</P>
    <P>I welcome some of the recent changes.  The service in Shannon has been improved considerably and there is more to come; Dublin has also benefited. The developments in regard to Russian airlines are worthwhile, Shannon is in safe hands.  The commitment of the past Government was questionable because there appeared to be a lack of commitment to the fortunes of Shannon at Cabinet level.  I assure the people of the mid-west that Shannon will not be <Col N="67" /> forgotten in the future.  It has been a vital industrial hinterland and cog in the development of that area.</P>
    <P>It is fitting that Deputy Carey's brief extends to County Clare.  Mr. Connolly's efforts in regard to the rural resettlement initiative has been a success story.  People in urban areas who feel frustrated and dejected because they are part of a big surburbia conglomerate should start a new life in the west.  They would be better off unemployed there and participating in a worthwhile scheme than living in a ghetto, and not part of a community, in Dublin.</P>

They have had a significant impact in County Clare and the Government should support such initiatives.</P>
      <P>I see a new life coming into urban Ireland and the Government can act as a catalyst to sustain that life.  Deputy Browne, as a former Minister of State, will be aware of the success of the Leader Programme, which will create vibrant rural communities.  This Government is sending out all the right signals to rural Ireland in appointing a Minister of State with responsibility for western development.  The populace in general will recognise what this Government is achieving.  The new Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, will improve the efficiency of the public service and at the end of the day the consumer will be far better off as a result of the appointment of both Ministers of State.  I applaud their appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should not be hyprocritical.  There will be a debate and people will want to score points, but we should look at it <Col N="68" /> from the objective of what rural Ireland is achieving.  Will it be better off as a result of the two appointments?  I believe it will.  I am delighted with the appointments and wish the Ministers of State well.  At least we have given the Opposition an opportunity to debate the matter, we were not afforded the same when the number of posts was increased from ten to 15.</P>

      <P>The Attorney General has made special arrangements to deal with cases, including the case referred to, where prior to his appointment as Attorney General he had acted as counsel for the other party in litigation involving the State.  Those arrangements, in summary, are that such cases will be dealt with by his professional staff, with the assistance of the counsel acting for the State in the case and, if necessary, outside counsel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where the Minister or Ministers concerned in the case wish to be advised by the Attorney General personally, then in conformity with Article 30 of the Constitution the Attorney General will, as he must, give his advice.  If that advice differs from the advice that has been tendered to him by his staff or by outside counsel the Minister will be furnished with those other advices also. <Col N="69" /> The final decision will be a matter for the Minister.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No conflict of interest arises.  The fact is that if one was to look for any Attorney General who was likely to have done a good job and was successful at the Bar it is almost certain that he or she would have acted in recent times against the State.  Short of changing the entire system for the appointment of Attorneys General this type of situation could not be avoided. I am glad that the Attorney General, on his own initiative, put in place a procedure which clearly puts Ministers receiving advice from him in a position in which they know if he was involved in a case.  They also have a separate source of advice independently of him so that in coming to a decision they know exactly what advice they are acting on.  There is no question of any conflict of interest arising.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Taoiseach's reply and I hasten to add I am not impugning the character and integrity of the Attorney General.  He is a person for whom I have a high regard but I believe a clear conflict of interest arises in this case.  The Attorney General represented this organisation for two years where issues fundamental to this case arose.  For example, would the Attorney General accept that forged stamps were used to claim export credit, which is the State's contention?  Will the Taoiseach accept there is a clear conflict of interest and that it is unsatisfactory for the present Attorney General to have any role in advising Ministers in relation to this case or in giving direction to counsel about how this case might be run?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I explained in my original reply the position is that in the normal course of events the Minister for <Col N="70" /> Agriculture, Food and Forestry, or any Minister acting on these matters, will not receive their advice from the present Attorney General.  As I explained, he has put in place arrangements in his office whereby that advice can be prepared and tendered separately through his office, or through counsel employed by his office, direct to the Minister without his involvement. That is what he has done to avoid that situation.  If the Deputy consults the Constitution she will be aware that it is obligatory on an Attorney General, because he is the legal adviser to the Government, to provide advice if asked for it.  It is only in the unlikely event that the Ministers were not satisfied with the advice provided to them by independent counsel and the staff in the Attorney's Office that they decided they want the advice of the present Attorney General separately, even though he may not want to give it.  Under the Constitution, if he is asked for the advice by Ministers he is obliged to provide it.  As I have outlined already he has put in place arrangements to deal with that unlikely eventuality by making sure in tendering his advice that any other advices that have been provided that may differ from his in any way are also provided simultaneously.  This is just advice, the decision will be taken by Ministers.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy &mdash; or any other Deputy &mdash; wants to put down questions about the Goodman claim <Col N="71" /> against the State that is a separate matter. Such questions would more appropriately be addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry.  I have not come here with a brief enabling me to deal with any of the issues about the claim, stamps or any other matters that have been introduced to this discussion to give colour to it by Deputy Harney. I am not here to answer for the courts in regard to what decisions they may take about any of these matters.  I am here to answer in regard to the very honourable arrangements by an eminent senior counsel, who has agreed to become the Attorney General for this Government, put in place to ensure absolute transparency and there is no suggestion of conflict of interest in this case.  I ask all Deputies concerned, including Deputy Harney, to accept the validity and value of those arrangements.</P>

      <P>Of course I accept the Attorney General is acting honourably but his function is to protect the State's interest and to give direction on how cases of this kind are run.  I could be much more colourful if I quoted what he said in this House in early September &mdash; which I read this morning &mdash; in relation to this matter.  Will the Taoiseach accept that Ministers are not obliged to seek the advice of the Attorney General in relation to this matter?  Will he instruct his Ministers not to seek the advice of the Attorney General on this matter so that he is not placed in a position where there is a potential conflict of interest?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">

      <P>I will not do that because if I were to instruct Ministers not to seek the advice of the Attorney General on any matter I would be acting in defiance of Article 30 of the Constitution. I advise the Deputy to read Article 30 of the Constitution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because it is clear, under the Constitution that the <Col N="72" /> Attorney General is the adviser to the Government on legal matters and Ministers have a right and an obligation to consult him where and when they think necessary.  I have outlined to the House the arrangements that have been made to ensure that no conflict of interest arises.  I would ask Deputy Harney, and others, to bear in mind that any senior counsel worth his or her salt who is appointed Attorney General is bound to have acted against the State in the previous two years.  This so-called conflict of interest the Deputy is trying to make so much of has existed in respect of the appointment of every Attorney General since the office of Attorney General was founded.  Mr. Dermot Gleeson is probably the first Attorney General &mdash; I cannot say this for certain &mdash; who, of his own accord, not at my suggestion, has put in place arrangements to ensure that no suggestion of a conflict of interest can arise.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach accept this is no ordinary case?  It is not a case of a technical nature or a simple hit-and-run case that previous Attorneys General might have been involved with.  Is there a precedent for an Attorney General acting, as the present Attorney General has done, or believing it necessary to act in such a way?  Will the Taoiseach accept that while the Attorney General is obliged to give advice when Ministers seek it, Ministers are not obliged to seek his advice under the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to provide an interpretation of the Constitution on the hoof for the House but it seems that if the Constitution provides a facility for the taking of advice on a matter, a Minister fails to avail of that facility and subsequently a problem <Col N="73" /> arises, the Minister is in some difficulty for having failed to avail of the facility under Article 30 of the Constitution. Furthermore, I would regard it as a reflection on previous Attorneys General to suggest that most of them were involved, to use Deputy Harney's words, in technical cases or running down actions.  All Attorneys General appointed by previous Governments have been extremely worthwhile people in their field and would have acted against the State in substantial and significant matters on which they were likely subsequently to have to advise the Government on appointment as Attorney General.  However, it was not necessary, or they did not decide to make arrangements of the elaborate procedural nature that Mr. Gleeson has made, which are very good arrangements and I have no doubt will set a precedent that will be followed by all future appointees.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State to the Government attends Government meetings in the same way as the Government Chief Whip.  He receives all Government papers and participates in discussions at Cabinet.  Like the Government Chief Whip and the Attorney General, he is not entitled to vote should an occasion arise where that would be necessary.  However, as this Government is committed to conducting its business on the basis of consensus, the fact that the Minister of State does not have a vote at Cabinet does not have any real significance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government will, as the need arises, request Minister of State Rabbitte to involve himself in specific matters of importance.  A recent example would be the role which he played in the negotiations in the Packard dispute &mdash;<Col N="74" /> where his knowledge of industrial relations and the situation at local level in Tallaght was invaluable to the Cabinet in their discussions on that matter.</P>
    <P>Minister of State Rabbitte is, of course, also Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, with special responsibility for commerce, science and technology and consumer affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach suggesting Deputy Rabbitte will be the industrial relations or personnel officer of the Government?  His role in Packard Electric was based, as I understand it, on the fact that he is Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  What is Deputy Rabbitte's level of remuneration?  Will he be entitled to appoint programme managers? Does he have the same speaking rights as other Cabinet Ministers?  Is he bound by the Cabinet confidentiality rule, as are other Cabinet members?</P>

      <P>I will check that for the Deputy.  I do not have the precise information on Deputy Rabbitte's delegation within the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The question concerns his appointment as Minister of State to the Government.  For the interest of the historians in the House, this is not the first occasion on which a Minister of State or Parliamentary Secretary to the Government as a whole rather than to an individual Department was appointed.  Former Deputy Jack Lynch was appointed Minister of State to the Government in the period 1951-54 and former Deputy Dr. John O'Donovan was appointed to a similar position in the 1954-57 Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>It is apparent from what the Taoiseach has said that the only difference between the post of the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte and that of a Cabinet Minister is that he is not entitled to vote at Cabinet but that there will be no reason to vote because you will be so happy together.  Is that what the Taoiseach said?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The aim of the Government &mdash; this matter was discussed in some detail before forming the Government &mdash; is to avoid votes at the Cabinet table.  We will be working on the basis of consensus but that does not mean there will not be significant disagreements from time to time within the Government and we will seek to work out those disagreements on the basis of consensus.  The Deputy will recollect that the practice of pushing matters to a vote has not had happy consequences for her party in recent times.</P>

      <P>There is nothing mysterious about this.  Deputy Rabbitte is a member of Democratic Left, one of three parties in the Government, and it is extremely useful to have both Deputy Rabbitte, Minister of State to the Government, and Deputy De Rossa, Minister for Social Welfare, present at Cabinet meetings.  As a result Democratic Left as a party has the means of fully understanding and participating in all Government business.

The programme managers are there to assist the Government in implementing a political programme agreed between Democratic Left, the Labour Party and Fine Gael.  Deputy Rabbitte participates at Cabinet as Minister of State to the Government &mdash; he is responsible with all other Ministers for decisions taken there &mdash; and also represents his own party.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos.  3 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The programme manager system is one designed to manage a political programme for Government.  It is, therefore, one that I believe should be properly operated by people who have a clear political perspective, combined with other appropriate skills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this we are not critical of civil servants who in the last Government were part of the programme manager system. On balance we felt that to maximise <Col N="86" /> effectiveness and to avoid any possibility of politicisation of the Civil Service, it was best to proceed in the way we have decided.</P>
    <P>In the case of my own Department I decided to employ Mr. Séan Donlon, former Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, who also has a strong business background, in a position combining the work of programme manager and that of special adviser on Northern Ireland.  I made this decision because his combination of experience in the Northern Ireland, business and administrative areas makes him especially suitable for this combined role.</P>
    <P>He is engaged on the same terms and conditions as approved for all such appointments, namely, his is a temporary unestablished position, under a contract that terminates not later than the date on which I cease to hold office as Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Contracts of employment for the unestablished staff at my Department are being drawn up at present.  Their names, roles and annual salary are set out in the schedule I am circulating in the official report.</P>
    <P>Unestablished Staff at the Department of the Taoiseach &mdash; January 1995</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach's special adviser on Northern Ireland is a good appointment and, despite what was said in recent times, Seán Donlon played a key role in bringing about the Anglo-Irish Agreement and in educating Irish Americans about the reality of the problem in Northern Ireland.  Having said that, why was it felt necessary to combine the function of special adviser on Northern Ireland with programme manager? Was this done merely to justify payment of a higher salary?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Harney for what she has said about Mr. Seán Donlon who has taken a certain amount of unjustified criticism because of his decision to assist in the public service for the lifetime of this Government. The decision to combine the two jobs was made, essentially, because he seemed to have an almost uniquely good combination for both roles.  I felt it would be unfortunate if he were simply to be, say, adviser on Northern Ireland in a position where his expertise as a former departmental Secretary and a former business person across a wide range of other issues arising in the Programme for Government would not be put to good use.  I also felt that to appoint him, on the other hand, as solely a programme manager, where his input to Northern Ireland matters would be minimal, would not be putting his talents to good use either.  I felt, therefore, that the combined role was the best one.  I made that decision independently of any other considerations, <Col N="88" /> apart from the one I have just mentioned, including that of salary.</P>
      <P>The position in regard to salary was decided because Mr. Donlon had retired from the public service approximately eight years ago at the rank of departmental Secretary and had gone on to achieve higher levels of remuneration in the private sector.  I thought it would be invidious and unwise to ask somebody of his calibre and experience to return to work in the public service at a salary scale less than the one he had been working at when he was previously in the public service.  That was my decision.  It is a decision that can be criticised because no matter what level of salary one fixes for any appointee, one person will say it is too much and another will say that it is not enough.

      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is that it is a greater salary in terms of salary <i>per se.</i> I cannot put a monetary value on the other perquisites that go with being a Minister but certainly in terms of salary, <Col N="89" /> his salary is greater than that of a Minister of State.  The question of his taking the job at a lower level of salary did not arise.  I made the decision that that was the appropriate salary to agree to. There was no process of horse trading about it.  I believe &mdash; and I think the Deputy has acknowledged this, perhaps indirectly &mdash; that a man of this calibre is of great value at this critical stage in the peace process where we need to bring in all the expertise we have to bear on the problem.  However, we are very fortunate in the level of dedication in the Department of Foreign Affairs and indeed among the permanent officials in my own Department dealing with Northern Ireland.  They have been doing tremendously good work, in assisting my predecessor and all the other Ministers of the previous and present Government, in bringing the peace process to its present stage.  The process is now entering a more complex stage where we are having to elaborate a more detailed agreement built on the principles of peace and the principles set out in the Downing Street Declaration. The additional expertise that somebody of Mr. Donlon's experience has, which dates back to the time of internment in Northern Ireland, preparing the case for the Court of Human Rights to the negotiation of the Sunningdale Agreements and the Anglo-Irish Agreement, will be extremely useful to the Government in carrying the peace process further.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree it is a flagrant abuse of public trust and accountability to campaign actively as an Opposition party for two years and then, as soon as that party goes into Government, to reverse everything it said in the previous two years? The Taoiseach, as the then Leader of the Opposition, objected to the appointment of programme managers as non-civil servants and then immediately engaged in an orgy of making appointments from outside the public service, thereby undermining it.  How can the Taoiseach justify such a blatant and cynical U-turn?  Does he think the public are so gullible that they will believe his view was changed because of one newspaper article?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I expressed reservations about the appointment of programme managers at the time they were appointed.  I will not attempt to deny <Col N="91" /> that.  I have, however, analysed the Programme for Government of the previous Government and indeed the Deputy has a question down about that later.  While I would criticise some of the priorities in that Programme for Government and regard parts of it as somewhat misguided or vague, if one actually reads the legislative commitments in it, one will find that the rate of implementation is very high.  There are few remaining legislative commitments from that Programme for Government that have not been either acted upon or progressed quite considerably.</P>
      <P>The rate of implementation of previous Government programmes, without the aid of programme managers, was considerably less in terms of delivery of legislative measures.  It was not for lack of political will but for lack of administrative backup.  The system of programme managers worked effectively in the outgoing Government and I believe it would be foolish for an incoming Government to abolish something that worked well for a previous administration.  This is something we discussed with both the Democratic Left Party and the Labour Party in negotiations leading to the formation of the Government.</P>
      <P>We have a very ambitious programme to implement in the next two-and-a-half years which contains many new commitments not included in the previous Government's programme.  If the previous Government had a system that helped them in administrative terms to deliver its programme effectively, it would be foolish of us not to learn from that and apply that lesson.  That is what we have done.  I realise I am open to the sort of criticism that Deputy Ahern is making on this occasion and, no doubt, he will score by making that criticism.  I am quite happy that what we have done will prove to be a good decision when, in two-and-a-half or three years time, the delivery of the programme of Government of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left is assessed.</P>

      <P>The 75 appointments that the Taoiseach has made shows he has changed his mind.  Would the Taoiseach agree that it is, essentially, the job of public servants to implement Government programmes?  He has already quoted Éamon de Valera and Seán Lemass.  The last Taoiseach would have agreed that civil servants were the people to do that job.  Will the Taoiseach confirm that he has not followed what was done by the last Government as he has sent out a letter from Fine Gael headquarters to the effect that Fine Gael activists should be taken on to help to regenerate the party in Government?  Perhaps the Taoiseach would explain to the House how Fine Gael activists, Labour activists and Democratic Left activists will implement the programme when it was the Civil Service that implemented the previous programme?  The legislation was successful because the civil servants were dedicated to implementing it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated in his long reply that he was following the example of the last Government. With one exception Fianna Fáil Ministers employed civil servants.  Is it not the job of civil servants to implement Government programmes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I disagree with the Deputy.  A programme for Government is a political programme agreed between parties and the political job of managing that programme is more appropriately done by somebody who is a member of or a supporter of the party that originated the programme.  I realise the Deputy has a different view, to which he is entitled, but it is my view <Col N="93" /> that it would be unfair to ask civil servants to be the political managers for a particular political party when, following a change of Government, they will be working for a new Government with a different composition.  That politicises the civil servants concerned.  In saying that, I am making no criticism of the programme managers who served Fianna Fáil Ministers.  Nor do I criticise Fianna Fáil for doing what it did because it did it with relative speed and it worked fairly well.</P>
      <P>However, as a long term arrangement, I do not think it a good one.  A better long term arrangement, if we are to use the programme manager system, is not to appoint non-political civil servants as programme managers because their non-political status is interfered with by asking them to do political work.  Rather such positions should be filled by people who are appointed only for the lifetime of the Government involving the parties they are serving. This is the approach the Labour Party took in the last Government.  It is not the approach Fianna Fáil adopted.  On balance, I believe the Labour view on that issue was right.  Although I respect Fianna Fail's reasons for its decision, I disagree with it.</P>

Will he appoint them to other agencies where the Government wants to implement policy? It is usually civil servants who implement Government policy.  Is the Taoiseach saying he will implement policy throughout the system by appointing party activists all over the place?  He has already made 75 appointments.</P>

      <P>I am answering a question specifically about programme managers whose job is to implement a political programme.  I am not answering questions about appointees to State companies.  The best people available should be appointed to the boards of <Col N="94" /> State companies.  Most of the appointments we have made &mdash; one was discussed at Cabinet only yesterday &mdash; involved reappointing people who were appointed by the previous Government because they were doing a good job. They were not removed just because they happened to have been appointed by Fianna Fáil and Labour.  We may do otherwise in other cases but the job of programme manager is a political one which should be filled by somebody with a particular political commitment.</P>

      <P>For the first time the Taoiseach has given us the real picture with regard to Mr. Donlon's appointment when he said that he had come from the private sector and had to be paid accordingly.  I accept that but why have handlers and sources close to the Government been presenting it as two jobs which require two salaries?  Will the Taoiseach not agree that Northern Ireland requires one adviser and what is the role of the new Secretary in the Department of Foreign Affairs?  Who is <Col N="97" /> in charge?  May I remind the Taoiseach that on his appointment he said that good government is a public service and it should be kept simple.

      <P>I suggested that Mr. Donlon's salary was set not in terms of his private sector income, which I imagine was substantially greater, but by the level of his salary when he worked previously in the public sector. On the question of doing two jobs I have replied already that he had an almost unique combination of experience which I wanted to combine in one job because not to do so would mean that some of his experience would not be put to sufficient use.  It is extremely important also that the Taoiseach in dealing with Northern Ireland can and does draw on the services of the entire Department of Foreign Affairs and the section on Northern Ireland in the Department of the Taoiseach, as indeed the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs has the capacity to draw on the advice available in the Department of the Taoiseach.  The issue of Northern Ireland should be dealt with and is being dealt with on a teamwork basis between the two Departments.

I have made the details of my interests publicly available already but I have doubts from a legal point of view about the wisdom and propriety of asking for declarations to be made that touch on the privacy of third parties, that is not Ministers themselves, in advance of having statutory authority for same.  That is the reason I decided not to ask for this declaration at this stage.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that it is this Government's policy to enact this legislation as quickly as possible.  We are looking forward to the guidelines being set out for the disclosure of interest by Ministers to the Public Offices Commission to be established under that Bill and we will fulfil in full the requirements set out by the Public Offices Commission.  In so doing we would be acting on a statutory basis and there would not be any question of a third party who might be affected claiming that their interests were being interfered with on a non-statutory <i>ad hoc</i> basis.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current budget surplus of £15 million recorded in 1994 represented a very satisfactory performance.  However, the 1994 outturn benefited from a number of once-off favourable factors including the release of £120 million in NTMA savings carried over from previous years; the residual inflows of £51 million from the income levy which ceased in April 1994; and the proceeds of the tax amnesty in so far as they were not used to meet once-off outlays.  Accordingly, at an underlying level there was, in fact, a significant current budget deficit last year.</P>
      <P>I am fully committed to holding the current budget deficit to the lowest level possible, consistent with the Government's policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> In particular, the agreement applies strict limits to the growth in current departmental spending which are set well below the levels of increase which occurred over the past several years.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister agree that many of the problems encountered in the last 20 years revolved around the fact that, as a nation, we were not prepared to live within our means and this was reflected by different Governments during that period? When the Taoiseach was in Opposition he and other eminent people suggested that if we ever achieved a balanced current budget we should not go down the road of a current budget deficit again. Will he agree that no economic benefit accrued from Governments failing to aim for a balanced budget?  Given the favourable economic circumstances which pertain this year surely there is no justification for planning for a current budget deficit in the 1995 budget?</P>

      <P>I do not disagree with the odyssey of intellectual development to which the Deputy referred.  His party is perhaps the biggest convert to fiscal orthodoxy in this regard.  I sat in the House with him when the late George Colley announced a current budget deficit of approximately 13 per cent of GDP.  I welcome the fact that parties, including my own, recognise the need to manage our affairs within our resources. To aspire to do that is one thing but to slowly turn the ship of state around and bring ongoing commitments of expenditure in line with resources is a much more painful and, of necessity, time consuming process.  The Government is committed to speeding up that process. We have set out in the document <i>A Government of Renewal</i> clear commitments in that regard with which the Deputy is familiar &mdash; 6 per cent in 1995 and 2 per cent for the remaining two years to 1997 is an indication of that.  No doubt the Deputy and his backbench Members will assist me in resisting demands for additional expenditure in the Private Members' motions put forward by Fianna Fáil over the next three years to ensure I reach the targets he has set for me.</P>

      <Quest>the amount of funds received from the EU in late 1994 but credited to 1995; the amounts of any other receipts attributable to 1994 but credited to 1995; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The public finances operate on a cash-based receipts and payments system rather than on an accruals basis.  Accordingly, the practice of accounting officers is to take all revenues to account in the year of receipt in so far as that is practicable, irrespective of the year to which they are attributable.</P>
      <P>As regards the first part of the question, the position as far as my Department is aware is that all EU funds received during the calendar year 1994 were credited in 1994, whether to the benefit of departmental accounts, FÁS or the Exchequer, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>In relation to the second part, it is inevitable that some specific items will be received too late within a particular year for value to be registered within that year.  The only significant example of such carryover from 1994 which has come to notice is an amount of some £15 million in health contributions disbursed by the social insurance fund which I understand is being taken to account as Appropriations-in-Aid to the 1995 Health Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It may be that the Deputy had in mind EU receipts which in the normal course would have been received in 1994 but which were in the event not <Col N="105" /> received and which are now expected in 1995.  In that category, I am aware of the following, which fall on the capital side of the budget:</P>

      <P>Is the Minister for Finance telling me that, in the first 15 days of 1995, £109 million in European Regional Development Fund and Cohesion Funds and £22 million from FEOGA has come to hand?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am saying that the money, to which I have just referred, was expected to come in in 1994 but did not arrive.  It is now expected that those sums which were factored into the 1994 figures are expected to be received in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will table a separate question on that matter.  However, given the figures the Minister has just read out, the £109 million and £22 million from the European Union, making a total of £131 million &mdash; which were included in the figures for 1994 &mdash; is it true that those figures show beyond doubt that in 1994 there would have been a larger budget surplus which has now been factored into the 1999 figure? If I may presume to advise the Minister, this type of creative accountancy, practised in some Departments, if I may put it like that, is not in anyone's long term interests.  We can have a debate later but there is considerable confusion about departmental Estimates because <Col N="106" /> some European Regional Development Fund moneys include the capital side, above the line, while ESF money is included in net expenditure, whereas in all Departments expenditure should be shown gross, particularly that of agencies. Is it the Minister's intention to go down the route of gross accounting, which would give a better idea about our position after 1999, a matter to which he referred, and on which I absolutely agree with him.  It would be much better to reach that stage, again nodding in the direction of the goddess, OTA and there would be more openness, transparency and accountability if that were done.  We could then proceed to the matter of accrual accounting which has long been advocated and which has been successful in other jurisdictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the Deputy's expressed views in regard to the benefits of moving to an accrual system of accountancy rather than the current one.  As a professional accountant, the Deputy will be better able to evaluate the benefits of such a system.  I understand that this matter is being examined in my Department to avoid the kind of problems and difficulties of interpretation of accounts which would flow naturally from one year to another having regard to the manner in which the system operates at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly I support the Minister for Finance in having some openness, transparency and accountability introduced to the manner in which the Estimates are presented.  Having gone through them in some considerable detail, as I have in recent years, I concede they are very difficult to follow whereas, if they were prepared on a gross receipts and gross expenditure basis, they would be easier to follow. For one reason or another, it would appear they are designed to confuse &mdash; there is nothing underhand or anything about that, that has been the practice &mdash; and certainly are not open, transparent or accountable.  Given the problems we shall face when the tranche of funds <Col N="107" /> expires in 1999, I suggest that the Minister put in train in his Department a proposal that they convert to the gross expenditure and receipts basis of accountancy about which we have spoken, after which we can proceed to the accrual basis when everybody will be able to see quite clearly the financial problems that will confront this nation at the end of this decade.  I commend that system to the Minister.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 36 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>ICC Bank is a commercial body whose day-to-day relationships with its <Col N="108" /> customers are conducted at arm's length from my Department and without reference to it.  Accordingly, I have no knowledge of the existence or otherwise of the transaction referred to.  In any case, in view of the convention of client confidentiality, it would not be appropriate to disclose information concerning any particular client of ICC Bank.  This is normal banking practice and if ICC Bank was forced to depart from this practice, it would damage its business.</P>
    <P>I have no reason to believe that ICC Bank conducts its business other than in accordance with strict commercial criteria and, on foot of the Deputies' questions, ICC Bank has reconfirmed to me that this is the case.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that if ICC Bank did in fact provide security in relation to the transaction concerned it would have had two effects.  It would have prevented the registration of a security which would have been the subject of publicity, thereby keeping secret the names of the lenders and the nature of such a transaction. Will he agree that if ICC Bank is furnishing security in relation to the business migration scheme investments for citizenship, this would be apparent to the Department of Justice?</P>
      <P>Obviously the Minister has inquired of ICC Bank and drawn a blank on the basis of confidentiality, but will he now inquire from the Department of Justice whether it is aware that the ICC Bank furnished this security in respect of this loan to a company?  Does he consider it very disturbing that, if such information was available to Government Departments, it was not made known to the Members of this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned the banks currently in State ownership will continue to operate on strict commercial criteria similar to those operated by other banks.  I, for one, abhor political interference in the commercial activities of any State enterprise.  Indeed that is what has given State enterprise <Col N="109" /> here a bad name in contrast with successful State enterprises in other countries. Therefore, I do not propose to take the course of action outlined by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the Department of Justice knows that the loan in question was secured by ICC Bank, that that is within the knowledge of the Department of Justice and that this House was misinformed in relation to it.  Furthermore, if this House had known that a semi-State bank had cooperated by providing security and, indirectly, ensured complete secrecy about this transaction, there would have been a very grave scandal indeed.  It is not good enough for the Minister now to say that he is happy to accept the assurance of the ICC Bank that it was a normal commercial transaction when the reality is that this transaction was carried out to cloak in secrecy a transaction about which the public was entitled to know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I respect the integrity of ICC Bank in the way in which it conducts its commercial affairs.  Its successful annual accounts, which are on my desk and in the process of being made public, will indicate that it is a successful bank.  I have no intention of getting in behind, because it is a State-owned bank, to obtain information which would not be normally available to me if the clients in this case had been clients of AIB, the Bank of Ireland or any other, I am surprised that Deputy Michael McDowell &mdash; who espouses a very clear and cogent policy philosophy &mdash; would want me, as Minister for Finance, to interfere in the commercial operations of a successful bank.  For the life of me I cannot understand his ideological motive in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply asked the Minister to agree with me that it would be much more serious if this transaction had been undertaken by ICC Bank as a result of the interference of a politician in his or her own interests.  I am asking <Col N="110" /> him to inquire whether that did happen. I suggest to him that, if he consults his colleague, the Minister for Justice, he will discover that there was such a transaction involving the ICC Bank and that it amounted to an abuse of the banking system to procure secrecy for a deeply suspect transition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I repeat categorically that, as far as I am concerned, none of the State credit institutions, whether it be the Post Office Savings Bank, the ACC or ICC, will be open to political interference of the commercial kind to which the Deputy referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that; I do not want to protect them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned &mdash; and I want to state this very clearly &mdash; no such interference has occurred as far as I am aware.  For the benefit of every normal customer who may well be listening to this question and reply, who may think that coming to a Member of this House to obtain leverage on a loan they may want to obtain from ICC Bank, because they may be a friend of the Member concerned, whether he or she be in Opposition or in Government, I want to refute any such suggestion. Anybody who would engage in such practice would be doing a great disservice to the credit institutions of this country.</P>
      <P>For the Deputy to imply that some type of political interference resulted in favourable lending facilities being extended to a particular company is totally at variance with the information I have been given by ICC.  I do not want the impression to go abroad that political pressure can be put on any State owned bank &mdash; for which I have responsibility as Minister for Finance &mdash; that will result in soft loans or easy credit terms.  That is at variance with everything that I, as a Labour Minister for Finance, want to achieve in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest to the Minister that a soft loan was <Col N="111" /> made as a result of political interference and I ask him to accept that.  I suggest that the Department of Justice knows well that the ICC provided security for this loan in circumstances which were designed to prevent the loan becoming public knowledge and for the purpose of throwing a cloak of secrecy over a particularly suspect transaction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <P>The objective of exchange rate policy continues to be the maintenance of price stability, that is, low inflation.  As the Government's Programme for Renewal points out, a stable currency is essential to the maintenance of low inflation and competitiveness.  A stable exchange rate within the ERM will remain the cornerstone of monetary policy.</P>

      <P>With your indulgence, Sir, as this is my first opportunity in the House, I extend my best wishes to the Minister for Justice for a very successful and happy term in office.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies O'Donoghue and O'Donnell for their kind remarks and for their questions on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All Members in this House and the public are deeply concerned about the armed robbery in Clonshaugh last night and I want to give Members as much <Col N="113" /> information as I possibly can, but with the understanding that I do not wish to prejudice the case.  I am sure the Deputies when asking questions will not wish to prejudice the Garda investigation.</P>
    <P>At approximately 6.30 p.m. yesterday, an armed robbery took place at the Brinks-Allied premises at Clonshaugh, Dublin.  Preliminary investigations indicate that at least five raiders were involved and that at least one of them discharged a firearm.  Thankfully, no one was injured as a result of the discharge of the firearm.  However, one employee was apparently injured as a result of the vehicle used by the raiders being rammed against the door.</P>
    <P>The amount of money taken was quite large.  It will not be possible to say for definite how much was stolen until the amounts of cash in transit can be verified with the financial institutions involved.  However, preliminary indications are that it was considerably less than the figure of £4 million quoted by some media sources.</P>
    <P>The raiders succeeded in taking a large number of cash bags and transferred them to a vehicle parked in a field to the rear of the premises.  They apparently made their getaway in this vehicle, which was subsequently located by gardaí in a field at Barbarstown Lane, west of Dublin Airport.  It appears that the two vehicles used by the raiders during the robbery had been stolen in Dublin on 12 January this year.</P>
    <P>A full Garda investigation commenced within minutes of the raid taking place.  A number of houses have been visited and searched by members of the Garda Síochána and I am informed that one person was detained last night.</P>
    <P>Like all Members of the House, I deplore this appalling crime.  Armed robbery cannot and should not be tolerated in a civilised society.  I know that the Garda Síochána will leave no stone unturned in their efforts to find the perpetrators and bring them before the courts.  In this regard I would like to echo what the Taoiseach said here this <Col N="114" /> morning about the efforts necessary from all sections of the community to assist the gardaí to track down these dangerous armed robbers.  Any information about movement of vehicles or suspicious movements by persons should be reported as soon as possible to the gardaí.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the law and order package currently being implemented in the fight to tackle crime.  This package, which is costing approximately £66 million, spread over a number of years, is designed to ensure that the force is at the required strength, that more gardaí currently engaged in administration can become operational by replacing them with civilians, and that the latest developments in information technology can improve and enhance the operational capacity of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I have discussed last night's developments at length with the Garda Commissioner and with the Taoiseach.  We are concerned to ensure that the Garda Síochána will have sufficient resources in terms of manpower, equipment and forensic assistance to fight armed robbery. If further resources are required they will be provided.</P>
    <P>Because of the seriousness of the case and the danger of inhibiting future possible prosecutions, there is under-standably a limit to what I can tell the House in terms of detail.  I know the two Deputies asking these questions and other Deputies in the House will recognise the sensitivity of this matter.</P>
    <P>In the House this morning Deputy Harney indicated that the gardaí may have had advance notice that this raid was planned.  I raised this specific point with the Commissioner, within the past two hours, in view of the concerns understandably raised by Deputy Harney. Not surprisingly the gardaí regularly receive intelligence about criminal plans.  In fact a considerable number of such schemes are frustrated as a result of early Garda intervention.</P>
    <P>Deputies will understand that in some cases the available information may be <Col N="115" /> fairly specific thus enabling a preventative strategy to be put in place.  In others, however, the information can be of a very vague generalised nature and not such as to enable effective and specific counter-measures to be taken. There are also situations of course where misleading information is put into circulation with the deliberate aim of frustrating the battle against crime.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied on the basis of the assurances I have received from the Garda Commissioner this afternoon that this was not a situation in which the information available was such that it would have been reasonable to expect that an effective preventative strategy could have been mounted.</P>
    <P>I am assured there is no truth in the suggestion that the gardaí knew that a raid on this premises was planned.  Had they known this they would clearly have been able to prevent it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>That was never suggested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assured by the Commissioner there is no truth either in the suggestion that the premises was under surveillance and consequently no truth in the suggestion that such surveillance was withdrawn.</P>
      <P>I fully understand the concerns raised by Deputy Harney on the basis of the information supplied to her.  However I would ask that we be wary of some of the information that may be provided by all of us at a time like this.  The better course is to allow the investigation to proceed and to urge that the public support the gardaí in any way they can and to postpone judgment until the investigation is complete.</P>
      <P>I note Deputy McDowell said that Deputy Harney did not say what I indicated she said but some of the evening newspapers have indicated that also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of clarification, I did not say that the Garda knew there would be a raid on this premises. However, I am satisfied that the Garda knew a raid of this magnitude was being planned.  They visited vulnerable individuals in the past few weeks to alert them to this, to ask them to take certain security precautions and to speak to members of their families in that regard. I am satisfied that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the point at which an escort, the Garda or the Army, leaves a vehicle carrying large sums of money needs to be reviewed and that guidelines need to be put in place in that regard?  If the escort had remained with the vehicle carrying the money for a longer period the crime might have been avoided. Also, what level of resources is available to her Department as a result of the peace dividend?  Will she ensure those funds are retained in the Department of Justice to fight the escalating crime problem?  In this context, will she ensure that the number of gardaí is increased significantly?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements regarding escorting large amounts of cash are kept under constant review by the Garda and companies carrying out the escort duty and I have no doubt that following last night's robbery a further examination of the entire process will be carried out.  It would not, therefore, be appropriate for me to say what information I have in regard to how this money was escorted. That will form part of the examination that will be carried out by the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, any resources that become available through the peace dividend and that I need for my Department to ensure the Garda can fight crime to the best of its ability will be <Col N="117" /> maintained in my Department.  I will fight tooth and nail in the context of the forthcoming budget to ensure I have the resources I need.  During my meeting with the Commissioner less than two hours ago he assured me he has all the resources he needs to carry out the investigation into this crime and he knows he can come back to me if he needs further resources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the level of security and surveillance provided for major cash handling facilities, such as the premises which was raided last night?  In other words, is she happy that surveillance is adequate on perimeter fencing given the need for high security on such premises? Has the Garda Commissioner ruled out paramilitary involvement in the crime which occurred last night?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of protection surrounding the premises of this or any other company is a matter for the management running the company.  A major investigation into this crime is taking place and an examination of the surveillance and security surrounding the premises will form part of it.  It is clear there were breaches in the perimeter fences and the company will have to consider its responsibility in that regard.  The Garda provide general surveillance on the premises of companies and businesses which hold large amounts of cash, but this matter will have to be reviewed.  When major crimes and robberies such as this took place a number of years ago the question of escorts for large amounts of cash was reviewed.  At present money over a certain amount cannot be transported around the country without an escort.  I am satisfied this will be considered, but I cannot give the Deputy information on what will happen following the examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, the Garda Commissioner assured me during our meeting today that there is no indication of <Col N="118" /> any paramilitary involvement in this crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that when a certain sum of money is being transported by a carrier it is necessary to have an escort.  Does she agree that if the sum involved is extremely large a number of vehicles should carry the money?  This would have led to a lesser sum being taken on this occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Investigation into this crime will involve reviewing the security aspects of transporting money.  The money in this case was taken when it had arrived and was inside the premises. I am sure the Deputy's suggestion will be examined, but I cannot predict the outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that it does not make sense to have a Garda escort while money is in transit but no Garda presence when the money is being held in a premises known to contain large amounts of money at any given time.  As there are indications in the media from Garda sources that a well known criminal is the prime suspect in this crime, what prevented the questioning and bringing to justice of that man in the past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case the escort stayed with the money until it was taken into the company's responsibility.  The money was inside the premises and the security door closed when it was taken. The normal procedure then would be for the escort to leave.  At that point the robbers struck, rammed the door and got inside.  Responsibility rests with the company for its security and I have been assured by the Commissioner that this company indicated it operated top of the range security measures, but obviously they will have to be reviewed as a result of the burglary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A person was arrested and is undergoing questioning in regard to the crime, but it would not be correct for me to enter into speculation as to who <Col N="119" /> might be guilty.  There has been much speculation and names have been mentioned, but it would not be appropriate for me to comment at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Garda aware that a major robbery such as this was planned by a Dublin criminal gang?  In recent days did members of the Garda visit people who handled large amounts of cash to alert them to this and to ask them to take special security precautions? They even gave advice to the families of those involved in handling large amounts of cash?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy is anxious to get this information into the public arena, but I urge her to recognise that the Garda frequently get information which allows them to pre-empt and intervene before crimes are committed but I reiterate that they do not have specific information about this robbery.  If they had, they would have been able to prevent it.  It is normal police practice for the Garda to get such information, but I cannot say any more without jeopardising the way in which the Garda carries out its business, and I do not wish to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to be unhelpful but I would like to see those involved brought to justice.  Did the Garda visit this company and give them any advice in recent weeks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Again the Deputy will probably accuse me of trying not to give information to the House.  I cannot give information about the actual workings of the Garda and what they did.  I do not always have this information, apart from which it would not be appropriate to say how the Garda carry on their business in regard to surveillance or examination of premises.  The Deputy will understand the reason because it would, perhaps, give information to people whom we do not want to have that information.</P>

      <P>Is it the Minister's intention to set up a new task force to deal with organised crime or does she intend to provide increased resources to any existing task force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an existing task force and I have, today, assured the Garda Commissioner that the full resources of the State will be made available to fighting serious crimes such as this one.  I will be seeking resources when required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that locations such as this are a magnet for those who can mount sophisticated armed raids of this kind?  In those circumstances and bearing in mind that we do not license employees of security firms to carry firearms it would make sense to station members of the Garda Síochána permanently in locations where large sums of money are handled.  It is not sufficient simply to say that once employees are behind gates of this company that is the end of the public's interest in security.  Will the Minister take it from me that when one visits RTE &mdash; which some Members do frequently &mdash; one meets a detective who is permanently on duty to ensure that nothing untoward happens?  Would it not make sense if somebody who has a firearm and who would act as a deterrent to armed raiders was on duty in these premises rather than to regard the Garda duty complete as soon as the money is inside the premises?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that the Garda are charged with the duty of protecting the whole State. The responsibility of protecting property in a premises is the responsibility of the company involved.  There are many concerns such as banks, where there are constantly large sums of money, who provide their own security.  I have no doubt that in the review of this crime suggestions such as those mentioned by the Deputy on the security arrangements during transportation, unloading and all the other elements of moving <Col N="121" /> large sums of money, will be considered. Hopefully, this type of crime will not be repeated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Mr. J. Higgins Mr. J. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>My supplementary question relates to what the Minister said.  Will the Minister agree, in view of the fact that the banks and the financial institutions are making massive profits, that there should be a consequent obligation on them to make greater provision, financial and otherwise, for the protection of assets within their custody? Will she agree that whatever security arrangements are in place for the protection of such assets and money should be submitted to the Garda Síochána on a regular basis for examination to ensure that they comply with the best possible standard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his question.  I agree that the banks and other financial institutions are responsible for and carry the cost of most of the security arrangements for the transportation of money.  Responsibility for the security of their premises, mechanisms for transporting money and methods of transferring money from one location to another are matters for the companies involved.  If they do not accept such responsibility it means that the lives of other people, who may be in a location where a robbery such as this takes place, would be threatened. Thankfully, apart from the man who was injured last night as a result of the door hitting him, there was no serious injury.  That has not always been the case and may not always be the case.</P>

      <P>I welcome the decision of the Government to create the two posts.  Deputy Carey who will be a Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht will also be given special responsibility for co-ordinating the Government commitment to western development and rural renewal. The appointment of a Minister to cater for the needs of the west from Malin Head to Mizen Head is long overdue. Geographically, Deputy Carey is ideally <Col N="185" /> situated for such an appointment.  I cannot understand the attitude of successive Fianna Fáil Deputies who, one after the other, have criticised the appointment of this Minister, an appointment that is vital if the west is to survive.  This region has only received the crumbs that fell from the master's table of previous Governments.</P>
      <P>It is evident that special attention is needed to arrest the economic malaise and the population haemorrhage must be stopped.  Do the Fianna Fáil Party want to let the west turn into a wildlife park for the benefit of wealthy tourists to explore?  The Crusade for Survival, launched by the western bishops, highlighted the necessity for immediate Government action to save the west.  In view of that I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Cabinet on their wisdom to answer that SOS message so promptly.</P>
      <P>It is evident that schools, Garda stations, churches, creameries and post offices have been allowed close by successive Administrations.  Deputies on the Opposition benches should not have the audacity to oppose legislation to rectify the serious problems and ensure that the west gets its rightful share of the cake.</P>
      <P>Deputy Carey's ministry will contribute to the improvement of living conditions for island inhabitants.  Financial aid is needed to construct and improve piers and slipways.  While ferry services to our islands must be brought up to proper standards.  Grants must be made available for that work.  It is vitally necessary that all islands benefit from a ferry subsidy such as applied to Gaelic speaking islands.  Island people, regardless of the language they speak, should be given the necessary facilities.  An English speaking island population endures the same hardship as does an Irish speaking island population.  From the report publicised last Sunday about the Bere Island ferry tragedy, it is evident that immediate ministerial action is needed to rectify the anomalies among our island inhabitants who are treated as second class citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="186" /> I have knowledge of the needs of the islands.  The island committee in Cork county council has indicated that a massive injection of funding is needed if island inhabitants are to survive.

      <P>I assure Deputy Sheehan I have listened very carefully to everything he said on this matter and I agree entirely with most of what he said.  It surprises me that there is no mention of the needs of the west or of the islands in the very elaborate and overworked programme for Government.</P>

      <P>There is not a mention of west Cork or west Kerry.  There is no mention of the needs of the west or of any group of islands off our coast and that is unacceptable.  This is a major conversion in a short number of weeks since the programme was first put in place and the initial group of Ministers was appointed.  If there is such a degree of concern for the welfare of the west, it is difficult to accept that the Government did not establish such a Ministry in the first group of Ministers appointed.</P>

      <P>Arising from what Deputy <Col N="187" /> Sheehan said &mdash; maybe it is a pity he does not speak at the Cabinet table &mdash; I would have thought a Minister for the west should have been appointed.</P>
      <P>The programme for the new Government is full of fine phrases and lofty sentiments about responsible public behaviour, honouring the character and spirit of the Irish people and making Ireland a more self-reliant, enterprising and innovative society, and I agree entirely with those sentiments.  That is the message we have preached in recent times to Irish Steel, TEAM Aer Lingus and all the bodies in the public and semi-public sector.  We have told them they must become more self-reliant and more enterprising, but in addition we have told them how to become so.  We have told them they must become more competitive and cost effective, that they must cut the number of staff and become leaner and fitter in order to become more efficient.  That is the argument we have put before workers and management.</P>
      <P>However, we are now being told that the Government must add to its staff, with the additional expense involved, to enable it to become more efficient.  I suggest that will stick in the gullets of many people who have recently been requested to do the opposite in their industries and their fields of operation. Nobody believes that adding to staff will of necessity make it more efficient. Nobody believes that these two additional appointments were made in order to render the new Government more efficient.  Everybody realises the real reason the appointments are being made.  There would be less public cynicism if the Government did not try to convince people that these appointments are being made in the interests of efficiency, because that is not the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adding to an already over-bloated and top heavy administration in the manner proposed and by the appointment of special advisers to Ministers is no guarantee that the Government will be more efficient.  It is probable that it will have the opposite effect.  People are <Col N="188" /> now stumbling over one another in the corridors, scrambling to get a seat in the restaurant and trying to gain advantage over one another in terms of how they can get their individual messages across to the media.  If that is supposed to make the Government more efficient then I am afraid I understand nothing about the system of government.  I do not accept that argument.</P>
    <P>I am saddened that the first legislation introduced by the Government in 1995 proposes to add to the cost of the public service in one way or another and to make additional ministerial appointments. If the Government had any sense of priority in terms of public appointments it would look at those areas in urgent need of essential public appointments such as the health, educational and judicial services.  Taxpayers' scarce money could be put to better use than making these additional appointments which are useless in terms of service to the general public.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to areas which I know well.  Cork University Hospital &mdash; I prefer to call it the regional hospital as it is a major flagship hospital which serves the needs of a much wider region than Cork city and county &mdash; has only one consultant cardiologist.  As a result people with serious cardiac complaints have to wait for 12 months for a consultation. The hospital has been seeking the appointment of an additional cardiologist for a long time.  Taxpayers' money would be better spent in appointing an additional cardiologist to this hospital.  I am speaking of only one appointment which I believe ought to be made.</P>
    <P>There is a similar situation in relation to the treatment of children with cancer in the same hospital.  Because there is no oncologist in the hospital the children in the health board area, in Cork and Kerry, who have cancer other than leukaemia have to travel to hospitals in Dublin and other areas for treatment.  I do not need to underline the hardship this causes for these young patients and their families.  The parents of these children have to bring their children to <Col N="189" /> Dublin and other areas for treatment because we have not been able to find enough money in the public purse to appoint an oncologist to Cork University Hospital.  The public would be better served if scarce taxpayers' money was allocated to such an appointment.</P>
    <P>How many additional Circuit Court or other court judges could be appointed with the money which will be spent on appointing two additional Ministers of State and all the apparatus which go with these appointments &mdash; offices, drivers, secretaries etc?  If the Government made the appointment of more judges a priority there would be a major improvement in law and order issues.  At present there is not only a backlog of people waiting to see consultants in hospitals but there is also a backlog of court cases because we do not have enough judges.  This is having a very regressive effect on law and order.</P>
    <P>I could talk at length about the inadequate number of remedial teachers in schools.  There was a reference in the House last night to the crisis in Cork University Hospital which does not have enough beds.  As a result a number of very important operations which were due to be carried out in the hospital this week had to be cancelled. Instead of voting money to remedy that critical situation in the health services and some of the other problems to which I referred we are being asked to vote money to underpin the appointments of two additional Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>The work which will be assigned to these two new Ministers of State could just as easily have been done by some of the Ministers of State already appointed.  The gross overstaffing of this House in terms of Ministerial appointments is an insult to the many people in the public service &mdash; in the health and education areas, the Garda and the courts &mdash; who are struggling to keep within their budgets and who have to cope with a lack of staff.  I could also talk at length about the pittance given to carers and people who carry out home help duties, thus enabling patients <Col N="190" /> to remain in the community.  The key point I want to make is that the money being voted for these two additional appointments could be better spent with more benefit to the community.</P>
    <P>These appointments will add greatly to the level of cynicism about politics and politicians among the public.  It will also devalue the English language &mdash; we say one thing in our programme for Government and during election time when we are looking for votes but then do the exact opposite.  I was active in the by-elections in Cork North Central and Cork South Central last November.  The key point in the election propaganda of Democratic Left and Fine Gael during those by-elections was that the then Government was squandering money on what it called Mercs and perks.  The perks were the special advisers and other people employed to assist the Government.  People voted for the candidates of those parties on the clear understanding that if they got into Government they would reverse that process.  Look what happened &mdash; not only have they not reversed that process, they have retained and expanded it.  One can imagine the cynicism among the people of Cork and other areas at that turnabout.  We say one thing but we do the opposite which must be bad for politics.  I appeal to the Government at this late stage to reconsider its position in relation to these two appointments.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned about the west.</P>

      <P>I would not wish any utterance of mine to be misconstrued here.  People seem to have a new science of distorting words and their meaning. To say that because we oppose these appointments we also oppose special initiatives to help the west is not the case.  I repeat the question I posed at the outset.  If this Government is so concerned about the west, why were these appointments not part of the initial appointments of Ministers of State? Why is there not any mention, under <Col N="191" /> any heading, of the west or any particular programme or policy towards the west in the new elaborate programme for Government?  If this Government was concerned about the west and responding to the legitimate plea made by the western bishops and the good work done by them in terms of identifying needs and pinpointing remedies to address the problems of the west, surely it would have appointed a Minister for the West in the first tranche of appointments? Nobody is convinced by the story being put out.</P>
      <P>There was a desperate scramble earlier this month to save the Government's blushes when it realised it had got it wrong in seeking to appoint Deputy Carey to the office of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  Having failed to appoint Deputy Carey to that office, it came up with another notion.  The Government was fortunate, however, that it had not already made an appointment to the west but I suppose it would have found some other cause with which to identify. Nobody should be deluded as to the priority this Government puts on the welfare of the west.</P>
      <P>These new appointments &mdash; and the appointments of the additional plethora of advisers and special advisers &mdash; will not make for a more efficient Government. It did not do so in the last Government because the first function of Government is to keep itself in office and the last Government, with all its advisers, failed to do so.  Those advisers failed in the primary duty of Government because, to achieve anything in a programme, one must stay in office. These appointments will not lead to efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fiercely reject this wasteful use of taxpayers' money, particularly at a time when many critical appointments need to be made in our health, judicial, education and local government services. This is a gross misuse of public money. This turnabout, particularly on the part of Fine Gael and Democratic Left, will not earn any respect for elected politicians. It will do the opposite.  It will <Col N="192" /> breed a higher level of cynicism and contempt than that which exists already.</P>
    <P>My party will be voting against this Bill and I repeat the commitment made by our party Leader, Deputy Harney. Should the opportunity arise &mdash; and I hope for the sake of the country it does &mdash; that we will be part of the next Government, we will certainly play our part in not only reducing the number of Ministers of State to 15 but in reducing it even further.  We all acknowledge that the 15 Cabinet Ministers do very good work but we know also that most of the Ministers of State have flimsy duties assigned to them and some of them have been promoted far beyond their capacity.  It is because of that that they need so many advisers, press officers and so on.  The whole question of the number and duties of Ministers of State is one we will be examining carefully in terms of real Dáil reform when we, I hope, become part of the next Government.</P>

      <P>I am talking about Seanad Éireann which was one of the major planks of the Progressive Democrats' policy for a long time.  We do not hear a word about that now.  When the Leader of Deputy Quill's party was a Minister of State, she put in an excellent performance as indeed did all the other Ministers of State.</P>
      <P>Ministers of State have an important function provided they are defined properly for them and that they do not go around like the headless chickens about which we heard a lot in the past three or four months.  Their performance depends on the specific task they are given and I know that because I was a Minister of State some years ago.  That is why I am shocked by the Opposition opposing the appointments of the two new Ministers of State.  If the Opposition said in two years' time that it did not work, that the public service or the west are not better off, I would accept that criticism because it would be made with the benefit of hindsight.  Deputy Quill and many other speakers, particularly those from Fianna Fáil, are vehemently opposed to the appointment of Deputy Carey.  The western bishops, who have received much praise from speakers today, said recently that they had been seeking such an appointment for many years.</P>

Members of the Opposition should go back down to the chambers of commerce in the west and say that they are opposed to the appointment of a Minister for the west.  I would like to see Deputy Quill say that in the west.  The Progressive Democrats will get the same answer in the west as they got in the Cork by-election.</P>

      <P>I have been around long enough to know that the tasks given to the two junior Ministers involves an extremely large volume of work.  I have no way of knowing, nor has anybody else, how successful they will be.  However, the need is there.  I sincerely believe that the two people most suited to achieve success in their respective areas are Deputies Doyle and Carey and I wish them luck in carrying out the daunting task they have before them.  We have talked about the reorganisation of the public service and western development for many a day. The Government has now said it will try to do something about it and, in two and a half years time we can evaluate the performance of the two Ministers.  I believe the west of Ireland project will meet with success.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why Fianna Fáil is voting tonight, particularly against the appointment of Deputy Carey.  Fianna Fáil has always tried to give the impression that there can be no development of any description in the west that is not initiated by it.  One only has to look at the decline in the population of areas from Galway to Donegal to know that successive Governments have not given enough thought to the underlying problems that beset the west. Now, when we have a chance to install a Minister of State, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are opposed to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent times there has been an effort to co-ordinate various activities. There are countless thousands of local communities trying to help themselves, investing their time, energy and expertise to make their area a better place in which to live.  There is potential for job creation in this.  I appreciate the initiative of the western bishops who managed to bring thousands of people to area meetings and get their views.  There is a large framework of very good chambers of commerce across the western province. Organisations such as the IFA, <Col N="195" /> ICMSA, Macra na Feirme, the town commissioners, the county councils and the urban councils comprise a sound local government structure.  However, none of the county councils or corporations is quite big enough to have a major impact on the social and economic life of the region.  It makes sense, therefore, to co-ordinate all the activities in so far as this is possible.</P>
    <P>Having lived and worked all my life in the west I can say that Deputy Carey will have a difficult job.  However, his appointment is a strong statement by the Government that it is sincere and interested in doing what it can to revive the west.  One might ask why the west should be helped to survive.  Some politicians and economists say the west has got enough, that it is no different from any other region and should be treated in the same way.  This is not how one treats a very sick patient, and many parts of the west are denuded of population. Some areas are unable to regenerate population.  The new Minister of State, Deputy Carey, must ensure that the money available is used properly to introduce a new dimension to community effort.</P>
    <P>I hope the efforts of Deputies Doyle and Carey will be fruitful because if the west cannot be regenerated the loss to the entire community and to Ireland generally will be great.  I wish both Ministers of State well and I am amazed that the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil intend to vote against the appointment of a Minister of State for western development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>For too long the catch cry has been &ldquo;to hell or to Connacht&rdquo;.  One would be forgiven for thinking that the slogan of previous Governments was &ldquo;to hell with Connacht&rdquo; such has been the wilful neglect of the region.  It is heartening that the new Government has moved decisively.  The appointment of Deputy Carey as Minister of State for western development is a step in the right direction.  I welcome the decision, but I do not view the appointment as an <Col N="196" /> end in itself.  The Government will have to back up words with action.  Deputy Carey will have to earn his keep and I will keep a critical eye on his performance.</P>
      <P>For years bishops and politicians have been highlighting the decline of the west.  Archbishop Cassidy of Tuam, who is to retire shortly and whom I wish well, has been extremely eloquent in underlining the seriousness of the situation. He says the west will be bled dry of its people and will be unable to sustain itself within a few decades unless we take action.  The Archbishop elect of Tuam, Dr. Michael Neary, who will be installed in March, will maintain the good fight for western development started by Bishops Cassidy and Kirby among others.  I wish him well in this most difficult work.  The Church, although backed up by vibrant community core groups, cannot succeed without the support and commitment of the Government.  Having talked with Deputy Carey, the proposed new Minister, and other senior and junior Government members I am confident there is the will and determination to cut away the curtain of blind indifference which has been wrapped around the problem until now.</P>
      <P>This is a new year and I am full of optimism.  We have a new Government, a new Minister for the west a new beginning. I am not big-headed when I claim credit for the new mood of concern about the depopulation of the west.  Last year, against all the odds the people of west Mayo elected me to Dáil Éireann. They did not elect me because they liked the look of my face or the ring of my voice.  They voted for change and in protest at the disgraceful neglect of whole communities which were either dying away or were having the young people sucked from them by the dark forces of emigration.  I was elected to the Dáil because for too long Fianna Fáil neglected the people of west Mayo and the other scattered communities along the western seaboard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surveys have been undertaken and forecasts made to underline the extent <Col N="197" /> of depopulation in the west and north-west. Other speakers have given the stark figures and I do not intend to repeat them.  Some of the latest statistics refer to Achill Island.  A survey by the Irish National Teachers' Organisation indicated that the school-going population on the island is in rapid decline. The study showed that the numbers attending primary schools on the island will have dropped by 363 by 1997.  This represents a fall of 50 per cent over four years.  This trend, if not reversed, will result in the loss of five teaching jobs and the creation of four one teacher schools on the island.  I have said enough to illustrate my point.  The problems of Achill are mirrored in dozens if not hundreds of communities from Donegal to Kerry.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to quote Archbishop Cassidy whom I mentioned previously.  In welcoming the appointment of Deputy Carey he said that reviving the west was not a question of breathing life into the dead, that there was enough talent and enterprise in the region on which to build.  I heartily agree with that statement.  We have the means to work our way out of the depopulation nightmare.  The action plan being prepared by the Western Development Partnership Board is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Doyle on her appointment as Minister of State and wish her well in her role as chairperson of the special committee set up to commemorate the Famine.  We should remember that that terrible event was only a century and a half ago.  We forget the past at our peril.  Let the present Government act now to stop the province where our forefathers starved becoming an empty wasteland.</P>
    <P>I call on my Fianna Fáil colleagues and the one Progressive Democrats Member from the west to support the new Minister of State for the West.  I compliment the Taoiseach on showing his commitment to the west by reappointing Pádraig Flynn as the EU Commissioner.  The Fianna Fáil <Col N="198" /> Members told us in the past of their great concern for the west, but it took the by-election of last year to remind them how much they had forgotten the west.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Carey on his appointment as Minister of State for the West.  He knows the problems there because he was my director of elections. Deputy Higgins, the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny and I will have the opportunity to fill him in.  I do not wish at the next election to have to tell the people in my constituency that the Fianna Fáil Members, the people who love the west, voted against the Minister for the West.  I hope they will vote with the Government so that we can get people back to the west.  We have suffered long enough under Fianna Fáil.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> The west is very dear to the heart of the Fianna Fáil Party and will continue to be.  We have no problem with a Ministry for western development but the idea of creating 17 Ministers of State is a problem.  I do not think that the State can carry that number of Ministers of State.  If one looks at the duties and functions they have been given &mdash; I will not go down the road of Deputy Rabbitte, who is now the Government's official doorman, the official greeter, as that is the amount of work he has to do as a Minister of State with special responsibility for Government.</P>
    <P>It seems extraordinary that when the announcement of Ministers of State was made on 20 December last to mention an additional Minister of State in the person of Deputy Doyle there was no mention of the appointment of Deputy Carey.  It was not contemplated that there would be a Minister of State with special responsibility for the west.</P>
    <P>If there is to be a Minister of State with special responsibility for the west why could it not have been added to the Department of Tourism and Trade? Deputy Enda Kenny for example, is Minister for Tourism and Trade and he now has a Minister of State Deputy Toddy O'Sullivan.  I am not certain that within his remit there is sufficient work for him as the Department is small.  If we are talking about the west that is the portfolio to which to attach western development to give it additional strength and vigour.</P>
    <P>The bishops, of course, are right in saying that the west has been neglected by successive Governments during the years.  I love the west and live there as often as I can.  I know Cois Fharraige and Galway to Rossaveal intimately and the neglect of that part of the world by successive Governments, ourselves or coalition Governments.  I am glad that the poverty I remember of the 1940s has now become a thing of the past but the area continues to need to be developed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="200" /> This is called for in the document produced by the bishops and now being discussed in concert with the various communities throughout the west.  That is a very important development.</P>
    <P>We do not begrudge Deputy Carey his appointment as Minister of State for the west nor do we begrudge Deputy Doyle her position as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Finance and the Department of Transport, Energy and Communication &mdash; they might have given her further responsibilities to keep her occupied.  What we object to, however, and will continue to do so is the cynical creation of two new Ministers of State. When we were in Government a short time ago Deputy Rabbitte would stand up and lecture us about the number of programme managers, advisers and so on.  Deputy Rabbitte, who has a non-job in Government has a State car and all the trappings of a full Minister and has done a complete somersault from three months ago.  Plain Deputy Rabbitte has had metamorphosis and is now Deputy Rabbitte, Minister of State for the Government.</P>
    <P>Let me make it clear that we are in favour of the west and its people, we are for the Deputies, the Ministers of State but we are not in favour of non-jobs in the sense of creating a special job to placate an individual for some ulterior motive.  To suggest that by not going into the division lobby Fianna Fáil is in some way against the west could not be further from the truth.  We stand strong and firm in our conviction that the west needs to be developed but we do not need 17 Ministers of State and that is why we will go into the division lobbies and make our protest.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> Deputy Carey is an honourable gentleman and I wish him well in his position as Minister for the west.  However, if it was <Col N="202" /> intended to appoint a Minister for the west Deputy Carey should have been in the first 15 and not appointed as an afterthought.  I heard Ministers and Deputies talk about the need to protect and develop rural Ireland and revitalise the west.  We are all in favour of that. For many years too many people have drifted towards the major urban centres. I hope the Government will continue the decentralisation programme and that county enterprise boards will be given funds to rebuild rural areas.  The Leader programmes played an important part in developing small enterprises.  I hope these will be reintroduced.</P>
      <P>In originally appointing Ministers and Ministers of State why did the Taoiseach not think it worth while to appoint a Minister for the west?  There were 29 vacancies excluding his own.  If it had been possible to remove Deputy Jacob as Leas-Cheann Comhairle the position of Minister for the west would not have seen the light of day.  I do not dispute that it is good to have a Minister for the west but he has been appointed for all the wrong reasons.</P>

They stated this was a waste of taxpayers' money. During my canvass I was told that Fine Gael and Democratic Left stated, if elected, they would put the money to more productive uses.

Those who made allegations against the outgoing Government have somersaulted to such an extent that the public are outraged.

There were ferocious outbursts by Deputy Barry and others but now Fine Gael find it acceptable to increase the number from 15 to 17.</P>
      <P>I was a Minister of State and know that many junior Ministers do a good job.  I am disappointed that there are no Ministers of State for food and environmental protection.  That is a pity.  The areas of food and environmental protection are interlinked.  Regardless of the capabilities of the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin &mdash; I know he was a good Minister for Health &mdash; it will be difficult for him to look after environmental protection as well as other areas of the environment.  The Taoiseach and the three parties should look seriously at giving responsibility for environmental protection to a Minister.</P>

        <i>(Wexford):</i> These are very important areas and it is wrong not to appoint a Minister to look after them. It will reflect badly on the Government.</P>
      <P>A number of Ministers have been given responsibility in two or three Departments.  I wish Deputy Durkan well in his Department.  Will such a Minister or Minister of State have three private secretaries and a back-up service in each Department?  How much will that cost?  Enormous extra costs will be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the formation of the last Government, Labour was negotiating from the cliff top of the high moral ground.  They said they would not go back into Government unless the proposed pay increases for Ministers and Ministers of State were not implemented.  While that has happened, there is the proposal to appoint two additional Ministers of State, in addition to new programme managers, new advisers and so on.  The costs of such appointments far exceed the salary increases that were to have been paid to Ministers and Ministers of State and the <Col N="205" /> objection to which was no more than a publicity exercise on the part of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>I wish Deputy Carey well in his new appointment.  He is a decent, honourable man and will do a good job as Minister for the West.  Who knows, perhaps Wexford and Clare might meet in the All-Ireland Hurling Final this year when we can sit side by side in Croke Park. My sparring partner from Wexford, Deputy Avril Doyle, is an able dealer, tough, hard working, having survived the tough constituency that is Wexford over many years.  I have no doubt that she will carry out the tasks allocated to her by the Taoiseach in a responsible manner; indeed she is well capable of being on the Front Bench.</P>
    <P>In Wexford we have now Ministers Howlin, Yates and Minister of State, Deputy Avril Doyle, which will render it very difficult for humble backbenchers like myself to survive within that political scenario&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Cuireann sé an-lúcháir orm an deis seo a fháil chun labhairt ag an díospóireacht faoi leasú an Achta seo.  Mar Theachta Dála ó lár an chósta thiar, is dóigh liom go bhfuil sé d'údarás agam a rá go bhfuil tuiscint mhaith agam ar na fadhbanna atá idir chaibidil sna ceantair seo.  Beidh focal ar leith le rá agam faoin nGaeltacht ar ball.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The west is caught in a vicious circle; as its population has declined, services <Col N="206" /> reduced and economic activity decreased.  Each of those negative factors reinforces the others; as services have been reduced and economic activity curved downwards, fewer people have been able to live in the west.  While other parts of the country experience social and economic problems, no other region is caught in this type of trap.</P>
    <P>My job will be straightforward, to find practical ways of helping the people of the west to break out of this vicious circle. The appointment of a new Minister of State with responsibility for the west has been widely welcomed throughout the region, among others the Council of the West and Archbishop Cassidy of Tuam.  This huge response convinces me of the heartfelt desire of the people of the west to have a voice at national level, someone to argue their case in the highest arena.  I hope to serve those people to the best of my ability, to leave a legacy comprising structures and support in which the people of the region can believe.  The people want this, the desire is there and found lucid expression when the western bishops launched their document &ldquo;A Crusade for Survival&rdquo;, which initiative energised local communities in addition to focusing attention on the needs of the region. I might now quote from what the bishops said in &ldquo;A Crusade for Survival&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>... the scale of the problems in the West of Ireland is so great, and the need for action so urgent that a resolution of the crisis situation of which we speak in the report demands a major partnership between the people and the Government, and between private and public enterprise.  Our target is, together, to stabilise the population by the end of the decade.</P>
    <P>The analyses and policy recommendations contained in the report &ldquo;A Crusade for Survival&rdquo; are important in that they represent the various perspectives and key developmental priorities of the people living in the west.  The report <Col N="207" /> represents the consensus views of a number of core groups who have identified the potential of the area and recommended strategic approaches to exploit that potential.  The report merits a positive response.  It called for the appointment of a Minister for the West. I am pleased and honoured to have been nominated for this position.</P>
    <P>The bishops' initiative mobilised many diverse interest groups and sectoral organisations in the region, managing to capture the imagination of the people and, through those core groups, allow for genuine bottom-up participation in the process.  The newly-established Council for the West will continue to provide an outlet for those concerns and energies.  I have already written to the council members expressing my admiration of the achievements of the bishops' initiative to date.  I know that the council will prove to be a valuable source of ideas and support for the continued development of the west.</P>
    <P>The Western Development Partnership Board forms a further important element of the response to the needs of the west, representing, as it does, all the main State agencies in the region, including FÁS, Bord Fáilte, Forbairt, IDA Ireland, Údarás na Gaeltachta and Teagasc.  These experienced, high-level members of key developmental agencies in the region will be complemented by the energy and enthusiasm of board members nominated by local developmental interests in the region.</P>
    <P>The Western Development Partnership Board has been set the specific target of achieving population stability at 1991 census levels by the end of the decade. This population stability is to be achieved on a county-by-county basis and will take account of the need to ensure that a balance is struck between the development of urban areas, as centres of growth, and the maintenance of rural communities.  That task appears impossible but need not be so.  I believe it is achieveable.</P>
    <P>The striking success of Rural Resettlement Ireland, led by Mr. Jim <Col N="208" /> Connolly, is an important example of the target to which I have just referred. They are developing a new partnership between the public and private sectors and the Irish overseas.  It is this type of initiative which requires a clear focus for support at Government level.  On Sunday last I attended the launch of a five year plan by Rural Resettlement Ireland in Athlone when I met Mr. Jim Connolly.  I was glad to receive congratulations and the support of all western Deputies there, including those of the Fianna Fáil Party, who were most anxious that this appointment should go ahead.</P>
    <P>The Western Development Partnership Board will complement the work already being done by the county enterprise boards and Leader groups in the region.  The regional and cross-sectoral perspectives of the board will help to ensure that the activities of county and sub-county level groups are reinforced by appropriate regional policies. There will be scope also for co-ordination and co-operation between the board and those groups.  Indeed the terms of reference of the board specifically provide for it acting as a catalyst in this manner.  There are many possibilities for such initiatives.  I hope to see the board pursue this route.</P>
    <P>While continuing pressure on numbers in agriculture and competitive forces of Europe and the Far East pose a serious challenge to the region, many opportunities also exist for the west.  Its unspoiled environment and social and cultural attractions can act as a magnet for tourists.  Information technology will allow businesses to establish in the west, given that telecommunications have diminished the importance of geographic distances.  I am aware that a person in County Clare is working on a scheme involving the European Union which I hope will be up and running fairly soon.  Those are just two of the sectors where new opportunities await development.</P>
    <P>Another area of great potential is that of small business, particularly those in the food area.  Irish food products are <Col N="209" /> renowned for their quality.  We must build on this reputation and the positive image of Ireland as a green, unspoiled country.  The west needs to ensure that it maximises the potential of this sector.</P>
    <P>Cross-Border trade and tourism also offer huge possibilities for the region, in particular for the counties of Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim, often viewed as peripheral but which have a natural hinterland across the Border and following the end of violence in the North have had increased contact with the North which will benefit them enormously.</P>
    <P>I have already met the members of the board and spoken to them about the role it can play in tackling the problems of the region, capitalising on its possibilities. I was impressed by the seriousness with which it approaches its task and have assured it of my support.  I hope to develop this and other contacts throughout the west of Ireland over the next few weeks.  I was impressed by the venue in Foxford chosen by the board for that meeting.  Foxford presents a clear demonstration of what can be done in partnership between private and public interests and with goodwill and community initiative.  I was impressed by the activities in Foxford, including the programme outlined by the manager of Meitheal Mayo.</P>
    <P>The board was asked to produce an action plan by the autumn and that plan will receive an immediate positive response from me and the Government. The plan and the board's role in overseeing its implementation will also provide a focus for the activities of the public agencies active in the region.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a Minister with responsibility for the west means that the people of the region now have a voice at the centre of national administration. The former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, addressed the question of western development and sited responsibility for it in his Department and that role was continued by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds.  That followed a rural resettlement programme pursued by Mr. Jim Connolly. I would point out, not in a niggardly <Col N="210" /> way, that a point made to me in Athlone was that there was a good deal of scepticism about whether that resettlement programme would get off the ground.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>It was resettled.  Mr. Jim Connolly told me that in order to meet the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, he had to travel to New York as it was not possible for Mr. Connolly to meet the Taoiseach in Dublin because of his agenda at the time.  That illustrates the lack of access to Government encountered by people in rural development programmes hitherto.</P>
      <P>The Western Development Partnership Board was established through the Department of the Taoiseach because of the central and strategic nature of the Department.  Likewise my appointment as Minister of State at the Department will give me a central position from which to address the key issues affecting the region.  Local people must be given a stake in their own future &mdash; a chance to take steps to improve their lives and environment.  There is only so much that even the most energetic community can do for itself.  Up to now, communities have felt frustrated.  This new Ministry will provide a clear path from good ideas to effective action.</P>
      <P>The challenge facing the west is much more than an economic one.  It relates to the self-confidence and a sense identity for the people of the region.  The constant loss of population, particularly the emigration of young people, can damage the morale of small communities. Part of my task in this new Ministry will be to stimulate new confidence in these communities &mdash; to let them know they are valued.  The ultimate objective should be that every young person leaving school or college in the west will have a chance to live or work in their local community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some cases young people are attracted by the bright lights of the big city or even to the different experiences offered by a foreign country.  They may <Col N="211" /> also wish to broaden their education or gain valuable work experience.  I hope more will at least have the option of staying in their local areas and that those who leave will be tempted back by the many attractions of the west.</P>
    <P>Much of the work of the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht relates directly to the development and, indeed, conservation of a large part of the western region.  I intend to work very closely with the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Higgins, another Clare man, who also represents a neighbouring constituency of west Galway.</P>
    <P>Beidh mé i dteagmháil leis an Aire Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta go luath faoi chúrsaí sa Ghaeltacht.  Faoi mar is eol don Teach, tá cuid mhaith scéimeanna á reachtáil ag an Roinn ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht &mdash; go háirithe i gcás na muiroibreacha ar na h-oileáin sa Ghaeltacht.</P>

Idir í féin agus Údarás na Gaeltachta, táthar ag cabhrú le comharchumainn agus ag cur áiseanna farantóireachta ar fáil ar an mór thír agus ar na h-oileáin.  I gcás Údarás na Gaeltachta tá beagnach 6,000 post lánaimseartha cruthaithe i gcomhlachtaí a fuair cúnamh ón Údarás agus atá mar dhea-shampla agus mar mhisneach don iarthar uile.  Tabharfaidh mo phost nua deis dom an obair seo a láidriú.</P>
    <P>Tá coiste eadar-ranna ag scrúdú na bhfadhbanna a bhíonn ag oileánaigh. Beidh torthaí ar obair an choiste seo ina chabhair mhór domsa.  Beidh sé rí-shoiléir don Teach cé chomh crua is atá an saol ag na comhluadair oileáin, go mór mór le linn an gheimhridh.  Chonaiceamar go léir le déanaí an togha oibre a rinne an tAer Cór chun freastal ar na <Col N="212" /> comhluadair chéanna.  Léiríonn sé crógacht agus misneach mhuintir na n-oileán agus slí bheatha faoi leith á caomhnú acu.  Is léir go bhfuil dualgas faoi leith orainn go léir tuiscint agus tacaíocht chuí a thaispeáint dóibh.  Déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall chun cothrom na féinne a sholáthar dóibh.</P>
    <P>The task is to break out of the vicious circle of declining population, declining services and declining economic activity. Even in advance of completion of the action plan by the Western Partnership Board we can take practical steps.  For example, I want to implement a pilot scheme to examine how public services can be delivered more effectively in sparsely populated areas.</P>
    <P>Throughout my time in public life, and I am sure Deputy McDowell will agree with me on this, I have recognised and strongly supported the view that State services must be run efficiently and with the same economic criteria that apply to all well-run businesses.  At the same time, I am only too acutely aware of the injustice of withdrawing services from people solely on the grounds that they do not have enough neighbours.  The answer to this dilemma is for the providers of the services to act together.  For example, where the community has difficulty in supporting, say, an ESB office and a post office, the two could use the same premises and employ part time staff.  Also, redundant public buildings could be used as a single location for one-stop-shops for several public services.  There are endless possibilities.</P>
    <P>In this area, some interesting work has been carried out by the Forum group in Connemara.  Mr. Leo Hallissey, who at one time was my next door neighbour in Clarecastle, is very active in that group.  It has had success in responding to the needs of the elderly in the area.  I heard Mr. Hallissey on Raidió na Gaeltachta this morning describing a pooling system of cars to bring people to the pubs, the church and the doctor.</P>

      <P>Up until now there was no one to help turn the type of eminently suitable proposals into reality.  There was no Government Department or State agency which could pull together the providers of services.  It is precisely because effective action involves such co-ordination across Departments and agencies that the Government has moved the process forward with the establishment of this new Ministry.  It should have happened much earlier.</P>

    <P>This is a serious debate about a matter of principle, not about the personalities of individuals opposite.  It is about the principle of the use of State funds &mdash; taxpayers' funds &mdash; to solve party political problems.  We oppose the use of taxpayers' funds to solve the leadership problems of the Fine Gael Party.  If the case was being made that these two appointments were in the national interest or an effort to further Government policies one could consider them <Col N="214" /> positively, but as everybody knows they are proposed to reward two Fine Gael Deputies for missing out on the first row, the one and a half rows comprising Deputy Rabbitte, the second row and the two and a half rows.  Would it not be the essence of transparency to admit that when there are three parties in Government new jobs must be created to keep everybody on board?</P>
    <P>I applaud the Government's commitment to job creation.  It has appointed 75 non civil servants since coming into office a few short weeks ago.  There has also been a <i>de facto</i> increase in the size of the Cabinet and two new Ministers of State will be appointed.  That is not a bad job creation record in a short time.</P>

      <P>We are to have four new Dáil committees presumably with paid chairmanships &mdash; as Deputy Ahern said earlier, &ldquo;an orgy of appointments indeed&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Why is Democratic Left silent on this issue?  The Fianna Fáil front bench discussed the matter and undertook publicly to repeal this legislation.  A compromise between the rainbow parties is being achieved at the taxpayers' expense.  The alternative for the Taoiseach was to make difficult choices, which is what being Taoiseach appears to be about, but it is regrettable he decided to put his party before the taxpayer on this occasion.</P>
      <P>In fairness, I compliment the Taoiseach for his admission on Question Time today when pressed by Deputy Ahern on the need for programme managers. Despite his Cork by-election campaign call to &ldquo;stop the gravy train of programme manager appointments and others&rdquo;, the Taoiseach told the Dáil this afternoon that he had changed his mind and he now supported that concept. That is a start and I thank him for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Programme for Government is a serious document, yet there is no mention in it of the need for a new ministerial post to save the west.  If that was <Col N="215" /> an important matter in the minds of the negotiators surely it would have been included in that document.  Likewise, if it was deemed necessary to appoint a new Minister of State with responsibility for co-ordinating consumer access to services and a thousand other matters, why was it not included in the Programme for Government?  With my colleagues in Fianna Fáil, I was involved in negotiating the proposed aborted Programme for Government between the Labour and Fianna Fáil parties until Deputy Spring changed his mind and withdrew from the negotiations.  At no time during those talks did the question of the appointment of new Ministers of State arise.  I conclude, therefore, that the Labour Party in this Government is merely going along with this decision as a matter of expediency to solve Fine Gael's dilemma of having more ambitions than there are posts to satisfy.</P>
    <P>Why is the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, going along with this proposal?  He would not have contemplated it at another time.  I understand he will actually vote for it. A few short months ago he would have roasted Fianna Fáil if it attempted this charade.  We should have spotted this when the Labour Party put forward the idea of a rotating Taoiseach.  The half Cabinet ministry held by Deputy Rabbitte and the two extra posts now proposed come from the same type of thinking that threw up the idea of rotating Taoisigh and equating jobs with ambitions.</P>
    <P>To solve the Government's lack of a majority in the Seanad, will we now have a Minister of State from the Seanad?  Deputies may smile at that suggestion but when they hear what I have to say they may not.  I understand discussions are taking place.  Are alternative Seanad arrangements being considered this afternoon?  For example, Senator O'Toole, the Secretary-General of the INTO made no bones yesterday about the fact that in his talks with the Fine Gael Party about his vote in the Seanad he said would decide how to <Col N="216" /> vote based on the Government's response to issues he would raise on his education spending proposals.  The Taoiseach should resist this shopping list approach before it grows like Topsy.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the suggestion of my colleague, Deputy McCreevy, that many of the Ministers of State are virtually titular appointments.  I had the honour to hold such a post on two occasions and I put new policies and programmes in place in important areas of State.  However, the proposal to increase the number by two runs the risk of debasing what is a valuable coinage.</P>
    <P>Deputies Doyle and Carey are respected Members of the House and if these appointments proceed I wish them well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate Deputies Carey and Doyle.  I know they are not appointed yet, but it is obvious, because of the Government's majority, that they will be.  I wish them well.</P>
      <P>Eloquent attempts were made yesterday to defend the appointment of two additional junior Ministers and Deputy Quinn, Minister for Finance, with his descriptive job specifications, made them sound very interesting.  This will probably give ammunition to backbenchers entertaining hopes of chairmanships to defend the appointment of two additional Minister of State.  It may even solve the consciences of some members of Democratic Left who have been loud and shrill over the past number of years. However, no amount of fancy job descriptions can hide the truth, namely, that this is the first act of hypocrisy of this Administration.  It is the first in 1995 and the first for this rainbow coalition, a Government of transparency, openness and accountability.  What a start.  Over the past seven years I listened to a great deal of hypocrisy from the high moral ground, in particular from members of Fine Gael and the Democratic Left. Fine Gael, in particular, expressed concerns for the taxpayer which reached a crescendo in the run-up to the Cork by-election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="217" /> Less than two months ago Fine Gael was against the appointment of programme managers from outside the Civil Service, advisers and mobile telephones. Today the Taoiseach agreed he was wrong.  That is the clearest example I know of the differing perspectives one can have when one moves from one side of the House to the other.  Fine Gael now support the appointment of programme managers from outside the Civil Service with salaries higher than those paid to Ministers.  Democratic Left, who has always been against the idea of having anybody other than Ministers coming into the House, has extended the concept of programme managers to Ministers of State.  We heard much during the past few months about Labour's change of heart about the ministerial pay increases.  Having enthusiastically supported them initially they then decided they were not popular and said the taxpayers deserved better. The net savings resulting from setting aside this independent arbitration award will be wiped out by the cost of these two extra Ministers of State whom the Government is attempting to appoint today.  When you take into account the allowance, the drivers and the mileage that will be paid to the Ministers of State it wipes out what would have been saved by setting aside the Ministerial pay increase.  I do not believe the taxpayers are well served by that type of hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>Much play has been made of Deputy's Carey's appointment.  We are told that it shows the commitment of the Government to the west.  Two Ministers at the Cabinet table would show that much better.  That type of excuse for the appointment adds insult to injury.  There would have been no Minister of State for the west if Fine Gael had succeeded in taking the Leas-Cheann Comhairle position.  That is the basis for its commitment to the west.  The Taoiseach gave a commitment in writing to Deputy Carey that he would make him Leas-Chean Comhairle.  When he discovered <Col N="218" /> he was not able to deliver on that for constitutional and other reasons&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>As we are discussing the position of Ministers I wish to refer to Deputy Rabbitte's elevation to the high chair of the Cabinet.  This is another part of the effort to cobble the Coalition together.  In this House some months ago, the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, made serious and totally unfounded allegations.  To date he has not withdrawn them although I asked the Taoiseach to ask him to do so.  He has not apologised to the House or to any person to whom he caused serious stress on the basis of one 'phone call.</P>
      <P>The allegations caused the adjournment of the House, consternation in the Attorney General's Office, serious concern in various places throughout the country and forced the Cardinal to issue a statement contradicting the allegation. Deputy Rabbitte refused to go before the committee set up to investigate such matters and refuses to put a statement to the committee.  I ask him to come into this House and to be man enough to withdraw the allegation and apologise to those he offended.  It is ominous that in the Programme for Government, in the section on Oireachtas reform, most of which was compiled by Fianna Fáil, that the reference to the abuse of privilege in this House, which has become a feature of the House during the past number of years is withdrawn from the draft programme for Oireachtas reform.</P>

      <P>I will have to keep my contribution short and sweet as Deputy Batt O'Keeffe wishes to contribute.  I wish Deputy Carey and Deputy Doyle well in their promotions.  When the original announcement was made the first insult was to Deputy Doyle who was nominated as the first sub.  When the legislation is passed she will be given the jersey either this evening or tomorrow. <Col N="220" /> A few weeks later it was announced that there would be a Minister of State with responsibility for the west.  It was a few weeks before the Fine Gael Party and their colleagues realised how important it was to have a Minister for the west. We on this side of the House have often been accused of being conservative and slow to learn.  Perhaps we can be given a few more weeks to realise the importance and the necessity for this new post.</P>
      <P>During the past few weeks we have witnessed a major change in the policies and the stance adopted by Fine Gael and Democratic Left.  It is unfortunate that when we are in Government we tend to hold certain views in relation to advisers, or Members of the Dáil seeking election to the European Parliament but in Opposition we take on a different stance.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach when he was leader of the Opposition said the trappings of Government are much loved and yet abused.  At that time he was speaking particularly about the Labour Party.  He spoke about the appointment of family members, blood relations, personal buddies as advisers and drivers.  Suddenly, when he assumes office Fine Gael becomes involved in continuing the process to which they were opposed in Opposition.  The problem is that it leads to further public cynicism.  How can the Taoiseach say he is committed to the west when he omitted to mention it when making the original appointments? The position would not have been created if the Taoiseach had not botched Mr. Carey's appointment to the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Unfortunately Mr. Carey was the unwanted child.</P>

      <P>Now we have a Minister of State with responsibility for the west and I wish him the best of luck. I hope he realises the ambitions he has set himself.  It is important to refer to the reforms that have been signalled by the Government and the four extra Oireachtas committees.  In the interests of the public purse those committees could have been taken in under the umbrella of existing committees.  This will send out the signal that we have an opportunity to look after all those who have been faithful to us.  It is getting so crazy at this stage that the gang of four are likely to get prominent positions. What deeply concerns me is the reckless manner in which the Government face problems when they arise.  I recall Deputy Brian Cowen saying, when in doubt leave out.  This Government <Col N="222" /> when in doubt, buy out.  That is exactly what is happening.  If this trend continues it will have grave connotations for the public purse.</P>

      <P>From listening to the debate I can only conclude that some people have very short memories.

      <P>I agree that such decisions merit deep consideration and discussion.  However, the questions that should be raised on these appointments are not addressed.  What are those questions? They include: are these Ministers of State necessary, can the work be done by other means, are there other areas that merit more attention, are the designated appointees suitable, will the results justify the additional costs, would it be prudent on our behalf not to proceed with such appointments, would it be wise to defer or delay the appointments? These are the logical questions that should be argued and debated in any responsible and reasonable place where such delegation of responsibility is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadly the Opposition has not addressed any of these pertinent matters. Rather, they grasped this opportunity to accuse the Government of cronyism and of creating jobs for their friends.  Being of a generous nature, I <Col N="224" /> can understand their position.  After all, having unceremoniously put themselves out of office, it is understandable they are now going through a rehabilitation period.  Cricitism that a Bill such as this undermines the status, integrity and standing of politicians and that it will cause further cynicism among the public sounds very hollow, especially from a party, as a result of whose actions the very recent past stands out as the most disturbing and scandalous period in our political history.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil speakers in particular who accuse the Taoiseach of opportunism in the appointment of these two new Minister of State have very short memories because in the dying days of the last Government they appointed everyone and anyone to every vacancy within their brief.  There are stories abounding that such was the volume of appointments made that it was necessary for Ministers to burn the midight oil in drawing up the list of Fianna Fáil boys and girls for these jobs.</P>
    <P>I raise a very important question: are the appointments necessary?  The Opposition has contradicted itself on several occasions on this question.  Some say the appointments are not necessary while others say that each position carries so much responsibility one person will not be able to undertake all the duties involved.</P>

      <P>A Minister for the west is necessary and essential.  Evidence of this is clear from the outstanding welcome the new ministry has received from all sections of the community. Everybody realises that no place has suffered more from rural decline than the west.  This ministry is essential to arrest the decline in population. It is essential for the preservation and enhancment of our cultural and environmental heritage.  The Government is committed to western development and rural renewal.  Surely, we need one person with special responsibility to <Col N="225" /> co-ordinate the Government's initiatives.</P>
      <P>All of us, as Members of this House, have voiced our concern with the supply and quality of public services in remote rural areas, and we have justified our concerns.  Surely, it is welcome for the Taoiseach to appoint a Minister who will give priority treatment to such needs.  The Minister will play a crucial role not only in saving the west but in ensuring better services and facilities for all rural areas.  I welcome the fact that the ministry includes responsibility for island communities who, as has been said in this House, have rarely been represented. Let us, for God's sake give them a chance.  Small as they are in number they are a precious part of our community, our heritage and our culture.</P>
      <P>The most common criticism by the Opposition of the appointment of a Minister for the west is that it has come too late, that it should have been announced two weeks earlier.  I challenge one of these people to answer the question: would they prefer that the Taoiseach did not make the appointment? If they believe there should be a Minister for the west, they should be honest and accept and welcome the appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second Minister of State will have responsibility for public service reform.  This Minister will oversee initiatives that were started by the previous Government.  Can anyone here say with conviction that there would be a continuous improvement in the performance of the Civil Service and the wider public service without giving someone responsibility for it?  We all know that what is everybody's responsibility is nobody's responsibility.  The provision of services to the public and the efficient and effective use of resources is a priority for this Government. The answer to my question as to whether those appointments are necessary is that they are necessary.  Deputy McDowell answered that question when, in referring to the responsibilities that will be given to the Minister of <Col N="226" /> State designate, Deputy Doyle, having questioned whether the ministry is necessary, concluded that Deputy Doyle would have too much to do.  That is a total contradiction of this previous position. As to whether the appointees are suitable, the answer is an overwhelming &ldquo;yes&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Rarely have two people been greeted with such positive response, with such enthusiasm.  All over the west Deputy Carey has been welcomed.  Everybody welcomes the appointment of Deputy Doyle because they know that the job will be done.  As to whether the appointment will justify the additional cost.  I believe it will because, as Deputy Carey has said, we cannot afford to delay the appointment of Ministers to those two very important areas.  The appointments should not be deferred.  We cannot afford to defer them.  I congratulate the Minister for giving such priority to two very important areas.  If there are some who believe that those areas should not be the responsibility of a Minister, they should stand up and say so, but they will find very little support for their view among the public.</P>

      <P>There is no doubt that the demands of Government always exceed the possibilities.  There is not one Deputy or one party in this House who does not wish it was possible to achieve more, who does not at the end of the year look back and point to issues still to be addressed or completed. The agenda for this Government is vast.  Tackling unemployment is a key priority.  At present hundreds of thousands of people, individuals and families, are affected by unemployment. There are increasing levels of poverty. Child poverty is becoming increasingly a feature of society.  This has long-term implications for individuals.  There are <Col N="227" /> huge demands for developments in education, health and housing and it is necessary to break the cycle of disadvantage from which many people suffer at present.  The Government faces an immense task and I believe all Deputies share the hope that we can make progress. There is an onus on all of us to look at issues with the objective of making as much progress as possible.</P>
      <P>There has been a great deal of criticism of the Government since it decided to appoint two additional Ministers of State.  Almost all of this criticism has centred on whether certain posts were invented for people rather than on jobs which need to be done.  While we all share a common commitment to change it is often easier to engage in knee-jerk reactions and to emphasise the differences between parties through mud slinging rather than by engaging in more complex debates.  I regret any public perception that successive Governments have acted other than in a most honourable and meaningful way in allocating responsibilities or in developing the role of advisers.  Such decisions are not taken lightly and I am convinced the level of responsibility for Governments is such that new ways of working are necessary. We have to look at the systems in place, analyse them to see if they are the best way of getting jobs done and, if not, change them.</P>
      <P>Following the formation of this and the previous Government accusations were made that posts were created, whether at ministerial or advisory level, for all the wrong reasons.  It is, of course, easier to debate by cliché, to shout in the Chamber and the media about jobs for the boys and girls and to raise questions about the motivation of those charged with the responsibility for government.  It would be foolish to continue the debate in this tone or fashion. If attempts to change a system to meet present and future demands are decried as personal ploys to benefit those close to us or as political opportunism then we risk switching people off from politics completely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="228" /> I am appalled by some of the criticism which essentially boils down to an insistence that since there are only so many places then that is how things should remain, regardless of whether the structure is adequate or appropriate to the task.  Governments all over the world have had to look at their systems of government because they were not responding quickly enough to meet the changing demands of society.  This generation has witnessed an unprecedented rate of change and it is essential that the Government responds in an appropriate way to new issues and tasks and puts appropriate structures in place.  We have to look at the tasks facing us and see whether the present structures are adequate.  If not, they must be adapted to increase the potential for success.</P>
    <P>Clearly Ministers have overall responsibility for their areas but it has long been accepted that junior Ministers have a crucial role to play in ensuring that certain discreet areas of activity are progressed effectively.  We have some very good examples of this.  This debate is about the creation of two new ministries, one of which will address, among other things, the very important issue of public sector reform.  Last night Deputy Doyle gave us very interesting statistics on the number of people in the public sector, the range of services provided and the cost.  She also referred to the need to ensure that the public sector is continually reformed and responsive. The other new Ministry will address the equally important question of the rejuvenation of the west.  It is not helpful to focus solely on these two new roles; rather we need to examine the entire structure of government and, in particular, the way in which tasks such as those I mentioned are to be tackled.  If the structural template has ceased to provide an appropriate framework within which work can be done then clearly there is a need for change.</P>
    <P>During the debate I heard some criticism of the role of a Minister of State. This morning's newspapers had some interesting articles on this issue.  Some very interesting suggestions have been <Col N="229" /> put forward on how this role can be developed.  However, some of the people who have made those suggestions could have changed those roles, reformed the Ministries and reduced or increased the number during the past two years, yet they did not do much in this regard when they had the opportunity. I hope that the more thoughtful comments made about the way in which these posts can be developed and changed will be taken up at a later stage.</P>
    <P>There are a number of new departures within the team of Ministers of State which I welcome.  For example, the brief of the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, spans the Departments of Justice, Health and Education.  For many years people in the child care area said that we needed a Minister who had responsibility in these areas so that a more effective system could be delivered to children and families.  The fact that his brief spans three Departments indicates the many needs of children, the complexity of the response and the need to work meaningfully within various Departments.</P>
    <P>Members of this House have been calling for many years for reform of the public service and for measures to support the development of rural areas, particularly those in the west.  These are jobs which either need to be done or do not need to be done.  If they need to be done then the structure needs to be changed, which is what the Government has done.  There are many ways in which government can be carried out effectively. No system is cast in stone and no party or parties has the monopoly of good ideas.  I congratulate Deputies Doyle and Carey and wish them every success in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It gives me great satisfaction to support this Bill which proposes to appoint Deputies Doyle and Carey as Ministers of State.  Naturally I will concentrate on the ministry with responsibility for western development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Life in the west has always been a struggle for survival and people's resilience, determination and love of the land <Col N="230" /> has ensured that survival.  The Government, through the appointment of a Minister of State with responsibility for the west, is providing a leader in this fight for survival.  The extent of the present crisis can be seen from cold statistics.  Over a 65 year period, between 1926-91, Connacht lost 24 per cent of its population.  However, this figure does not tell the whole story.  During the same period Leitrim lost a staggering 55 per cent of its population while some of the areas in Sligo lost even more people.</P>
    <P>The west can survive only through a massive and planned programme for survival by the Government.  The Government has now acknowledged the extent of the problem and it has made a commitment to do something about it. The appointment of Donal Carey is only a start but it brings some hope to the west.</P>
    <P>Previously we relied on farmers to sustain the population in the west.  Given the emphasis on large farms, I fear we may be witnessing the last generation of small farmers.</P>

      <P>One of the most depressing sights in western counties are recently vacated houses going to ruin, with a cow staring out a window which has a remnant of a curtain hanging. Nothing deteriorates as fast as a locked house.  Many houses which have all the necessary services and which are close to all the necessary infrastructure &mdash; local schools and churches &mdash; are in danger of being deserted due to a lack of people.  There must be some scheme under which these houses can be purchased, preserved and made available to people who will maintain the local population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The west will not be saved by accident but it can be done despite the forces reined against it.  The resilience and determination of past generations from the west is still alive.  This can be seen <Col N="231" /> from the action plans which have been drawn up by virtually every community in that territory.  These plans can do the job but the odds against them are so great that special help is required.  An excellent start in this regard is being made by the appointment of Deputy Carey as Minister of State with responsibility for the west.  I have known Deputy Carey for a long time and do not know any person with more drive, initiative, dedication and love of the west.  I am delighted that the headquarters of the West of Ireland Partnership Board will be located in Sligo.  I invite Deputy Carey to locate his Department there and if he moves there at a later stage he will be very welcome.</P>

      <P>I wish Deputies Carey and Doyle every success.  My remarks are not directed at them personally. These appointments are being made for one reason only.  When Deputy Bruton realised some weeks before Christmas that he had an opportunity of becoming Taoiseach and of getting Fine Gael into Government he emasculated the role of his party and responsibility for the Department of Finance, Foreign Affairs, Environment and Education was given away without any argument. Since then, the Taoiseach has been trying to create new positions for all the people who have been quite upset by all of these Departments being ceded to the Labour Party and Democratic Left. That is why two new Minister of State positions are to be created by the Government.  It is not for high moral reasons or because there is such a demand for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>A light suddenly lit up in the Taoiseach's office and all of these tasks could not be done unless there were two additional Ministers of State.</P>
      <P>All of this started on the very day this Government was to be formed.  We heard much high minded rhetoric on the plinth of Leinster House, that the only thing that matters is the Programme for Government and how everybody would work together.  Issues such as Ministers and programme managers were irrelevant. However, Deputy Rabbitte was about to bring down the Government before it was even put together, so he had to be accommodated and a deal was worked out.  He is now a Minister of State with a car and half a salary, but he is sitting at the Cabinet table.</P>
      <P>We now must appoint two additional Ministers of State to ensure that the balance within the Fine Gael Party, not the Government &mdash; supported by Labour and Democratic Left &mdash; is correct and that Deputy Bruton as Taoiseach, can sell the job he has done to the Fine Gael supporters throughout the country.</P>
      <P>Only some months ago the Taoiseach and the Fine Gael Party were totally opposed to the idea of programme managers. They regarded it as a waste of time and an abuse of taxpayers' money. All of those arguments were made in the run up to the by-elections in Cork but as soon as they moved across the floor of the House into Government, there was another conversion on the road to Damascus.</P>
      <P>I dislike the Taoiseach's suggestion that civil servants and those in the public service do not have the capacity to turn in the political direction in which each Government would wish it to go. The Civil Service and public services have served each Government honourably, regardless of political persuasion, down through the years to the present day.  That was proved by the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party when in Government in appointing, with one exception, all of the programme managers from the public service, and rightly so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is to be a debate on the requirements of Government, my party <Col N="233" /> Leader, Deputy Ahern, has suggested that the Ministers and Secretaries Act of 1923, which governs the responsibilities of all Ministers and how Government is run, is out of date.  The parameters by which Governments operate, the needs and requirements of each Department and Minister to operate in a modern country, could have been examined in that context.  I would have expected the Taoiseach to have brought forward more ideas &mdash; if he had them &mdash; on the need for additional appointments at Minister of State or programme manager level or on the question of additional committees, the remuneration of chairpersons and all of those involved in the committees; but the first thing he did on entering Government was to forget all he said and abuse the taxpayers by going ahead with the promotion of two backbenchers to the positions of Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>In the coming weeks more people will be appointed and additional committees will be set up.  Obviously, there was a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow, but it only concerned party activists, hacks or whatever title one wishes to put on them.  There was no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for the taxpayers. The Taoiseach would be wise to remember what he said some months ago in this House, when he is considering these appointments.  The only reason for making them was to accommodate those within his party whom he had disappointed and because he had ceded so many of the major portfolios of Government to members of Democratic Left and the Labour Party in his need to be Taoiseach.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to contribute to the debate and I regret we have such a short time to conclude but often brevity is the soul of wit and on this occasion I trust it will be so.</P>
      <P>I formally congratulate the Minister of State Deputy Hogan on his appointment. He is a friend of many years standing with whom I enjoy an excellent rapport.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="234" /> I wish to clarify a point made by Deputy Ahearn, who has fled the House, concerning the position of Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  She deliberately implied that a deal had been done with regard to the retention of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the appointment of two additional Ministers of State.  That is untrue.  Our Leader, Deputy Ahern, undertook an extensive study of what was proposed by the then Deputy Bruton.  Deputy Bruton proposed that a motion would be put down, on which the House would vote, to the effect that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle had failed in his duties.  That was the only way he could have removed him from office.  Manifestly that was not so and gradually more and more people came out and said that was not so.  The appointment of two new Ministers of State, however, has nothing whatsoever to do with the much praised retention of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in his position.</P>
    <P>Speakers on the other side of the House have implied that we do not want Ministers with special responsibility for western, island and rural development or Ministers with responsibility for three Departments, as will be the case with Deputy Avril Doyle.  Both Deputy Doyle and Deputy Carey are fine parliamentarians, although Deputy Doyle will have an even more frantic life than she presently enjoys as she races from Department to Department creating great scenes of activity.  Nevertheless, Deputies Doyle and Carey are two fine representatives and we should all show approval of individual performances. However, that is not the point.  If western, island and rural development, and running between three separate Departments improving services to the public is so important, why were they not among the Taoiseach's first thoughts as he set out to appoint his Ministers of State?  He is now saying they are the most important aspects of life and this is what he wanted these fine people for, but why did he not appoint them to their positions at the outset?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> On the day Deputy Bruton was elected Taoiseach there was an understandably warm reception of him in this House.  He stated at that time: &ldquo;I want this to be a Government of public service to the people.  I want it to be a simple Government which will serve the people well&rdquo;.  He has set out on a convoluted path to do so and one of his first tasks was to create more jobs for the boys and girls.  How extraordinary. Speakers on the Government side are very good at dishing it out, but they are not very good at taking it.</P>

I do not criticise the individual personalities but the jobs they will do.</P>
      <P>Fine Gael has been seduced down the primrose path of profligacy.  They, who were the champions of fiscal rectitude on the right, are suddenly increasing the numbers of Ministers of State so that people will feel comforted.  If Fine Gael backbenchers feel disgruntled they should join a committee.  If they feel dispossessed, a quango is set up for them. If they feel they should have a job they can become a Minister of State; anything is possible when Deputy John Bruton is Taoiseach.</P>

I would venture to suggest that when the clock turns full circle and Fianna Fáil are back in Government, we will have 19 Ministers of State, because that is the inevitability of the farce we all engage in.  We had some harsh words to say about programme managers and advisers.  I still have doubts about those people who could not be elected to cross the road on their own count.  However, they are there, and no political party will cut the cord.  The likelihood is that when Fianna Fáil go back, they will add more, possibly to accommodate Deputy Martin Cullen in Waterford.</P>

      <Col N="237" /> My main objective is to raise a flag for the forgotten part of this country, that is, the Border area which has been decimated for the past 25 years because of the war that was fought on our borders. County Louth was literally consigned to hell.  Over a quarter of a century, we fell from the pinnacle of success to the abyss of disaster.  We have 32 per cent unemployment, double the national rate, and it is regrettable that accommodation was not made for a Minister for the Border region.  I exclude myself because the only ministry I would get would be in the Church of Ireland in west Cork.  However, I feel a sense of regret that Deputy Boylan, another hard-working Deputy, who is in the Chamber almost on a daily basis, was not recognised.</P>
    <P>I look askance and slightly enviously at the tears being shed for the west because the north-eastern part of Ireland has been allowed to fall into serious decay in the past 25 years.  The west has what I would describe as the hidden industry of Ireland.  It attracts thousands of tourists every year and thousands benefit from meeting the demand for bed and breakfast and the many related activities that attract tourists. I would not deny them that, but they have the beautiful scenery that the east coast does not have.</P>

      <P>Some weeks ago, when it became clear that the proper government of this State required that Fianna Fáil should leave office and make their contribution to this House from the Opposition benches, I expected that, freed of the need to protect their Ministers, the pent up energy of their long silenced backbenchers would display itself in intelligent, constructive Opposition.  From this point of view, this first outing of the party under its new Front Bench is a grave disappointment.</P>
      <P>We brought into this House a Bill which made a significant change in the structure of Government by enabling two additional Ministers of State to be appointed.  Instead of outlining in a general way the growth and complexity of governmental activity, as was done when the number of junior Ministers was increased by Fianna Fáil Governments, we set out in considerable detail the responsibilities and tasks which it is intended to assign to the new appointees and which they expect to pursue to conclusion during the remaining term of this House.  Both the importance of the task and the truncated timescale in which they have to be progressed clearly justify a reinforcement of the political element in our administrative system.</P>
      <P>What we have heard from the benches opposite is not an argument that the tasks are either unnecessary or unimportant, but repeated reiteration of newly drafted legends of rivalries within and between parties in Government. What we have seen is a return to the politics of allegation and unsupported assertion and a drawing in of every red herring which occurs to Deputies opposite rather than an attempt to evaluate our proposals or any advocacy of alternatives.</P>

      <P>This is a typical Fianna Fáil U-turn.  It is significant that almost every Opposition spokesperson acknowledges the need to undertake the work which it is proposed to assign to Deputy Carey.  Their complaint about Deputy Doyle's remit seems to focus on its extent and range, not on her ability to discharge it and not on any objection to the detailed programme of work which she outlined.  Various speakers concentrated on the undesirability of having 17 rather than 15 Ministers of State.  Notwithstanding the attention which speakers devoted to the job descriptions of the existing Ministers of State, none of them, other than Deputy Andrews, suggested any posts that could be dropped or argued that the functions intended for Deputies Carey or Doyle should be assigned to existing portfolios.  That Deputy's suggestion that western development should be tagged on to the Department of the Marine or the Department of Tourism and Trade illustrates the narrow view of the potential of the west taken by the previous regime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to put on record the background to the proposed extension to the number of Ministers of State. First, there is the question of workload. Although it may be something of a cliché to say that the business of Government has grown and continues to grow in size and complexity, this does not render the statement any less true. One has only to consider the responsibilities imposed by the ever expanding <Col N="240" /> corpus of legislation, EC regulations, the requirements of the general public and, not least, by our very ambitious programme set out in the document, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to realise that no one Minister could do justice to the full range of his or her responsibilities.</P>
    <P>There is a spirit among many political office holders which I might describe as a curious blend of stoicism and machismo. The underlying principle is that no work-load is too great for a Minister and that they should willingly take on board any accretions to their duties without demur.  We must have cop on. An overworked Minister is not only running the risk of personal burn out&mdash; as some of the Members opposite certainly suffer&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>To pretend to do so would be to deceive the public.  The functions of every Minister can generally be divided into two broad categories: first what might be described as &ldquo;core functions&rdquo; which the Minister has responsibility to handle directly; second, <Col N="241" /> there are other, often no less important, functions which may not be quite so central to the role of the Minister. Broadly speaking and allowing for inevitable exceptions, the functions which the Minister would delegate to his Minister of State would generally fall into this secondary category.</P>
      <P>The second reason relates to what I might term the &ldquo;ecology of human resources&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>A third factor is the issue of accountability.  There is an enhanced public awareness of the need for the institutions of State to be more answerable to Parliament.  This awareness has undoubtedly been heightened by the widespread concern about the issues which are under consideration by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  The ongoing development of our democracy demands that we broaden the scope of accountability.  In this regard, we are committed to the enhancement of the Oireachtas committee system.</P>

      <P>We have announced the <Col N="242" /> outline of our plans to broaden the remit of the Ombudsman and to vest in that office new statutory powers which will enable the Ombudsman to monitor and where necessary, regulate various aspects of the administrative process to ensure that the decision-making process in the public service is opened up.  The present measure, by ensuring that Members of the Oireachtas answerable to the Houses for the discharge of public business is brought to a realistic level, forms an integral part of this process of making public accountability more embracing.</P>
      <P>The final consideration is essentially political.  We are a multi-party Government. In the interests of participation and balance, there is a need to ensure that a reasonable proportion of positions of responsibility are assigned to each of the constituency parties in Government.  There is nothing dishonourable about this.  It happened before and Members opposite know that &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that some critics have asked why Ministers delegated so few functions to Ministers of State in the past.  The assumption behind this question may be false.  The formal legal mechanism whereby Ministers delegate statutory functions to their Ministers of State is a delegation of functions order made under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1977, brought in by Fianna Fáil.  An examination of the functions delegated in the past could indeed convey the impression that only a modest fraction of ministerial power seems to be delegated.  The fact is that the greater part of ministerial functions is non-statutory.  I was surprised to hear complaints from Deputy Kitt and others about Ministers of State being assigned to several Departments.  This is not a new practice, it has been the case since the early days of Ministers of State.  As <Col N="243" /> to the difficulties of coping with wider and more disparate portfolios, they did not appear to be beyond the capacity of Deputy Dempsey in the last administration &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ó Cuív and others complained that the decision to appoint a Minister with responsibility for the west was an afterthought &mdash; some weeks after the initial announcement of ministerial responsibilities.  There are two essential points in this connection.  First, the Fine Gael Party on entering Government was fully aware of the range of organisations and schemes applicable to the west and when our new office-holders took responsibility in different Departments for individual schemes they noticed a co-ordination gap, which blunted the overall effectiveness of these schemes.  Since this is a Government which intends to be responsive to identified needs, it was decided to provide co-ordination in the most politically accountable manner <Col N="244" /> possible &mdash; by providing a Minister of State for that purpose.</P>
    <P>The second point is that my party's chosen timescale for assuming the responsibility of Government would have been after the next general election. In this instance, Government was thrust upon us by the inability of those who formed the previous Government to continue their collaboration or to find even under the new Fianna Fáil leadership a basis for a new Government. While our party had defined objectives for Government, given the urgency with which a responsible and effective Government had to be provided, it was not possible for us to settle in advance of our entry into office every detail of essential changes in the machinery of Government.  It was our duty to provide good Government without delay.  We have started to provide it and the appointment of Deputies Carey and Doyle will enable us to continue to do so.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the very short time available to me I should like to highlight an issue causing great concern in regions outside main urban areas, where there is no access to third level education without the necessity for students to leave home and remain away from home.  If we are to believe what is printed in our newspapers, the proposal is that all third level students be exempt from fees, but there is no mention about anything being done <i>vis-á-vis</i> maintenance grants. In the case of those who face the costs of maintaining a third level student, or <Col N="249" /> students, away from home it can be presumed that the minimum expenditure involved &mdash; that is between travelling to the college, returning to one's lodgings and so on &mdash; is in the region of £40 to £50 per week which, to many parents, constitutes a much greater burden than the cost of university fees.</P>
    <P>What is proposed here is the creation of a two-tier society within which people earning equivalent incomes will be favoured or disfavoured, depending on where they live.  In other words, if a student lives within reach of third-level college, and it is the college of his or her choice, he or she will be exempt from fees, be able to live at home, and the cost of attending college will not be considerably dearer than attending a second-level school.  On the other hand, if one lives beyond the range of accessibility to a third-level institution, one will be exempt from fees but, on the same annual income will have to bear the huge burden of providing for a student's total needs, if one's income is above the threshold, <i>vis-á-vis</i> maintenance.</P>
    <P>To dispel a myth about rural Ireland, let us face the reality that the majority of people in rural areas are now PAYE taxpayers.  Therefore, the famous argument that to date the means-testing system in some way favoured rural areas, because it favoured farmers &mdash; which I do not believe to be necessarily true &mdash; does not stand the test.  Indeed I look forward to a full debate that will apparently now take place since we have at last received the de Buitléir report on the system of State grants for third-level courses.  I do not believe there is a bias <i>per se</i> in favour of farmers.  Perhaps, in certain circumstances, certain types of farmers can make the systems suit them but, in general, that is not necessarily true.  If one also accepts that the vast majority of people living beyond the main urban centres in which third level institutions are located, or living beyond those towns with universities &mdash; if university is their choice &mdash; are PAYE taxpayers, the proposal to direct all available resources to the implementation of exemption from fees, irrespective of <Col N="250" /> income, is totally anti-rural and favours those living within the range of such colleges. In fact it will add to the discrepancies and costs of maintaining rural societies and will do nothing in the interests of equity.</P>
    <P>There are various types of inequities within our society.  One of the greatest is the growing disparity between living costs of people on a similar income living in a rural area and living in a town. Exempting people from third level fees, irrespective of income, could lead to circumstances in which a household with an income of, say, £200,000 per annum would reap the advantage of being exempted from third level fees while another person in receipt of say, £19,000 or £20,000, gross before tax or the payment of mortgage, would be forced to pay huge maintenance costs.  All available resources should be used to help as many people as possible, to ensure that the system is devised in such a way that on an equal disposable income level people bear equal costs of putting their offspring through third-level education. That has to be the target but would not appear to be.  Rather, the easy, or publicity-seeking, way out would seem to be what is proposed which will not engender any equity in the system.</P>
    <P>I propose a step-back in regard to this matter and that we have a full Dáil debate, as was suggested by the Fianna Fáil Party and our spokesperson on education, on this issue and on the de Buitléir report, some parts of which are praiseworthy while I disagree with others.</P>

That will include the abolition of third level fees, major reform of the higher education grants scheme and in particular support for post leaving certificate courses so that, in general, the total number of third level places will be increased.  Having listened to the last speaker I wonder if he has read the report because in the appendix to it shocking cases are reported of rural families with massive assets, of perhaps £0.5 million, who qualify for grants when it is almost a miracle for people from Dublin 17 in my constituency to complete second level and go to third level.

      <P>I am proud that the campaign for free third level education originated and has its headquarters in my constituency.  I congratulate Ms Margaret Hopkins and her committee who have pursued the campaign relentlessly as one of the measures to increase access to third level education.  As the <Col N="252" /> Minister for Education, Deputy Bhreathnach, said last night, the key issue is psychological as it was in the late 1960s when the great Donogh O'Malley opened up second level education to all. We had the same &ldquo;doomsayers&rdquo; and &ldquo;naysayers&rdquo; who said it could not be done, that it would bankrupt the country etc, yet Donogh went ahead and did it.  As the Minister proudly said last night nearly 93 per cent of students are completing second level education.  My experience as a second level teacher vindicates that position.  Four or five years age 30 to 40 per cent of my students in the CBS wanted to go on to third level education, now all those students want to do so.</P>
      <P>Many crocodile tears have been shed and there has been much phoney debate on this matter.  I will consider the unholy alliance that exists.  It is made up of self-serving self-interested university lecturers and the conference of the heads of universities and people like Seán Barrett and Tom Mitchell talking about a bad piece of social engineering.  Who are those men trying to fool?  Members may recall that Tom Mitchell had the cheek not to include the huge number of places in regional technical colleges. Dublin Institutes of Technology and PLCs.  As the Minister proudly said last night, this year &mdash;&mdash;</P>

For the 68,000 who will sit the leaving certificate this year, as the Minister proudly said, there are up to 50,000 places available in third level, not just the 15,000 places in the universities, but 17,000 places in the regional technical colleges and Dublin Institutes of Technology.  Many of the courses available in those colleges are degree courses and others are diploma courses leading to degrees, and there are also 18,000 places in PLCs.  As the Minister said last night, there is already massive financial support for the third level sector, approximately £300 million. Three quarters of the funding for the seven senior colleges in the country comes from the public purse.  The abolition of third level fees is the key element in this debate.  As Mr. de Buitléir said, the present system is unfair, complicated and inefficient.  What have the three large elitist institutions in this city done for the people we represent? When I went to my <i>alma mater</i> a Dublin working class accent was almost as rare in UCD as perhaps an Irish accent is in the town of Grozny in Chechyna.</P>

      <P>The colleges have a big case to answer in terms of increasing access.  The new university in Dublin is surrounded by a wasteland of unemployment. A recent survey by the committee on the future of higher education highlighted that parts of my constituency in Dublin 17 and Dublin 13 have among the lowest take-up numbers of third level places in the country. Members may have enjoyed the famous film &ldquo;Educating Rita&rdquo; when it was shown over Christmas.  Although it may be a melodramatic metaphor for the reality of elitism in third level, it highlighted some of the problems associated with that whole sector.  Often people opposed to what the Minister has been doing try to have it both ways.  The Minister has a magnificent track record of diverting and targeting resources at first an second level.  She secured a doubling of the funding available for the primary school building programme, in excess of double the previous allocation for the secondary school building programme and launched 72 major building projects at primary level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for sharing his time with me.  I have heard that when a Member makes a first speech in the House he or she is seldom interrupted and I hoped that when someone had something worthwhile to say he or she would not be interrupted, but that does not appear to be the case.</P>
      <P>I would be able to respond more positively to this motion if it did not come from the source from which it did.  Education is very important.  I came up through a system which did not allow everybody access to third level education and I had to do without it. However, having witnessed the performance of some Members opposite, who readily admit they had the benefit of a third level education.  I probably did not miss very much.</P>
      <P>The motion in the names of Deputies Martin, Coughlan and Flood appears to have been tabled with indecent haste. Deputy Martin was no sooner appointed Front Bench spokesperson on Education &mdash; a position he had sought for a long time &mdash; than the motion was tabled.  The motion proposes that we should not have free third level education, a sentiment with which I could sympathise if it were the only proposal on reform of the education system. This proposal comes from a source which has made the headlines in nearly every local newspaper demanding that the Government &mdash; of which the Labour Party is the only old element &mdash; honour the commitment to allocate £10 million to UCC to refurbish a building which is beyond refurbishment.  That is not the type of commitment to education on which a Government should proceed. There are divided opinions on that issue as well as on the issue of fees for third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new programme for Government is a package containing many significant elements, one of which is the reduction in class sizes in primary schools, with special emphasis on areas of disadvantage. I take that to mean primary schools in Cork North Central will be <Col N="258" /> better treated.  The programme also proposes increased access to remedial, psychological and home school link services &mdash; a necessary development &mdash; and increased capitation grants for primary schools &mdash; somethings which should have been done in the past ten years, seven of which Fianna Fáil has spent in Government.  It proposes the investment of special resources in adult literacy and education schemes, a very laudable proposal.  The abolition of fees for third level education is only part of a package which extends to four pages in the document, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    <P>We must target education on an area basis and not give one school disadvantaged status while refusing it to a school across the road.  Education must be area rather than pupil targeted.</P>
    <P>Statistics prove that those with leaving certificate have a far better chance of securing a job than those without it. We cannot say we are providing free education when we charge a fee for the most compulsory examination, the junior certificate.  In that regard I sympathise with the sentiments of the motion, but I do not sympathise with the way it was proposed and presented.  Deputy Ahern, stated that Fianna Fáil would not present opposition for opposition sake, but that it would present constructive opposition.  There was nothing constructive in the debate which took place here in the past hour or so.</P>
    <P>When I speak about education I speak about a means to an end, but that does not always mean third level education. I refer to it as a means by which people can live with integrity.  Without all the other measures, we cannot continue to fund the richer sister in education. We must examine education as a whole.  If a family is bankrupted to get a student over the financial and social constraints to take up third level education how can we expect him to live on less than half he would receive from social welfare?  That is now being dealt with and this Government must continue to examine the question of education as a whole.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="259" /> Those who tabled the motion are not sincere in what they say.  They may believe what they say, but they are not sincere in how they want the proposals implemented.  If they were, they had ample opportunity to do that in the past seven years, but they did not.  They failed abysmally to address this question.</P>
    <P>I will support the Government's programme on education and I will not single out any item in it.  We must examine the question of thresholds and the possibility of increasing maintenance grants because that is the most crippling burden in the context of third level education. The Opposition should examine the Government's programme on education and note its good points.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion is timely in that it gives us an opportunity to debate these issues immediately after the publication of the de Buitléir report.  It is timely also in that the debate is taking place in advance of certain decisions being made by the Government.  From that point of view I welcome the motion, but I would be more impressed if I thought Fianna Fáil tabled it because it felt it was timely or if it was a follow up to something it had done over the past two years.  There has been no evidence over the past two years of any progress on the part of the previous Government in the areas mentioned in the motion.  The motion is opportune in the sense that it has brought the Minister's amendment before us and that has widened the debate considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before proceeding I wish to make a parenthesis.  I assure my colleague, Deputy Broughan, that when I was a student in UCD &mdash; a little time before he was there &mdash; there were plenty of Dublin accents to be heard, including mine.  There were people there, including me, who could not have afforded to be there if we had not got scholarships from Dublin Corporation.  That has given me an interest in equity and opportunity of access to third level education and in the efficient use of public <Col N="260" /> expenditure to bring that about.  I would like to see the resources available for third level education used in a way that would mean that the maximum number of children of parents on low income can have access to third level education. I fear that the emotion, some of which we have seen from Deputy Broughan this evening &mdash; I do not know what was seen from Deputy Cullen &mdash; gets in the way of looking at the implications of what is proposed.</P>
    <P>As is the cold way of people who are trained in economics.  I sat down and did the sums before getting worried about the emotions.  I looked at the cases that may arise if we abolish third level fees.</P>
    <P>I will take three cases, each of which includes a family with fewer than four dependent children, two of whom are full-time in third level institutions.  I have taken that as an example because it will be my position next autumn, all going well for my younger daughter, so I know what I am talking about.  A family with an income of less than £18,348 is now getting the full fees grant and full maintenance.  The abolition of third level fees, without anything else, will do nothing for that family.  On the the other hand, a family like mine, where the total income is in excess of £40,000 &mdash; in addition to a Deputy's salary I happen to have a ministerial pension because, wisely I think, I opted for the old system &mdash; gets no fee grant, no maintenance grant, and properly so.  The advantage to that family will be in the region of £4,000.  If that family is covenating a part of the income &mdash; 5 per cent is the maximum, £2,000, it appears as if they would stand to lose about £540.  The net benefit to that family is likely to be in the region of £3,500 or, in my situation, the equivalent of a gross increase in salary of £7,000.</P>
    <P>A family in the middle of the spectrum with four dependent children or fewer, two of whom are in full-time third level education, on an income of between £18,300 and £21,600, is getting the full fee grant and no maintenance grant.  There is no gain for that family in <Col N="261" /> the abolition of third level fees.  Contary to some of the propaganda we hear from some activists, that family is probably convenanting part of its income.  It would be sensible for such a family to use the covenanting provision although the total amount that family could covenant would be around £1,000. That family might stand to lose if it is covenanting in the region of £250 to £300.  I put it to the House that a family in that situation, on a gross income of £21,617, with two children, both of whom are in third level education are finding the shoe pinching most cruelly at this stage.  They are not getting any fee grant and the maintenance grants are not at a level that would allow such a family to face, without difficulty, the maintenance of children in third level education especially if they do not live in the city or town in which that third level institution is located.  It is in that centre group of families that one of the major problems arises.</P>
    <P>There is another problem that worries me, Deputy Broughan and a great many Deputies on all sides of the House.  The families whose incomes are in the region of £10,000 to £12,000 and who, even if the child gets a place in university or third level institution and they do not live in the town in which the institution is located, and get the full fee grant and maintenance grant, will still not be able to top up those grants at the required level.  I know of such families who live only ten or 15 miles, as the crow flies, from Maynooth in my constituency. There is no bus service from anywhere in County Kildare, other than the Leix-lip-Maynooth corridor, that goes to Maynooth.  There is one town in north Kildare from which there is a bus service to Maynooth every second Friday. It goes in one direction one second Friday and goes back in the other direction the other second Friday.  Those people might as well be living on the moon. Under the present scheme they live too near the university to get a substantial maintenance grant.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="262" /> It seems that if we have additional resources to devote to third level education we should look at how we use them in the most socially just and effective way to attain the objective of expanding, in real terms, the access particularly of children of low income families to third level education.  I can only conclude, on the basis of the analysis. I have been able to sketch out very briefly, that there are more immediate issues which would be much more effective in terms of social equity than the abolition of third level fees.  That is something I hope we can aspire to at some stage but I would not put it anywhere near the top of my agenda.  For example, I would look at maintenance grants and funding the expansion in the number of places in third level colleges in a way that would be to the benefit of people on low incomes.  Those are much more important.  I do not know what amount is being talked about.</P>
    <P>The arithmetic, as I understand it, goes something like the following.  The abolition of third level fees would cost gross about £50 million.  I was told a few months ago that the abolition of all covenants would save about £39 million. A more limited operation now being suggested would save about £20 million. The implication of that proposal is that the Minister for Education is considering the possibility of spending a net extra £30 million on third level education. I would like to see more information being presented to us on the range of things that need to be done, some of which are mentioned in the Minister's amendment to the motion, that are part of the effort to improve access to third level education and a rational debate on prioritising them.  Let us start with what will have the greatest effect for the people on the lowest income and the greatest difficulty of access.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the de Buitléir report has been published.  I hope we do not hear in the next few weeks the proposition that we have to take this report holus bolus or not at all.  Every time a report like this is published, wise people <Col N="263" /> say you cannot take the parts you like and leave out the parts you do not like. Every commission set up since time began tried to fool its customers into saying, &ldquo;you have to take all or nothing&rdquo;.  That is not what we are here for and that is not why we are elected to this House.  I like some of these recommendations.  For example, I like the idea of the grading of all the grants, whether fee grants or maintenance grants, which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>I would dearly love to see a greater proportion of the total funding for third level education being routed through the means-tested grants scheme rather than going directly in block grants to the colleges.  If we route more of the money through the means-tested scheme we will have a greater influence in favour of people who have difficulties with access. Paying 80 per cent of the total cost directly to the colleges in the form of block grants means that we make all that part of the money available to people irrespective of their means.  That is not the tenor of what we want to do.</P>
    <P>There are other issues in this report that required a good deal more examination. I cannot let the occasion pass without commending on the case histories here, some of which would bring tears from a stone.  There are many case histories not included in this report which outline even greater problems.  I find those case histories to be a very partial presentation.  To propose, for example, that all assets be taken into account when assessing means, even with the qualifications on the value of agricultural land and other matters referred to here, seems to be nonsensical. Nobody can say it is valid to ask a person who owns a small business, without owning any other realisable or liquid cash resources, to liquidate part of that business, which is the foundation of the family income, to send a child to college.  Everybody is entitled to say that if people applying for grants have access to large amounts of liquid assets or easily realisable assets, it is more than reasonable to require that they should <Col N="264" /> liquidate those.  I would like a debate that makes a distinction on properly thought out economic grounds in those regards.</P>

One would expect nothing less of Deputy Dukes than to be well researched in his contribution.  A number of Deputies referred to the de Buitléir report as the reason the Government proposes to remove fees, but that is not the case.  In many respects that report states the opposite.  For example, it states:</P>
      <P>Vertical equity requires that people who can be ranked according to some agreed measure are treated consistently in relation to that measure; in the context of a student support system for third-level education, the rate of grant given should vary from full grant support for those with low means to zero support for those with means adequate to support a student at third-level.  In essence, those who cannot afford to pay for third-level education should be supported by grants while those who are better off, and therefore able to pay, should received a lesser or zero grant.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal with two issues.  The effect of removing fees from third level education will not help one extra disadvantaged student who cannot afford, because of family circumstances, to avail of third level education.  The greatest deterrents to any family with a student attending third level education are maintenance and distance from the third level institute.  That is the reason some regions have a lower uptake of students at university.  That is an accepted fact in all reports.</P>

      <P>The Minister seems to have totally ignored the funding this country is in receipt of through the Community Support Framework, particularly the ESF.  The Minister's presumption obviously is that in 1999 when the present programme has expired we will automatically receive, at a minimum, the same level of funding under the Community Support Framework to maintain the resources available in the education area.  I put it to the Minister that that is a very unwise presumption.  If the funding available at present through the Community Support Framework is reduced, which all commentators agree is likely to be the case, what will happen in the area of third level education?  Current spending on education is in excess of £140 million and a further £177 million is being spent on training &mdash; those figures are available from the EU.  How can a Minister make a decision in those circumstances to remove the money available to universities through college fees?  This is a nonsensical step because it does not allow for extra places to be created at third level, it does not help those in the disadvantaged or lower socio-economic groups and does not overcome the greatest difficulty, that of sustaining a student at a third level institute.  The Minister has put the cart before the horse.  With the available resources she should have ensured, through the grants system, that a greater number of students at lower income levels have access to a third level college.</P>

      <P>This is the most relevent motion on education to have come before the House for some time. The Minister's proposals are an outrageous attack on the self-employed, farmers and property owners generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="269" /> People in rural areas have always placed a high value on education and many of them made sacrifices so that their children could receive an education.  This ideologically driven so-called reform Minister is a wolf in sheep's clothing for the self-employed and farmers.  If Fine Gael supports this proposal the electorate will not forgive it.  Up to one-third of farmers and business people could be disqualified if this measure goes through.  It is the same as taking the Minister's pension into account when calculating her income.</P>
    <P>Much has been said about the assessment system for the self-employed.  The Revenue Commissioners must clamp down on false claims.  I know from experience that the assessment system and criteria used in determining eligibility for a higher education grant are the severest applied by any Department. A farmer with 40 acres and four or five children who is assessed as having an income of £40,000 will be put to the pin of his collar to have a disposable income of £10,000, and this using the highest levels of production and assistance from his Teagasc adviser on how to gain the maximum income.

      <P>The Deputy, who has been given a nice job, should keep quiet.  It has been the policy of successive Governments, as proclaimed in the Constitution, to cherish all the children of the nation equally.  It is totally unacceptable to apply an asset test when determining eligibility for third level grants.  The introduction of such a test is a clear attempt to discriminate against farm families.  Farming depends on <Col N="270" /> heavy investment in assets such as land, buildings, stock and machinery.  Deputy Dukes's explanation of the consequences of using an asset test to determine eligibility for a third level grant was like a breath of fresh air.  Many self-employed families will have to sell some of their assets in order to give their children a third level education.  I know this prospect is not acceptable to Deputy Bradford who represents many farmers.</P>
      <P>Eligibility for third level education grants must be based on taxable income as acceptable to the Revenue Commissioners and it must allow for a deduction for capital investment, finance lease payments and interest on funds borrowed to finance capital investment.  While welcoming the announcement to do away with fees for all third level students, I want to stress the importance of maintenance grants. Maintenance grants are vital to the children of farm families who have to travel great distances to higher education institutions. In many cases the provision of maintenance grants is the deciding factor in whether a child attends a third level institution.  There is a simplistic view that the children of farm families get an unfair proportion of the available grant-aided college places.  Under the current scheme children from farming backgrounds are unfairly discriminated against as no allowance is given for onfarm investment, lease payments or interest paid on money borrowed to finance capital investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In deciding on reckonable income, the figure used to determine whether a child should received a grant, the current scheme does not recognise that a farmer must invest to stay in business and that such investment is not discretionary. One of the farming organisations carried out an indepth analysis of the number of third level grants awarded to the children of farm families which indicated that such children avail of significantly fewer grant-aided places than do other sectors of the population.  For example, the urban class, which includes higher and lower professional <Col N="271" /> employers, management and salaried employees, accounts for 20 per cent of the population but accounts for 46 per cent of the places in third level colleges. In contrast, the agricultural sector represents 17 per cent of the population but accounts for only 22 per cent of third level places.</P>
    <P>A means test is designed to favour those on low to moderate incomes.  An analysis of the £15,000 income threshold shows that the low to moderate income urban workers are more favoured than farmers by the current system.  Though representing 17 per cent of the population the agricultural sector receives only 19 per cent of higher education grants.  This is a grant-aided ratio of 1:1.1 and means that under the means test farmers receive only 10 per cent more of higher education grants <i>vis-ávis</i> their share of the population. However, urban classes and moderate income groups such as lower professionals and salaried employees who represent 7 per cent of the population get 11 per cent of the grants, a grant-aided ratio of 1:6.6.</P>
    <P>A cautious approach must be adopted to any proposal to remove the current tax breaks available for covenants entered into with children attending third level colleges.  Any new educational support system must take into account the thousands of students already attending third level colleges with little or no support and who currently rely on covenants with their parents for vital financial support.  Covenants are binding legal agreements normally drawn up for a minimum period of six years.  The status of these agreements must be taken into account in any new system.</P>
    <P>The Government is trying to give the impression that the self-employed are ripping off the system and is obviously trying to shelter behind the de Buitléir report while endeavouring to put its anti-rural policy in place, thus depriving the children of rural Ireland of their rightful entitlement to a third level education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>On 1 March last year I called on the Minister for Education to publish the De Buitléir report on the system of State grants for third level education. The Minister published that part of the report dealing with the issue of administration, the nuts and bolts issue of the disbursement of grants.  However, she refused to publish that part of the report which deals with the issue of grants, the students who would be eligible and the measures which should be adopted for the future.  She replied to me that she will publish the report when the recommendations have been fully considered by the Government.  She did not say which Government.  She went on to say that she will come to the House with the recommendations.  Whatever difficulties she may have had in publishing the report when she was a member of a different Government, she should have no difficulty in coming to the House with the recommendations.</P>
      <P>The Minister has finally published the full report.  However, she pre-empted discussion on it by her announcement last July &mdash; this is hardly surprising given some of the unpalatable findings of the report that she would introduce free third level education during the lifetime of the Government.  This was a very attractive prospect, particularly for those of us who hope that our offspring will gain entrance to third level education in the next few years.  Like Deputy Dukes, I wonder if I should be a beneficiary of such largesse.</P>
      <P>When I tried to establish what the proposals from the Departments of Education and Finance really meant there was silence and populist rhetoric. There were no details available on how the extra places implicit in the promise would be provided.  I was very taken with Deputy Duke's cogent argument about those people who, because of a very low income, qualify for full maintenance support but who are completely excluded from third level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In her speech here yesterday evening, the Minister again spoke in aspirational <Col N="273" /> terms of mechanisms to increase participation by third level students from low income backgrounds, including the abolition of third level fees &mdash; comprehensive reform of the higher education grants scheme, the introduction of support for students on post leaving certificate courses and an increase in the number of third level places &mdash; long on aspiration, short on detail.  The Minister says that the commitment to free third level education means she is pledged to introduce a fairer system of third level funding for all students.</P>
    <P>The Minister latches on to one part of the de Buitléir report which recommends that the system of convenanting income to children at college should be abolished.  The £20 million saving on income tax allowance from that is what the Minister is seizing upon.  Obviously, there is a popular appeal inherent in having free third level education, but, as has been pointed out, if this happens, nearly all, if not all, of the funds available to improve access to higher education will be used up.  Where will the Minister find the funds to improve maintenance grants for needy students, or the post leaving certificate area, which has no grant support at present?</P>
    <P>The de Buitléir report makes a strong, uncontestable argument for capital assets to be taken into account in assessing eligibility for higher education grants on the grounds that it is reasonable that those who have the wealth should be able to fund education.  These are the type of points we should be debating.  We all know that the middle income groups, in particular PAYE earners, have been squeezed out of the system. We should, in a full debate in this House, examine the de Buitléir proposals to see if, indeed, the measures promoted in the report would redress the imbalance and the inequity, especially as far as those who are on fixed salaries are concerned &mdash; the teachers, gardaí, nurses and so on, who are the hard-pressed PAYE workers.</P>
    <P>One thing is certain from the report &mdash; there are gross inequities in the system as it stands and we all acknowledge <Col N="274" /> that.  Perhaps Deputy Dukes did not like the case histories but they are damning and underpin the widely held view that it is unfair that someone whose father has assets of over £200,000 can be eligible for grants while another applicant, whose parents' income is marginally over the £16,544 limit, gets nothing.</P>
    <P>During a discussion on the whole question of assets with my colleagues, Deputy Quill, she pointed out that she knows people who have mortgaged the family home so that their children might receive third level education.  I have little sympathy for those in the wealthy classes.</P>
    <P>One worrying feature, in addition to what I have already outlined, is that there is no acknowledgement by the Minister of the difficulties faced in the wider area of education.  As yet we do not even enjoy free primary education. Every parent knows that they will be involved in either so-called voluntary subscriptions or fund raising &mdash; education funded by cake sales.  There is an absolute priority in ensuring that primary education is truly free to parents and children.</P>
    <P>A recent report by the INTO confirmed that lack of books and supplies to schools in disadvantaged areas was seriously undermining the quality of education.  Another recent survey by the ESRI confirmed what we already know &mdash; that those with the lowest levels of education are bearing most of the burden of unemployment and that those who are poorly educated have little chance of breaking out of the poverty trap.  In a catch 22 situation, those within the poverty trap have the least chance of a high standard of education. For example, the Inner City Teacher's Group have called on the Minister to help, asking that if £50 million is available in the education budget, it should be spent on poorer children at primary level, not on free third level education. That is an argument we should at least debate.</P>
    <P>Other bodies have views on this also. The Education Commission of the Conference of Religious of Ireland called on <Col N="275" /> the Government not to proceed with the abolition of third level fees because it would represent a major reversal of stated Government policy which it says is to give priority to breaking the link between education and poverty and to tackle the regressive nature of Exchequer spending on education.</P>
    <P>The Commission says there is now overwhelming evidence that children who are poor are least likely to benefit from their schooling and that, as a result, they are destined to remain poor and marginalised in the future unless specific policies aimed at reversing the situation are successfully adopted.  It is known, for example, that 80 per cent of those who leave school with no qualifications are from working class or small farm families &mdash; the figure is 50 per cent where the father is unemployed.  At the other end of the scale, young people from low socio-economic backgrounds are grossly under-represented in third level institutions, especially universities, where their participation rate is approximately 3 per cent.  In addition, upper middle class young people are at least six times more likely to receive third level education than those from lower working class backgrounds.</P>
    <P>The Commission further contends that the extent of social inequalities is exacerbated by the fact that educational spending is highly regressive because an analysis of recent Department of Education financial reports reveals that the State spends at least twice as much on the education of third level graduates, predominantly from middle and upper class backgrounds, as it does on the education of early school leavers, predominantly from working class backgrounds.</P>
    <P>The abolition of fees, according to this group, would do little or nothing to increase the participation rates of those who are grossly under-represented in third level colleges, namely, young people from unskilled and semi-skilled backgrounds, and I wish Deputy Broughan was in the House to hear that. The vast majority of people from these backgrounds have their fees paid <Col N="276" /> through one of the existing student support schemes if they qualify for, and decide to take up, a place in third level education.  It seems likely that if there is a financial barrier to participation of young people from lower socio-economic backgrounds, it arises from the inadequacy of the maintenance element of the existing student support schemes. I am sure we are all agreed on that.</P>
    <P>Any debate on education must have an integrated package of measures with particular emphasis on strategies which focus on a child's early years and which forge partnerships between school, home and the wider community.</P>
    <P>Apart from all that, we should examine the situation in the universities. They can only accommodate 18 per cent of the school leaving population.  They can only accommodate 30 per cent of demand for places and thousands of well qualified students are denied entry to university education every year.  Free fees, as the Minister describes them, will not do anything for this problem &mdash; the opposite is the case.  A recent report stated there will be a freeze on college intake next year, in spite of increased demand.  The universities, naturally, want to know what provision is being made for the expectation that will be created for students about the availability of college places.  They would say that capital funding is needed &mdash; this has fallen from £11,000 per additional student in 1982 to £1,950 in 1993.</P>
    <P>To their credit, the universities have reduced their dependency on public funding to below 50 per cent of their cost.  One concern is that underfunding will result in more dependence by the universities with a consequent reduction of autonomy.  Many will ask if the same outcome will be achieved as happened with the abolition of rates in 1977?  The rate support grant was supposed to provide for the shortfall but, as all of us involved in local government know, that is not the case.  The rate support grant is only at some 30 per cent of the original amounts.  What will happen and who will decide the substitute payments to universities?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="277" /> If I was a naïve politician I would believe that the initial purpose of this motion was to force the Government into publishing the de Buitléir report but, I welcome the fact that the report has at long last been published.  I ask that we have the opportunity to debate it in full.  I regret, however, that the Minister to some extent pre-empted any debate by her announcements last year. What would be the point of having an empty debate with the pretence of attention by a Minister?</P>

      <P>Much of what has taken place over the past two nights could be described as &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo; politics.  Having been in Government up to a few weeks ago, Fianna Fáil has tabled a motion which, but for the amendment, would not make sense.  It is criticising the Government because of the contents of a report commissioned by a Fianna Fáil majority Government and is trying to peddle this report as a Government measure in certain sectors.  That will not wash with the public.  Fianna Fáil was in Government for almost eight years &mdash; on its own, with the Progressive Democrats and then with the Labour Party.  Now, suddenly, after three weeks in Opposition, it has tabled this motion.  I am not sure what it is about but it does not credit to this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contributions to this debate and the issues raised have shown the serious interest both inside and outside this house in our third level education system which currently involves some 88,000 students and their families.  The <i>Government of Renewal</i> policy agreement outlines the Government's commitment to promoting greater access to third level education.  The policy agreement gives a commitment to new support mechanisms to increase participation by third level students from low-income backgrounds including the abolition of third level fees.  A comprehensive reform of the higher education <Col N="278" /> grants scheme, the introduction of support for students on post-leaving certificate courses and an increase in the number of third level places.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate so far a number of issues have been raised to which I would like to respond.  As the Minister for Education has already indicated, this Government is anxious within available Exchequer resources to increase maintenance grants and income thresholds.  The case for improving the support mechanisms to increase participation by third level students from low income backgrounds is very strong.  However, I would stress that it is important that the fundamental inequities within the system be addressed and the initial step in this regard is the proposed abolition of fees.</P>
    <P>In this context, however, I would point out that the current income thresholds make provision for each child after the first in third level, contrary to a view expressed in this House yesterday. The income limits may be increased by increments of £2,000 for each child after the first in third level.</P>
    <P>The issue of delays within the system was raised by Deputy Coughlan.  In 1994 the third level student support schemes were issued to the awarding bodies at the end of April 1994 as against mid-August in 1993, something that my party highlighted.  This was in line with a previous commitment of the Minister and allowed an additional three months for processing grant applications in 1994.  It is envisaged that a similar timescale for issue of the grants schemes will be met in 1995.  Any delays encountered by Deputy Coughlan should be raised with her local authorities.</P>
    <P>The position of Irish students living in the UK and other EU countries was addressed in the Advisory Committee's report.  The committee recommended that subject to appropriate quality control, courses abroad should be covered for maintenance grants and fees grants if payable, if there is not a similar course available in Ireland.  It was envisaged that this should happen as resources become available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="279" /> On the topic of access, the Minister has initiated or expanded measures to help the education of disadvantaged groups; these actions should enhance the participation of such groups in third level education in due course.  They include providing 206 remedial teachers at primary and post-primary level over the past two years; a special initiative to improve the pupil-teacher ratio in disadvantaged areas; a home/school liaison scheme; and early start pre-school programme; allevation of fees in hardship cases for certificate examinations; the introduction of free book grant schemes; and a hardship fund at third level.</P>
    <P>The national plan includes a provision of £120 million under the European Regional Development Fund programme for third level capital investment for the period up to 1999.</P>
    <P>The proposed abolition of third level fees is part of a comprehensive package of support mechanisms to increase participation of students from all socio-economic groups in third level courses.</P>
    <P>This package will have a major psychological significance on the attitude of students and their aspirations for further education.  This Government is fully committed to ensuring that income eligibility limits and maintenance grants will also be increased within available resources.</P>
    <P>I support the steps already taken and the further measures proposed by this Government to improve access to third level education.</P>

      <P>What I have to say relates primarily to my area of responsibility.  I should like to touch briefly on Deputy Duke's theme with regard to his desire to see more social equality, and to make some suggestions to the Minister.  Some speakers have already expressed the <Col N="280" /> desire that any additional resources available within the education budget should be spent on dealing with areas of disadvantage.  One cannot take the question of education at any particular level on its own because third level institutions depends on the primary and second level system for their supply of students and are dramatically affected by the quality of students coming through that system.</P>
      <P>How would the abolition of fees affect the travelling community, one of the most disadvantaged groups in our society?  There are approximately 5,000 travellers children here at the moment.  It is suggested, although I cannot find any definite information on this, that about 4,000 of the traveller children attend special schools, special classes or ordinary primary classes.  Very few of them progress to second level education but drop out of the system as they progress through the primary sector.  Of those who enter the second level sector very few manage to get their leaving certificate, and few if any find their way successfully into third level education &mdash; that is not to say there are none in third level.  This has nothing to do with the specific abilities of these children.  It has to do with their extreme disadvantage in trying to enter the school system.  If finance is available in the education budget, some of it should be targeted not just towards providing classes or additional teachers but towards providing back-up facilities.  There is no point in providing the means whereby traveller children can enter primary and second level schools if we do not support them socially.  It is impossible for a child of the travelling community to complete socially with the children of the settled community.  It is impossible for a child of the traveller community to leave a halting site or an unauthorised site at the side of the road and successfully enter school and remain there unless there are additional facilities apart altogether from the special teaching facilities that might be required.  I suggest that the Minister seriously consider this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> I accept that the Minister has made substantial progress in her Department during her tenure of office in the Government of which Fianna Fáil was a member, but I would like to see her efforts zeroing in, in a specific and determined way, on areas of disadvantage before taking decisions to target additional moneys at people who could well do without it.</P>
    <P>We read in tonight's <i>Evening Herald</i> that some of our primary schools are in appalling condition, one school referred to in the article is 100 years old and has broken windows and doors, the children come to it hungry and obviously cannot address themselves to their lessons. They are neither properly fed nor clothed, with clothing that is totally unsuitable for the weather.  I do not think the Minister for Education can ignore these areas and I am not suggesting the present Minister would.  Therefore, I suggest that she diverts the additional funding available to her from the top end of the scale &mdash; I do not mind the Minister improving the threshold for grant aid or improving the maintenance grant &mdash; and target it at the areas to which I have referred specifically.</P>
    <P>The Minister has to respond also to the needs of special schools, including schools to accommodate young offenders.  None of us want to see places of detention for young people who fall foul of the law but such facilities have to be provided.  In recent years we have seen instances where the courts have sent young people to centres that are under the control of the Minister for Education but, unfortunately, there is no place at the inn and the youngsters have to be released again.  I am not talking about secure centres or specifically about detention centres but school settings for youngsters who have difficulties of one kind or another.  In my opinion we should be able to provide enough places to accommodate them so that we do not have to say to the courts there is no place so the youngster has to be released again.</P>

      <P>Regardless of what people say about primary education there are children who cannot gain access to primary education.  That is an extraordinary situation.  A number of young children, not a large number, in my constituency who because of behavioural problems and so on cannot gain admittance to primary school.  They may have attended school for a number of years but then things went wrong in their life.  There may have been problems at home over which they had no control and because of their behaviour they were not accommodated in a primary school.  I have cases on my files of individuals who cannot be accommodated at primary school and they are left at home or wandering the streets.</P>
      <P>I know the Minister has compassion for children with such problems and that she has achieved a great deal already in her term of office.  I suggest that in the context of this timely debate, contrary to what Deputy Lynch said, resources be diverted from the third level sector to the pre-school, primary and second level sectors.  Resources would be well spent in that area and I suggest the Minister look at that rather than giving resources to people who admit they can do without them.</P>

      <P>When I opened this debate last evening I expressed the hope that it would be the beginning of a more open, comprehensive, informed and inclusive discussion on the issues pertaining to third level grants and fees.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party has endeavoured to be constructive in the debate and cover a broad range of issues &mdash; as manifest by the excellent contribution of Deputy Flood on his special area of responsibility &mdash; and give a clear illustration of the ongoing needs and demands on very scarce resources for education.  We call for a debate in this House on the de Buitléir report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the formation of this Government the Taoiseach in his opening address spoke about the need to make this House more relevant to the people.  He spoke of his aspiration to give the <Col N="283" /> Deputies in this House a greater say and involvement in the formulation of ideas and policy and of his wish to involve Members in such issues.  It seems, therefore, that the Government should agree and must be agreeable to have this report debated in the House before any fundamental decision is taken.  Deputy Keogh asked if the Minister will listen or if she has her mind made up already. This matter should be debated because I want the many Deputies who approached me and expressed their views and concerns about this report to have the opportunity to articulate those views in this House.  They are the representatives of the people and the will of the people should always be articulated in the national parliament.</P>
    <P>Our basis position is that we want an immediate improvement in the lot of third level education students and that is why we tabled the motion on improving the means test.  I am disappointed at the Government's lack of commitment to increasing the maintenance grants. Deputy Allen's speech, although he did not get to this point, refers to the aspirations to increase the maintenance grant within available resources.  We have the strange situation where on the one hand we are told that fees will be abolished and that we may not witness the increase in maintenance grants or the means thresholds.</P>

      <P>We must get cast iron guarantees and a commitment from the Government that those needs will be delivered upon.  The guarantees given yesterday for PLC students relate to fees and not to maintenance grants but the critical issue for PLC students is maintenance and not fees.  In fact in some vocational education committee PLC students are not charged fees so let us not do a con job with the 16,000 to 17,000 PLC students.  Their demand is for maintenance because very often they have either to travel or stay away from home to avail of this new developing third tier of education.  They will not be satisfied with some woolly commitment on fees.  They want decent maintenance grants and I hope they will be forthcoming.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cullen made a very important point also on his area of responsibility, European affairs.  Have we any long term strategic plan in place to deal with the problems that may arise post-1999 when in all probability we will not receive the same level of European funding that we receive at present in the context of our education and training systems?  We receive vast sums on an annual basis to support our educational infrastructure, FAS and the various manpower policies.  What is to happen post 1999?  Before we take major decisions on reducing the resources to universities and so forth, in terms of abolishing fees, it is important that we have in place a long term strategy.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dukes made a very significant contribution this evening and his examples were a good illustration of how the abolition of fees in themselves will not benefit people on low incomes. As an economist, his examples are ones that the Minister should seriously consider. It is quite obvious that on the Government side there are alternative views on this issue.  We should be prepared always to listen to good arguments put by various interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had a great deal of consultation in the education debate, the national convention and so forth, consultation <Col N="285" /> is one thing but it is more important to try to build a consensus on the way forward instead of trying to impose one's own vision of the situation. I would look for greater consensus on this issue and I think the interests involved should be consulted on what is best for the future of third level education and for a more socially progressive education system, which genuinely seeks to improve the participation rates of students not only at third level but at <Col N="286" /> second level.  Contrary to earlier comments it is a fact that 23 per cent of students are leaving our school system before attaining the leaving certificate qualification.  We need to improve the level of academic achievement and participation at second level, never mind third level.  We can only do that if we invest heavily in the pre-school and primary schools sectors.  I hope we will have a debate on the de Buitléir report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ChrisFlood" hpid="Mr. Flood Mr. Flood">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flood</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving me an opportunity to raise this important matter this evening.  I thank especially the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, for having come into the House to take this business.</P>
      <P>On 1 October 1992 former Minister for Health, Deputy Dr. John O'Connell, implemented the provisions of section 5 of the Child Care Act, 1991, which places responsibility on each health board to provide suitable accommodation for homeless children.</P>
      <P>Regrettably, in recent years there has been a growing tendency on the part of the Eastern and other health boards, to place homeless children in bed and breakfast accommodation.  I would not say this should never happen; of course, it can happen in extreme emergencies, but it should not become the norm. Recent figures available to me suggest that the numbers of young people being placed in bed and breakfast accommodation are increasing and that the duration of their stay is also lengthening. For example, in 1991, the average length of stay of homeless children in bed and breakfast accommodation was 8.7 nights which figure had risen, by 1993, to 26.3 nights.  It is inappropriate that such accommodation should be used and become part of the established response to homeless children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The out-of-hour service for homeless children I established in the Eastern Health Board region when serving as Minister of State in the Department of Health has been run very effectively but it cannot be effective from 8 p.m. until 6 a.m. if sufficient emergency places are not available to accommodate young people who, for a variety of reasons, are homeless and in need of attention.  The voluntary sector has always played an <Col N="289" /> important role in the provision of accommodation for homeless young people.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the greater Dublin region.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the difficulty that has arisen in the hostel in Ballymun which was established by Fr. McVerry in response to a need in 1983.  There are complexities because people under the age of 18 covered by the Child Care Act are accommodated there as are people over 18 who, in terms of accommodation, are the responsibility of the Department of the Environment.  I understand there are complex issues to be tackled, but I am disappointed that it appears that relationships between the Eastern Health Board, the landlords of the hostel, Dublin Corporation, and the local residents' association seem to have deteriorated in recent times.  I understand in the past there was a commitment by the Eastern Health Board to provide accommodation in the greater Ballymun area for young homeless boys who, in a crisis in their community, would not necessarily have to be plucked out of it and moved away from it, their families and schools.  The proposed project in the past was Geralds-town House and I am disappointed to note that it appears that facility is not yet in place.  Consequently, there is an evident need for Fr. McVerry's hostel to continue operating.  I would prefer if it were in a better location and had more broadly based support from the Eastern Health Board and Dublin Corporation. It is a fundamental part of the voluntary sector which has always played a substantial role in addressing this issue in the greater Dublin area.  I call on the Minister to use his influence and good offices to resolve the difficulty that appears to exist between the operator of the hostel and the statutory agencies to which I referred and to put in place and develop, through the resources made available by the former Minister for Health, Deputy Howlin, a proper facility within the greater Ballymun area for young homeless boys under the age of 18 who, unfortunately, are homeless on a temporary or long-term basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>: I understand the concerns of the Thomas McDonagh Residents' Association in relation to the fact that a flat in the McDonagh Tower, Ballymun, is being used to provide accommodation for homeless males, adults and boys.  I accept that this is probably not the most suitable location for this type of activity.</P>
      <P>I do not think it would be appropriate for me to intervene in what is essentially a housing allocation matter for the local authority, Dublin Corporation.  I understand that the flat was made available to Fr. McVerry by Dublin Corporation and that the Eastern Health Board had no role in the matter.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board has of course, as Deputy Flood pointed out, a role to play in relation to the provision of suitable accommodation for homeless boys, those under 18 years.  During the last two years a range of improvements in services for homeless children has been approved as part of a package of developments funded from the additional moneys made available for the Child Care Act.  These include: additional funding for Focus Point &ldquo;Off the Streets&rdquo; project to provide accommodation for &ldquo;difficult to place&rdquo; youngsters; additional funding for Eccles Street hostel to increase places from 12 to 14; provision of funding for a boys' hostel at Botanic Road, Glasnevin; funding for accommodation for adolescent girls at the Salvation Army, Eden Quay; funding for a new Street-line Hostel, North Circular Road &mdash; four places; carers for young people scheme involving the selection of 50 families who will be trained to care for and manage difficult adolescents; the development of an eight place special therapeutic unit which will cater for children with behavioural problems who require intensive care and the development and expansion of foster care services including the recruitment of an additional 30 foster places.  This will facilitate the transfer to family settings of children currently in residential care.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="291" /> The Eastern Health Board, in conjunction with the child care policy unit of my Department, is currently involved in the formulation of plans for the further development of child care services, including services for the young homeless, in the context of the additional moneys to be made available for child care during 1995.</P>
    <P>As part of this process the Eastern Health Board is in the process of examining the provision of services for young homeless in Community Care Area 7, which includes Ballymun.  I understand that while the board considers an additional hostel is required, the location of such a facility remains to be determined.  In this context it is important to bear in mind that the homeless persons offered accommodation by Fr. McVerry are drawn from around the city and not necessarily from the Ballymun area.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Eastern Health Board that it does not regard itself as being in dispute with the residents' association on this issue and is willing to meet their representatives to discuss their concerns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very concerned about the alleged interference by the Minister in the day-to-day operation of a State-aided board made in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 22 January 1995.  The article was headed &ldquo;Minister ordered confidential files to be removed from Dublin office&rdquo; and another read, &ldquo;Taylor's interference sparks legal board row&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Will the Minister for Equality and Law Reform confirm that on the days leading up to last Christmas a senior member of his departmental staff, under his direction, called to the Dublin headquarters of the Legal Aid Board when the chief executive and the assistant chief executive were absent and removed files?  Will the Minister confirm also that that official subjected <Col N="292" /> Legal Aid Board staff to questioning which continued late into the evening and that his departmental official ordered members of the staff not to discuss what had happened or what was said to their superiors in the Legal Aid Board?  Will he confirm that it is his view, as expressed on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; last Monday that the Legal Aid Board is not independent in the exercise of its functions under the civil legal aid scheme?  Will the Minister further acknowledge that this action by him constitutes a gross and unwarranted political interference in the internal affairs of an independent board?</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister not raise his concerns with the Chairman or the chief executive of the board or was it not a simple matter to inquire from the Legal Aid Board the basis on which the appointment was made?  I understand the appointment was fully above board and in keeping with the best practice. Did the Minister not consider the embarrassment which his action might cause to the woman who got the job and to the members of the board?  I consider the key question is whether the Minister knew that an instruction was issued by his Department to an official to order staff in the Legal Aid Board not to disclose to their superiors what had happened or what was said during the inquiry.  Did the Minister issue the instruction, approve of the steps taken or know what had been done?  If he did, then he is gravely at fault in undermining the independence of this important board which has had widespread support. The very least he should do in the circumstances is to apologise to the board and to the House.  I invite the Minister to reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy's information is based on reports in a newspaper on Sunday last, 22 January 1995, which allege interference by me with the Legal Aid Board's independence.  While matters about staffing in general were raised in <Col N="293" /> that press report the Deputy's concerns, it would seem, are with that part of the press report which relates to the inquiry which I established to answer queries which unions representing law centre solicitors &mdash; MSF and SIPTU &mdash; had about the appointment made by the board to the post of solicitor-in-charge in Monaghan.  The House will appreciate that since that inquiry is still ongoing I am constrained to some extent in what I can say at this stage.  Nevertheless, I will try to be as informative as possible and let the House know at least the background to the problem and what I have done so far to allay concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Once the unions raised their concerns it fell to me, as Minister responsible to the House for the scheme of civil legal aid and advice, to ensure that the Monaghan appointment had accorded with necessary procedures.  I think it is unarguable that the staff represented by the unions, persons who competed in the competition from which the appointment was made, the public and the House would demand that I should be in a position to establish the facts.  I set about doing so by directing the Secretary of my Department to ask the chief executive of the board by letter, dated 21 December 1994, for the file dealing with the competition and appointments made from it.  The board was also informed about my directive. The chief executive made the necessary arrangements for handing over the files on 22 December 1994 in his absence on leave and the absence on official duties of one of his senior assistants.  A senior official of my Department took delivery of the files on that day with the co-operation of staff in the board's headquarters. In handing over the files it was necessary for the senior official to question staff on a voluntary basis about the papers given to him with a view to ensuring that the papers fully reflected the board's position.  Staff were asked by the official not to disclose to anyone the content of the discussions they individually had with him.  The press report indicates that staff were instructed by the official not to talk to anyone about <Col N="294" /> his visit.  That was plainly not the case since the visit was arranged between the secretary and the chief executive with the knowledge of the board.  There was nothing secretive about the purpose of the visit and the need of the Minister to establish the facts surrounding the Monaghan appointment.  The work started at 1 p.m. and finished at 8 p.m.</P>
    <P>Following consultation with the Department of Finance, a former Secretary of the Department of Labour, Mr. Michael Keegan, is in the process of conducting an independent review of the case.</P>
    <P>The board has total independence in giving legal aid or advice under the scheme.  However, the scheme requires the board to give me such information as to the performance of its functions as I may from time to time request.  I must also point out that while the board has power to engage staff, the numbers of staff, their grading, pay and conditions and method of appointment is subject to my approval, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Moreover, if any contract entered into by the board gives rise to a course of action as a result of which the payment of costs or damages falls to be made by the board or by an individual board member, it is open to me as Minister to direct that such costs or damages be paid out of the fund under which the board operates.</P>
    <P>Exchequer funding to the board in 1994 was £4.97 million, an increase of 56 per cent over 1993 funding.  Authorised staff numbers in 1994 doubled over 1993 numbers.</P>
    <P>I do not consider that it can seriously be suggested that the Legal Aid Board is so independent in the exercise of all its functions that I could not question and find out what the board's position was regarding the Monaghan appointment.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset the investigation is still underway.  When Mr. Keegan has completed his report I shall be glad to inform the House and all interested parties about the outcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret I was not given an opportunity to raise this matter last evening because in the meantime the Minister has issued a statement saying he intends putting an underwater heritage order on the <i>Lusitania</i> wreck concerned. I understand there has been panic in the Minister's office since I submitted this question last Monday afternoon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a shame that until now nothing practical has been done to protect the <Col N="296" /> wreck of the <i>Lusitania.</i> The content of the question I submitted to the House is not correct.  I stated that the <i>Lusitania</i> is lying on the seabed off the Old Head of Kinsale whereas it is lying about ten miles west of the village of Butlerstown in west Cork.</P>
    <P>My late mother heard the explosion when the ship was sunk on 7 May 1915, she was attending school in the nearby village of Courtmacsherry.  When she reached the area only minutes later the <i>Lusitania</i> had sunk with the loss of more than 1,100 lives.  It was well known even then that the huge liner contained a large quantity of gold bullion, now estimated at £170 million.  It was also speculated at that time that Sir Hugh Lane, Director of the National Gallery, had on the voyage three very valuable paintings, one by Monet and two by Rubens. This bags the question why a serious effort was not made previously to recover those treasures.  I believe there was also a consignment of industrial diamonds on board.</P>
    <P>Apparently unauthorised diving teams have been going down to the wreck in recent years and months and there is a strong suspicion that very valuable items, such as those to which I referred, have been removed.  What does the Minister's order mean?  Why was it not made sooner?  I believe it was made under the provisions of the Merchant Shipping (Salvage and Wrecks) Bill, 1993 or under the provisions of some other legislation.  How does the Minister intend investigating the wreck and recovering the treasures and artefacts, if they are still there?  I read in a newspaper article last week that a wealthy businessman in America has a set of golf clubs made from one of the propellers of the <i>Lusitania.</i> It appears the ship has been well ravaged by diving teams. Why was action not taken last June when, according to <i>The Sunday Press</i> one of the people claiming ownership of the wreck &mdash; Mr. Bemis of New Mexico &mdash; complained to the Director of Public Prosecutions that he has a right to the wreck.  He is contesting its ownership and complained about the illegal <Col N="297" /> removal of artefacts from it.  Why was action not taken at the time he lodged his complaint?  Apparently major damage was done and artefacts removed between the months of June and August.  Can the Minister say why action was not taken?  It may be too late as the treasures may have been taken at this stage.</P>
    <P>The wreck lies 11.8 miles off the Irish coast.  Surely it belongs to the nation.  I am at a loss to understand why a court battle about ownership is being fought in America, in Norfolk, Virginia by Mrs. Muriel Light and the said Mr. Greg Bemis.  Why have those people a right to the ownership of this wreck when it is in Irish territorial waters?  I hope the Minister can clarify some of these matters. I hope he can find out as soon as possible if the artefacts are still on or near the wreck and if they have been removed, what he intends to do and how he intends to recover them?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will try in the limited time available to me to answer as many of the questions as I can for Deputy Deasy, to whom I am grateful for raising this important issue.</P>
      <P>I am sure all Members of the House are aware of the extensive newspaper and other media coverage regarding the removal of artefacts from the wreck of the <i>Lusitania.</i> My Department, in consultation with a number of other Departments are investigating these reports with a view to establishing the current position accurately, to determine what actions are necessary, and to take the immediate necessary actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should stress that the discovery of a relatively recent wreck such as the <i>Lusitania</i> is not in the same category as, say, the discovery of an ancient Viking ship which would have no known owner.  In the case of any wreck and associated artefacts with no known owner the State has asserted its right of ownership, a right established through the National Monuments Acts, and explicitly set out in the recently enacted National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1994.  While I <Col N="298" /> understand there is a dispute in the American courts regarding the ownership of the wreck of the <i>Lusitania</i>, it seems apparent that a clear claim to ownership should be established eventually through these courts so that it is unlikely that the question of State ownership of the wreck should arise.</P>
    <P>The question of ownership of possessions of passengers or the cargo on board not pertaining to the wreck should be seen as a separate issue, even if more complex, involving the establishment of clear ownership, succession rights and salvage rights.</P>
    <P>Perhaps of most interest to this House is the report referred to by Deputy Deasy that Sir Hugh Lane, who was lost when the vessel was sunk, had a number of valuable paintings with him on board and that these paintings were protected sufficiently to withstand serious damage from the sea over all these years.  If the reports are true then these paintings may form part of Sir Hugh Lane's bequest to the National Gallery.</P>
    <P>Taking all these matters into account I have now decided that there are two clear immediate objectives to be met in this case.  First, there is an immediate need to protect the wreck from further unregulated tampering to ensure that the State's interest in both the paintings, if they exist, and in other artefacts with no known owner is protected and, secondly, to establish if a painting or any other artefact in which the State may have an interest has been removed and, if so, to take every step possible to recover the material.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works advised me yesterday that it would be appropriate to place an Underwater Heritage Order on the site of the wreck.  I have accepted this advice and asked that office to proceed with issue of the order. This has now been done and comes into effect immediately.</P>
    <P>An underwater heritage order is an order of the Commissioners for Public Works which, in the main, prohibits diving within, or other interference <Col N="299" /> with the site of a wreck or object of historical, archaeological or artistic importance on the sea bed.  The protection afforded is extensive.  A member of the Garda Síochána may without warrant seize and detain any equipment which he reasonably believes is being used in the commission of an offence, found in, at, or in the vicinity of the site of the wreck; and the seized equipment would be liable to forfeiture upon conviction for contravention of the prohibition. The maximum penalties on conviction on indictment are £50,000 and/or five years imprisonment.</P>
    <P>This order and the accompanying enforcement powers will ensure that no legal dives on the site will take place except under and in accordance with a licence issue by the Office of Public Works.  If such dives are permitted the licence can be issued subject to conditions that ensure adequate protection. I am satisfied that the measures agreed by me with the Commissioners should ensure that no material will be removed from the jurisdiction without authorisation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second objective to discover the facts concerning the reports that some material, including a painting in which the State might have an interest, may already have been illegally removed, I assure the House that investigations are under way and <Col N="300" /> that this investigation involves a number of Departments.</P>
    <P>The measures I have taken will immediately ensure that the wreck is protected.  I have instituted inquiries with all the other relevant Departments in relation to tracing any objects that may have been removed.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Deasy for raising this issue.  There are matters being discussed in another jurisdiction but I would draw the Deputy's attention again to a distinction I made.  There is the issue of ownership of the wreck, the issue of ownership of possessions of those who were passengers and there are also salvage rights.  This matter was brought to my attention last week and I was interested in its coverage in the newspapers over the weekend.  I moved to act immediately to ensure that both the national interest in the wreck and any benefit to the Irish State from the Hugh Lane bequest would be assured.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 and 20 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's programme makes clear its commitment to firm management of the public finances.</P>
      <P>In particular, the Government has accepted the fiscal criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty: the annual General Government Deficit will be no more than 3 per cent of GDP, which roughly translates to an Exchequer Borrowing Requirement of less than 3 per cent of GNP and Ireland will continue to make progress in reducing the debt/GDP ratio towards 60 per cent.</P>
      <P>The implementation of all the economic and social measures to which we are committed in the programme is dependent on achievement of these targets.</P>
      <P>The current expenditure targets, namely, a 6 per cent increase in 1995 and an average annual rate of 2 per cent in real terms over the following two years, were included in the programme, firstly, to underline the Government's general approach to budgetary policy and, secondly, to set a specific target which will ensure that the fruits of economic growth would be used for tax reform, as well as for improvement in public services.</P>
      <P>The setting of targets that allow for reasonable expansion in expenditure on goods and services offers a real prospect, given the likely level of economic growth and inflation, that the Government will have sufficient resources available for tax reform.  We are determined that such reform will promote employment opportunities and encourage enterprise in the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 32 together.</P>
      <P>Irish residents are taxed on their worldwide income wherever it arises. Irish residents who are cross-Border workers are, therefore, liable for tax on their income accruing in Northern Ireland.  Under the 1976 Double Taxation Agreement with the UK, however, cross-Border workers are given credit on their tax liability in the country of residence for tax paid in the country of work.  As some rates of taxation are higher in the Republic than in the UK this in effect means that cross-Border workers resident in the South are liable for some Irish taxation in addition to UK taxation.  This is in accordance with the general practice adopted by most member states of the European Union in regard to foreign income earned by residents.  However, some member states have included in their double taxation agreements provisions in regard to frontier workers and in the majority of these cases taxation is based only in the country of residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position here is that, except where the PRSI allowance applies, a <Col N="124" /> cross-Border worker pays exactly the same amount of income tax and levies as another Irish resident with the same income.  The PRSI allowance of £286 is only available to taxpayers who pay the full rate of PRSI.  I have recently been made aware of the concerns expressed by some cross-Border workers and I am having the whole question examined.  It is a difficult and complex area and is affected by double taxation arrangements. I should mention that it may be impossible to come up with a solution which caters directly for the individuals affected and which is fair to all the taxpayers involved i.e. both the cross-Border workers and all other Irish resident taxpayers.  It is important, therefore, that expectations of relief or some special arrangements should not be built up.</P>

      <P>I share the view of the Small Firms Association that the redevelopment of North-South trade links affords a tremendous opportunity for small firms. I can assure the Deputy that I am acutely aware of the problems and difficulties which small businesses face and that I will be taking account of those problems in framing the forthcoming budget.</P>
      <P>Although there has been very substantial progress on tax reform in recent years, I and my colleagues are very aware that a lot more needs to be done. Accordingly, our programme: <i>A Government of Renewal</i> contains a commitment to accelerate the process <i>inter alia</i> by:</P>
      <P>targeting lower paid workers and young new job entrants, through a combination of measures aimed at taking them out of the tax net, and the development of a reformed system of PRSI contributions and other measures;</P>
      <P>widening the standard rate tax band, with the aim of ensuring that only those on higher incomes would pay tax above the standard rate; and,</P>
      <P>increasing personal allowances by significantly more than the rate of inflation.</P>
      <P>Budgetary policy on tax and PRSI will target resources at the promotion of sustainable employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While a differential exists between Irish PRSI rates and the UK national insurance contributions paid in Northern Ireland this is but one of a number of factors affecting competitiveness.  I should point out, however, that PRSI concessions are costly.  An interdepartmental review of employers' PRSI estimated the cost of introducing a tiered rate system similar to that in force in the <Col N="127" /> UK in 1994-95 at £198 million.  A simple reduction in the main 12.2 per cent Employers PRSI contribution would cost £77 million for each 1 per cent cut.</P>
    <P>The data requested by Deputy O'Malley is as follows.  The sums that are payable by employer and employee by way of tax and social insurance in the South and North, in the case of a single worker with standard allowances, are on income of:</P>

    <P>As the Deputy is well aware, in any comparisons of the tax wedge between the Irish and the UK tax systems, the single person is among the groups that show the largest differences.  However, if one takes the example of a married couple, with one earner, which are quite a significant category in Ireland, then the divergence between the two tax systems is considerably reduced and can in the case of large families on low incomes be even slightly in our favour.</P>
    <P>As regards the corporation tax issue, as the Deputy is aware the Small Business Task Force recommended a reduced rate of corporation tax for small businesses with profits of up to £80,000 and a turnover of up to £3 million. This issue has been raised in many pre-budget submissions and at pre-Budget meetings which I and my officials have had with various representative bodies last week.  I and the Government will be giving due weight to those proposals in framing the Budget.</P>
    <P>I expect that the emergence of peace in Northern Ireland will result in much more favourable conditions for enterprise there and make it a more attractive location for investors.  I view this prospect with optimism: the present <Col N="128" /> strength of the Irish economy and the actions which this Government will take in the coming years will enable us to cope successfully with the challenges of the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 22 and 53 together.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to set up a study group to consider the implications of tax credits to replace tax allowances.  The Government has particular tax policy objectives which are set out in the Programme of Renewal.  This policy includes increasing personal allowances, widening the standard rate tax band and targeting assistance towards lower paid workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> It is important that, in looking at possible options in the area of taxation, there should be no confusion between the underlying policy considerations, such as equity, progressivity or efficiency, and the essentially administrative issue of how best to realise these in practical terms.  Tax credits simply represent an alternative means of pursuing goals which could equally be advanced within the framework of the present allowances system.  The choice between a credits system and an allowance system should, therefore, rest on considerations of simplicity from the standpoint of taxpayers and the administration.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of substituting tax credits for allowances, it should be made clear that this would significantly increase the progressivity of the tax system in the absence of other changes.  The tax system is already quite progressive.  Moreover, one effect of replacing allowances by credits could be to bring about a situation where a far greater proportion of taxpayers would be liable at the higher rates.  I do not believe that this would be generally seen as an improvement in the tax system, it would certainly run counter to the view that economic and employment objectives are likely to be best served by keeping marginal tax rates as low as possible.</P>

    <P>No new random cases were selected in 1993 for audit.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the following factors made it impractical to include an element of random audit in the overall audit programme for 1993;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the need to allow taxpayers the opportunity to avail of the Amnesty and to free staff to undertake Amnesty related work.</P>
    <P>&mdash; the need to concentrate on training of the increased number of staff assigned to outdoor audit activities as a basis for future audit programmes;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the major restructuring of the audit districts in Dublin and to a lesser extent in Cork and Limerick which took place in 1993 to help improve the efficiency and effectiveness of audit.</P>
    <P>I am informed that in the 1994 audit plan 2 per cent of audit cases were selected randomly.  The purpose of the random audit programme is to demonstrate the risk of audit to every self-assessing taxpayer and the Revenue Commissioners consider that the current selection procedure serves this purpose well and is a useful element in the overall audit programme.</P>

      <P>In the case of Ireland GNP is a better measure of the income actually available in this country.  The gap between GDP and GNP is higher in Ireland than in other member states of the EU.  In particular, GDP measures output, not incomes.  Ireland has a sizeable net out-flow of factor payments, the GDP measure therefore overstates the country's relative income.  GNP allows for profit repatriation and also for external <Col N="133" /> debt interest payments.  It is accordingly a better measure of the income which is available within the country.</P>
      <P>EU economic statistics are expressed in both national and regional terms.  In the case of regional economic statistics, GDP is the basis used by the Commission, because not all the components of GNP can be disaggregated on a regional basis.  Ireland qualified for Objective 1 status under the Structural Fund Regulations 1994-1999 by virtue of the fact that <i>per capita</i> GDP for the three years 1988, 1989, 1990 was less than 75 per cent of the average in the European Union.  The list of regions covered by Objective 1 is contained in annex 1 to the Framework regulation.</P>
      <P>Despite the limitations I have referred to in applying GNP on a regional basis, a case can be made for greater weight to be given to GNP in determining Ireland's relative position within the EU.  This issue has been raised at the EU Economic Policy Committee, and we will continue to draw attention to it.  It should be noted that in its 1994 annual economic report the EU Commission acknowledged that &ldquo;... GDP figures may over/under-estimate a country's command over its income&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had inquiries made of the Revenue Commissioners in relation to this tax-payer's case.  I have been advised, in regard to the taxation element of the question, that as the income of the taxpayer is likely to exceed the income exemption limit of £8,200 in 1994-95 he is liable to tax.  However, as his income is only slightly above the exemption <Col N="134" /> limit he is entitled to be assessed to tax under the Marginal Relief system of taxation. This means that the first £8,200 of his income is exempt from tax and any income in excess of that amount is taxed at 40 per cent.  Consequently, the increase of £3.39 in his weekly pension is taxed at 40 per cent resulting in an additional income tax liability of £1.36 per week.  I would point out that as the taxpayer is being assessed to tax under the Marginal Relief system, rather than the Standard Income Tax system as applies to the generality of taxpayers, his tax liability for the year is reduced by approximately £440.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, persons who earn £173 or less per week were exempted from paying the health and employment and training levies, amounting to 2.25 per cent in the 1994 budget.  However, as the increase in this taxpayer's pension brought his weekly income over the £173 threshold, his income became liable for the levies which, in his case, amounted to £3.90 per week.  It was this element which effectively offset the increase in pension.</P>
      <P>Due to budgetary constraints, the exemption from the levies was targeted specifically towards people on low pay. This was achieved by setting the threshold at £173 per week.  I am aware of the difficulties or anomalies that can arise from introducing such a threshold. However, introducing a marginal relief system at the present threshold would introduce an unacceptable level of additional complexity and compliance costs into the employee's PRSI system. The suggestion is sometimes made that the levies should apply only to income over the threshold.  Such a proposal would be very costly to implement and would not focus the benefit towards those on lower incomes as the existing measure does.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, as stated in my predecessor's reply to Parliamentary Question No. 140 on 18 October 1994, they are operating a number of programmes to counter tax evasion by landlords and <Col N="137" /> that these programmes are continuing to be successful.</P>
      <P>The Special Enquiry Branch whose main function is to identify sources of income not previously declared, has a dedicated property unit with a full time focus on landlords and rented properties. Specific areas, which information sources have shown to have high rental densities, are targeted.  Four surveys in different areas of Dublin are currently underway and similar surveys have been conducted in provincial urban areas.</P>
      <P>In addition, Special Enquiry Branch conducted 619 visits in connection with rental income in 1994 and identified 349 landlords who are not declaring some or all of their rental income.</P>
      <P>The question of Revenue access to information held by public authorities is being considered by my Department. The reluctance to grant a general power of access to information is related to an awareness of the requirements of Data Protection legislation.  It appears that specific legislative authority for the transfer of information is needed where the Data Protection law precludes its automatic transfer.  Such legislative authority would significantly add to Revenue powers.  When this question was raised at Committee Stage in the 1994 Finance Bill my predecessor indicated that rather than seeking new powers, attention should be focused on establishing how effective the existing regime &mdash; which was considerably strengthened in 1992 &mdash; proves to be.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report referred to by the Deputy.  There are a number of points on which I wish to comment.</P>
      <P>First, pay comparisons between an average industrial worker and an average Government service employee can never be strictly valid in that like is not being compared with like.  Staff paid from the Exchequer are typically highly-trained groups like teachers, nurses and gardaí operating at a level of skill relatively higher than that of a private sector worker at or about the average industrial wage.</P>
      <P>Second, as explained in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 53 of 21 April 1994 by Deputy O'Malley, there is a technical problem with the earnings figures used in the ISME report, deriving from methodology such as that used in the OECD Economic Survey Series.  For the purposes of that exercise, an &ldquo;average&rdquo; public service figure is obtained by dividing the Exchequer Pay Bill by the average numbers employed.  For a variety of technical reasons, which are explained in detail in the reply referred to earlier, averages produced in this fashion must be treated with caution.</P>
      <P>Third, any evaluation of comparative trends in pay is, by definition, sensitive to the time period examined.  The starting date used in the ISME report, 1987, reflects a point in time when public service pay rates were widely acknowledged to have fallen seriously behind those in the private sector.  This manifested itself in a series of arbitration findings recommending increases for the main marker groups of public servants originating to a large extent in pay awards in the private sector in the early to mid 1980's.  To their credit, arrangements were negotiated with the public service unions which had the effect of deferring implementation of those awards, cushioning the impact on the Exchequer, over a period which commenced two years later in 1989 and did not end until last year, 1994.</P>

    <P>Trends over time in comparative developments in public service and private sector pay were, <i>inter alia,</i> the <Col N="139" /> subject of a special comment by the National Economic and Social Council (NESC) in its report of November 1993 entitled <i>A Strategy for Competitiveness, Growth and Employment.</i> That report (pages 134 and 135) confirms the trends identified by ISME for the period since 1987 but, on the basis of a more detailed analysis over a longer period, points out that a reverse of these trends emerges if comparison is made over the period 1982 to 1988 and goes on to conclude that &ldquo;in the long run, wage determination mechanisms produce broadly comparable pay movements across public and private sector employment&rdquo;. While the relevance and usefulness of the report referred to in the question has to be qualified by reference to the foregoing, the overall situation gives us no grounds for complacency.</P>
    <P>The Government is acutely aware of the cost of public service pay as a component of public expenditure.  It has committed itself to restraint in overall expenditure as part of a broad economic strategy set out in the recent Programme for Government.  Its current pay policy is contained in the pay agreement which forms part of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> It is the Government's intention to honour its commitments under that programme and in doing so to adhere to the <Col N="140" /> cost parameters which have been agreed for the next two and a half years.  It expects, in return, a high level of commitment by public servants to improving the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of public services.</P>
    <P>It is also committed to modernise the system for determining public service pay in a manner which will make it more transparent and sensitive to the needs of staff, the Government and taxpayers alike.  Already an amended scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration has been agreed in the Civil Service and we expect that discussions in the other areas will be brought to a conclusion in the coming months.</P>

      <P>The main proposal in the document referred to by the Deputy is to replace the existing tax and social welfare systems with a partial basic income and a single tax rate of 50 per cent.  While such proposals seem interesting on the face of it, I think that further study on the question would need to be undertaken before such a radical change could be considered.  In particular, the effect of the proposals on the labour market and on persons on different income levels would have to be examined.</P>
      <P>In addition, there are some questions on the tax base used in the study and on the legal implications of the changes in the uses of EU funds suggested.  I know that the Conference of Religious in Ireland are anxious to address these issues and I look forward to seeing the results of their study in these areas.  On the Government's part, the question of basic income is one of the questions which is being addressed by the Expert Working Group on the Integration of the Tax and Social Welfare Systems which will be reporting during 1995.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Finance</askee>
      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that families where the parents have separated are subjected to the imposition of PRSI and levies on maintenance payments while cohabiting parents are not subjected to levies on moneys transferred; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1564/95]</QRef>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under existing legislation where an individual makes an enforceable maintenance payment to an estranged spouse, PRSI contributions, health contribution and employment and training levy are chargeable on the paying spouse's income at the time it is earned and again on the maintenance payments on their receipt by the receiving spouse.</P>
      <P>Where the couple are separated but the marriage has not been dissolved or annulled they have the option of having the maintenance payment disregarded for any purposes of the Taxes Acts and in those circumstances the payment would not be income in the hands of the recipient for tax, PRSI and levy purposes.</P>
      <P>Transfers of moneys between spouses which are not legally enforceable, have no significance for tax, PRSI and levy purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The payment of separate PRSI contributions enables each spouse to build up a social insurance record in their own <Col N="145" /> right, and they can both, in due course, qualify for a pension.  Entitlement to a social insurance pension is a valuable right and I believe that coverage under the system should be extended as widely as possible and should afford protection to separated spouses.  It is, therefore, appropriate that a social insurance contribution be levied on the maintenance payment.</P>
    <P>The charging of both spouses to the health contribution and employment and training levies is another matter. For the purposes of these levies the person receiving the maintenance payment is treated in the same way as a self-employed person with the maintenance payments made by one spouse to the other being regarded as &ldquo;reckonable income&rdquo;.  The liability to the various charges is the same as for a self-employed person and no allowance or cognisance is taken of the fact that the maintenance has already suffered deduction of levies in the hands of the payer.  This is clearly anomalous.  Unlike social insurance contributions no specific benefits accrue to the individual involved.</P>
    <P>The number of such cases is small and the introduction in last year's budget of an exemption from the levies for persons with incomes below £9,000 will have reduced that number further. Once again while in the case of social insurance the provision of a separate benefit entitlement constitutes a justification, the double charging of such payments to the levies is difficult to defend. The issue is a complex one affecting a number of Government Departments as well as the Revenue Commissioners who collect the levies.</P>
    <P>Following discussions which have taken place involving officials of my own Department, the other interested Departments (Social Welfare, Health, Enterprise and Employment) and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, I am considering, in the context of the forthcoming budget, certain measures designed to effect more equitable arrangements for maintenance payments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="146" /> The Deputy also refers to moneys transferred between cohabiting parents. The position here is that where a payment is made by one of the couple to the other person under a deed of covenant, for the benefit of that other person, the payment would also be treated as income in the hands of the recipient for tax, PRSI and levy purposes.</P>
    <P>Transfer of moneys between a cohabiting couple which are not legally enforceable under say a deed of covenant would have no significance for tax, PRSI and levy purposes.</P>

      <P>Unclaimed prizes are returned to players in many innovative ways to stimulate national lottery games.  These include special prizes in instant games as well as supplementing lotto jackpots from time to time.  Experience has shown that such jackpots are popular with players.  They help to sustain public interest in the lottery and encourage additional players to participate.  By returning unclaimed prizes to players the national lottery can in the longer term achieve a greater return to the beneficiary fund programmes than would be achieved by a direct allocation of unclaimed prizes.  To take the unclaimed prizes away from the players would run the risk of jeopardising the long term success of the lottery games and consequently the beneficiary fund programmes which are supported by lottery funds.</P>
      <P>I remind the House that very many social and charitable bodies have received grants from the beneficiary fund since the lottery was introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might mention that it would not in <Col N="147" /> fact be necessary to amend the National Lottery Act, 1986, to allow for unclaimed prize money to be allocated to social or charitable projects.  The provision in relation to unclaimed prizes is contained in the rules of the lottery which are agreed between the lottery company and the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45, 65 and 66 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I confirm that I have received representations on behalf of the company referred to by the Deputy.  VAT is charged at point of entry into the State on all goods originating from outside the customs territory of the European Union.  There is no provision in Irish law <Col N="148" /> under which this requirement could be waived for particular companies or categories of goods.  The complete abolition of VAT at the point of entry would be required to provide the kind of concession being sought.  This course of action would involve a very significant cash-flow for the Exchequer and, accordingly, cannot be contemplated in present budgetary circumstances.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of providing an exemption from VAT, I should explain that because the company in question, a trading company, is not engaged in one of the exempt activities provided for in EU VAT law, it cannot be afforded exemption from the tax. Indeed, exempt status might only worsen its position because it would not be able to recover VAT paid at point of entry.  VAT is, generally speaking, only recoverable by VAT-registered traders. I understand that the company referred to by the Deputy is, in fact, properly registered for VAT, although it has charitable status.  The only point at issue is the situation with regard to cash-flow, that is, the time which the company must wait in order to recover the VAT paid at point of entry in its normal VAT return.</P>
    <P>While the company states it must wait for up to a year for repayment, I must point out that repayment periods of up to a year in relation to VAT at point of entry should normally only arise for traders who opt for annual returns for VAT purposes.  All traders have the right to make returns on the more usual bimonthly basis and this could reduce considerably any cash-flow difficulty being experienced relating to the payment of VAT at point of entry.</P>

      <Quest>if he will make a statement on the Government's position on the merits or otherwise of shifting the balance of taxation from labour to non-renewable resources in view of the endorsement of the ESRI and the European Commission of the asertion that an energy tax would lead to 9,000 extra jobs in Ireland as well as help stabilise CO2 emissions.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> states that, in the context of protecting the environment, the Government will contribute to the preparation of a pan-European taxation policy on carbon and fossil fuel inputs. While the benefits of shifting taxation from labour can be endorsed in principle, we would need to be assured about the full implications of additional taxation on energy products.  While the former would reduce the direct cost of employment, additional tax on non-renewable resources would inevitably cause an increase in inflation.  If, in turn, this were to lead to demands for higher wages in compensation, the benefits of reduced labour taxes could be quickly offset.  In addition, unilateral action by either Ireland or the EU as a whole in this area could very likely result in some industries moving to locations which would not be as concerned about the environment, leading to loss of employment here.  This potential effect would need to be borne in mind in examining the overall effect on employment.  With regard to the estimates of increased employment by the ESRI, I would refer the Deputy to the reply given by my predecessor to his question of 1 December 1993 on this issue.</P>
      <P>The ESRI's estimate, in a study published in 1992, emerged from an illustrative exercise which envisaged unilateral adoption by Ireland of a carbon/energy tax applied at the rate of $10 per barrel of oil equivalent for a period of ten years up to the year 2000.  It assumed that all the proceeds of the tax would be applied to reducing PRSI contributions. Because of the nature of the study it could not address sector specific effects such as closure or relocation of plants in certain industries&mdash; effects which would diminish the positive employment impact found by the ESRI.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="150" /> Regarding EU carbon/energy taxation proposals, the European Council meeting in Essen last December, noted the Commission's intention of submitting guidelines to enable each member state to apply a CO²/energy tax on the basis of common parameters if it so desires; the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers was instructed to consider appropriate parameters.  This approach is in contrast to previous efforts to establish a mandatory EU wide regime in this area.  Commission proposals in the matter are awaited and it would be inappropriate to act unilaterally on the issue before the wider position has been clarified.</P>

My Department is currently considering the details of how this will be implemented.

      <P>The Department of Justice have a long-standing requirement for additional space at Ballincollig in order to improve access and security at this Garda station.  The adjoining Telecom Éireann property, which contains two exchange buildings, was identified as being suitable to meet this need for extra space.  In early 1991, the Office of Public Works inquired of Telecom as to the availability of the property but was informed that the exchange premises were still required for operational purposes and that the property was not therefore, available for disposal.</P>
      <P>In late 1993 it was again suggested that the Telecom property was surplus to its requirements but, on inquiry, this proved not to be the case.  Further investigation by Office of Public Works towards the end of 1994 ascertained that Telecom's plans to vacate its property were at an advanced stage.  Following a feasibility study carried out by Office of Public Works, a portion of the Telecom site was identified as being suitable to meet the extra accommodation requirements and agreement to Office of Public Work's proposal has been sought from the Department of Justice.  Telecom has recently informed Office of Public Works that its premises will not be available for disposal for a few weeks yet.  It is understood that exchange equipment has yet to be removed from one of the buildings.  It has, furthermore, been reported to Office of Public Works that the other building may currently be in use by a voluntary organisation apparently on foot of a local arrangement with Telecom.</P>
      <P>It is expected that Telecom and Office of Public Works will shortly be in a position to conclude negotiations for the purchase by Office of Public Works of the requisite property.</P>

I am also conscious that the narrowing of tax differences between North and South has been an important contributory factor in the improvement being recorded.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the run-up to the 1994 budget, the Society of the Irish Motor Industry sought the implementation of an extensive package of changes in the motoring taxation area aimed at boosting new car sales; the society's submission also contained revenue forecasts based on the adoption of its proposals in full.  In the event, budgetary action was more restricted, namely, a reduction in the rates of Vehicle Registration Tax and an improvement in the capital allowances regime applicable to business cars.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="156" /> As a result of the very strong recovery recorded in sales of new cars in 1994 &mdash; up some 25 per cent compared with 1993 &mdash; taxation receipts, at £361 million, were well ahead of the post-budget forecast.  While the taxation changes certainly helped new car sales, the generally favourable economic conditions, particularly low interest rates, which prevailed throughout the year were far more significant factors in explaining the sales performance; indeed, it is now evident that the surge in new car sales had already begun before the budgetary changes were announced.  Similarly, sales of other types of vehicles grew strongly in 1994 even though tax rates remained unchanged.</P>
    <P>The continuation into 1995 of the favourable economic climate suggests that new car sales should remain strong this year and the relevant pre-budget revenue forecast of £391 million reflects this.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="157" /> Because of the many other factors at play in determining the level of car sales here, it is not possible to say, with any conviction, whether or to what extent second-hand imports are having an effect.  It can be argued that, given the age and value profile of such importations, the level of new car sales is unlikely to be significantly affected. However, industry interests contend that the importations, through their impact on the indigenous second-hand market, depress new car sales.  It should be noted though that new car sales recovered strongly in 1994, rising by 25 per cent year-on-year, reflecting strong consumer confidence and low interest rates. In preparation for the forthcoming budget, I will be examining carefully the various proposals I have received in relation to the motor industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the recent strong performance of the Irish economy itself, has provided a major boost for the confidence of international investors to invest in this country.  In the five years to 1994, GNP growth averaged over 5 per cent per annum, the fastest growth rate in the European Community.  At the same time, inflation remained subdued, at an average of about 2.7 per cent per annum over the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, budgetary management <Col N="159" /> has been responsible.  Exchequer borrowing has been well under 3 per cent of GNP each year since 1988.  A similar trend is evident in the General Government Deficit, which was established in the Maastricht Treaty as a primary measurement of budgetary convergence in the run-up to European Monetary Union.  Since 1988, this deficit has not exceeded 2.3 per cent of GDP, comfortably below the 3 per cent level that is prescribed as the reference value in the treaty.  The General Government Debt to GDP ratio has also been on a firm downward path, falling from 116 per cent in 1987 to below 90 per cent last year.</P>
    <P>The Government is committed to continuing responsibility in budgetary management, to price stability and, through investment, to the upgrading of physical and other infrastructure vital to business success.  These Government policies are underpinned from the investor's viewpoint by the moderate pay terms which have been agreed between the social partners under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work,</i> and the real prospects for a lasting peace on the island.</P>
    <P>All of these factors are contributing to making Ireland a very attractive location for potential foreign investors.</P>

      <P>The joint Ireland/Northern Ireland draft programme under the second INTERREG structural funds Community initiative was submitted to the EU Commission at the beginning of November 1994.  Based on the successful pattern achieved under INTERREG <Col N="160" /> I it will offer a multisectoral range of measures covering infrastructure, (including roads, energy, telecommunications and transport), environmental protection, economic development, tourism, community development, agriculture, forestry, fisheries and human resources.</P>
      <P>Consideration of the INTERREG II programme by the Commission is at an advanced stage, and it is expected that it will be approved shortly.  Funding allocations to individual measures cannot yet be confirmed but overall Ireland will get EU funding of approximately 89.5 mECU (in 1994 prices).</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the programme will be launched at a suitable venue in the Border region as soon as possible after it has been approved.</P>
      <P>Under the 1994-1999 INTERREG initiative there will also be a maritime INTERREG programme between the Dublin, Mid-East and South-East regions and Gwynedd and Dyfed in Wales.  Ireland will get EU funding of 70 MECU (in 1994 prices) under this programme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 69, 70 and 71 together.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the central recommendations of the report of the Kilkenny Incest Investigation was that the necessary resources be made available to facilitate the implementation of all sections of the Child Care Act, 1991 and in particular Part III to VI which deal with the taking of children into care, court proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.</P>
      <P>This recommendation was accepted by the Government as the single biggest contribution which could be made towards promoting the welfare of children and protecting those who are at risk.  Over the last two years, additional resources totalling £20 million has been made available to develop child care services in preparation for the introduction of the Act.  Among the developments approved were:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; The creation of over 370 new jobs for the child care services around the country, including child psychiatrists, <Col N="162" /> psychologists, social workers and child care workers,</P>
    <P>&mdash; The provision of additional hostel places for homeless children,</P>
    <P>&mdash; The establishment of new family resource centres and community support projects to assist disadvantaged children,</P>
    <P>&mdash; The expansion of the homemaker and home help services to help families in difficulty and the establishment of community mothers programmes in a number of boards,</P>
    <P>&mdash; Increased financial support to pre-school services in areas of social deprivation and the provision of additional places and,</P>
    <P>&mdash; The development of foster care and other alternative family placement services.</P>
    <P>The Policy Agreement between the Government parties, &ldquo;A Government of Renewal&rdquo;, contains a commitment that the Act will be implemented in its entirety by the end of 1996.  During the current year it is intended to commence Parts III, IV, V and VI which deal respectively with the protection of children in emergencies, care proceedings and the powers and duties of health boards in relation to children in their care.  These provisions will greatly strengthen the powers of the courts, the health boards and the gardaí to intervene effectively in relation to child abuse and neglect.  These are the most complex provisions of the Act.  Various sets of new regulations are required to be made in order to give full effect to them.  The provisions in question are interrelated and must therefore be brought into force at the same time.</P>
    <P>Extensive preparatory work is currently underway in my Department regarding the next phase of implementation. Two working groups were established to assist my Department in the preparation of the initial drafts of the new regulations relating to foster care and residential care.  The foster care group has completed its task and the <Col N="163" /> draft foster care regulations have been circulated to interested parties for their comments prior to being finalised.  The residential care working group is at an advanced stage in its deliberations and I intend to circulate their draft regulations to relevant interests shortly.</P>
    <P>I would also like to refer to a number of important initiatives at present underway to give effect to other recommendations in the Kilkenny Incest Report.</P>
    <P>My Department, in consultation with the Department of Justice, the Health Boards and the Garda Síochána is developing new procedures for the notification of suspected cases of child abuse between the Health Boards and the gardaí.  These procedures, which revolve around a standardised form for the notification of suspected cases of abuse, are aimed at ensuring closer co-ordination between key personnel from both agencies in order to facilitate the twin objectives of protecting the child and the full investigation of any crime. I expect these new procedures to be finalised within the next few weeks. There will then be a series of training sessions for members of the gardaí and relevant health board staff in relation to the new procedures.</P>
    <P>In the area of prevention the Kilkenny Report recommended the extension of the &ldquo;Stay Safe&rdquo; Child Abuse Prevention Programme to all classes in primary schools and the further development of the programme for use in secondary schools.  The programme has now been made available on a nationwide basis to all primary schools and the necessary social work supports have been provided by the health boards.  The extension of the programme to schools around the country has the full support of the Department of Education which has seconded additional teachers to the project.  My Department has met the production costs of the programme packs and the <Col N="164" /> other materials required and is co-operating with the Department of Education on the development of an appropriate programme for second level schools.</P>

      <P>It is my intention to protect the benefits to Ireland from CAP Reform including the accompanying measures.</P>
      <P>The accompanying measures will continue to be funded by the guarantee section of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund and will remain an important component of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Funding for these measures is provided for in the general budget of the European Communities for 1995, which was signed by the President of the European Parliament on 15 December 1994.</P>
      <P>In the course of the budgetary procedure, Parliament adopted a number of &ldquo;amendments&rdquo; to the draft budget as established by Council on 25 July 1994 in respect of headings relating to expenditure hitherto classified as &ldquo;compulsory&rdquo; and on which Council had the final say.</P>
      <P>The Council of Ministers has decided to question the procedure adopted by Parliament and will refer the matter for a ruling to the European Court of Justice on the basis that Parliament's action is not in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty and the Inter-Institutional Agreement between Parliament, Council and the Commission on budgetary matters.</P>

      <P>I understand that <Col N="175" /> the functions of the Minister for the Environment in relation to the use of Irish timber in public building contracts relate principally to ensuring its suitability for use and compliance with the Building Regulations.  Towards this end, he has asked his technical staff and local authorities to be vigilant, where appropriate, in ensuring that new houses are constructed using timber which is suitable for the purposes for which, and the conditions in which, it is being used and which fully complies with the Building Regulations.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment and I would, in principle, welcome greater domestic use of Irish timber. Such use would, however, have to be consistent with EU public procurement law which prohibits discrimination against timber originating from other EU member states.</P>

      <P>The recommendation in question was contained in an ESRI report published in May 1993.  In the intervening period there has been a number of developments, most notably significant increases in the levels of forestry premiums payable to farmers, a continued upward trend in farmer planting and the commencement of work by my Department, with the assistance of <Col N="176" /> consultants, on a strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector. Work on this plan places specific emphasis on the creation of sustainable employment; a balance of regional benefit from forestry in Ireland; the assessment of the potential for forestry to make a greater contribution to economic and social wellbeing, and the identification of impediments to realising that potential.  I expect the consultants assisting in this task to present their formal report shortly and anticipate that the strategic plan will be completed within the next few months.</P>
      <P>Against this background, I will, in due course, be better able to assess what joint initiatives with other colleagues in Government might be desirable in terms of securing the greatest possible overall benefit from the substantial ongoing investment being made in our forestry sector.</P>

      <P>I do not believe that we should devise a strategic approach to hardwoods on a stand-alone basis.  Our strategy in this area should be an integral part of our overall <Col N="178" /> plan for forestry.  The Deputy will be aware of the preparation by my Department of a strategic plan for the development of the forestry sector.  The work of consultants appointed to assist in this process is now far advanced and I expect formal submission of their report shortly.  The terms of reference to which the consultants have worked place specific emphasis on the creation of added value and on the optimum utilisation of all the output of Irish forests.  The strategy will therefore encompass the question of utilising our hardwood resource and pursuing added-value outlets for indigenous hardwood timber.  I look forward to further considering this particular aspect when the consultants report is to hand.</P>

      <Col N="179" /> The size of the national sheep flock at June 1994 was 8,462,900.  The volume of unprocessed wool exported in 1993 was 9,934 tonnes.  Given the supply and range of wool qualities available it is unlikely that a wool processing plant would be viable here at present but I would, of course, have any proposal in this regard properly considered.</P>
