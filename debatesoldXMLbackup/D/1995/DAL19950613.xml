    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 22 together.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would remind the Deputies that I have dealt at length in my replies to parliamentary questions on 23 and 31 May and the statements and questions and answers sessions on 24 and 30 May with matters relating to the Attorney General's office and the problems which arose in that office over the past two years.  I do not propose, therefore, in my reply to questions today, to refer in any detail to aspects on which I have nothing further to add.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question as to the authority under which Mr. Russell dealt with work in the office of the Attorney General.  Mr. Russell, as senior legal assistant in the office was the official head of the office of the Attorney General. He was, therefore, responsible for the distribution of legal work among the professional staff.  He was one of three officials in the office who dealt with extradition matters.  The Duggan case had been allocated to one of the other two officials, and the Fr. Smyth case had been retained to be dealt with by Mr. Russell.  In November 1994, on the instruction of the then Attorney General.  Mr. Fitzsimons, Mr. Russell was informed that he was no longer to deal with the Smyth extradition file and he relinquished custody of that file at that time.  I have already informed the House that the file was locked away in the room of the deputy senior legal assistant.  Other than the Attorney General and the two senior officials in his office who perused the file at the time of the selection of documents for the Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, no official handled the Smyth file.  There was, as I informed the House on 30 May, no indication on the file that the letter of November had not been replied <Col N="494" /> to.  Two officials have now been assigned the file under the supervision of the Attorney General in relation to the compensation claims made by the victims of Fr. Smyth.  One of these officials now has custody of the file.</P>
    <P>The difficulties encountered in the Smyth extradition case did not relate to the issue of correspondence not being dealt with but rather to the delay in coming to a decision on a legal problem and the prioritisation of legal work within the Attorney General's office.  As I have already informed the House instructions had issued by the former Attorney General, Mr. Fitzsimons, that all extradition cases and cases involving minors were to be brought to the attention of the Attorney General.  This instruction was further reiterated by the present Attorney General, Mr. Gleeson.</P>
    <P>As to the procedures now in place to check the passage of mail in the Attorney General's office, I stated in reply to a question from Deputy O'Dea on 23 May that a case and correspondence tracking system was determined to be a priority in the major information technology programme for the office as part of an integrated package covering a two year implementation plan.  This approach has received the approval of the independent legal technology consultants who have quality assured the plan.  With the recent arrival in the office of top of the range PCs it has been possible to establish a computerised correspondence tracking system. This new system also enables acknowledgments to be generated for issue on receipt of such correspondence, and is part of the elaboration of a fully inclusive case tracking system which is being developed at present by the central information technology service division of the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>On the question relating to the statement of facts on the Fr. Smyth file, the file, including the statement of facts, was made available to the legal assessor of the Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security.  The Attorney General also wrote to the chairman of the sub-committee on the <Col N="495" /> matter of the statement of facts on 11 January 1995.</P>
    <P>On the question of procedures in the office of the Attorney General and Chief State Solicitor's office in relation to correspondence, a new procedure has now been put in place in the office of the Attorney General whereby letters of claim received by the Attorney General will be acknowledged by the office of the Attorney General and the claimant informed that the papers have been passed to the Chief State Solicitor's office for attention.  A copy of that acknowledgment will be kept in the office of the Attorney General with a copy of the correspondence.</P>
    <P>The practice has been that where a matter is being sent to the Chief State Solicitor for attention &mdash; for example, letters of claim against the State &mdash; a note is put on the correspondence being transmitted to the Chief State Solicitor that it is being referred to him for attention and a copy of that correspondence with such note thereon is retained in the Attorney General's office.  In the case of a letter of claim received initially by fax the note of referral to the Chief State Solicitor's office would be put on the hard or posted letter when received rather than on the FAX.  It is that letter that would be forwarded to the Chief State Solicitor &mdash; not the faxed letter &mdash; in accordance with the procedure I have already detailed.  Of course, in the case of general correspondence being dealt within the Attorney General's office a copy of whatever reply is issued would be retained on the appropriate file in the normal course.</P>
    <P>Correspondence received in the Chief State Solicitor's office from the Attorney General's office seeking information receives a response from the Chief State Solicitor's office.  Letters of claim received by the Chief State Solicitor from the Attorney General's office until recently have been acknowledged in the Chief State Solicitor's office on behalf of the Attorney General and passed to the relevant Government Department for instructions.  Receipt of <Col N="496" /> such letters from the Attorney General is not separately acknowledged to him. If a claim develops and proceedings are served the Attorney General is then informed.  On average, four to five such letters per day are received.  These letters are received directly by the Chief State Solicitor or are passed to him for attention by the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>On the question as to whether there are other letters of claim in the office of the Attorney General, as I have stated previously, it is not possible for me or for any other member of Government to give an absolute assurance that there is no outstanding correspondence, of whatever duration, in our offices.  What can be done, and is being done in the Attorney General's office, is to plan, devise and then put in place systems to prevent such delays.  With huge volumes of correspondence this must mean computerised systems whereby all such correspondence can be tracked from the time it enters an office until it is finally dealt with.</P>
    <P>On the question in relation to powers over personnel matters, on 1 June I again delegated to the Attorney General the powers under section 2 (2) (c) of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956.  I arranged to have copies of the instrument placed in the Oireachtas Library at the time.</P>
    <P>On the question of <i>ex gratia</i> payments to the families of the victims of Fr. Smyth, legal proceedings have commenced against the State.  Accordingly, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on that aspect.  I dealt with this matter in response to questions on 7 June.</P>
    <P>On the question of the existence of a third letter from the solicitors for the victims of Fr. Smyth, as I informed the House on 7 June, a letter from Dublin solicitors marked &ldquo;Strictly Private and Confidential&rdquo; was received by the Chief State Solicitor's office at 5.25 p.m. on 25 May.  This letter, which sought clarification as to whom proceedings might be issued against, gave a seven day notice for reply.  In addition, the confidentiality of the letter precluded the <Col N="497" /> Attorney General from passing it to me for the purposes of disclosure to the Dáil without the consent of the persons on whose behalf it had been issued.  The existence of the letter was not of relevance to the matters being debated in the House on 30 and 31 May as it was confidential correspondence that was in fact being dealt with expeditiously.  A copy of the letter was passed to my Department on 1 June, by which time its existence had been publicised by the victims' solicitors, for the purpose of seeking any views my Department might have on the proposed reply.  The reply issued from the Chief State Solicitor's office on 2 June &mdash; within the seven day time limit set by the victim's solicitors.</P>
    <P>On the question of the cost to the State of independent legal advice sought by my Department regarding the retirement of Mr. Russell, details of the costs involved have not yet been received. Deputies can, however, be assured that the cost will be within the established criteria for such fees as adopted by the Chief State Solicitor's office.</P>
    <P>On the question of the cost of independent legal and ancillary advice obtained by the office of the Attorney General on behalf of Government Departments since December, no such advice, over and above the standard practice adopted by that office in cases of litigation, has been sought.  Therefore the question of cost does not arise.</P>
    <P>On the question of the instigation of proceedings against the State on behalf of the victims of Fr. Smyth, prodeedings were served on the Chief State Solicitor's office at 5.30 p.m. on 1 June 1995. The plaintiffs' claim is for loss and damage incurred by them by reason of the failure of the Attorney General's office to endorse extradition warrants in respect of Fr. Smyth for execution within the State and ensuing consequential delay in bringing him to trial.  The proceedings do not make any claim for damages incurred as a result of the Attorney General's office's failure to <Col N="498" /> reply to the correspondence of November 1994 and January 1995 from the solicitors on behalf of the plaintiffs.</P>
    <P>On the question of the number of child sex abuse cases, the Attorney General does not deal with these cases, as such.  Child sex abuse allegations, following investigation by the Garda, are referred by them to the Director of Public Prosecutions and are dealt with by him independently of the Attorney General.  The Director of Public Prosecutions is independent in deciding issues of this nature.  He, rather than the Attorney General has the responsibility for prosecuting in such cases.  This independence is enshrined in section 2 (5) of the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974 which states that &ldquo;... the Director shall be independent in the performance of his functions&rdquo; and which received wide support in this House at the time.  Issues relating to child abuse can arise indirectly in the Attorney General's office in other matters which are dealt with by that office such as extradition cases, legal advice being sought by the Government and claims of one kind or another against the State in relation to children generally.</P>
    <P>There are cases currently being looked at in the Attorney General's office where proceedings have been taken against the State on behalf of emotionally disturbed children for failure to provide proper educational or detention facilities.  Although child abuse is not an issue on which the office has been asked to advise, nor is it a substantive issue in the proceedings themselves, child abuse may have been a factor in some of the children in question becoming emotionally disturbed in the first place.</P>
    <P>There are no extradition cases involving alleged child sexual abuse before the Attorney General's office at present. There is one case of advice being sought by another Government Department.</P>
    <P>An examination, in so far as it has been possible in the time available, of criminal files in the Chief State Solicitor's office reveals that there are 130 <Col N="499" /> cases involving sexual offences on persons under 18 currently before that office in respect of which a final court sentence has not yet been imposed.  In addition, there are civil cases with that office arising out of the claim for compensation for the delay in dealing with the Fr. Smyth extradition case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Assuming that the Taoiseach accepts ultimate responsibility to this House for the office of the Attorney General, he stated in his reply that Mr. Fitzsimons had informed the staff in that office that official A was to cease dealing with the file when he locked it in the safe in December last. Did it not occur to the Taoiseach or the present Attorney General, at some time between mid-December last and May, 1995, to inquire what was happening to this file which had brought the Taoiseach unexpectedly into office?  Did it never occur to him or the Attorney General to check what progress was being made on that file?  Does the Taoiseach consider it sufficient to say that official A held letters on his desk?  Did the Taoiseach or the present Attorney General never consider it appropriate at any stage to ascertain what progress was being made on that file?</P>

      <P>As I have explained to the House on a number of occasions, the Father Smyth file basically was an extradition one.  At the point at which this Government came into office Father Smyth had already departed this jurisdiction.  Therefore, the issue of extradition &mdash; the basic purpose of the creation of that file &mdash; no longer obtained.  As I have also explained repeatedly, there was correspondence seeking compensation for the victims because of the delay in dealing with the extradition of Father Smyth.  The Attorney General was not aware that that correspondence had not been replied to.  The reason he was not aware it had not been replied to was that the correspondence was retained on the desk of a particular official, Mr. <Col N="500" /> Matthew Russell, and was not drawn to the attention of the Attorney General by Mr. Russell with a view to the issuance of a reply, nor was it, as would be normal in the case of correspondence making a claim on the State, referred to the Chief State Solicitor's office.  The normal procedure in the case of a letter making a claim against the State would be for it not to be acknowledged by the office of the Attorney General but rather passed for acknowledgment or processing to the Chief State Solicitors' office.  This correspondence was not passed to the Chief State Solicitor's office.  It was retained by Mr. Russell. The faxed copy of the correspondence was placed on the Smyth file but there was nothing on that faxed copy to indicate that it had not been replied to.  Normally, the question of whether it had been replied to or where it would have been referred would not appear on the faxed copy, it would appear on the original or hard copy &mdash; the letter copy.</P>

      <P>With respect to this very important file, was it not political negligence that, for a period of five months, neither the Taoiseach, the Attorney General nor anybody else checked whether the matter of extradition had been dealt with or any other matter?  This was still a live case; it was something that was being discussed a great deal.  Was it the position that the Attorney General felt compromised and that is why he did not ask anything about the file?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ahern should be careful in imputing motives to people as he is seeking to do on this occasion. The position is that the file was an extradition file.  The Attorney General had no knowledge that there was any outstanding matter on that file, that it <Col N="501" /> was not being processed in the normal way.  The person in question was no longer in the jurisdiction, therefore the matter of his extradition did not arise. As far as its primary purpose was concerned, therefore, that was not an active file.  The only matter that remained to be dealt with which we have gone into exhaustively in this House was a claim for compensation from the victims in respect of the delay that occurred in dealing with that extradition matter previous to Mr. Gleeson's becoming Attorney General.  As far as that claim is concerned, Mr. Gleeson did not become aware until 9 May that that correspondence had not been answered.  It was only on 9 May that he became aware that that claim, which threatened legal proceedings within seven days of 14 November, had not been responded to by the Attorney General's office or by the Chief State Solicitor's office at the time.  He was also not aware of the subsequent letter of January or of the fact that that subsequent letter had not been replied to until 9 May.</P>

He knew when the file was put away following the adjournment of the committee that that remained a live issue.  It is wrong to say he did not know it was a live issue.

      <P>The Deputy may not get the answers he wants but we will leave that to one side.  The position is that the Attorney General only saw the letter of November when he was perusing the Smyth file and saw the faxed copy of it on the file.  That faxed copy did not contain any indication that it had not been replied to.  Mr. Gleeson was not going through the file with a view to checking whether individual items on it had been replied to.  He was doing that with one purpose in mind &mdash; sorting out those documents that could properly be given to the committee with a view to their being published.  Other documents on the file could not be given to the committee for publication because they contained sensitive information in the three categories I referred to in replies during a previous Question Time on this subject.</P>

Why were the members of the sub-committee not informed that the Taoiseach was consulted about what we would or would not see on the Brendan Smyth file?  In relation to the <i>ex gratia</i> payments, is it not the case that the State could make a payment in regard to the delay issue, quite apart from what is at issue in the proceedings as to culpability?

      <P>As I have said on several occasions in this House, that process was gone through by the Attorney General.  He had to exclude <Col N="504" /> certain documents for a number of reasons, one of which was the confidentiality of the victims.  Another reason concerned the integrity of the extradition proceedings and the confidentiality of information exchanged between various jurisdictions in regard to extradition.  The Attorney General made those decisions himself but in order that there would be no question raised as to whether he was excluding documents in a way that was unhelpful to the committee, the independent legal advisers to the committee saw all the documents, including the documents that the Attorney General believed the committee should not see, and they too were satisfied that the exclusions from the documents passed to the committee were valid exclusions in light of the criteria to which I have referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that the reason the sub-committee was formed was to find out why there was a seven month delay in dealing with this case?  The existence of admissions in the statement of facts by Brendan Smyth was central to the delay; if there were admissions on the file there was no need for a seven month delay.  That is the reason the committee wanted to see the statement of facts.  I put it to the Taoiseach that in answer to Deputy Eoin Ryan at an earlier Question Time, he admitted that he was consulted by the Attorney General as to which documents went to the committee and to the independent legal advisers.</P>

      <P>The decisions in regard to what was sent to the legal advisers and what was sent directly to the committee were made by the Attorney General, not by me.  I was not consulted about whether the documents should be included.  That is not a matter <Col N="505" /> on which I would have any competence; it was a matter that was dealt with by the Attorney General.  In so far as the statement of facts is concerned, the Deputy may have omitted to remember that a letter was sent on 11 January to the chairman of the committee by the Attorney General dealing with the question of the statement of facts.  It stated that the statement of facts indicated that police officers reported that during the course of an interview Fr. Smyth made verbal admissions to them about indecent assault charges.  Details of these admissions were set out in the statement of facts.  In it the police officers are also reported as stating that Fr. Smyth signed the interview notes in respect of the interview in question but declined to make a written statement after being cautioned about the matter saying that he preferred not to go over it all again.  I understand that information was made available by letter to the committee chairman on 11 January.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach is unable to give us information on the additional costs to the State because of the conflict of interest the Attorney General has in relation to a number of items.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe there are additional costs.  Virtually every Attorney General will have cases with which he is unable to deal because he previously acted for the other side. Every Attorney General, as a matter of course, normally puts out cases that will appear in court to independent barristers even when there is no conflict of interest.</P>
      <P>I do not believe additional costs will arise for the State from the fact that Mr. Gleeson, who had a very active practice, is Attorney General.  On the contrary as I pointed out already, Mr. Gleeson in the past six months has appeared more often for the State in court than any previous Attorney General in the past ten years and in so doing has saved the State approximately the equivalent of his entire salary for the past six months in moneys that would otherwise have had to be paid to other counsel.</P>

      <P>The position in this matter is that further allegations were made in respect of possible offences by Fr. Smyth last October.  These involved 11 parties who claimed to have been the victims of sexual abuse.  The file on that case was passed by the Garda authorities, after exhaustive investigation, to the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions as recently as 6 June, and they are dealing with it speedily.  Fr. Smyth was sentenced in Northern Ireland to four years in prison in June 1994, and the earliest date he could come up for release <i>sine die</i> is June 1996.</P>

Why is it that the Taoiseach and his colleagues who were partners in the previous Government, insisted on the resignation of an Attorney General in relation to an inactive file while, the file having been reactivated under their tenure of office, the Taoiseach defends everybody who has dealt with it except the one official whom he made a scapegoat?</P>

Smyth went back to the Northern Ireland jurisdiction.  The Taoiseach, as Leader of the Opposition at the time, sought political accountability in this House, not alone for the Attorney General but for the Leader of the Government which included people who are now members of the present Government.  Does it not fly in the face of logic that there should be political accountability in respect of an inactive file but no political accountability today, or since this controversy arose, in respect of an active file that the Taoiseach, as the person accountable to this House, oversaw from December to May, in respect of which he asks to be excused on the grounds that he knew nothing about it until 12 May?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The social welfare Estimates of expenditure on unemployment for 1995 are based on an average live register forecast of 266,000, as announced by the Minister for Finance on budget day. This number is some 16,000 below the 1994 average figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As is customary, the Department of Finance will review its budget day live register forecasts and any necessary revisions will be set out in its Economic <Col N="514" /> Review and Outlook document, which should be published in July.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on the full range of my Department's programmes is monitored closely as a matter of routine.  The monitoring process covers all subheads of the Vote which includes income from PRSI receipts and will take into account any change in the live register projections provided by the Department of Finance as well as other relevant factors.  It is too early yet to predict the overall outturn on the Social Welfare Vote with any degree of certainty and, therefore, too early to say whether a Supplementary Estimate will be needed later in the year.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that, in addition to making the statutory unemployment payments, my Department, through its employment support services, actively encourages unemployed people to avail of the full range of relevant options and incentives.  These include incentives to take up employment, self-employment, second-chance education, social employment or training which are administered by various Departments and agencies, including the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the recent Central Bank report which states it has upped its forecast to 269,000, and independent economic forecasts of 274,000 which will put additional strain on the requirements of his Department to an estimated £30 million.  I do not accept that it is too early to forecast because the Central Bank is an arm of Government. Is the Minister taking any steps as a result of that forecast?</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that the Deputy seeks to create the fear that the Government will not meet its obligations to the unemployed or those who may become unemployed before the end of the year.  If the need arises, my Department will seek a supplementary estimate for additional money.  If the Deputy knows anything about his brief he knows that outflows, income from PRSI and so on are taken into account.  The Department will meet its obligations to the unemployed.</P>

We take them into account in our projections of what is required to meet our obligations for the rest of the year.  The Christmas bonus is not included in the budgetary arithmetic at the beginning of the year but is provided for later in the year. That will happen this year as is usual.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 144 and 145 together.</P>
      <P>The programme for Government commits this Government to publishing a comprehensive paper dealing with all the relevant issues relating to divorce in advance of the referendum.  One of the key issues which arose during the last referendum campaign on divorce was the extent of public disquiet about the implications of divorce across a wide range of issues, including social welfare entitlement.  The Government is determined that there should be no ambiguity on the implications of divorce and has, therefore, decided that no spouse will be disadvantaged in terms of his or her social welfare entitlements as a result of a change in their legal status from married, separated or deserted to divorced.  The Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1995 gives effect to this decision.</P>
      <P>The additional Exchequer costs in the social welfare area resulting from the possible introduction of divorce arise predominantly from the proposed payment of survivor's pension to divorced persons, as provided for in the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of extending entitlement to survivor's pension to divorced people, <Col N="517" /> who have not remarried on the death of their former spouses is estimated at £1 million by year five following the introduction of divorce.  This estimate takes account of a number of relevant factors, including the number of separated persons who are likely to remarry following divorce and their age profile and mortality rates among potential divorcees in the various age groups.</P>
    <P>The figure of £1 million must be put in the overall context of social welfare expenditure generally.  In 1995 the cost of providing social welfare payments is £4.18 billion, of which £342 million relates to the provision of survivor's pension.  The estimate of £1 million represents an insignificant proportion of total expenditure and less than 0.3 per cent of the cost of survivor's pensions.</P>
    <P>It would not be practical for my Department to estimate the cost implications over a period of 30 years as requested by the Deputy.  The variable nature of the factors upon which the estimate is based would tend to dilute the accuracy of any estimate of the costs arising over such a prolonged period.</P>
    <P>The costs arising over a ten year period, however, are currently being estimated by my Department and I expect to be in a position to provide this information to the Deputy during the Second Stage debate on the Bill later this week.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I received a copy of the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill, 1995 and the Explanatory Memorandum.  No costings were given.  If we ask the people to change the Constitution they are entitled to know the costs involved and whether they will be underwritten by the Government.  I was appalled to see the unrealistic suggestion that the cost would be £1 million.  The Minister has confirmed that it is impossible to give any relevant estimate of the cost.  I look forward to his submission on the Bill during the Second Stage debate.  The people will want to know if the costs have been estimated and properly researched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did <Col N="518" /> not ask a question but I will provide some information which he might have looked for had he given more thought to his role as Opposition spokesperson. I have been a Member of the House since 1982 and have not seen estimated costs included in any Explanatory Memorandum or Bill.  However, I made a point of ensuring that the costs were addressed in any public statement I made about the Bill.  The Deputy mentioned the figures I gave in his question.</P>
      <P>To imply that I am concealing the costs is misleading.  The Deputy implied that it is impossible to state the costs conclusively. I have made it clear in my reply that it is impossible to give a costing over a 30-year period as there are many variables involved, for example, to try to estimate the number of people who will seek a divorce in 30 years time is impossible.  However, based on the number of people who are separated we can estimate how many are likely to seek divorce.  The assumptions for the estimate made regarding the 55,000 people classified by the Central Statistics Office as separated are that 75 per cent will avail of divorce, 50 per cent will remarry and 80 per cent of the women concerned will outlive their former spouses.  These assumptions which underlie the estimate are conservative in that, given the religious ethos of the country, the number of separated people who seek a divorce will probably represent less than 75 per cent over the five-year period.  The figure of 50 per cent for divorced people who remarry is also conservative.  The experience elsewhere shows that fewer divorced people remarry.  Anyone who studies pension reports knows that many more women than men survive their spouses.  We have based our costs on these reasonable assumptions.  Given possible variations in the figures, it would be impossible to give the cost over a 30-year period.  However, I have given an undertaking to give the Deputy the figures covering a ten-year period during the debate on the Bill on Thursday.</P>

      <P>This Bill deals with social welfare entitlements, not housing or health entitlements.  The estimated cost of the change in FIS will be minimal.  It must be borne in mind that this supplement is payable to people on low pay, people below a certain social welfare limit, and their being in a position to support a second spouse and maintain a first spouse is virtually impossible.  The likelihood is that the former spouse would be better off claiming a lone parent allowance in his or her own right.  The estimated cost of the change in FIS is so small that it is virtually impossible to measure.</P>

      <Quest>the steps, if any, he has taken to effect a long term restructuring of the State pension provision taking into account the growing burden of providing for contributory pensions out of the PRSI fund and in view of projections that PRSI pension costs to the State will be doubled by the year 2035.</Quest>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 40 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="521" /> On a number of occasions recently I have drawn attention to the demographic patterns which indicate a considerable increase in the proportion of elderly people in the population over the first half of the next century.  This will have a significant impact on the future costs of social welfare pensions, which, as the Deputies point out, are set to increase by some 100 per cent by the year 2035.  At the same time the ratio of persons in the economically active age group to those over age 65 is projected to fall.  This would result, in the absence of any change, in an increasing burden of the cost of pensions falling on future generations of PRSI contributors and taxpayers.  These are important factors in any consideration of the development of future pension arrangements and raise serious questions about the capacity of the present financing arrangements to meet these emerging costs and is an issue that must be addressed.  The pensions industry is also placing considerable emphasis on this issue at present.</P>
    <P>The final report of the National Pensions Board, &ldquo;Developing the National Pension System&rdquo;, raised and considered these issues.  This report is being considered within my Department at present and I intend to bring forward, in due course, proposals based on its recommendations.</P>
    <P>In this context, a major survey of occupational pension schemes, which was recommended in the National Pensions Board report, has been commissioned and will be available next year.  The last major survey was carried out in 1985 and the results of the new survey, which is being financed mainly by my Department, will give essential up-to-date information on occupational cover, which will be of considerable assistance when proposals in relation to pensions are being formulated.</P>
    <P>I have also stated frequently in recent times that demands to abolish or significantly reduce contributions to the social insurance fund are short-sighted given the demands which are currently being placed on it and which will grow in the <Col N="522" /> years ahead.  We must preserve the principle of solidarity embodied in the PRSI system if we are to guarantee pensions needed in the future due to the ageing of the population.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that there is no danger to anyone's pension entitlement. However, as I pointed out earlier, this is an issue which we cannot afford to ignore.  Provided we face up over the next few years to the needs which we know will arise because of the demographic changes, we can plan to deal with them in an orderly and effective way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">

      <P>I am glad the Minister is taking seriously this matter which is of concern to many people.  I might have couched my question in different terms given that some people, including Members of this House, are seeking to reverse the greying process.  We will not get away with this indefinitely.  Has the Minister had any meetings with the pensions industry on this matter?  Recent reports suggest that the State will find it increasingly difficult to fund pensions as the age profile of the population gets older.  There must be co-ordination between the Government and the pensions industry on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 31, 46, 57, 60, 63, 78, 154 and 155 together.</P>
      <P>The carer's allowance is a social assistance scheme which provides an income maintenance payment to people who are providing elderly or incapacitated pensioners with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below certain limits.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1990, a total of 2,563 people were in receipt of carer's allowance at a cost of £0.97 million.  In 1991 and 1992, the numbers were 3,959 and 4,437 respectively involving costs of £6 million and £10 million.  In 1993 and 1994, the figures were 4,748 and 5,392 respectively with expenditure coming to £11.5 million and £14.4 million.</P>
      <P>At the end of April this year, there was a total of 5,810 carer's allowances in payment of which 4,209 were awarded at the maximum rate.  It is estimated that expenditure on the scheme for this year will be £20.1 million, an increase of £6 million over last year.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the criticism of the means test.  However, the means testing arrangements have been eased in recent years.  Last year, the initial disregard of income of £2 per week was increased to £6.  In addition, the first £100 of a spouse's weekly earnings were disregarded in the calculation of the allowance. This figure is being increased to £150 this year and covers other forms of spouse's income.  However, any further relaxation of the means test which would involve the carer's own income, such as income from self-employment, would have cost implications which could only be examined in a budgetary context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recognition of the role of carers who look after people with disabilities in the home, a respite care fund was established by my Department in 1993 involving an initial sum of £500,000. This fund provides resources to finance respite care thus allowing carers of people with disabilities to avail of breaks from their caring duties.  An additional £500,000 was added to the fund in 1994.  From this year, the <Col N="526" /> Department of Health has responsibility for administration of the fund.</P>
    <P>It is a specific condition of the scheme that the carer lives with the person they provide with full-time care and attention. To extend the scheme to include carers who are not resident with the persons being cared for would involve a significant increase in expenditure and I am not convinced it would be the best use of additional resources for the scheme at this time.  My Department does not maintain statistics as to the type of payment the person may have been receiving prior to qualifying for a carer's allowance.</P>
    <P>Credited contributions, or &ldquo;credits&rdquo; as they are termed, are intended to protect the entitlements, particularly the pension rights, of employees and other persons participating in the social insurance system when they are ill or unemployed.  The award of credits is subject to certain conditions.  For example, a person who has no PRSI contributions paid or credited for two full tax years cannot get credits.  Subject to such conditions, a person who is giving constant care and attention to a person as a carer is awarded credits on the same basis as if they were unemployed because of illness or unemployment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason I specifically concentrate on the importance of giving credits to full-time carers is that while we pay lip service to carers and the great work they do &mdash; they give up jobs and possible earnings and get little credit from the State but yet, save the State a fortune in terms of institutional care &mdash; when they come to retirement age they do not qualify for a pension. Will the Minister give an assurance that he will introduce changes which will ensure that all full-time carers in the community will be entitled to a contributory pension on retirement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The short answer is that I am not in a position to give that assurance.  The carer's allowance is an innovation introduced by my predecessor. In Opposition I gave credit to <Col N="527" /> the former Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Woods, when he introduced the scheme which is a very good scheme in principle and has been improved gradually since its introduction.  It is my intention to improve it and there are a number of ways in which this can be done.  It is a question of deciding what is possible within the resources available given the demands which are also made in relation to other areas in the social welfare system.  It is a question of trying to balance the resources available and the best benefit for those delivering care. There is some concern about the fact that the number of carers will be increased by 1,000 this year because of changes in the income disregard and the fact that we are now taking into account people who have occupational pensions as well as social welfare pensions.  We expect that 1,000 will be added to the numbers currently on the scheme.  We are spending £20 million on the scheme this year, a significant sum of money. We could decide to change the means test which would bring many more people into the scheme and leave the current rates of payment as they are or we could increase the rates of payment but maintain the means test as at present.  We could improve the secondary benefits for carers or, as the Deputy suggests, examine the question of credits for pensions and so on.  There is a range of things that might be done, all of which must be considered in the context of available resources.  I am very supportive of this scheme and I would like to see it developed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>While improving the carer's allowance is a matter we debate here on a regular basis with the Minister I would like to concentrate on credits in regard to pensions.  It is unfair that so many people, mostly women, in the community who provide full-time care on a long-term basis when they come close to retirement age discover they are at a disadvantage and not entitled to a contributory pension because they did not work all their lives <Col N="528" /> and because they gave up work to provide care.  We all say they are marvellous and that they have saved the State a huge sum of money.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Can we not concentrate today on the straightforward question as distinct from the general question of care?  Can the Minister say if it will be possible for people who have provided care all their lives on a full-time basis in the community &mdash; and who saved the State huge sums in institutional care &mdash; to be protected on retirement with a contributory pension? They should not suffer because of the great work they have done throughout their lives.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Deputy that I am not in a position to give such a commitment on this issue.  Areas of the carer's allowance require improvement.  The provision of guaranteeing contributory pensions to people in this situation would have a cost implication.  We talked earlier about the pension costs we will face over the next 35-40 years.  In about 40 years' time we will be facing something like a 100 per cent increase in pension costs.  It is not an issue on which we can lightly make commitments; it has to be done in the context of other resources and issues that have a bearing on it.  The carer will be entitled to a non-contributory pension depending on means. There is no question therefore of carers being abandoned.  If they do not qualify for a contributory pension they will be entitled to claim a non-contributory pension which, like other allowances, is means tested.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Minister is taking the issue as seriously as I would like.  He said that carers will be entitled to a non-contributory pension but the people we are talking about are those who give up good jobs and who would be entitled to a contributory <Col N="529" /> pension.  They also give up the opportunity to earn considerable sums and to accrue savings in return for a carer's allowance or some other supplementary payment.  We do not offer them any protection throughout their working lives. We need to bear in mind that they will continue to work throughout their lives and provide care 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  All we say to them when they reach pension age is &ldquo;Thanks for all you have done and for all you have saved the State in terms of institutional and other costs but we would still like you to undergo a means test for non-contributory pension&rdquo;.  The Minister should seriously consider providing credits for carers whom we compliment so much but do so little for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of how we should use the resources that will be available in developing the scheme should not be approached on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  If a carer does not qualify for a contributory pension, he or she may well qualify for a non-contributory pension, depending on means.  They are not being abandoned.</P>

      <P>I have acknowledged as often as anyone else in this House the great work that carers do but we cannot separate them on that basis <Col N="530" /> from the rest of society and say that they must receive special treatment when they reach pension age.  I would prefer if my Department and the Department of Health looked at the carer's allowance and the question of care in the home to ensure that people would not have to provide care 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days of the year.  It is not right that we expect them to do this.</P>

      <P>I realise that but I would much prefer to see the Deputy arguing and campaigning for change to ensure that there would be no exploitation. I will try to ensure in so far as I can that the carer's allowance delivered to those providing full-time care is adequate and fair.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Social Welfare</askee>
      <Quest> if his attention has been drawn to the fact that as the Fourth European Poverty Programme has been held up in the Council of Ministers for almost one year there has been no funding from this source for Irish anti-poverty projects since June 1994; and the action, if any, he intends to take in this regard.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 143 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, proposals for a Fourth EU Poverty Programme to combat social exclusion <Col N="531" /> came up for decision at the Social Affairs Council meeting in April 1994. The Commission had proposed a doubling of the budget to 121 million ECUs.  This proposal for a Fourth Poverty Programme, which requires unanimity, has, however, been blocked by Germany.  The German Government objected not only to the timing of the new programme and to the doubling of the budget but also raised objections in principle to the proposal.</P>
    <P>The Commission's proposal for a Fourth Poverty Programme is on the agenda again at the Social Affairs Council on 29 June 1995.  If it is not possible to secure unanimity on this issue, then Ireland will be looking for some form of mechanism whereby member states will be able to work together in the European Union to keep poverty and social exclusion on the agenda and to allocate the funding already provided in the EU budget.</P>
    <P>For its own part, the Government is keeping poverty and social exclusion to the forefront on the national agenda following the recent Government decision to develop an anti-poverty strategy which will involve Government Departments drawing up specific plans to target poverty in Irish society.  I will be urging that this action at national level should be matched by ongoing actions at European Union level to ensure a continued emphasis on the need for concerted approaches aimed at reducing levels of poverty and disadvantage.</P>
    <P>The failure to agree a new poverty programme does not affect the three Irish projects funded under the Third Poverty Programme.  Continued funding for the work of the projects has been made available under my Department's community development programme and from other sources.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that 121 million ECU is a substantial sum?  The people to whom I have spoken about this matter would like to see him make more robust efforts at European level to secure agreement on <Col N="532" /> this matter.  Can the Minister give us an assurance that agreement will be reached at the council meeting to be held at the end of this month?</P>

      <P>The global figure to be provided by the European Union is 121 million ECU, only a proportion of which will be provided to Ireland.  In addition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I already know that as I have been to Europe several times. Ireland will be entitled to receive a substantial proportion of the 121 million ECU provided the Minister makes our case.  There is no evidence that he will do this.  While his efforts at European level are feeble, he is good at giving lectures here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1992 Maastricht Treaty on European Union contains an agreement on social policy which was signed by all member states with the exception of the United Kingdom.  This agreement further widened the scope for social action and established the combating of social exclusion as a goal for the Union while easing the decision-making rules for future initiatives in the social policy area.  The Third Poverty Programme was a further development designed mainly around a smaller number of large scale projects.  There are three Irish projects under the programme, all of which are currently being funded by my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government is doing everything that is humanly possible to try to overcome the objections by the German Government to the Fourth Poverty Programme. The German Government has fundamental objections to it and the programme cannot proceed without unanimity.  It is on the agenda at the Social Affairs Council at the end of this <Col N="533" /> month when we will make every effort to ensure it is carried through.</P>
    <P>It was first placed on the agenda more than a year ago when the Deputy was a member of the Government.  I am sure he knows precisely what the obstacles are and how difficult it will be to overcome them.  I have made it clear that if we fail to overcome them on 29 June &mdash; the Fourth Poverty Programme is supported by every member state except Germany which remains adamant in its opposition &mdash; we will still be insisting that action be taken at European level to ensure that the issues of poverty and social exclusion remain on the European agenda and that the money provided is spent.  I emphasise that we are not waiting for action to be taken at European level on this issue.  The Government is taking its own initiatives in this area at home.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate whether he or his officials had meetings with his counterpart in Germany to ensure the obstacles are removed?  Obviously unless the necessary homework is done before the Council of Ministers' meeting it is unlikely agreement will be reached. Does it not, therefore, behove the Minister and his officials to engage in protracted negotiations to ensure these obstacles are removed so that this country benefits to the tune to which it is entitled?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The German Government objects to this programme. First, it expressed concern about the increase in the budget &mdash; doubling it to 121 million ECUs &mdash; for the poverty programme.  It also objects in principle to the idea of a European anti-poverty programme &mdash; this objection was made in the initial stages in April 1994 &mdash; claiming that the Commission does not have competence in this area.  No other member state objects in principle to the proposal although there are varying opinions on the size of the budget. There is implacable opposition to this <Col N="534" /> programme.  My Department, the Taoiseach's Department and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Enterprise and Employment have made strenuous efforts, making contact directly with the German Chancellor on this issue, but to no avail.  All other member states are pressing to have this programme put into effect but the Germans are adamant they do not want it.  It is logical to see what we can do on 29 June to have this measure adopted and, if not, ensure an alternative is put in place so that exclusion and poverty remain on the agenda and that the money the European Union has already provided for this matter is spent in a proper way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been in constant contact not only with my counterpart but with Chancellor Kohl on the issue and Germany persists in its refusal to accept this programme.  If the Deputy has a magic wand to overcome that objection, which has resisted pressure from all member states, he has much to answer for because Fianna Fáil should have dealt with it when it was in power up to December of last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33, 56 and 69 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is currently involved in discussions with the Department of Health and the health boards on the transfer of the disabled person's maintenance scheme to my Department. There is considerable detail to be addressed in the arrangements for this transfer in relation to the present operation of the scheme within health boards, medical and means assessments as well as training and rehabilitation arrangements for recipients of the allowance.  The transfer of data in relation to the 31,000 people at present in receipt of the allowance is in itself a complex process in that there are eight different systems in operation which are not readily compatible with my Department's central records system.</P>
      <P>In view of the complexity of adapting eight different administrative systems to ensure the provision of one streamlined service, the transfer will not take place until the beginning of 1996.  Provision for the transfer will be included in the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill which I will introduce later this year.  In that Bill I also intend to address a number of the anomalies which exist in relation to payments under the scheme.  I will also take account of any recommendations emerging from the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities due to be published later this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a wide range of groups representing people with disabilities.  It is intended to meet representative groups in the near future to discuss their concerns and recommendations in relation to the transfer process.  I am confident <Col N="536" /> that that transfer of responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme to my Department and the improvements to the scheme which I intend to make will achieve efficient and effective arrangements for people with disabilities dependent on the scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryWallace" hpid="Miss M. Wallace Miss M. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to meet representatives of disabled adults and reasonable to expect the Government to consult all relevant people. While the Minister said he intends to meet these people in the near future I am anxious that he meet them before the Social Welfare (No. 3) Bill is drawn up.  In March this year the Minister said in reply to a question from me that a detailed assessment was being made and that he intended to ensure the new arrangements provide an improved and more streamlined service.  Have meetings taken place since March and is progress being made in the consultation process?</P>

We have received from the Department of Health a list of organisations with whom it has been dealing on this matter and we will use that list as our basis for meeting these groups.  No legislation will be brought forward without hearing the views of the group involved.</P>

We are aware the Minister has let people down badly, particularly the elderly, with a 2.5 per cent increase in benefit.

      <P>I am concerned that the Minister told us he will argue for money for people with disabilities, but in this year's budget there was a 2.5 per cent increase in social welfare although inflation is 3 per cent.  It is difficult for some people to cope especially those depending on social welfare and those with disabilities.  Democratic Left's submission to the Commission on the Status of People with Disability recommended they should receive a minimum weekly income of £150.  The Minister is in a position to assist those people, but he has not done so.  While he said he will continue to raise this matter in Government, talking about it and doing something about it are two different things.  Deputies should not make proposals in Opposition which they are not prepared to implement in Government. They must make realistic proposals and when they return to Government be prepared to implement them.  Democratic Left members must have believed <Col N="540" /> they would form part of this Government or they would not have made that submission, now that they are in Government people with disabilities are asking that they deliver on their recommendation.</P>

I am very conscious of the difficulties for social welfare recipients created by the total loss of the adult dependant allowance when the dependent spouse earns more than £60 per week.  This has given rise to distortions in certain industries where extra working or overtime is not availed of &mdash; and in some cases, pay increases are foregone &mdash; because of the impact on the spouse's adult dependant allowance.</P>
      <P>For this reason I took regulatory powers in the Social Welfare Act, 1995, for the introduction of an adult dependant allowance related to the earnings of the spouse or partner.  The proposed new arrangements are being worked on by my Department at present and, as I announced during the Second Stage debate on the Bill, the new provisions will be introduced next year.</P>

      <P>Overtime payments in my Department in 1994 amounted to £2.4 million.  This represents 3.3 per cent of the total 1994 expenditure on pay.</P>
      <P>Overtime is worked in my Department to ensure that it delivers its services in a timely manner.  It is used in areas where experience and special skills are necessary and to cover peaks in the normal workload.  Seasonal factors such as budget changes also necessitate overtime working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are three State agencies under the aegis of my Department &mdash; the Combat Poverty Agency, The Pensions Board and the National Social Services <Col N="542" /> Board.  Neither the Combat Poverty Agency nor The Pensions Board incurred expenditure on overtime in 1994.  The National Social Services Board incurred expenditure of approximately £650 in 1994.</P>

      <P>The Deputy's question does not refer to a particular year, but we have taken 1994 as the most relevant period.  Overtime expenditure in that year was £2.408 million, representing 3.3 per cent of the total 1994 expenditure on pay.  The main expenditure areas for 1994 on individual items was £0.78 million on local offices, £0.265 million on part of the ISTS computerisation project and £0.274 million on the ISTS project in local offices, £0.36 million on the pensions services office, £0.446 million on other social welfare services and £0.280 million on the Aireacht.  Local offices tend to use substantial amounts of overtime each year to cover staff on annual and sick leave and to deal with seasonal factors giving rise to fluctuations in the live register.</P>

      <P>I do not believe it would be a proper use of departmental resources to use staff to dig out that type of information.  As I already pointed out, we have 4,000 staff and overtime payments in my Department in 1994 amounted to £2.4 million.  Most, it not all, local offices use overtime at some time during the year.  In addition, because of the exceptionally heavy workload at budget time, overtime is required and is also required to deal with matters regarding the live register. From what I told the Deputy it is obvious that probably the majority of staff at some time avail of overtime.  It would be a total waste of departmental resources &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Deputy has an odd sense about what is open and transparent if he cannot accept that I have given him specific statistics.  A total of £2.4 million was spent on overtime payments in my Department in 1994. There are 4,000 staff in the Department, most of whom do overtime to some degree during the year and I indicated the matters on which there is a need for staff to do overtime.  I am sure the Deputy can divide £2.4 million by 4,000 and arrive at the figure he is seeking.</P>

    <Title>Tourist Traffic Bill, 1995: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. E. Kenny) Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. E. Kenny)">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Tourism and Transport (Mr. E. Kenny)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As indicated in the explanatory memorandum which I have circulated, the purpose of the Tourist Traffic Bill, 1995 is to enable Bord Fáilte Éireann to delegate to a contractor certain of its tourist accommodation inspection and associated functions and powers under the Tourist Traffic Acts, 1939 to 1987 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988. The functions and powers in question relate to the registration and grading of a range of tourist accommodation and the licensing of restaurants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe it would be useful to outline briefly the background to this Bill.  In the context of reviewing the effectiveness of existing arrangements to promote Ireland as a tourist destination, Arthur D. Little Limited of London were commissioned as consultants by my predecessor in 1994 to carry out a fundamental review of Bord Fáilte.  The conclusions and recommendations contained in their final report &mdash; copies of <Col N="655" /> which have been provided to the Library &mdash; were accepted by the Government in November 1994.  When I took up office at the Department of Tourism and Trade in December last, I reviewed the position and decided to press ahead with the implementation of the findings in the review.</P>
    <P>It is important to recall that the consultants recognised that Bord Fáilte had done a good job for Irish tourism over the years.  However, times change and there was a need for change in the Board as well.  Because of its unstructured and organic growth over the years Bord Fáilte Éireann had developed into a multifunctional body and was undertaking more activities than was desirable. In addition to marketing and promotion, it had become involved in the registration and regulation of a very wide range of tourist accommodation and services.  It was deciding on EU grant applications, publishing a wide range of brochures, running the Tidy Towns competition and so on.  Although important in their own right, those other activities were not necessarily supportive of the overseas marketing and promotion functions which should be at the heart of Bord Fáilte's role.  In reality, they almost certainly led to a significant diminution in the level of dedicated and focused team effort that should characterise a dynamic international marketing organisation.</P>
    <P>Moreover, it is clear that the Irish tourism industry has grown and matured in recent years and is now willing and able to take on more responsibility for its future development. Accordingly it is less in need of the intensive handholding and paternal direction which characterised the role of Bord Fáilte in earlier times.</P>
    <P>The consultants concluded &mdash; quite rightly in my view &mdash; that Bord Fáilte, in future, should concentrate on its core activities of selling Ireland as a tourist destination overseas, helping the less mature elements of the industry to develop and providing market intelligence to industry decision makers.  The <Col N="656" /> review envisaged Bord Fáilte strengthening its marketing capabilities and, with a view to filling skill gaps, introducing new blood with industry experience. As an essential part of the change process, Bord Fáilte Éireann would transfer or cease some of is existing activities and its overall staff complement would be reduced by up to 70.</P>
    <P>The ADL review was well received by the Irish tourism industry, in political circles and by the media and this convinced me that it had general acceptance and should be urgently implemented.  I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor.  Deputy Charlie McCreevy, who was instrumental in commissioning the review.  While I have said before in public that I might take issue with his at times confrontational style <i>vis-á-vis</i> Bord Fáilte, I believe he had at heart the interest of the continued successful development of the tourism sector.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to inform the House that much progress has been made since the beginning of the year in implementing the ADL review.  A high level steering committee is overseeing the change process and has already met on ten occasions.  As I said at a recent appearance before the Select Committee on Enterprise and Economic Strategy, we are now seeing clear evidence of the much desired internal organisational and cultural changes within the bord.  A new mission statement and organisational structure has been put in place together with related senior staff changes.  A new dynamic international marketing director has been appointed with an impressive track record in private industry.  An attractive voluntary severance package has been available to staff which will enable the organisation to be revitalised and reinvigorated through staff movement and some limited recruitment of new blood.  The &ldquo;new Bord Fáilte&rdquo; will be progressively launched over the summer months and we will see an exciting rebirth of the organisation and a new era in the marketing of Ireland overseas as a first-class holiday destination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="657" /> As regards existing Bord Fáilte functions to be divested, the tendering procedure for the registration and grading of accommodation is well advanced. Tenders are currently being evaluated and, subject to enactment of this Bill, I hope the new arrangements &mdash; of which I will speak later &mdash; could be put in place by September.  My Department has also completed a consultative process with the key groups of accommodation providers affected by the proposed changes to ensure they fully understand what is being done and to take their concerns on board.</P>
    <P>On the product approvals, or nonregistered tourist accommodation and services side, a number of the key associations, for example, in the bed and breakfast sector, have now taken up the challenge of accepting a greater level of responsibility for enforcing their own standards.  Last week I had the pleasure of hosting a reception to announce the formal recognition of the Town and Country Homes Association and the Irish Farm Holidays Association as approving bodies for the Irish homes sector and the awarding of the shamrock symbol.  I do not rule out the recognition of further associations subject to acceptable standards being met.</P>
    <P>The tenders for Bord Fáilte's European Union product development grant administration role have been received and are currently being assessed to determine if costs and other considerations justify this function being contracted out.</P>
    <P>The Tidy Towns competition has been transferred to the Department of the Environment and the Discover Ireland holiday brochure series has been put out to private tender.  The Gulliver computerised information and reservation system has been fundamentally reassessed to see if it can be satisfactorily reconfigured in the context of an external commercial arrangement.</P>
    <P>This is a series of dramatic changes which I believe represents a new and exciting chapter in the history of Bord Fáilte.  I know that the chairman, board, director general, management, staff and <Col N="658" /> unions &mdash; after some understandable initial reluctance &mdash; are taking up the challenge with enthusiasm and I am grateful for their support.  Much care has been taken to ensure a full and comprehensive dialogue with the unions and staff in view of all the sensitivities involved.  No compulsory redundancies are envisaged.  I also wish to acknowledge the support and patience of the industry in regard to the changes being put in place.  Change is always unsettling and demands adaptability and intelligence to accommodate it.</P>
    <P>The Bill before us does not constitute a major overhaul of the Tourist Traffic Acts which govern the operations of Bord Fáilte and the registration, grading and approval of tourist accommodation. My objective has been to implement the ADL review with the minimum of legislative change and disruption to the industry.  As I said earlier, one of the major changes recommended by the consultants was the subcontracting by Bord Fáilte to a commercial third party of certain inspection and associated functions in relation to the registration and grading of tourist accommodation. As these are statutory powers and functions at present vested in Bord Fáilte, amending legislation is necessary to allow the bord delegate them to a third party.</P>
    <P>Under the current tourist traffic legislation the following categories of establishment require mandatory registration with Bord Fáilte; hotels, guesthouses, holiday hostels, youth hostels, holiday camps, caravan and camping sites, and holiday cottages and holiday apartment group schemes.</P>
    <P>The standards to be applied, together with the relevant fees payable, in the case of each of the categories are provided for in regulations made under the Acts by the board, with the consent of the Minister for Tourism and Trade. Classification &mdash; or grading, as it is more commonly referred to &mdash; is not mandatory but is provided for under the current legislation and applies to hotels, guesthouses, caravan and camping sites and holiday cottages and apartments.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> The Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1988 provides that in order to obtain a special restaurant licence the proprietor must present a Bord Fáilte certificate.  The Act empowers Bord Fáilte to inspect restaurants for the purpose of issuing such a certificate.  The inspection criteria to be applied and the fee payable are laid down in regulations made, under the Act, by the Minister for Tourism and Trade with the consent of the Minister for Justice.  It is my intention to review the criteria for certified restaurants to see if they can be simplified somewhat while maintaining high standards.</P>
    <P>The Tourist Traffic Bill, 1995 will enable the board to delegate to a contractor the bulk of its inspection and associated functions in relation to registration and grading of tourist accommodation and in relation to special restaurant licences.</P>
    <P>Under the new arrangements, the board will continue to retain ownership of the registration and grading standards, which means they will continue to set the criteria for registration and grading and to prescribe the various fees involved by regulation made under the provisions of the Tourist Traffic Acts, with the consent of the Minister for Tourism and Trade.  Bord Fáilte will also continue to retain responsibility for the operation of the final stages of the appeals mechanism provided for under the Acts, when applications for registration and renewal of registration are refused and in the case of cancellation of registration.  They will also be involved in the final stages of the appeals mechanism for grading of accommodation.  They will have a key role also in monitoring the performance of the contractor and in the selection process.  All other aspects of the inspection process will, in future, be undertaken by the third party contractor.</P>
    <P>The key roles being retained by Bord Fáilte in the registration, grading and certification process will be critical in ensuring that the board maintains tight control on the standards and procedures <Col N="660" /> to be used while relieving them of the more routine physical inspection procedures. I am acutely conscious of the importance of maintaining high quality standards for tourist accommodation and there is no reason to believe that the changes envisaged under this Bill will adversely affect the current situation.</P>
    <P>In selecting an external contractor to undertake the functions to be outsourced, we will be assessing tenders against a set of key criteria which will include (i) capability and experience to undertake the role, (ii) cost efficiency within the existing fee structures, (iii) financial offers to Bord Fáilte for the right to provide the service and collect associated fees, (iv) transparency and objectivity in the activities to be undertaken and (v) accountability.  It is envisaged that the successful tenderer will be awarded the contract for five years but subject to a yearly review clause.  Bord Fáilte will also have the right to cancel the contract in the event of unacceptable performance.</P>
    <P>The Bill is quite short and comprises nine sections and a Schedule.  The explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill explains the proposed changes in detail.  Section 2 allows Bord Fáilte to delegate to a third party, subject to contract, certain of its inspection powers and functions as set out in the schedule.  Section 3 allows the board to make regulations governing the terms and conditions of any such contract. Section 4 provides for termination of a contract where this is deemed appropriate. Section 5 allows employees of the contractor to be designated as registration officers, or inspectors, subject to appropriate controls.  The remaining sections deal with certain legal consequences in relation to holding of the accommodation registers and opinions of the board.  I will be happy to deal on Committee Stage with any specific question Deputies might have.</P>
    <P>It would be useful to give the House a brief update on developments in the tourism sector generally in the context of this Bill.  The economic importance of <Col N="661" /> tourism has grown enormously in recent years.  Earlier this month I launched a major consultancy study of the economic impact of tourism in Ireland by Tansey.  Webster and Associates under the auspices of the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation.  Some of the findings were extremely interesting and I would like to share them with Deputies.  For the first time in 1994, the number of overseas visitors coming to Ireland, at 3.68 million, exceeded the size of the domestic population; tourism's contribution to GNP has risen from 4.8 per cent in 1986 to close to 7 per cent in 1993, tourism supports employment for over 90,000 at present and is closing the gap on primary agriculture as a source of jobs in Ireland.  Tourism has been one of the major growth sectors in the Irish economy with continued potential for further development and job creation.  It is labour intensive, has a negligible import content and a strong regional development dimension.  We can achieve continued growth while at the same time protecting our environment by careful management and a wider seasonal spread of tourist numbers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Andrews knows all these Deputies were listening intently to my speech on tourism growth in each of their respective constituencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The year 1994 was very good for tourism and continues a pattern of uninterrupted growth in revenue and visitor numbers since the late 1980's.  Recently released Central Statistics Office figures <Col N="662" /> show that the number of overseas tourists is estimated to have increased by over 10 per cent in 1994.  Revenue spent by overseas visitors increased by 10 per cent also to £1.5 billion.  Much of the 1994 growth was attributable to especially improved performances in the American and British markets.</P>
    <P>I am optimistic that 1995 will be an excellent year as well.  Figures released by the CSO very recently show that the number of overseas visitors to Ireland in the period January to March represented an increase of nearly 17 per cent on the same period last year.  To achieve the ambitious medium-term growth targets which are included in the EU Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99, we have set specific targets for each of our principal markets in 1995.  The new structures and initiatives which we are putting in place in Bord Fáilte, in our international marketing effort, in this year's Finance Act and through EU development grants, will provide an added boost for achieving our goals in 1995.  The ongoing peace in Northern Ireland is of course, of tremendous benefit as well and I will touch on this later.</P>
    <P>Turning to the international marketing of Ireland, I have allocated £4 million to the OTMI &mdash; the overseas tourism marketing initiative &mdash; in 1995. When complementary finance from the tourism industry, North and South, is included the total budget for this campaign this year amounts to £6.3 million. The OTMI represents the continuation of a consumer marketing partnership between Government and the private sector which was pioneered in last year's US marketing initiative.  That campaign was extremely successful.  CSO estimates show that an overall increase of some 17 per cent in North American visitors was achieved by Ireland last year compared with an average 8 per cent growth by our European competitors.</P>
    <P>This year's OTMI campaign is aimed at increasing tourist numbers and revenue from our four most important markets &mdash; the US, Britain, Germany <Col N="663" /> and France.  An exciting new dimension is the involvement of the Northern Ireland tourism industry.  For the first time ever, all the tourism interests on the island have come together in a large scale programme to market Ireland as a single destination &mdash; one of an increasing number of marketing co-operation initiatives being pursued on a joint North-South basis.</P>
    <P>The OTMI strategy again consists primarily of generic &ldquo;Visit Ireland&rdquo; advertising on TV and in newspapers and magazines.  Inquirers in each market receive a custom-produced brochure which features the product of the participating companies and organisations together with the Bord Fáilte and Northern Ireland Tourist Board literature.</P>
    <P>Work on the development of an international brand for Irish tourism was initiated in 1994 through the Tourism Council.  This is a very exciting project and is part of a comprehensive look at Ireland, the brand and its communication. I have already said publicly I believe it has the potential to bring a new dynamism to our international marketing effort in co-operation with the industry.  Consultants were appointed to develop the visioning process of the brand development and have reported their findings.  Bord Fáilte's new international marketing director is now leading an industry partnership group to take the process forward with the objective of relaunching the Ireland brand progressively in 1996.</P>
    <P>The EU Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-99, under which investment of over £650 million is envisaged with associated grants of £370 million, is now in place for six months.  I am glad to report that interest in the programme is very intense and over 1,000 applications for grant assistance have been received.  The management boards which decide on individual grant applications under the programme have already established an excellent record <Col N="664" /> for independent and rigorous appraisal of projects.</P>
    <P>Under the product development sub-programme of the OP some 50 of the 250 applications received have been decided to date.  The approvals cover a wide range of tourism product, including visitor information, visitor centres, leisure and conference centres, tourism angling, cruising, walking and adventure sports.  One of the major flagship projects in this sub-programme is the establishment of a national conference centre. I intend to bring this matter before the Government shortly, in order to obtain clear support to proceed with the development of the centre at an early date.</P>
    <P>The marketing sub-programme of the OP is well under way also with decisions made on some 100 of the 400 or so applications received to date.  The most significant initiative undertaken in 1994 has been the OTMI campaign to which I referred earlier.  Almost 8,000 people completed training in 1994 on over 600 ESF sponsored training courses under the training sub-programme of the OP. Of the 1,380 unemployed persons receiving certification, almost 1,000 (72 per cent) gained full-time employment, with the balance obtaining part-time work or progressing to further education/training or to sheltered employment.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, I am well satisfied with overall progress under the tourism operational programme.  I am conscious of the need to ensure that EU funds are spent wisely with a view to putting in place the industry infrastructure which will carry us into the next century.</P>
    <P>This year's budget and Finance Act will help to strengthen the Irish tourism industry through a variety of both general and specific measures.  I am very pleased that the pilot renewal scheme for traditional resort areas was included, and I am confident this measure will have a revitalising effect on the specific towns and areas to be covered.  The scheme is based on the very successful <Col N="665" /> urban renewal scheme and it incorporates many of the features of that scheme, notably, accelerated capital allowances, double rent allowances and rented residental accommodation relief. The details are set out in the Finance Act and the scheme will now be promoted by my Department and the tourism support agencies.  Ultimately, the success of the scheme will depend on the commitment and energy of the investors and entrepreneurs who come forward with development projects.  The tourism industry will also benefit greatly from a number of general taxation provisions under the Finance Act, 1995, such as PRSI reliefs and reduction in corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>The peace process in Northern Ireland has enormous potential for the further development of tourism on the island and has already resulted in a redefinition of our policies and strategies.</P>
    <P>I referred already to the £6.3 million Overseas Tourism Marketing Initiative which for the first time ever brought the public and private sectors in Ireland and Northern Ireland together.  This is a unique partnership which is selling tourism on the island in our major markets abroad.  I have met my Northern Ireland counterpart, Baroness Denton, on numerous occasions in recent months and we have announced a range of cross-Border regional marketing initiatives, as well as participated jointly in numerous events, most recently at the White House Conference on Trade and Investment in Ireland.  In Washington, we were joined by the chief executives of our two tourist boards who made an effective joint presentation to US business on the investment needs of the industry on the island.  A tourism communique was signed on behalf of the American, Irish and British Governments. The International Fund for Ireland, the new INTERREG programme and the forthcoming special support programme for peace and reconciliation are all creating new opportunities for North-South contact <Col N="666" /> at Governmental, tourist board, community and business levels.</P>
    <P>It is clear from what I have said that these are exciting times for tourism.  The industry has developed very substantially in recent years and high levels of investment are being made to improve our product.  We have always had a reputation as a country of great national beauty where, despite recent isolated crimes against tourists, a warm welcome is guaranteed.  These attributes have now been enhanced through a major improvement in tourist accommodation and visitor attractions, together with a growing level of maturity and professionalism in the industry.</P>
    <P>The Tourist Traffic Bill, 1995 is a reflection of the changes made in tourism. It will play its part in helping to reposition Bord Fáilte among the best of national tourism organisations, making its unique contribution to the continued growth and development of tourism.  It is my intention to prove beyond doubt that following the implementation of these changes Bord Fáilte will be clearly established as the premier tourism board in Europe.  Once again I commend the Bill to the House and look forward to hearing contributions from Deputies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. Andrews Mr. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his complimentary references to his predecessor in office, Deputy Charlie McCreevy.  I would have expected no less from this Minister whose generous remarks are appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the spade work was done by Deputy McCreevy and we are now reaping the rewards of his far sightedness in respect of the review undertaken by the consultants, Arthur D. Little, much of which I agree with, but parts of which I have doubts about.  A number of the recommendations will never see the light of day, although the Minister indicated that the report will be fully implemented.  I will not hold my breath but I will take the Minister's word because I believe him to be an honourable man who to date has been doing a good job in the Department which will <Col N="667" /> be shown to be effective in ordering the disparate tourism industry, which the Minister has described as fundamentally important to the future of this country. In real terms he said it may be catching up with agriculture and that, for the first time this year there will be more tourists visiting the country than there are members of the domestic population.</P>
    <P>These are significant features of the Minister's speech, apart altogether from other items he has raised which will need closer scrutiny and broader elaboration during the debate on this Bill which is fundamentally important to the future of tourism here.  The report correctly focuses attention on what Bord Fáilte was originally set up to do &mdash; sell Ireland abroad.  It carries out that function well but it could do better.  For that reason alone we welcome the Bill.  It is the kind of Bill Deputy McCreevy might have introduced had he been Minister and we support it.</P>
    <P>The legislation is broadly in line with the recommendations of the Arthur D. Little Report.  Bord Fáilte should be able to subcontract to a third party contractor certain inspection functions regarding the registration and grading of tourist accommodation.  It is important that Bord Fáilte be freed up to deal with its core activities &mdash; selling Ireland abroad, helping the less developed elements of the tourism industry and providing information to industry decision makers.  I am glad, as the Minister stated, that Bord Fáilte will retain ownership of the registration and grading standards.  This is important for the industry as the board will continue to set the criteria for registration and grading and will prescribe the fees involved.  It is also right that it retains responsibility for the operation of the final stages of the appeals mechanism for application for registration and grading renewal.</P>
    <P>This Government proclaims that it is transparent and uses all the clichés proper to the politically correct atmosphere which undermines the basic tenets of Deputies' generosity and decency.  I <Col N="668" /> know Bord Fáilte's involvement in the appeals mechanism will be transparent but I do not want to go down that wretched avenue as I have no time for political correctness.  That philosophy is insulting to Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not provide for consultations between the contractor and the various interest groups in the tourist accommodation sector.  Relations have been developed between Bord Fáilte and the Irish Hotels Federation and that is vital to the smooth working of the industry.  If that does not exist under a new arrangement, it will be a major loss. The Minister might consider a forum involving the new contractor, Bord Fáilte and the various interest groups which could meet quarterly and ensure everyone was aware of the proposed changes and developments.  It could help foster and develop policy and maintain relationships between the parties and within the industry.</P>
    <P>Registration and classification are important and can materially affect businesses.  It is imperative that the interest groups continue to have a strong involvement in how classification and registration procedures are implemented.  Difficulties could arise with the implementation of the Bill and it is important for the Minister to stitch in principles which would guide the contractor's approach to the registration and grading of accommodation.  For example, the Bill does not state that registration according to existing agreed minimum standards should continue to be mandatory for all hotels and guesthouses. There is no specification regarding classification.  Will this continue to be voluntary?  If hotels and guesthouses opt to be classified, will this be done in accordance with existing criteria?  Will Bord Fáilte set new standards with the new regime?  The Minister said current standards will apply for the present but for how long will that be?  Will new review and appeal mechanisms be put in place by the board following the appointment of a contractor or will existing agreed procedures apply?</P>
    <P>What has been the response to the <Col N="669" /> tendering of registration and grading of accommodation?  The Minister should give details of the applicants to enable the House assess the course that is being chartered.  Interest has been expressed by the Automobile Association and Egon Ronay.  A former senior manager with Bord Fáilte is also in the running. I understand the tendering process is at a sensitive stage and do not wish to express my views on the applicants but I reserve the right to make observations in due course.</P>
    <P>At present Bord Fáilte carries out this function.  The State spent £2.2 million on redundancy payments.  Will we have a former employee of Bord Fáilte who took voluntary redundancy take over this function?  That is hardly a cost effective way to do business.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify who is taking over this function.  If this function is not carried out in a cost effective manner the extra cost will be recovered in full from proprietors and probably down the line from the consumer.  Those involved in the registration and grading process should be adequately qualified and experienced to carry out the relevant inspection and advisory roles.</P>
    <P>I met the Family Homes of Ireland organisation on a number of occasions. It looked forward to the launch of its second accommodation guide as it believes its sale could be done through tourist outlets.  Its discussions with the Department were encouraging and it received an assurance that departmental sanction for it would be granted by the end of March.  However, it was then told it would be September before a decision was made.  It has been unable to avail of the summer season as a marketing opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been slow to implement the consultants' recommendations. The Minister's procrastination has been to the detriment of the Family Homes of Ireland organisation which does marvellous work.  I wish to pay tribute to the 9,500 B &amp; B operators. These clean and friendly homes provide a unique opportunity for tourists to meet the real people of Ireland.  Visitors <Col N="670" /> can sit and chat with their hosts and are given an excellent service in most cases.</P>
    <P>I have a particular affection and regard for Sneem which I have visited for the past 20 years.  I have stayed in various houses in the area and also the marvellous Parknasilla Hotel.  The bed and breakfast accommodation in Sneem is an example of the best in this type of accommodation.  I am referring to the accommodation run by the Teehans, Moriartys, Doyles, Husseys, Drummonds and Harringtons, the marvellous village inn run by Barbara O'Connor and the bakery run by Mr. Ó Ceallaigh. These people are the bedrock of the tourism industry and I want to pay a tribute to them as representatives of all those who provide a service for tourists.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased at the considerable increase in the number of English tourists visiting Ireland.  I pay tribute to the Minister who has concentrated on this market and has met Baroness Denton on a number of occasions.  These meetings are proper and appropriate &mdash; when I was Minister for Defence and the Marine I met her on a few occasions &mdash; and they have encouraged British tourists, who are big spenders, to holiday here.  There are many differences between us but we share a common language, and I pay tribute to the Minister for encouraging these tourists to visit Ireland.</P>
    <P>I question the Minister's decision to allow self-regulation in some sectors, including the bed and breakfast sector. It is admirable that a number of key associations have taken up the challenge of accepting greater responsibility for ensuring their own standards.  They are likely to come under intense internal pressure if the work is to be done properly.  For example, an inspector who refuses registration or classification to a member is likely to be lobbied within the organisation.  There has always been a question mark over self-regulation which may lead to problems within organisations.  Regulation by an independent body is preferable.  Given the opportunities offered by the peace process, has the Minister considered the <Col N="671" /> setting up of a single North-South grading and registration body which would ensure consistency for tourists travelling from Dublin to Belfast and <i>vice versa</i>?</P>
    <P>Hostels are an important part of the tourism industry.  In the main they are of a very high standard and some, such as the one on the Aran Islands, are known internationally.  However, in grading and registration terms there appears to be an anomaly which could hinder the healthy growth of this type of accommodation.  The terms &ldquo;hotel&rdquo; and &ldquo;holiday hostel&rdquo; are prescribed terms but a hostel does not have to be of the same standard as a holiday hostel.  It is probably desirable to make the term &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; a prescribed term.  Tourists have a fixed view of hostels and expect them to be of a high standard.  It is important, therefore, to ensure that this type of accommodation is highly regulated. It is not acceptable that a proprietor who uses the term &ldquo;hostel&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;holiday hostel&rdquo; can escape important requirements of the tourism industry.  I ask the Minister to deal with the issue of contractors either in this or some other Bill.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to extend the State-based registration and grading process to restaurants?  We need a national system for the grading of restaurants so as to help tourists negotiate the restaurant scene.  It would also help to regulate entrants and prevent fly-by-night operators from opening up in vacant premises in tourist centres for a brief period each year before simply disappearing.</P>
    <P>Further consideration must be given to the requirement for cottages in tax designated seaside resorts to be kept vacant from April to October in order to qualify as self-catering accommodation. I accept that the tourism season needs to be extended but this appears to be an excessively long period.  The Minister could deal with this matter by way of an amendment to the Bill.</P>
    <P>The experience of the staff of Bord <Col N="672" /> Fáilte who are leaving under the voluntary severance programme is invaluable to the development of the tourism product.  Does the Minister have any plans to tap into this expertise during the transition period?  I am concerned that the registration and grading work is being removed from the State sector merely for the sake of it.  Did the Minister consider offering the work to another State agency, for example, CERT, which has done exceptional work in improving standards in the hotel, catering and tourism industry? Would it not be possible to give this State agency responsibility for the registration and grading work?  If this work is retained within a State agency the transition to a new system will be made easier.  There might have been no need for a voluntary severance programme if staff had been given the option to move to another State agency.  However, the process is now in train and I understand it is unstoppable.</P>
    <P>Moving the registration and grading work to another State agency might also have created less anxiety in the tourism sector.  That anxiety may have been allayed by the future mapped out for Bord Fáilte.  Until recently some of the main groups in the hotel and accommodation sector were in favour of leaving the registration and grading work with Bord Fáilte.  Has the Minister given them assurances in this regard and has he had any second thoughts about moving the work out of the State sector? Some people in the tourism industry believe the Minister should not have accepted the Arthur D. Little report in its entirety.  Usually Ministers select certain recommendations from a consultancy study and implement those. Does the Minister intend to depart in any way from the Arthur D. Little report?  What other plans does he have for Bord Fáilte and will they require legislative change?</P>
    <P>Bord Fáilte was established in 1939 and it has carried out excellent work and served the State well.  For example, it has kept up with the changes in <Col N="673" /> communications, marketing and patterns of travel and holiday making.  I am concerned that the impact of these changes on Bord Fáilte while it is getting back to its core activities may damage the morale of the remaining 250 staff.  I am also concerned at the loss of senior staff in the organisation.  Five of its senior executives have opted for voluntary severance as part of the restructuring programme, 75 jobs will be lost and only two of the top managers will remain in the organisation.  The Minister will agree that the loss of this expertise could have serious implications for the tourist industry.  Will this new body perform as well as Bord Fáilte in registration and grading?  We do not yet know how this body is to be financed, staffed and operated.  Will the Minister address these issues when replying?</P>
    <P>It is important that the new system works well from the word go as tourism is a vital sector in the economy.  It is one of the few sectors that can produce the economic growth to cut into unemployment numbers.  Because of the peace process there are few sectors that can match the growth potential of tourism which is labour intensive and where revenue growth translates directly into job creation.  As the Minister properly pointed out in his contribution, in one way or another this affects 90,000 people.  He also opines that in the future this figure will grow.  Any new system must work well, we must have new guesthouse quality accommodation constantly coming on stream.  Will the Minister give details of his long term plans for the new registration body and will B &amp; B and farmhouse accommodation be under its aegis?  How quickly and for how long will the self-policing arrangement be in place for the awarding of &ldquo;Shamrocks&rdquo;?  Why has the Minister decided to implement only some of the measures?  There will be continuing anxiety in the tourism sector because the review of standards has yet to come. Current negotiations with the industry associations are on the basis of existing standards.  However, changes in standards <Col N="674" /> have been recommended by Arthur D. Little but when will this happen? It appears that the tourism industry will be subjected to two bouts of major changes when it could have been done in one sweep.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister consider referring matters others than registration and accommodation to the new body?  The Bill and the Minister's speech raises many questions that require answers. As we move into peak holiday time, serious fears for the long term future of tourism along the west coast are being voiced by top hoteliers who see an ever increasing amount of business going to Dublin and the east coast.  I understand urgent letters have been sent to the Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Kenny, and to the Director of Bord Fáilte, Mr. McNulty, concerning difficulties being experienced by people in the industry in the west.  The Minister should give details of these letters to the House.</P>
    <P>The reported rise of 17 per cent to 20 per cent in tourism nationally is not seen in Cork and Kerry and along the west coast.  The removal of the compulsory stopover at Shannon Airport is one of the reasons.  Aer Rianta should urgently help the authorities at Shannon Airport to attract low cost carriers to the region.  There must be discounts on landing and airport charges at Shannon so that carriers can be wooed to the airport. Initiatives to boost British business out of Shannon should be undertaken. Low cost carriers for instance have been instrumental in increasing the amount of traffic from Dublin to Britain.</P>
    <P>Are there proposals to develop the car hire industry?  While the number of coach tours appear to be increasing in Dublin the numbers of people who go to the west and south west independently and hire cars is rapidly decreasing. Sneem village is clogged up daily with tourist buses and I often wonder about the advantages for that marvellous place and its people.  At peak holiday time a week's car hire can cost up to £400: there is a need for an immediate examination of this area. <Col N="675" /> There seems to have been a serious shortage of cars which lead to even higher prices.  I understand the shortage problem has eased somewhat because Northern Ireland fleets are now more actively sought out by tourists.</P>
    <P>Car hire surveys show the prices vary from day to day and from location to location and there is a problem with insurance regulations.  Some elderly tourists are prohibited from hiring cars when visiting Ireland.  There has been a number of complaints to Bord Fáilte from tourists who were unable to hire cars because they were over 70 years of age and did not qualify for insurance cover.  People nowadays are fitter and live longer and when they come to Ireland they want to hire cars.  In the US one can hire a car at the age of 90.  Many of the US tourists to Ireland are retired and do not expect to suffer age discrimination in Ireland of all places.  This insurance problem must be examined; perhaps this could be done by a subcontractor who might look at the regulation of the car hire industry as it is such an important part of the tourism industry.</P>
    <P>In the grading of accommodation, it might be worth the Minister's while to take note of a warning today by a holiday expert who said that continental tourists may like a traditional Irish breakfast to begin their holiday but they do not want it every morning.  Food and drink can be very important and I wonder if this will be part of the standards applied by the new contractor?  The expert also emphasised the importance of foreign languages for hotel receptionists and waiting staff so they can translate menus.  While I broadly support the Bill I have some concerns and perhaps the Minister will address them.  I am grateful to the Minister for the frank way in which he approaches his brief and for the manner in which he presented the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill and compliment the Minister for bringing it before the House.  I also compliment the Minister for following up on <Col N="676" /> the initiatives of his predecessor, Deputy Charlie McCreevy, in radically reorganising the approach of the State to tourism and the marketing of tourism. The approach taken by Deputy Mc Creevy &mdash; whereas the Minister may have called it confrontational &mdash; was proactive and although a few feathers may have been ruffled here and there he got on with the job and put in place the administrative policy review which has led to this legislation.  That is not to detract from the Minister's accolade for this Bill.</P>
      <P>Tourism is rapidly becoming our number one industry and it is essential that everything possible is done to optimise the returns which flow from the industry and to ensure the highest standards and value for money for people holidaying in Ireland, whether home holiday makers or visitors.</P>
      <P>It is worthwhile reminding ourselves that in 1986 this country was, so far as air travel is concerned, in the hands of a monopoly or an oligopoly which maintained very high air transport costs into this country.  We have to remind ourselves that Deputy Des O'Malley, in those days as an Opposition Deputy, had to cross swords with Deputy Jim Mitchell.  I am not saying anything against Deputy Jim Mitchell because I know and admire him and he is a fine Member of this House but then &mdash; because this was the posture of Government &mdash; he defended the indefensible &mdash; the very high air transport cost structure which prohibited access to this country. During the period of the 1982-87 Government legislation was put before this House, the gist of which was to penalise anybody who undercut the air transport monopoly, and long jail sentences and massive fines were proposed for those who engaged in what was then denigrated as bucket shop competition in terms of air transport access to Ireland.  How things have changed since then.  We now owe gratitude to those who fought for the principle of competition in air access to Ireland at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worthwhile recalling that real <Col N="677" /> competition on the Irish sea air corridor, which is a very important one, only emerged in relatively recent years and that every effort was made by a number of vested interests to stamp out that competition.  The emergence of competition in the air transport business into Ireland is the single most important issue, so far as the change in our tourism fortunes is concerned.  The emergence of this competition was revolutionary. We should learn a few lessons from this, one that we should now look at the issue of the costs of air transport carriers into Ireland.  In this context Ryanair is looking for lower landing charges and suggesting the creation of an alternative means of access to the greater Dublin area at Baldonnel.  This would be a welcome development and should be positively examined with a view to saying whether there is a way to further cut the costs of air transport carriers into this country.</P>
    <P>Is there any longer a necessity for a single State monopoly to run our airports? I do not believe that Aer Rianta is a necessary arm of Government, Whereas some airports may need State help to function maybe all air transport carriers into Ireland would gain if there was genuine competition in relation to landing charges.  In this context the Ryanair initiative is useful and valuable.</P>
    <P>The time has come to examine whether the State's role as shareholder of a monopoly company which runs all airports of significance in the Republic can be justified.  Whereas Aer Rianta is to a large extent a monopolist at home it now considers itself free to invest in British regional airports and expand its operations into ownership in a deregulated competitive airport economy next door.</P>
    <P>We should examine whether we should deregulate and demonopolise and introduce the principle of competition in the air transport industry in terms of means of access for air transport carriers into Ireland.  In this context we should look not only at the possibility of introducing lower charges but at the possibility of reducing State <Col N="678" /> indebtedness by allowing private investment in airports which would not be a burden on the taxpayer and breaking up the Aer Rianta monopoly to capitalise much needed infrastructural development.</P>
    <P>In the period since 1986, 25,000 extra jobs have been created in the tourism industry.  We need to make significant headway if we are to maximise the potential for promoting Ireland as a tourism destination.  In that context the proposals in this Bill are practical and should be welcomed.  They conform precisely with the central philosophy of my party in that the State should divest itself of non essential activities and, where possible, those activities should be conducted by the private sector.  If one wants to have a State scheme to regulate and grade tourist accommodation and restaurants, there is no reason the State should not act as a regulatory authority of last resort and the day-to-day function of assessing and grading such facilities should not be given to non-State bodies.</P>
    <P>In this context I respectfully disagree with Deputy Andrews that it might be an idea to transfer this function from Bord Fáilte, which is being slimmed down at considerable cost to meet the new challenge which the latest policy puts before it, to CERT or some other State body.  That would not in any sense mark a step forward.  The central proposal in this Bill that the inspection and standards functions of Bord Fáilte in relation to the registration and grading of tourist accommodation should be subcontracted to a third party is sensible.</P>
    <P>In many respects the tourism industry is self regulatory to a degree.  Excellent publications such as <i>Hidden Ireland</i> feature a directory of accommodation and have established a high reputation among holidaymakers.  The organisation behind this publication is largely a voluntary and self-regulatory body.  Other organisations such as the AA, Michelin and Egon Ronay also grade facilities. Therefore, there is a variety of agencies suitable to carry out this work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> Deputy Andrews queried which organisation will be given the job or whether it will be given to a private consultancy firm comprising former Bord Fáilte employees?  As this is enabling legislation, this is not the apposite occasion on which to consider which body should be given this function, but I would not rule anybody in or out. Given that the AA, Michelin and Egon Ronay sell commercial guides &mdash; this complication may easily be overcome; I do not say this in a discouraging way&mdash; any information gained by them in carrying out work as subcontractors to Bord Fáilte would have to be accessible to all.  If, for instance, Michelin which produces excellent guides was on the inside track as the subcontracting body, the information at its disposal would have to be available to anyone who wanted to produce a guide.  The erection of Chinese walls would be necessary to separate the functions of contractor and participant in the private sector in relation to tourism information.</P>
    <P>According to weekend newspaper reports a new private Irish consultancy is tendering for this business.  That is a positive development.  I would not exclude anyone merely because they had been involved in Bord Fáilte in the past and received severance payments from it.  We should ensure that the best contractor is given the job and carries out the work to the highest standards. We have to put everyone on a level playing pitch and see which of them will do the job best.</P>
    <P>When the function is given it should not be for a period, which would induce a sense of complacency in the mind of whoever becomes the contractor and a sense that they will be there for good.  I hope a system will be put in place to ensure that the matter will be re-examined on a competitive basis and that the chapter will never be closed just because one person becomes the original contractor under the legislation.</P>
    <P>In that context the further proposal in the Bill to allow Bord Fáilte to continue as the standards regulator is sensible. <Col N="680" /> The setting of standards by an independent regulatory agency such as Bord Fáilte is probably the best way to proceed. Believing in private enterprise, as I do, one cannot allow a sub-delegation of legislative power to a private enterprise contractor.</P>
    <P>The most damaging image this country could suffer as a tourism destination is that people will depart from our shores feeling unhappy about the quality of accommodation they booked and for which they paid dearly.  That is the reason the maintenance of the highest possible standards in all accommodation sectors is absolutely essential and as a country we cannot be satisfied with the old rule of <i>caveat emptor</i>, let the buyer beware.</P>
    <P>Accommodation standards are only one part of a much more complex question when it comes to offering tourists, home holiday makers or foreign visitors, value for money.  In that context the overall cost of holidays in Ireland is of crucial significance, including the access costs, accommodation, dining out and other entertainment, and the overall costs of incidental goods and services.  I stress that in this context the maintenance of high environmental standards is of huge importance.  One of the constant complaints by visitors to this country is our dirtiness in terms of litter, dereliction, scrapped vehicles in fields throughout the country and so on.</P>
    <P>The State has a role to ensure the litter laws are enforced.  Perhaps that function should to some extent be transferred to non-State bodies.  At the very least, local authority litter wardens should be encouraged to enforce litter laws in areas where they adversely affect tourism.  On-the-spot fines could make such a process self-financing so that it would not be an additional cost on the beleaguered taxpayer.  In that context the long-awaited waste Bill must introduce an effective anti-litter strategy that not only heightens public awareness of the problem but also provides for an effective system of penalties to ensure offenders pay for their carelessness and uncivic behaviour.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> The Bill proposes that Bord Fáilte will concentrate on promoting Ireland overseas as a holiday destination.  That is badly needed because in comparative terms we are still faring poorly in attracting overseas visitors, particularly from the United States, and our performance is not comparable with for example, that of Britain.  Much attention is paid to the fact that there are approximately 40 million people in the Irish diaspora in America and that we get only a tiny percentage of the potential American overseas holiday market.  We must ensure we can measure the impact of any marketing drive by Bord Fáilte in the State or elsewhere.  In that context its advertising and marketing strategy should feature coupons or other means of assessing whether the advertising is effective.  As part of its overseeing function in the tourism and transport area, the Government should insist that Bord Fáilte demonstrates the effectiveness of its advertising.  Such an approach would allow Bord Fáilte to be more effective in assessing the impact of and response to its advertising campaign.</P>
    <P>I highlight this point because the consultants Price Waterhouse found in the 1980s that while we had one of the biggest tourism marketing organisations it was not one of the most effective.  It is very important that effectiveness by the slimmed down, outward-looking Bord Fáilte is monitored.  Even though it is difficult to say whether image creation and branding of Ireland as a tourist destination is effective by reference to any particular advertising campaign, nonetheless Bord Fáilte must be subject to particular scrutiny in the way it fulfils this function and must reach efficiency targets set for it.  The amount of money expended and the number of people involved in marketing is important, but we must ensure we achieve positive results and value for money.</P>
    <P>The continental European market has great potential.  However, in terms of marketing there is little doubt but the exploits of our soccer team in the European Championship in 1988 and the <Col N="682" /> World Cup in 1990 had more to do with interesting continentals in the idea of holidaying in Ireland than had advertisements in newspapers in the last seven or eight years.  That highlights the complexity of developing and marketing Ireland as a tourist destination.  It is not merely glossy brochures or cheaper access travel costs on their own which guarantee success; a multi-faceted approach is essential, combining a good holiday destination with high environmental and other standards.  Reasonable access costs and a positive word-of-mouth attitude by people who have holidayed here are vital if we are to succeed in the long term as a tourism destination.</P>
    <P>In that regard our enviable reputation as a friendly welcoming people is threatened and undermined by the upsurge in crime and vandalism, particularly in urban areas.  I would ask the Minister to raise with his colleague, the Minister for Justice the possibility that where a person is convicted in the District Court of violent assault and robbery an early or almost immediate appeal hearing in the Circuit Court is arranged so that the malefactor cannot escape justice by appealing the sentence in the hope that the star witness will not turn up.  The Government should provide the DPP with adequate resources to ensure witnesses to such events are brought back and made much of where it is necessary to prosecute for a violent crime against tourists.</P>
    <P>Ireland as an island is a natural tourist market.  The co-operation the Minister spoke of and his meetings with Baroness Denton are very positive.  Ireland as a tourist destination knows no border.  I will not labour the point that the violence which was confined largely to the north of the country had an adverse effect on southern tourism.  However, I see no reason that, if a similar development occurred in Northern Ireland and it was possible to appoint a contractor under equivalent Northern Irish legislation, the Minister and Baroness Denton should not co-operate to ascertain whether it is possible to appoint a <Col N="683" /> single contractor to carry out one task north and south of the Border to similar standards so that one tourism guide for the whole island could be produced with uniform standards and a uniform system of tourist grading on both sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>When talking about practical ways in which this country, North and South, can have its lot improved, without prejudice to anybody's long term political aspirations, it seems a common tourism promotion programme is one of the most obvious ways.  I am sure that almost everybody in Northern Ireland &mdash; with the exception, perhaps, of one particular person &mdash; regardless of their political opinion would agree that Ireland could be treated in large measure as a single unit for tourism promotion purposes.  Nothing would be more sensible than to ensure a common all-Ireland system of tourist evaluation and grading and nothing would be more apt towards that end than the identification of one contractor to carry out a similar task north and south of the Border. The shamrock is not a southern symbol.</P>
    <P>The process of evaluating a hotel in Warrenpoint is more or less the same as that of a hotel in Carlingford.  It would be a tremendous tourism boost if a person travelling from, say, Scotland could pick up one guide with a single set of standards, established by one contractor on a delegated basis from two sovereign Governments, to guide them as to the best tourism accommodation.  That would be very simple.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews spoke about car hire in Ireland.  I am aware there are difficulties in terms of insurance, that insurance costs here are very high and because of the tax structure the car hire business operates in difficult circumstances, but the Government ought to think of ways to overcome the disadvantage under which Irish car hire labours, particularly when oriented towards tourism.  Like Deputy Andrews, I am in horror when I hear that retired couples from America who holiday here are <Col N="684" /> restricted in hiring a car because they are aged over 70.  That is most unsatisfactory. In terms of the taxation of vehicles available exclusively for tourism hire purposes &mdash; it is difficult to ring-fence vehicles into a certain category &mdash; the State should be willing to forego a significant element of its tax revenues from the motor trade to promote that business.  It should also be willing to act as an insurer of last resort or to ensure that adequate reinsurance is available to those willing to insure tourists driving hired cars to minimise costs and restrictions which tend to inhibit self-drive tourism.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an excellent initiative.  It would be churlish of me to query the logic behind it.  I hope it will enable the Irish Tourist Board to concentrate on where it can make a difference.  I also hope it will facilitate uniformity and co-operation, North and South, in the manner I outlined.  The Minister in introducing this Bill has done an excellent day's work and the House should be grateful to him on that account.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. O'Leary Mr. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on the manner in which the Bill was introduced.  It brings into effect major portions of the Arthur D. Little report commissioned by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy McCreevy, who adopted a radical approach to tourism.  We must bear in mind that tourism is and will be the greatest growth industry, not only here but worldwide.  Tourism is the most decentralised industry and extends to every city, town, village and parish.  It has great job potential and if the Minister and the Government are interested in creating more jobs for our well educated young people who are getting good training in the area of tourism including catering and management, everything possible must be done to ensure that State and EU funding is spent wisely and in the most cost effective manner to maximise tourism growth throughout the country in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer particularly to the marketing <Col N="685" /> programme outlined by the Minister. During the period 1 October to 17 March as many representatives as possible from Bord Fáilte, the new marketing organisation and the Department of Tourism and Trade should engage in promotional work in the market place to attract more tourists.  Marketing is the key to tourism promotion.  I have been informed by those with vast experience in the tourism trade and in the hotel and catering business that we are only scratching the surface of a huge market in the US, continental Europe, Asia and elsewhere.  The importance of marketing cannot be over emphasised.</P>
    <P>Low interest loans should be made available to entrepreneurs who wish to undertake tourism projects, including the extension of existing facilities and the provision of new ones.  Low interest loans are far better than grants and are preferred by those in the tourism trade. I am convinced that we must spend a reasonable percentage of State and EU tourism funding on the provision of all weather leisure facilities, including cinemas and conference centres.</P>
    <P>This may be the last opportunity Ireland will get to spend money of the magnitude that will be made available from the European Commission between now and the year 1989-99.  I am convinced, as are those involved in the tourism trade, that the planning authorities should give priority to planning applications for tourism-oriented projects whether all weather leisure facilities, conference centres, extensions to hotels and guest houses or the construction of new projects.  I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to discuss with their Government colleagues, particularly the Minister for the Environment, the issuing of a directive to planning authorities requesting them to give priority to planning proposals that will ultimately create many new jobs in tourism. I am anxious that towns like Killarney, Kenmare, Killorglin and coastal towns in south and west Kerry should be given an equal opportunity to secure State and EU grants under the operational programme for tourism.  It is <Col N="686" /> important that all towns in south Kerry should receive a fair share of funding, given that entrepreneurs and others involved in hotels and tourism have invested a large amount of their own resources over the years.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the car hire business.  There is a lack of cars for hire, particularly during the peak tourist season.  Many in the trade have received complaints from tourists in this regard. I ask the Minister and Minister of State to examine this problem to consider how best it can be resolved.  I am also concerned that tourism along the east coast, from Wexford to Northern Ireland is growing at a far faster rate than in the south-west and west.  That imbalance must be addressed.  The large ferries serve the east coast and it is only natural that those in the east marketing tourism will promote their counties, cities and towns.  There should be a more equitable spread of tourism promotion to include the south-west and the west.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister and the Minister of State to investigate the possibility of reintroducing a scheme of grants for tourist roads.  Such a scheme was introduced many years ago by Bord Fáilte and it is regrettable it was abolished. I am not referring to grants for repairing and improving county roads but to the repair and improvement of roads leading to piers, seaside resorts, strands, beaches and remote parts of the country to which tourists cannot gain access unless those roads are maintained. Such roads in Kerry are deteriorating rapidly.  I ask the Minister and the Minister of State seriously to consider reintroducing such a scheme.</P>
    <P>I note from the Minister's statement that tourist figures for last year reveal a 17 per cent increase in US tourists as against only an 8 per cent increase in European tourists.  We must bear in mind that when referring to a percentage increase in US tourists we are starting from a remarkably low base.  There is great room for improvement in the marketing of Ireland in the USA, in Europe and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I note from the Minister's opening <Col N="687" /> address that there are 1,000 applicants for grant assistance under the EU operational programme involving a total cost of £370 million.  That is not a great deal of money when divided among 1,000 applicants.  I urge the Minister to ask those responsible for considering such applications to give careful consideration to applicants from the south west and west where additional facilities are necessary to compete with the ever-increasing number of tourists visiting the east coast, particularly Dublin.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to select an external contractor for the functions to be outsourced and note with interest the manner in which tenders will be assessed.  The criteria used will include capability and experience to undertake the role, cost efficiency within the existing fee structures, financial offers to Bord Fáilte for the right to provide the service and collect associated fees, transparency and objectivity in the activities to be undertaken and accountability.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that a number of key associations have accepted a greater level of responsibility for enforcing standards.  Standards are crucial in tourism as one bad operator in an area where, say, 1,000 operate would give the trade in that area a bad name.  I welcome the Minister's announcement of the formal recognition of the Town and Country Homes Association and Irish Farm Holidays Association as approving bodies for the Irish homes sectors and the awarding of the shamrock symbol and that he does not rule out the recognition of further associations subject to acceptable standards being met. Greater co-operation is required between State agencies and marketing organisations and we should endeavour to increase tourism standards.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister and the Minister of State to consider favourably a proposal, which I understand has already been submitted to the Department of Tourism and Trade, to establish a conference centre in Killarney.  This should be considered urgently as the promoter <Col N="688" /> is anxious to proceed as soon as possible. Such a centre would attract more tourists to Kerry, making additional use of Kerry County Airport.  The road network in the area would need to be improved to facilitate such a centre.</P>
    <P>CERT is an excellent organisation, provides great training for young people and should come under the aegis of the Department of Tourism and Trade.  It has provided many young people with the necessary skills to work in the hotel and catering business.</P>
    <P>Kerry County Airport should receive more assistance from the Department. The Minister and Minister of State should play a greater role in bringing together the marketing organisations in County Kerry to market the county as a whole.  It is regrettable that, for marketing purposes, the county is split, that SFADCo markets north Kerry and Cork-Kerry Tourism markets south Kerry, including Killarney and the Ring of Kerry.  There is an excellent airport in the centre of the county capable of facilitating 737 jets flying in from the Continent and the first large aeroplane from the United States will fly into the airport some time next month.  As the present system of fragmented marketing is unsatisfactory, will the Minister consider the matter?</P>
    <P>Will he also consider, as an adjunct to Tralee Regional College, a tourism-oriented educational institution in Killarney which could provide an educational facility leading to a diploma in tourism, catering and marketing?  Eyebrows were raised when I made this proposal at a meeting of Kerry County Council some months ago, but I believe it is worthwhile.  As Killarney is regarded as the home of tourism it is fitting that a tourism educational institution should be established there.  I have in mind a number of sites that would be suitable for the location of the institution and the first class hotels in the town could provide work experience for people on the training courses who could ultimately achieve a diploma in tourism, catering and marketing.  If the people in the business are not prepared <Col N="689" /> to market the country as a tourism location, tourists will not come here. Tourism destinations must be promoted and marketed.</P>
    <P>A tourism educational facility in Killarney, operated in association with Tralee Regional Technical College would not set a precedent.  A similar position prevails in Castlebar <i>vis-á-vis</i> University College Galway and another faculty.  The same applies in regard to Edenderry and Athlone and there are at least two similar cases in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>I sincerely hope the Minister's proposals will be successful.  There is much at stake also for the country generally. Many involved in tourism predict that that industry could outstrip agriculture in terms of job creation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>When one examines the contents of the Arthur D. Little Limited report and the progress made within the tourism industry in recent years one could not but be enormously pleased with the efforts to restructure Bord Fáilte and to market our country as a tourist destination.  The peace initiative offers even greater opportunity, in conjunction with the Northern Ireland Tourist Board, to sell Ireland as a holiday destination at the highest level. There is no doubt that much could be done within the tourism sector to improve goodwill and relations generally between both parts of this island. Even when the Northern troubles were at their worst I suggested the concept of holidays split between both parts, to be promoted by both tourism promotion agencies, through the pooling of their respective resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any examination of recent tourist statistics and the ambitious plans announced for tourism generally would give one good cause to believe we are on the right track.  For example, there are expectations of an increase of one million visitors by the end of 1999, leading to the creation of an additional 35,000 jobs.  One would search long and hard to find an equivalent within any other sector of our economy.  There is <Col N="690" /> also a projected increase of in excess of 1.7 million overseas visitors which would represent an impressive performance, although no more so than the increase in tourism-related jobs from 56,000 in 1986 to 90,000 in 1993, in respect of which the revenue intake increased from £643 million to £1,228 million.</P>
    <P>While wishing the Minister and his Minister of State well in their endeavours I must compliment their predecessor, Deputy McCreevy, who assumed that portfolio with the direct intention of shaking it up and making the best possible use of the funding and personnel at his disposal.  He applied himself forcefully to that task.</P>
    <P>There is mention in the Arthur D Little report of the non-core functions of Bord Fáilte, particularly those in regard to the Tidy Towns competition. The aims of this competition have been realised, thus allowing Bord Fáilte to withdraw.  It is suggested that in future it be the responsibility of chambers of commerce or county enterprise boards. No other competitive activity has given our towns and villages such a lift.  I live close to Smithboro, as derelict a village as was to be found when I was growing up but which has been rendered beautiful through the Tidy Towns competition in which the local community participated, involving much hard work, sometimes from morning to night.  It gave people a great sense of pride in their local environment and some work in which to engage in their spare time. Many people have commented that the village of Smithboro is a gem.  Only those like myself who knew its original state would appreciate the amount of work undertaken in its improvement.</P>
    <P>The Arthur D. Little report referred to the magazine <i>Ireland of the Welcomes</i> being well established and representing an attractive project for privatisation. Why should State funding be provided for such a project if it is capable of maintaining itself?  I represent a non-coastal area where there has not been a tradition of tourism.  I have requested <Col N="691" /> successive Ministers to ensure an evenhanded spread of resources while concentrating on areas without a tradition in tourism, bearing in mind particularly the water sports, walking and trekking, equestrian and many other activities now available nationwide.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk of the peace initiative and the Delors peace package, money we were told was earmarked specifically for cross-Border projects.  It is with regret that I read in the May edition of <i>IBEC News</i> an article entitled &ldquo;JBC Wants More Money for Motorway&rdquo;.  The JBC is a body comprised of IBEC and the CBI, an umbrella body covering North and South who hold joint meetings.  The article stated:</P>
    <P>The Delors peace package &mdash; and how this should be spent &mdash; dominated discussions at last month's meeting of the IBEC-CBI, Joint Business Council (JBC), which was attended by over 50 business representatives from North and South of the Border.  The JBC called on the British and Irish Governments to devote some of the extra £240 million in the EU package to constructing a dual carriageway between Newry and Dundalk, as part of the Euroroute EO1 motorway scheme.  The Council has warned that this 14-kilometre stretch of the Euroroute EO1 will form a major bottleneck by 1998 unless more funding is allocated now to continue the development of the North-South motorway route.  Commenting on the peace package, Doug Riley, JBC Joint Chairman, said that this provides a &ldquo;unique opportunity&rdquo; to upgrade the Newry/Dundalk part of the Euroroute and to help transform the level of contact between Belfast and Dublin and between Northern Ireland and the Republic generally.</P>
    <P>Mr. Riley went on to recommend the inclusion of Belfast and Dublin in the <Col N="692" /> European Union's proposed city information highways, a very laudable objective to which few could object.</P>
    <P>An effort has been made to siphon funding allocated to Border counties to a project which would be more appropriately dealt with under the Operational Programme for Transport.  I was greatly annoyed to see the photograph of Mr. Doug Riley, the JBC Joint Chairman with the Taoiseach when they attend the JBC meeting in Belfast last month.  The amount of money the six counties south of the Border hope to receive from the £60 million Delors package would mean, in the case of a constituency like mine, that Cavan and Monaghan would receive £1.5 million per year for the next four years.  For that money to be siphoned off for use on another project is not acceptable.</P>
    <P>Having read the article I immediately sent a fax to the Chief Executive of JBC, Mr. John Kenna and Mr. Colm Larkin in the EU Commission office in Dublin.  I pointed out that they should try to ensure that we received this money which was urgently required.  I also tabled a question to the Taoiseach which I had hoped would be answered today.  I was a little concerned, however, to be told that my question had been transferred to the Minister for Finance, who did not attend the JBC meeting in Belfast and would not know anything about it.  The Taoiseach was at the meeting and in my question to him I asked if he agreed with the IBEC/CBI submission regarding expenditure of the Delors package.  I have not been afforded the opportunity to question the Taoiseach on this matter, the only way open for me to do this would be to raise it in an unruly fashion in the House but I do not engage in such tactics as I have no doubt the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle would not condone such unruliness.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of funding currently available from INTERREG, the IFI and this fund.  However, a board or some other type of structure should be established in the six Border counties to monitor the allocation of funding to <Col N="693" /> ensure that the best possible use is made of it and that the areas to which it is allocated are developed to the maximum extent.  We all admit that this funding will not continue at its present level after 1999.  That is a realistic viewpoint. Meetings should be held between the Departments of Tourism and Trade, the Environment, Agriculture, Food and Forestry and Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to examine ways in which they can promote tourism in their various areas.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the objection of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht to the proposed development in Leitrim.  The Minister has a role to play in this area because heritage tourism is currently a major attraction. Recent reports indicate that 40 per cent of tourists to this country were interested in heritage tourism.  In my own area, a request has been made to reopen the Ulster Canal, which runs close to my home.  It goes from Newry to the Cavan border and links up with the Erne.  If that link were to run from Belfast, to the Erne, to Ballyshannon, to Shannon and back to Dublin along the Grand Canal, it would be the finest waterway in Europe.  That proposal is currently under consideration and representatives of the Departments to which I referred should discuss how such proposals could be implemented.</P>
    <P>The most crucial aspect of our tourism industry is the provision of accommodation. We must all thank the many hoteliers and bed and breakfast owners who made accommodation available in their areas despite the fact that the number of tourists were few.  They set up such tourist accommodation in the hope that the number of visitors would increase and they should be commended for that.</P>
    <P>Seven years ago, a proposal was made in my area to establish a conference centre which could also be used as a display centre for furniture, arts and crafts, etc.  We endeavoured to obtain private funding from the local hotel owners. This year, Monaghan town was in a position to host the Federation of <Col N="694" /> Health Boards' annual conference, one of the largest held here.  Approximately 600 people attended the conference which was held over three days.  Good quality accommodation was provided including hotels, bed and breakfast and self-catering facilities.  The work undertaken by those people seven years ago is to be commended.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the former Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy McCreevy, who as Minister visited our county on a number of occasions.  He was a very influential figure and during those visits he gave hope to people in community groups and other organisations involved in the development of tourism.  He had his own idea of how the tourism industry should be developed. He was an effective Minister and in that regard he should be commended.</P>
    <P>During one of his visits to our county, the Minister met a person who was in the process of making available self catering accommodation in an area close to lakes.  At that time the person had opened two accommodation units; he is now in the process of completing a sixth unit.  That person is selling an all year round product.  I brought some of his brochures to the Monaghan Men's Association in Birmingham some years ago.  People often want to return home for visits, even in non-tourist seasons and by providing such quality accommodation at a reasonable price, that person is attracting visitors to a rural area.  We need more of those people and they should be given our support in what they are trying to do.</P>
    <P>Our roads infrastructure was mentioned and Deputy O'Leary referred to the need for funding in this regard. Having been a member of a county council for many years, I vouch for the fact that we never received sufficient moneys for this purpose.  We were constantly assessing the condition of our lakes and rivers and that is an area on which there should be a greater concentration, in addition to the roads infrastructure in tourist regions.  Nothing would discourage a tourist from visiting an area more than a bad quality road, <Col N="695" /> even if that road leads only to a lake or to fishing grounds.  The Minister should examine ways in which money could be provided to improve our roads infrastructure. The Department should ensure that the non-traditional tourism areas making great efforts to attract tourists are encouraged to make the best possible use of EU funds.</P>

      <P>County Wexford is not as wealthy as Deputy Leonard seems to think.  Many people from my constituency would prefer to live in County Monaghan where there appears to be a surplus of wealth.  The Hook, the beautiful area I live in, is a partnership area and is participating in a combat poverty programme which is a clear indication that all is not as well in County Wexford as the general impression suggests.  I hope Deputy Leonard will encourage the Monaghan people who can afford to go on holiday to spend time in my lovely county.</P>
      <P>County Wexford is the focus of the sunny southeast where it is statistically proven there is more sunshine and less rainfall than in any other part of the country.  In spite of what is said tourists are keen to see less rain and more sunshine and they would be well advised to visit County Wexford as often as they can.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Tourism and Trade, Deputy Enda Kenny, suggested that tourism is second to agriculture in importance to our economy.  I compliment him on his assessment.  I hope through him and his Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, tourism growth will be enhanced.  With such encouragment tourism will become the major wealth earner.  In my travels today I noticed a great many British cars and this is probably due to the peace process.  I hope the flow of visitors from Britain continues. There are more British tourists visiting Ireland this year than before and they are enjoying the golf courses and other amenities.  Our neighbours should be encouraged to visit Ireland where they will be most welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="696" /> Rosslare, our major ferry port, is one of the most modern in Europe.  Each year 1.5 million passengers travel through Rosslare and the number is growing.  The majority is British but there are some French and Americans who have spent time on the Continent. With the excellent facilities on board the ferry and the very good road network from Rosslare, passengers get a fantastic first impression of our country. In fact some County Wexford councillors say we have built fine roads to take the tourism traffic through County Wexford and on to the west.  We should try to retain visitors in our area for a longer period.  Sometimes, I get into the line of traffic leaving the ferry and much to my disgust few, if any, stop in County Wexford, even to buy an ice-cream.  This baffles me.</P>
    <P>County Wexford has many attractions but unfortunately they have not received the attention they deserve. Heritage is a major part of tourism. However, I would like to see a balance in the mix of heritage and amenity developments such as golf, equestrian sports and fishing.  Not everyone is interested in heritage and other amenities must also be readily accessible.</P>
    <P>Development of the heritage of County Wexford is vitally important.  It is said that 80 per cent of Irish heritage is in County Wexford and of that 80 per cent is in south west Wexford.  The invaders came to Wexford first, whether it was because they thought we were soft and harmless or because of our proximity to Europe I do not know.  The Normans arrived in Baginbun near Fethard-on-Sea in 1170.  Within three miles of my home on the Hook peninsula there are 30 significant heritage sites.</P>
    <P>The county council is supporting local development organisations.  Duncannon Fort, built in the 15th century, was the home of King James after the Battle of the Boyne.  In the 1940s it was taken over by the Irish Army who, unfortunately, almost razed it to the ground, <Col N="697" /> there was much destruction of our heritage during that time when we seemed to care less about it than we do now. Duncannon Fort is now in the capable hands of the committee of the local heritage group of Wexford County Council, of the partnership to which I referred earlier and of the South Eastern Regional Tourism Organisation and I, for my sins, am the chairman of that group.</P>
    <P>Although the amount of money we get from the county council is small, it does prime the local people to raise money, and it has encouraged FÁS to give us much support by putting men and women to work there, to the extent that now substantial works are in train. Taking everything into account we have, over a three year period, spent £150,000.  The moat at Duncannon Fort has been cleaned, that took an enormous amount of work to do but it was well worth while.  Last year, through the summer student job scheme, quite a number of visitors were brought in. Although in tourism circles 5,000 would be considered modest, we hope to double that this year and our target will increase as the years pass.</P>
    <P>In that part of the county we are interested in moving in phases, and one of our problems in the past has been that we are inclined to bite off more than we can chew.  However, we intend to do the job properly and restore the fort as nearly as possible to its original state.  That will involve the placement of 18 cannon on the fortresses of Duncannon Fort.  In the past when people were less conscious of their heritage, the cannon were taken by people in the fort but they have now presented them to the fort trust.  This is an indication of the new enthusiasm for our heritage in and around County Wexford which I am sure is evident in other parts of the country.  There is no doubt that the authenticity of artefacts is vital because it is difficult to fool people these days, and we are intent on restoring the fort as closely as we can to its original state.</P>
    <P>Another very important part of our <Col N="698" /> heritage in that part of the country is the Hook lighthouse, the oldest lighthouse in Europe, built because of the hostility of the waters.  It is a place of tremendous danger and all Members present will have seen through the media the tragedies that have unfolded over many years, particularly in the last few years.  Since the 11th century we have had lighthouse keepers at Hook Point but, unfortunately, in 1996 the lighthouse will be demanned.  The lightkeepers played an important role, but the number of people watching our coastline will now be diminished, which is very sad. Because of its historic significance the Hook lighthouse has a tremendous impact on our heritage.  Irish Lights offered it to the community through Wexford County Council and a trust has been set up to develop it as a tourist amenity.  Possibly because of its remoteness, great numbers of people come just to sit at Hook Point every day of the week.  Whether it is the hostility of the water or the mystique of the Hook lighthouse, we are in the happy position that last year 80,000 people went out to that remote point.  For that reason it is our intention to develop the Hook as an area where many more tourists can come to soak up the atmosphere.  This is vital for that area which has a combat poverty programme in place because of its remoteness and the fact that unemployment levels are very high.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak about Loftus Hall about which a very famous story has been circulating for 300 years of more.  I will not tell the story tonight; I will speak to the Minister later and tell him how the devil left Loftus Hall through a crack in the roof.  Some say the devil is still around that area &mdash; I am not sure to whom they were referring. Loftus Hall is a very fine building which is in need of support, it would be a goldmine for a person with business acumen because it has many facilities, including its own private beach.

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann, having regard to the mistakenly planned current budget deficit in 1995, the out of control public spending, the lack of prudent financial planning, the lack of any coherent medium or long term economic strategy, the panic decisions of the Government as announced on Thursday, 8 June 1995 and the <i>ad hoc</i> policy announcements of Ministers, and in the light of the recent damning Annual OECD Survey on the Irish economy, condemns the Minister for Finance in particular for his imprudent mismanagement of the public finances and the economy and calls on the Government to implement the coherent and prudent fiscal, monetary and economic policies of Fianna Fáil-led Governments since 1987.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy Bertie Ahern.  It is difficult to hide from the truth.  Good economic management is difficult but it was abandoned when this Government came to power in December 1994.  Sound economic, fiscal and monetary management was the order of the day.  Unfortunately mismanagement is now the order of the day and there is no hiding from this inescapable truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the Fianna Fáil administration left office in 1994 we had the first balanced current budget deficit in 27 years, the lowest inflation and interest rates for decades, a steady rise in employment, increased economic growth and a National Development Plan which would channel billions of pounds into <Col N="700" /> the economy by the end of the decade. Whatever our critics may say about us, any independently minded person would agree that Fianna Fáil-led administrations since 1987 have proved to be successful in turning the economy around from the disastrous situation in the mid-1980s.</P>
    <P>A few months ago the incoming rainbow Government promised firm management of the public finances.  In his budget speech on 8 February 1995 the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>We will need firm discipline and strict adherence to our commitments if we are to meet the targets which we have set for ourselves in the policy document &mdash;<i>A Government of Renewal.</i></P>
    <P>Four months later on 8 June the Government suffered a panic attack and the Minister for Finance announced cutbacks. It appears to have come about as a result of the recently published OECD survey on the economy.  When a person is a couple of stones overweight he does not need a dietician to inform him of this unwelcome fact.  Is it that the Minister for Finance and the Government have been asleep for the last six months and need the OECD to tell them what Opposition Deputies have been saying, independent analysts and commentators constantly repeating and the world and its mother shouting from the rooftops.</P>
    <P>What new circumstances arose last Thursday, four months to the day from the date of the budget, which were not known to the Government when framing the budget?  No exceptional international economic events occurred. Nothing of an exceptional nature occurred in our economy.  If the board of directors of a commercial company behaved in this fashion the shareholders would be justified in looking for their removal.</P>
    <P>The OECD survey states:</P>
    <P>Despite its good performance the Irish economy continues to face high levels of public debt and unemployment ... tighter control on public <Col N="701" /> expenditure appears to be necessary in order to sustain progress in reducing the debt to GDP ratio as specified in the Maastricht Treaty and to make room for a further reduction in the tax burden.</P>
    <P>The survey has confirmed and legitimised all the recent statements made by me and my Fianna Fáil colleagues on the downturn in control of the level of public spending.  There is a 10 per cent plus increase in expenditure this year over 1994 when one excludes the tax amnesty and compares like with like.</P>
    <P>While it may be true of politicians the world over, Irish politicians seem hell bent on setting their faces against the lessons of the past.  While one could be excused for forgetting economic mistakes made 40 years ago it is beyond belief that a Government would not have learned from the daft economic and financial policies pursued here in the 1970s and 1980s.</P>
    <P>There was nothing wrong with attempting the policy experiment of current budget deficits in the 1970s.  As an economic option it is a tool to be used at appropriate times in economic development or in the lifetime of an economic cycle.  It is important to state the foregoing because I have been critical of the policy of current budget deficits since becoming a Member of the House in 1977.  My criticism has been based on the blindingly obvious: current budget deficits are an incorrect policy option for an open economy.  This is not to say that the option cannot be used. However, it should only be used in exceptional circumstances.  The lesson we should have learned from that experiment is that in a small open economy current budget deficits create massive long term headaches and mountainous international indebtedness.  Very few long term sustainable jobs are created by indulging in such a policy.</P>
    <P>Having achieved a current budget deficit in 1994 I would have thought no sane Government would go back down the other road.  I and my party Leader pointed this out when the budget was <Col N="702" /> introduced and in repeated statements over the past few months.  I do not regard my view of current budget deficits as either left-wing or right-wing, just pragmatic.  Surely if it is proven beyond any shadow of a doubt that a certain policy option does not work in an Irish context, reason compels it to be abandoned.</P>
    <P>Whereas it is easy to make decisions to increase spending, all Governments know the exceptional pain and political difficulties associated with taking corrective measures.  It has taken over a quarter of a century to return to a position of paying for current expenditure out of current income.  Whatever justification there may be in occasionally planning for a current budget deficit, there was no such justification in January 1995.  Any junior certificate student taking the business organisation paper in the 1995 examination knows that you do not put more money into an economy which has experienced the growth rates Ireland has in the 1990s.  Any amateur economist sitting on a bar stool knows that simple fact.  We do not need Central Bank reports, stockbrokers' analyses, business journalists or Opposition politicians to spell out the blindingly obvious.  Any Government should adopt a prudent approach to its first budget and provide for the rainy day which invariably comes around.</P>
    <P>There has been a sea change in the thinking of socialist parties worldwide. The traditional socialist view of spend and spend again has been abandoned from Australia to Central Europe but Irish left wing parties are living in the past and refuse to accept that.  This left wing dominated Government is not prepared to accept the changed economic thinking of recent times and has adopted the attitude that others are wrong and it is right.  They are supported in this by some media commentators who find it impossible to burn their 1960s socialist clothes.</P>
    <P>The ink was hardly dry on the Minister for Finance's Budget Statement when the Minister for Social Welfare announced an extra £140 million in <Col N="703" /> expenditure.  Apparently the Government believed some fancy creative accounting would explain this expenditure away and no analyst would realise it was additional expenditure.  Not long after, and to keep the delegates at the Democratic Left conference happy, the Government announced a major change in the law relating to service charges. When one strips away the verbiage surrounding the decision the Government effectively said &ldquo;if you do not feel like paying these service charges then do not bother because we will not pursue you further anyway&rdquo;.  What kind of signal was this to give to the electorate and the international markets?</P>
    <P>It is patently obvious the Minister for Finance is being ignored by his colleagues. There is no point in him ringing up journalists in the middle of the night to tell them he will get tough on spending. This happened some months ago and the Minister got the headlines he wanted in the morning papers. However, there is little point in closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.</P>
    <P>Ministers have been unable to resist the temptation to give in to pressure groups and some have announced their willingness to do certain things without any recourse to the overall budgetary position, and least of all, any recognition to the existence of the Minister for Finance. The Minister for Education has succeeded in transferring responsibility for early retirement for teachers to the Minister for Finance and lately I have detected that the blame is being shifted to the officials in the Department of Finance.  It should be remembered that Ministers, not officials, make policy decisions and it is not correct or ethical to shift the blame to officials in any Department.  If collective Cabinet responsibility is to mean anything in this era of openness, transparency and accountability Ministers must be prepared to defend the actions of their colleagues and not indulge in &ldquo;slieveenish&rdquo; cop-outs.</P>
    <P>On the imminent Tinakilly think out, <Col N="704" /> I send my sympathies to all Ministers and, in particular, to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa.  This supposed champion of the under-privileged and disadvantaged showed his true colours in giving them a 2.5 per cent increase in the budget.  I look forward with some eagerness to see how the champion of old age pensioners will square his ideologies with his new found responsibilities.  He was somewhat testy on last night's &ldquo;Questions and Answers&rdquo; programme.  He will have to learn to grin a bit more and bear it better.</P>
    <P>The Government is not following any clear strategy.  The Minister for Finance is being ignored and last week's headlines were not about his efforts but about those of the Taoiseach.  The headlines screamed &ldquo;Taoiseach to order tough curbs on spending&rdquo;.  In interviews associated with those decisions the Minister for Finance said the Government was engaged in minor adjustments only.  Yesterday morning one of the headlines stated &ldquo;Another £70 million in cutbacks on cards&rdquo;.  Yet within hours, in an interview, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs stated this was not correct.</P>
    <P>History seems to be repeating itself.  I recall similar confusion in the FitzGerald-led Coalition Government of 1982-87. The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, was publicly humiliated by the then Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, who left his hospital bed to inform the Taoiseach of the day that the line of the Minister for Finance was not Government policy.  The clear difference in strategy between the rainbow partners is disturbing and signals there are clear divisions on economic strategy.  Perhaps it was inevitable that a Government comprised of parties of the far left and far right would display such confusion. It is this type of muddled analysis which dug the Irish economy deeper into the mire during the period 1982-87.</P>
    <P>This administration is finding out that government is about making choices, making tough decisions and sticking by them.  I remind the House and at least one newspaper that Fianna Fáil is now <Col N="705" /> in Opposition.  It is the job of the Government, not of the Opposition, to prioritise its spending.  On the formation of the Government my party leader, Deputy Bertie Ahern, said that when Fianna Fáil returns to power he expects the economy to be in as good a shape as it was when it left office.  Given the record of the Rainbow Coalition Government over the past six months obviously he will be disappointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The economy and the national finances were in excellent order when they were handed over to the Government in December 1994 and there was a high level of confidence in business.  Unfortunately during the past six months there has been serious mismanagement of the economy and a sharp erosion of confidence, as shown by the recent poll in <i>The Sunday Business Post.</i>  A golden opportunity is in danger of being missed and there is no consistency, no firm sense of direction and no coherent leadership.  Fine Gael and Labour Coalition Governments were always bad for the economy and the story is no different this time.</P>
      <P>Stop-go economic policies instead of the sound and steady progress made under Fianna Fáil-led Governments of the past eight years are the last thing the country needs.  The Government announced reasonably tough public expenditure targets which corresponded to Fine Gael policy as announced by Deputy Bruton last November in his proposals for Government.  Within a few weeks of taking office these targets were overturned and ignored.  The Taoiseach gave the parties of the left their head and abdicated his responsibilities while new expenditure commitments were announced.  Last week the Government announced new stringent measures.  Of course, there would be no need for these if the Government had adopted a firmer approach in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the old adage states &ldquo;Begin as you expect to continue&rdquo;.  Fianna Fáil did this in March 1987 and up until now the country did not look back.  The Taoiseach <Col N="706" /> was wrong to state yesterday while canvassing in Wicklow that this was the first Government in the history of the State which had set itself a public expenditure limit.  He should check the facts.  Fianna Fáil's 1987 <i>Programme for National Recovery</i> stated: &ldquo;Expenditure will be contained in real terms at or below the 1986 expenditure levels measured as a percentage of GNP&rdquo;.  We kept our commitment not only during the first year but in the following years.</P>
    <P>Why should people be impressed by the Government's broken commitments? The parties of the left suffer from the fallacy that increased expenditure, taxation and borrowing are in general a good thing and that their constituencies benefit more from public spending than from reduced taxation. They do not stop to think about the national welfare or the burden this expenditure places on the PAYE taxpayer. The lesson of the late 1980s was that the confidence gained from tight financial control as well as the freedom to manoeuvre, outweighed the direct effects of fiscal contraction.  Conversely, the loss of confidence resulting from loose control outweighs any direct benefit resulting from increased expenditure.</P>
    <P>The first mistakes were made by Labour during the interregnum.  The Fianna Fáil Government had approved a tough provisional Book of Estimates which was drawn up under my direction and which recognised that the continued growth in public expenditure and rising interest rates had to be curbed.  The Labour Leader, Deputy Dick Spring, went for the political soft option of a Rainbow Coalition Government which included Democratic Left, rather than face up to the tough decisions with Fianna Fáil.  A similar dismissive approach was taken by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, to my view that the current budget deficit which was eliminated in 1994 should not recur so that an important signal could be given to the markets.</P>
    <P>I do not want to make too much of it, but I wish to refer to reports at the weekend, obviously fed by the Minister <Col N="707" /> for Finance, his handlers, advisers, programme managers and other people outside the Civil Service, to the effect that last year's figures were achieved with the help of an EU bonanza.  It is no secret that it was the opposite, that Brussels got the call before Christmas, just after I left, when there was a question of a few hundred million pounds coming in from the Regional Fund and the Social Fund, the cheque was lost in the Christmas post and was not included in the current budget deficit.  The current budget surplus would have been far greater if those cheques had arrived as was our intention.  That argument will not wash with anybody and in any case the markets knew the position at the time and would not believe anything from those sources.</P>
    <P>I also took the view, in my negotiations with Labour, that in a period of high economic growth &mdash; the Maastricht criterion &mdash; we were not stringent enough and that we should try to reduce the Exchequer borrowing by 0.5 per cent of GNP each year.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement had been on a declining trend since 1992 until this year.  The New Zealand Government, with which our officials spent some time last year examining their policies, is eliminating borrowing to reduce the national debt.  Real tax relief as opposed to illusory conjuring tricks on budget day will be possible only if we keep Government borrowing expenditure under firm control.  There will always be once-off items and Deputy McCreevy has outlined those which this Government has come up with but they should not serve as a routine alibi.  The underlying growth in day-to-day current expenditure this year is 11 per cent, including last year's amnesty, which would otherwise mask the trend.  There is a great effort to change around these figures.  In conjunction with my colleagues in the Department of Finance last year we did not try that trick.  We always gave the up front figure, otherwise the markets and the public would have been conned.  The figure is 11 per <Col N="708" /> cent and we have to face up to it.  If we do not face up to what the Government is trying to deal with we will never get it right.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, will admit tomorrow for the first time that the underlying increase is 11 per cent.  I ask the Government to stop talking about nonsensical figures of 5 per cent and 6 per cent, which are unreal.</P>
    <P>The total current expenditure, which includes the debt servicing costs, between 1992-94 declined in real terms, allowing some leeway, but including the amnesty, total Government expenditure increased by 6.4 per cent last year, about 4 per cent in real terms while this year it will increase by 7.6 per cent or about 5 per cent in real terms.  That is too much.  If I had remained Minister I would have insisted that the real expenditure increase be limited to about 2 per cent or 2.5 per cent and that is what was in the Book of Estimates which I and my colleagues had completed before being kicked out of office.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister have promised a pro-jobs budget with tax relief next year.  That was supposed to be what it had given us this year.  Is the Government now belatedly acknowledging that its financial and economic policies have taken a wrong turning?  As Deputy McCreevy said here on budget day, the budget, despite some worthwhile measures, did not achieve very much overall.  That was denied but now it seems the Government is admitting it.</P>
    <P>I will give a few illustrations about where the Government has taken off the brakes.  It showed no constraint in bringing in an unprecedented number of programme managers and special advisers from outside, instead of using the resources available within the public service.  One cannot get through the corridors with all the programme managers and advisers now blocking the way.  I was in Wicklow last night and I noticed that most of them were down there temporarily.</P>
    <P>There has been a 300 per cent increase in information and public relations services for the Taoiseach and <Col N="709" /> a 30 per cent increase in the costs of administering the office of the Tánaiste, including a trebling of the travel allocation. That is setting a very bad example.  Incidentally, the office is unnecessary and one which previous Tánaistes did not need.  In his proposals for a programme for a new Government last November, Deputy John Bruton said: &ldquo;Extravagance in the operation of Government must be curbed&rdquo;.  Based on those figures he failed to act on this occasion.</P>
    <P>The Government adopted a totally lopsided approach to social welfare expenditure with the Minister for Social Welfare concentrating all his resources on a couple of areas.  As Deputy McCreevy said, he awarded a minimal increase to the old and the unemployed without families.  Free third level education was announced, based on defective costings and created serious new anomalies.  The Minister for Social Welfare made it clear last night &mdash; he seems to make it clear every night he is on any programme &mdash; that he totally disagrees with that collective Government decision.  Is this Government bound by the doctrine of collective responsibility or is it just a political shambles?  Some favoured areas received increases of anything from 20 per cent to 60 per cent and even in some cases increases of 100 per cent.  The £100 million Bord na Móna debt is being written off in one fell swoop &mdash; grand if we could afford it.  The planned partnership of ICC-ACC, as part of the creation of a third banking force, has not been carried through and it seems they are to be kept in State ownership for purely ideological reasons.</P>
    <P>The Rothschild Stokes Kennedy Crowley Fry report which I commissioned last year seems to have been shredded.  I do not know why the Garda bothered to question me about it, it was leaked anyway because no interest was taken in it.  Now An Post will lead the way.  I have great regard for An Post but when I was Minister for Finance my aim was not to make An Post into the third banking force but to give them <Col N="710" /> resources so that they would not lose the savings certificates of old people who were buying them.  All of a sudden, within a year, they will lead the way into a national third banking force.  I reckon the Bundesbank will be terrified when they see this announcement in the next few days.</P>
    <P>While large increases were allocated to some areas, other areas suffered, notably the county roads and the community employment schemes on which the deputy leader of my party successfully managed to change a Government decision after three months of hard effort.  In addition, new spending obligations are looming: notably the European Union agri fines and compensation for the hepatitis C victims.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising every individual decision.  My argument is that the cumulative effect of all the decisions taken at budget time and subsequently is more than the country can afford at this time. Government is about choosing priorities; that is why we elect it.  It is not a question of paying out everything that crosses one's desk.  My party had a realistic attitude to Government expenditure. A complete freeze will not address our social needs.  In many areas we need improved social services when we can afford them.</P>
    <P>If we could reduce the cost of borrowing and the cost of unemployment it would create resources for tax cuts and selected improvements in services.  Cuts can be achieved by maintaining confidence in the system, keeping down the live register, keeping interest rates down and using the money productively. Relaxing financial control has damaged confidence.  The currency has been under pressure at the bottom of the ERM since early in the year, except for last week, when it went slightly above the French franc but yesterday it went down to the bottom.  While I was in office we stayed in the national narrow band with the Deutschmark.  We have since fallen out of that and there has been substantial unexplained outflows.  I do not want to dwell on that but perhaps the Minister will explain how in <Col N="711" /> the first quarter of the year £1.6 billion went out of the system, £210 million more than for the whole of last year.  As Deputy McCreevy said on &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; recently, all we want is explanations.</P>
    <P>It is clear that while in the last two years unemployment turned out better than forecast at budget time this year, it will be worse by several thousands with detrimental budget implications.  Voices in Brussels are casting doubt on our ability to participate in European Monetary Union.  We have much convincing to do and we have lost ground during the past five months.  Perhaps the Minister will state how that will resolve itself.</P>
    <P>Last week's mini budget was clearly felt necessary to reassure the markets.  If our financial affairs had been managed properly in the first place it would not have been needed.  Public service embargoes are inflexible instruments which mean that certain areas can be deprived of necessary staff while others remained overmanned.  We brought in administrative budgets that helped long term planning, it is another demonstration of the lack of confidence in the senior levels of the public service that is now being overridden.  Administrative budgets were a good idea and worked extremely well.  I regret the fact that they are now being abolished in favour of the old blunt instrument which as Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, brought in in 1981.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health seems to regard his Department as exempt from all these things even though the number of health workers has shown the greatest increase over the past five years.  The Minister for the Environment is not telling the people the full truth either when he says that central Government investment in local services will be maintained. The cut in the rate support grant is at one remove from a cut in central Government support for local services.</P>
    <P>We have a serious law and order problem and nobody in the House argues about that.  The arguments for putting off the planned provision of <Col N="712" /> additional prison places are threadbare in the extreme.  The Minister for Finance who talks about moving to multi-annual planning said that the provision of the additional prison places would do nothing to solve the problem during the next three years.  On that basis he might as well stop building new roads and most other capital projects, including the Lee tunnel and the Tallaght hospital, as they are not due to come on stream immediately either.  What sort of miserable short term vision is this?</P>
    <P>The Minister also talks about the peace dividend but there are a little over 50 IRA prisoners left in Portlaoise Prison.  They are filling a fraction of the number of places to be provided at Castlerea.  There is also the question of conditions in some of our older prisons. That is one of the reasons for building a new women's prison.  Clearly, women are not given as high a priority by the rainbow coalition as it sometimes likes to pretend.</P>
    <P>As recently as 30 May in this House the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, boasted that over 200 prison places would be provided at Castlerea and the new women's prison during the next couple of years to reduce the pressure at Mountjoy Prison and other institutions, in combination with an increased reliance on community sanctions. Deputy O'Donoghue will recall that the Minister said the exact opposite a few days later.  Representatives of women's groups were involved.  The Minister concluded by saying that she hoped there would be an acknowledgement in the report of the visiting committee next year that some action had been taken on the question of overcrowding. It does not look as if this will happen as no action has been taken.</P>
    <P>In the words of Deputy Eric Byrne &mdash; if one listens to local radio in Dublin one will know that late each Sunday night he makes a statement criticising the Government and then vanishes for the rest of the week &mdash; conditions at Mountjoy Prison are Dickensian.  The Government has decided to do nothing about this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> Today I asked my party's Whip the current position in relation to the transfer of sentenced prisoners legislation.  I thought once this legislation had been enacted Irish citizens would be able to return home but it now looks as if that they will have to remain abroad as we will have nowhere to put them.  There is no point in passing the legislation if we are only conning those who have been waiting a long time for it to be put through.</P>
    <P>A few months ago the Minister for Justice sought and received the support of my party's spokesperson, Deputy O'Donoghue, on the question of the desirability of reforming the law on bail. This is not now going to happen even though the Fine Gael candidate in the Wicklow by-election is trying to pretend otherwise.  Last year the Leader of Fine Gael Party, now Taoiseach, Deputy Bruton, solemnly pledged to reform the bail laws.  On 14 May 1994 at his party's Ard Fheis he said:</P>
    <P>A great number of serious crimes are committed by people already out on bail.  On 15 March bank robbers were arrested in Dublin for possession of a housebreaking instrument. They were promptly released on bail.  Later the same day they were again arrested in the course of committing a bank robbery.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach gave the public the misleading impression that he would do something about this when in office. This is the classic case of promising to do one thing while in Opposition and doing the exact opposite when in Government.  This does not represent openness, transparency and accountability, rather it is a definite U-turn &mdash; one of many.  Under the threat of resignation the Minister for Justice has been offered a face-saving deferral in place of cancellation.  It is obvious, however, listening to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, that the prison building projects have been cancelled for the lifetime of this Government.  The west is being given the same old answer.</P>

      <P>Making the decision to scrap the prison projects while the Minister for Justice was away was the ultimate insult.  The credibility of the Government in its drive against crime has been undermined.  The public and the criminal fraternity have been given a clear signal that the Government is not serious about tackling crime and that it does not figure among its priorities.  This has serious economic and social implications as business will not thrive in areas where crime is rampant.  Our citizens are entitled to a life free from fear of personal attack or robbery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach talks about those who do not pose a threat to the community, for example those who fail to pay fines, but what about all those who do pose a threat and who have to be released early because of lack of space or who are let out on bail to commit more offences, such as break-ins, as he cited <Col N="715" /> in his Ard Fheis speech last year?  My party's attitude is that habitual criminals belong in jail for the protection of the public.  There are still far too many out on the streets who mock the gardaí with impunity.</P>
    <P>During the past eight years Fianna Fáil managed our economic affairs extremely well.  There was high growth and low inflation.  We reduced debt, cut tax rates, secured large inward investment and good industrial relations.  If we are to enjoy growing prosperity, avoid future recessions as we avoided the last one and create more jobs we will have to attend to two things in particular. The bottom line is that the state of the national finances is vitally important.  If they go out of control we will be back in deep trouble.  We should not be content to rest on our laurels.  We should be seeking to improve our financial position while conditions are so favourable to make room for tax cuts. The second vital ingredient of success is continued social consensus.  Stop-go policies &mdash; as shown, for example, in the approach to teacher pension entitlements &mdash; will not make it easy to maintain this.</P>
    <P>The financial markets will be watching very closely as the Government has lost some financial credibility.  The carry-over effects of spending measures already announced will mean there will have to be a virtual freeze in Government spending and probably some cutbacks next year and the year after. There will be nothing left for the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy De Rossa, and his party to spend; they have already laid the cupboard bare in just five months.  While the lobbyists concerned will not like it, there will be little room for the Labour Party's favourite expenditure schemes.  It will be interesting to see if the stability of the Government can be maintained in conditions of financial stringency and if, having failed the test this year, they will be more capable of passing it next year. It looks as if it will have to resort to much privatisation if it is to make ends <Col N="716" /> meet.  In this regard Telecom Éireann was mentioned yesterday.</P>
    <P>For the sake of the economy and the welfare of the nation I hope that we succeed in getting back on course as set by Fianna Fáil.  We should never have left this course.  As Deputy McCreevy has outlined at Question Time, the Government should follow our advice.  We know that we will not have an opportunity to return to Government this year but the Government should heed the good advice we have been giving it for several weeks.  It is not necessary to wait for the OECD, the ESRI, the IMF or the World Bank to ridicule it; it should listen to our advice.  It could then do a good job.</P>
    <P>Before this debate is brought to a conclusion perhaps the Government will comment on the excellent Masonite economic project which will secure jobs and prosperity for County Leitrim. Already one Minister is trying to block this badly needed project in the west. Like the prison and so many other projects, it is being given the thumbs down by the Government.</P>
    <P>This motion in the name of Deputy McCreevy gives the Government an opportunity to restore some confidence. A huge number of people have transferred funds out of the country because of the threat of interest rate changes and other matters which are leading to instability. This trend will continue unless action is taken by the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann, having regard to</P>
      <P>&mdash; the fact that this Government is the first to commit itself, in <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to specific limits to increases in public expenditure;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the commitment to ensure that adequate resources are available so as to promote additional employment, reward work and reduce taxation;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the timely action announced by the Government on 8 June last aimed at ensuring that the Government's prudent economic and fiscal policies as set out in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> are maintained, in particular the target of 2 per cent real growth in gross current supply services expenditure in 1996 and 1997;</P>
      <P>&mdash; a positive assessment of the OECD Economic Survey of Ireland which states that the economic outlook for Ireland in 1995-96 remains favourable, with output growth projected at near 5 per cent and projected continued growth in employment and in real disposable income; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash; the acceptance by the Government of the public debt philosophy and targets set out in the Maastricht Treaty, including keeping the EBR prudently below 3 per cent GNP and the debt/GDP ratio steadily reducing towards 60 per cent, <Col N="718" /> has full confidence in the budgetary and economic policies being followed by the Minister for Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The Government amendment sets out clearly the principles underlying the prudent economic policies for both the short and medium term which are set out in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> The clarity of these policies contrasts sharply with the unfounded rhetoric evident in the motion tabled by the Opposition.  This Government has always been prepared to listen to constructive advice and criticism.  However, there is nothing constructive in describing the decisions taken last week as panic measures, reflecting imprudence in planning and lack of control.</P>
    <P>The reality is that the Government, recognising that expenditure could run slightly ahead of the 2 per cent target for 1996, has taken prudent early action. This Government does not wish to engage in unfocused, ill-planned fiscal measures at the end of the year.  In taking these actions now, well before the half year stage, the Government is allowing Departments prepare balanced, planned and efficient programmes for 1996.  I cannot see how any Member can describe such steps as panicked or imprudent.</P>
    <P>The Deputies opposite have seized on the OECD survey as support for their rhetoric.  This report, described as damning by the Opposition, reports favourably on the Irish economy and on the policies being pursued by Government. The report concludes that the economic outlook for 1995 and 1996 remains favourable with output growth projected to be near 5 per cent.  It also concludes that current expenditure targets are consistent with reducing the debt ratio towards 60 per cent by the end of the century.  The report certainly recognises the need to maintain control on public expenditure.  Specifically the report states: Achieving a further reduction in the debt ratio to meet the Maastricht criterion will require a marked slowdown in the growth of Government expenditure such as that <Col N="719" /> suggested in the policy programme of the new Government.  In short, on the matter of public spending the OECD is supportive and not damning of Government policy.</P>
    <P>The achievement of the 1995 budget objectives of rewarding work, promoting enterprise and strengthening social solidarity, requires the maintenance of a stable, low inflation and competitive economic environment.  Getting these basic factors right is crucial to sustaining growth in output and employment over the long term.  It is this long term perspective which defines the strategy adopted in the budget.  Moreover, this primary concern with sustaining the momentum of growth and job creation over the longer term determined our decision to make necessary adjustments to expenditure announced last week.</P>
    <P>It is instructive to examine the trend in current expenditure over the period since 1990, as compared to the discipline which the Government has brought to bear.  The focus here is properly on the evolution of non-capital supply service which represent day-to-day spending by Departments rather than on central fund services where the level of expenditure is essentially non-discretionary.</P>
    <P>Including the additional provision of £140 million for the equal treatment payout this year, the <i>Revised Estimates Volume</i> projects a gross non-capital supply services increase of 6.9 per cent in 1995 over the 1994 outturn.  This is a more modest rate of increase than any achieved since 1990.  Gross current supply spending increased by 10 per cent in both 1991 and 1992.  Excluding the exceptional £140 million allocation to equal treatment reduces the 1995 increase to 5.6 per cent, well below the 6 per cent undertaking set out in the policy document, <i>A Government of Renewal.</i>  In addition, the £140 million will not form part of the base for the calculation of the expenditure ceiling in 1996.</P>
    <P>The Government is fully committed to securing the strict limits being applied to the rise in current departmental <Col N="720" /> spending, which for the first time ever have been set out unequivocally in <i>A Government of Renewal.</i>  At 6 per cent in 1995 and at 2 per cent in real terms in 1996 and 1997, these limits are set well below the levels of increase which occurred over recent years.  It is of course not easy to shift away from a pattern of significant real spending increases to impose these more modest objectives.  No benefits can be achieved from decisions taken too late in the budgetary process.  It is prudent to allow Departments the time necessary to properly plan for 1996.  That is why decisions are being taken now.  Deputies opposite are mistaking prudence for panic.</P>
    <P>One important aspect of this process is, necessary, the need to secure further improvements in the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of public services.  This drive for improved public service performance is a focus of the strategic management initiative which has been formulated in my own as in other Departments to release the maximum potential of the real resource offered by a focused and motivated staff.  Over time I expect that such measure, will prove of real benefit to the clients of all Departments and to the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead to the more immediate prospects in 1996 and 1997, the Government has moved to ensure that the benefits to be obtained within the expenditure constraints can be maximised. Preliminary indications suggest that spending in 1996, if unchecked, could grow a little faster than the 2 per cent real limit.  Ministers have, accordingly, been asked to review their existing policies and expenditures so as to ensure that the best possible value can be secured within the spending target. In addition, recruitment is being restricted to ensure that, aside from some exceptional cases, public service numbers will be held to the level obtaining at 9 June.  This is control, not panic.  It demonstrates that this administration takes its programme very seriously, so seriously that it is willing to underpin its <Col N="721" /> spending commitments with the policy measures necessary to ensure that they will be delivered.</P>
    <P>There is no point in sitting back to await departmental spending bids and attempting to deal with the issues in late autumn on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  That is the recipe which has been at least in part responsible for the undesirably large increase in public expenditure that I have already discussed.</P>
    <P>A number of commentators raised concerns about the impact of the Government's budgetary policy on Garda and Defence Forces personnel. This Government will keep under review the necessity to undertake certain planned spending in the light of the continued peace in Northern Ireland. We have agreed to defer the Castlerea prison project.  The ceasefire was not in place when the Castlerea prison was planned in the first instance.  Should the ceasefire hold, the likelihood is that a significant number of prison places may be freed up.  It is, therefore, a prudent decision to defer the Castlerea prison project.  In this regard it should be noted that the Castlerea project would not have become operational until early 1998.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, there is increasing use being made of non-custodial sentences, especially community services.  In 1994-95, significant additional sums have been spent on the probation and welfare service to improve the management of released prisoners and to supervise community service orders etc.  It is to be hoped that continued peace in Northern Ireland will allow for a large number of gardaí, who are currently located in the vicinity of the Border to be redeployed to areas of greatest need.  It should also be noted that an information technology plan costing some £28 million over the four year period 1994 to 1997 is being carried out at present, which will permit more than 560 man years to be saved throughout the force and result in overall greater efficiency.  This investment will result in a significant increase in the operational strength of the Force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="722" /> The Government decision does not materially effect existing policy on the gardaí as set out by my colleague the Minister for Justice.  With regard to the Defence Forces, the number of military and civilian personnel will not exceed the strength levels prevailing on 9 June 1995.  This will allow for an intake of cadets and apprentices in the normal manner later this year.  Nothing in the Government decision reflects any weakening in our stance on law and order.</P>
    <P>This Government's determination to ensure a strategic approach to the allocation of resources in 1996 and 1997 is reflected in the decision to secure relative stability in public service numbers and to ensure that public servants are deployed in an increasingly efficient and effective manner.  A brief review of public service numbers since 1987 puts this policy development in context.  The size of the public service workforce is determined by the level of services &mdash; in areas such as health, education and welfare &mdash; which the Government deems necessary and affordable having taken account of overall bugetary constraints. Many of these services are, by their very nature, people intensive.</P>
    <P>The fall in public employment in the period 1987-90 coincided with a widespread consensus on the overriding need to contain and reduce the overall level of Exchequer indebtedness.  The implementation of a restrictive numbers policy prior to 1990 also coincided with a period of reducing levels of unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is also the case that the reduction in numbers achieved between 1987 and 1990 was achieved at considerable cost to the Exchequer.  For example, the public service early retirement scheme was availed of by approximately 10,000 public servants at a cost of almost £130 million.</P>
    <P>However, overall numbers began to increase sharply from 1990 onwards.  In 1990 numbers employed across the public service rose by over 3,500.  Between 1991 and the end 1994 public service employment levels increased by an <Col N="723" /> annual average of over 3,400.  Furthermore, it is anticipated that numbers employed will increase by an additional 3,600 by the end of 1995 unless action is taken to stabilise numbers growth. Action has now been taken by this Government.</P>
    <P>While the improving overall budgetary position in recent years provided successive Governments with a welcome opportunity to expand and improve on service levels provided to the public, the increased staffing levels required to implement these improved services are very significant.  The Exchequer is quite simply not in a position to maintain the levels of increase in public service numbers that have occurred since 1990.  This would not be prudent.</P>
    <P>It is useful in this context to review the extent to which employment levels have increased across the Civil Service, health and education sectors since 1990. These sectors account for over two-thirds of total public service employment. The Civil Service accounts for over 14 per cent of total public service employment.  Increased staffing levels in recent years &mdash; up by almost 3,000 since 1990 &mdash; has allowed significant service improvements to be implemented.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service is a significant employer.  As of 1 January 1995, there were 30,131 whole-time equivalent employees in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Since 1990 Government spending &mdash; particularly on current supply services &mdash; has increased by, on average, about 5 per cent a year.  Given the labour intensive nature of many Government services, it was inevitable that public sector employment would grow in tandem with this increase in expenditure and services.  Thus, between January 1990 and January 1995, non-industrial Civil Service numbers increased by 2,740 or 10.7 per cent.  This rate of increase is clearly not sustainable. Hence the need to secure relative stability in numbers by curtailing the creation of additional posts.</P>
    <P>The education sector accounts for 27 <Col N="724" /> per cent of total public service employment. Numbers employed across the education sector have increased by almost 5,700 since 1990.  The additional recruitment sanctioned by this, and previous Administrations has resulted in improvements in pupil-teacher ratios at primary and secondary levels and in the vocational education committee's, and the provision of additional teacher posts to deal with the needs of disadvantaged pupils.  In addition, increased caretaker, clerical and post-primary vice principal and guidance posts have also been provided. Furthermore, there have been significant increases in the number of third level places available to school leavers over recent years, requiring increased staffing resources at third level.  These achievements will not be lost as a result of the recent Government decision.</P>
    <P>The health sector accounts for approximately one-third of public service employment.  This sector bore the brunt of staffing reductions in the period 1986-89 when total numbers employed fell by over 6,700.  By the end of this year it is estimated that employment levels across the health services will have increased by over 11,000 since 1989.  The provision of these additional staffing resources across the health services in recent years has significantly benefited the general public.</P>
    <P>Health sector employment was just under 62,000 at the start of 1987.  This reduced to 55,300 at start 1989.  By the end of this year, employment in the health services will be in the region of 66,000.  These figures confirm that the health sector has not only fully recovered lost ground in the 1987-90 period but is also meeting many additional service requirements not previously catered for.</P>
    <P>This Government has committed itself to specific real rates of increase in public spending for 1995 to 1997.  It was the first Government to set such targets. The decisions taken last week were not to cut Government spending, as some have said, but to ensure that spending <Col N="725" /> growth for 1996 will be the targeted 2 per cent real increase.</P>
    <P>These decisions have been taken sufficiently early to allow Departments to properly plan the utilisation of the resources available for 1996.  They are entirely consistent with the determination of the Government to apply prudent and cohesive budgetary policies. These policies have been endorsed by the OECD in its report on the Irish economy.  It comments favourably on our economic performance and the decisions taken last week are entirely consistent with the policies underpinning our economic performance.</P>
    <P>The policies and achievements of this Administration are set out with great clarity in the motion in the name of my colleague, the Minister for Finances and I strongly commend them, and the motion, to the House.  I am disappointed the Leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Ahern, is not present.  I believe he was rather bitchy in attacking me in my absence tonight and I understand why. It is sad that he has gone to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's county to try to win votes for his candidate.  As a Wicklow man, the Chair knows full well he is wasting his time as Deputy Ahern will not return to the House with another Fianna Fáil Deputy in tow.  I suppose that is why he was so narky today.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am always amazed by Fianna Fail's almost supernatural gift for shooting itself in the foot.  Its motion calls upon the Government, of which I am a proud member, to implement the coherent and prudent fiscal, monetary and economic policies of Fianna Fáil-led Governments since 1987.  As we all know, that is the party which mislaid around £2 billion in EU funding on the short trip from Edinburgh to Dublin. We are still feeling the effects of the incredible shrinking billions Fianna Fáil lost.  Most recently it was apparent with the suspension of the control of farmyard pollution scheme.  &ldquo;Prudent&rdquo; is not <Col N="726" /> the first adjective that springs to mind when seeking to describe Fianna Fáil's handling of the public finances.</P>
      <P>On assuming office the Government was faced with a legacy of almost unprecedented mismanagement, ineptitude and bungling.  It is important to refresh Members' memories in that regard.  Successive Fianna Fáil-led administrations tried to deny married women their rights to social welfare equality arrears. Rather than paying up, they chose to put those women through the legal hoops in Ireland and Europe.  This Government must now pick up the tab that has run into hundreds of millions of pounds over that which it would have cost the taxpayer if Fianna Fáil had made those payments while in office.</P>
      <P>It is interesting to note that taxpayers will be intensely depressed when they see the legal bills attached to this Fianna Fáil débâcle in its crude attempts to deny those women their entitlements. The 1980s, about which Fianna Fáil regularly reminds us, witnessed major irregularities in the beef industry and the taxpayer was presented with not only a bill of £40 million for the beef tribunal but a possible EU fine of £100 million.  The Fianna Fáil hands-off approach to irregularities in the Blood Transfusion Service Board went undetected and this Government faces a compensation bill for those infected with hepatitis C, the cost of which has not yet been ascertained.  Many other bills may come fluttering on to this Government's table because of Fianna Fáil's recklessness and political ineptitude.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This motion is symptomatic of the Opposition &mdash; induced schizophrenia we have all witnessed in Fianna Fáil since last December.  It is interesting to note that irrespective of all the rhetoric in the motion.  Fianna Fáil carefully avoids any demand for a reversal of the spending cuts.  Since this Government took up office.  Deputy Bertie Ahern has trotted out a weekly speech decrying Government spending.  His speeches alternate between, on the one <Col N="727" /> hand, attacking us for too much public spending and, on the other, not enough. Last week the Government announced prudent curbs in spending and Deputy Ahern promptly accused the coalition partners of panicking.</P>
    <P>Unlike the parties who have a vested interest in big businesses, Democratic Left represents those on the economic margins of society, the people who would be hurt most by a Government spending spree because in the long term they would have to pick up the tab in the inevitable cutbacks.  Deputy Broughan and I recall the cutbacks announced when Fianna Fáil insisted on redundancy packages being paid to those in local authorities when staff numbers in Dublin Corporation were savagely reduced from 8,500 to 6,500.</P>
    <P>The spending cuts announced last week will ensure that public spending does not get out of hand and that the most vulnerable sections of society are not exposed.  Not surprisingly, Deputy McCreevy focused on Democratic Left, a party which has always had an influence out of proportion to its numbers.  I look forward to our numbers in the House being increased after 29 June. Deputy McCreevy was particularly scathing about the payment of equality arrears, something which does not come as a surprise to me.  Fianna Fáil has been mouthing the same refrain since the payments were first announced.  I challenge its Leader to stop beating about the bush and tell us if he ever intended paying married women their equality arrears.  If so, when, and with what resources?  If, as I suspect, he did not intend doing so, will he come clean on the matter?</P>
    <P>Once again Fianna Fáil is in a hole of its own digging.  I suggest it throws away the shovel, stops digging and reflects on the unpaid bills it left behind when departing for the Opposition benches last December.  I would like to say much more on the matter, but as time is limited, I will defer to Deputy Broughan who will take up the cudgels and complete the attack.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TommyBroughan" hpid="Mr. Broughan Mr. Broughan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Broughan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am flabbergasted at the audacity of Fianna Fáil and Deputy McCreevy in tabling this motion under the malign influence of the Progressive Democrat Party and the Newt Gingrich of Irish politics, Deputy Michael McDowell, the &ldquo;Mac the Knife&rdquo; who told his party conference a few weeks ago that he would slash the annual budget by £1,000 million.  Fianna Fáil appears to be under this nefarious influence.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne referred to Fianna Fáil's schizophrenia, but that is more evident in the Progressive Democrats, none of whom has the guts tonight to discuss this important issue.  On the one hand, week after week, we hear Deputies O'Donnell, Harney and Keogh ask for more resources for child care, education and security and, on the other, Deputy McDowell tells us he wants to slash public spending.  That is the flag Fianna Fáil is flying.  My colleague, Deputy Byrne, correctly stated that it was Fianna Fáil in the 1970s and 1980s who caused the dreadful debt burden the country has had to bear for the past number of years and which absorbs £2.5 billion of our basic budget each year.  It was the policies of Martin O'Donoghue, a colleague of Deputy McCreevy, that unfortunately launched us on this road for which we have had to pay dearly and on which this Minister has had to take a prudent line.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern's main problem is whether to run in Dublin Central or Dublin North-West, where he would like to run.  He cannot decide whether to remain on the social solidarity road which, to an extent, he travelled under the partnership Government or to go down the Progressive Democrat road of implementing cuts of £1,000 million and attacking social solidarity.  Will he pull Fianna Fáil into the PD orbit?  I am also struck by the fact that the Progressive Democrats do not have a candidate in the Wicklow by-election.  Are they fearful of selecting one to argue on the doorsteps for the policies espoused by Deputy McDowell which they advocated at their recent conference?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="729" /> Under the present Minister for Finance economic growth was 7 per cent last year and 6.7 per cent this year, inflation is well under control and there has been a massive trade surplus.  While Deputy Byrne and I are unhappy with the progress on unemployment, at least the figure is decreasing towards the 250,000 mark which did not seem possible a short time ago.  The Government was pleased that in recent weeks a respected independent economic commentator, Davy Stockbrokers, indicated that we will stay well within the 2 per cent current spending limit over the next few years.</P>
    <P>They expect that while the Exchequer borrowing requirement in 1995 was budgeted at £813 million, 2.4 per cent of GNP, the tax take from our booming economy will be at least £100 million higher and as a result we will end up with a real current deficit of £735 million, 2.1 per cent of GNP &mdash; a better performance from the Minister, Deputy Quinn, than from his predecessor.  The Government has responded vigorously to spending in health, education, housing, social welfare and security and an additional 17,000 civil servants were employed in recent years.  The Minister for Finance prudently seeks to ensure that the current budget deficit will be on stream at the end of the year.  That is the target he has set and will achieve.</P>

      <P>When this self-styled rainbow Coalition took office a few short months ago not even the most realistic pessimist could have foreseen that it would transfer our healthiest economy in over a quarter of a century into a nightmare, with a speed that has left the nation gasping.  Even the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition of 1982-87 took a little longer before finally doubling the national debt, leaving us on the very brink of national bankruptcy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="730" /> In 1987 Fianna Fáil assumed office under former Deputy Haughey who wisely chose former Deputy Ray MacSharry and, later.  Deputies Albert Reynolds and Bertie Ahern to serve in the Department of Finance.  What was achieved by them in the ensuring few years drew gasps of astonishment and praise throughout Europe.  In 1995 we are left with a rather unpleasant feeling of <i>déjà vu</i>, although this time we sincerely hope we will not have to wait until the car is half way over the cliff before a Fianna Fáil driver is called on to come to the rescue once again.</P>
    <P>Just a few months ago we handed over to this transparent Government the nation's finances which were in the best order for 25-30 years, resulting from tough, unpopular decisions having been taken.  Now there are ominous signs that those eight years of sustained economic growth are about to be reversed taking us back to the position that obtained in 1987.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party served a good apprenticeship under Fianna Fáil but clearly are not capable of being in charge of the nation's finances.  When a good chef prepares a dish, he takes special care to mix the ingredients to ensure they are compatible.  It would appear that a good political chef would never mix Fine Gael and Labour, placing them in the same Government, because history has clearly shown that the nation's stomach finds this particular recipe very disagreeable and harmful to its health.  The Labour Party recently served a useful apprenticeship under Fianna Fáil, until the pupil, the Labour Party, felt it was wiser than the teacher and ran off in a tantrum, enrolling in a different school where Master John Bruton was so delighted to get any kind of pupil, he handed over total control of the classroom to the Labour child who was allowed to take over the Fine Gael school lock, stock and barrel.</P>
    <P>I have the greatest respect for the Minister for Finance as a politician but about ten days ago I remarked that, unless he could manoeuvre a rapid <Col N="731" /> U-turn, the signs were pointing ominously in the direction of January 1987. That U-turn has commenced but the driver, his crew and mechanics have gone into a state of total panic; God alone knows where this vehicle will end up as the Labour Party and Democratic Left change their view for the sake of personal convenience.</P>
    <P>I note that the remaining Irish Life shares held by the Government are among the options mentioned in the rescue effort.  This is amusing considering that the Minister who holds those shares at present is a member of the Labour Party.  On 4 July 1990 the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, then contributing to the Second Stage debate on the Insurance Bill, 1990, at column 64 of the Official Report of that day said: &ldquo;The Labour Party are opposed to selling even one share of the people's holding in Irish Life...&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Later, in the same contribution he said that measure was Thatcherism at its worst.  Five years later, are we to witness the Labour Party embracing the much-maligned former British Prime Minister, Lady Thatcher, as the latest addition to their list of Government advisers?</P>
    <P>What of Democratic Left?  Also, on 4 July 1990 the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Rabbitte, was even more colourful in his reaction to the sale of Irish Life when he said at column 68 of the same debate:</P>
    <P>We have to ape Thatcherism at the end of the Thatcher era when it is patently evident to everyone that the experiment has not worked, that it has devastated one part of Britain and sold off the family silver in so many of the fine public enterprises in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I have no objection to the sale of Irish Life shares in a good cause, even if described as the family silver, but I will become a trifle concerned if I discover that the sideboard, dining table and all <Col N="732" /> the other contents of the house are in danger of following suit.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that the Labour Party served a good apprenticeship under Fianna Fáil but it was never so silly as to think the Labour Party was ready to be entrusted, with their colleagues in Democratic Left, with control of the nation's finances.  The fact that the Taoiseach, and the senior party in Government, Fine Gael, thought otherwise, clearly demonstrates that neither the Taoiseach nor his Fine Gael Party is qualified to be in charge of this nation's affairs.  With each passing day it becomes ever more clear to the electorate that a Government is in office by mistake.  I trust that the good, learned people of Wicklow will endorse that view in the forthcoming by-election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Administration has now lost the confidence of the business community at home and abroad, which is clear from a number of recent independent surveys.  This loss of confidence in the administration of our economy has occurred progressively as the Minister for Finance and his colleagues stumbled from one decision to another.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance presented his first budget on 8 February 1995 which, as I and others said at the time, was imprudent but we were disregarded. We also said it was an expansionary budget in an already expanding economy and, therefore, unnecessary but we were not listened to.  I and others went on to argue that the budget was reckless because it did not take into account that the current level of European Union transfers to Ireland, after 1999, will fall by between £500 million and £1,000 million annually.  Unfortunately, that fact is still being ignored although it is an important factor in our economy at this stage in its planning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In spite of some noble aspirations, incredibly the Minister's budget included not a single reference to the substantial reductions in transfers from the European Union to Ireland which will begin within a few short years; there is no long term planning in that.  The <Col N="733" /> Minister's budget included tax cuts for the banks and big business but not for small business.  The Minister was surprised at the initial widespread criticism of his budget and the growing criticism levelled at it within the financial community and business generally since then.</P>
    <P>The Minister's second mistake was to add to the current level of spending budgeted for at that time, by agreeing to additional current expenditures.  He sought simply to justify them as being unavoidable.  Furthermore, the Minister dealt with increasing Irish business community concern about the appropriate Irish pound exchange rate simply by repeating his wish that the Irish pound would enter the proposed European Union currency block when the German Deutsche Mark entered such a scheme; wishing it to happen is not an economic strategy; looking forward to it happening is not an economic programme, what was required of the Minister was a rational explanation of Government policy in regard to our currency strategy. We received no such explanation, just the Minister's wish and hope that some day it would happen but it will not happen without a strategy and the Minister did not give us one.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Minister introduced the now infamous section 153 in his draft Finance Bill which, if enacted, would have forced legal and financial advisers to companies to betray their clients' confidences.  Fianna Fáil objected to this proposal, as it constituted a major attack on civil liberties.  I am also advised that several major potential investors in Ireland were horrified at that proposed legislation which was without precedent in the free world.  When challenged about this proposal the Minister said he would not discuss any change no matter what was said in the House.  We told him at that time it was wrong, that he would have to change it and, in fairness to him, he came into the House and did change it.</P>
    <P>IBEC and the OECD have now forced a change in Government policy, which is welcome.  The Minister does <Col N="734" /> not appear to understand what normal people mean by control of Government spending.  In recent months he has inspired articles in newspapers about his strong control on current Government spending.  The Minister appears to be fooling himself in that he seems to believe what he reads in those newspaper articles, after he has briefed the journalists concerned, is what is happening. He is not fooling the investors, however.  They know that the Minister for Finance is wholly aspirational when he talks about Government spending. What they see is an outflow recently of more than £1 billion.  As our party Leader, Deputy Ahern, said tonight, that is the worst outflow in 15 years. Investors are not fooled by the Minister's lack of strategy in Government planning of the nation's finances.</P>
    <P>The collapse of Irish and foreign business confidence in the Government is reflected in two ways: first, in the loss of the £1.5 billion in reserves &mdash; as has been bluntly stated, investors vote with their money and can take their money elsewhere and, second, in the increase in Irish interest rates since Minister Quinn presented his budget on 8 February 1995.  The hardening of interest rates can be traced to the Minister's announcement in the budget.</P>
    <P>The Government is soft on current spending and on the nation's finances. This attitude has increased interest costs to Irish home owners and to Irish business. If the Minister had prepared an effective budget for 1995, and if he had tightly controlled current spending since then, the three month rate would probably have returned to its relationship with the Deutsche Mark interest rates and would be 1 percentage point less today.  The budget directly increased interest rates by 1 per cent.  We told the Minister that would happen but he did not appear to listen to us at the time.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what the Minister claimed, the budget has adversely affected everybody in that it has saddled borrowers with unnecessary high costs. Now he tells us there will be a change of policy.  Why were we not listened to <Col N="735" /> on 8 February when we pointed out that the last thing a country needs when it is growing is an expansionary budget.  We made that clear at the time but we were not listened to.</P>
    <P>The parties of the left are leading the country's economic policy.  That is clear to investors here and to those who watch Irish investment internationally.</P>

      <P>Throughout the world, where there is a left dominated administration, there are left dominated economic policies.  What do left dominated economic policies mean?  They mean increases in spending, borrowing and taxation leading to high interest rates, rising inflation and the commencement of a vicious circle, the result of which is recession.  We hoped it might be different here, that the parties of the left might be so pulled to the centre, they would avoid that vicious circle.

      <P>Because investors have seen this left dominated strategy, they have voted with their cheque books and moved their money out of this economy.  That will continue and I predict that the end of June figures will show greater outflows and expenditure will rise even faster, despite what has been said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Bertie Ahern was the first Minister for Finance to balance a budget in 27 years.  That did not happen by accident nor by EU fund manipulation. It happened through careful and courageous management.  It is a scandal <Col N="736" /> that having got the nation to that stage, this Administration calmly took the decision to plunge it once again into a budget deficit.  That was a reckless decision.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil was negotiating with the Labour Party to form an Administration last December &mdash; I was a member of the negotiating team &mdash; we were discussing a 4 per cent increase in spending for 1995.  Obviously the Labour Party got a better offer because it went elsewhere.  We were prepared to go to 4 per cent, which was slightly above inflation.  The Labour Party went to Fine Gael and Democratic Left and got an agreement on 6 per cent.  We could have accepted 6 per cent because it is approximately the growth rate in the economy at present.  What is happening now?  The rate of expenditure is not at 4 per cent, which we agreed, nor at 6 per cent, which the Government said it wanted to bring in but at 11 per cent, almost three times the level of spending my party was negotiating with the Labour Party last December.</P>
    <P>In my speeches on the budget and the Finance Bill, I stated that the borrowing requirement at the end of 1995 would be approximately £1 billion.  To put that into perspective, that is the figure we were looking at in 1986.  We reduced that figure every year since and now it appears that it will be increased to approximately £1 billion.  Why do we need to increase public spending three and a half times the rate of inflation?  Is it to keep a left dominated Government in place?  That is an expensive Government to keep in office.</P>
    <P>We have had cuts in the rate of tax every year since 1987.  The standard rate of tax was 35 per cent for 20 or 30 years. It has decreased progressively from 35 per cent to 27 per cent today.  I suggest that is where it will stop because the finances are such that the Minister cannot, within the budgetary arithmetic, reduce it further.  He has suggested that if he can implement various cuts, he will be able to allow for further reductions in that income tax rate.  That will not happen.  I know Cabinet politics and the <Col N="737" /> Minister will find that not only will he not get his £77 million, but he will have such stonewalling from his colleagues that he will be lucky to get any reductions and we may end up with the tax rates remaining precisely the same as we approach 1996.  That would be a tragedy because for a period of seven to eight years, the tax rate came down every year but that has halted.</P>
    <P>The Government's economic strategy seems to be that when growth of 6 per cent is achieved, it should be spent and a few percentage points should be added to it.  That is the wrong economic strategy to follow and I said that three times in this House since December. The correct strategy is to run a current budget surplus in times of growth &mdash; that is what all democratic countries do &mdash; and build up those surpluses so that in times of recession some small deficits can be permitted to inflate the economy.  The increase in growth should be used for tax cuts, to bring down the national debt and to build up reserves for the future.  It should not be frittered away.</P>

      <P>The proposed prison in Castlerea is part of the major plan to deal with the ever increasing threat of crime to our society.  It is a matter of regret that the Minister for Justice is not present.  It is important to recognise that if she had been at last week's Cabinet meeting, at least we could satisfy ourselves that she would have offered reasonable resistance to the dropping of a major plank in the fight against the <Col N="738" /> ever increasing crimewave.  A few months ago the same Minister for Justice decided to confirm the intention to build a prison at Castlerea &mdash; a prison that would provide 150 badly needed spaces at a time when over 700 persons are freely engaging in a rampage of crime and there are over 2,000 recognised heroin addicts in this city responsible for 80 per cent of all crime in this country.</P>
      <P>In addition to the gross insult the Minister for Finance conveyed to the people of the west, the Minister for Justice announced that prisoners from Britain and elsewhere in Europe will be transferred here as a result of the Transfer of Sentenced Prisoners Act, recently passed by this House.  She also proposes to introduce changes in the Constitution in connection with bail which will further increase the demand for prison places.  She proposes to eliminate once and for all the revolving door syndrome but at the same time she wipes off the slate the previous Minister for Justice's intention to provide 1,150 Garda Síochána and two prisons, one for women and one for men in the west.  It is an act of insanity showing total disregard for the fact that crime is at an all time high.</P>

      <P>It is clear that the law and order package announced by the Minister for Justice is in tatters.  It was torn up while she was not present at the Cabinet table, when the Minister for Finance arbitrarily dictated that neither the prison in Castlerea nor the women's prison at Mountjoy would proceed. We all want to contain public expenditure but it is a matter for Government to get its priorities right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> On this occasion it is quite evident that the Government has got its priorities entirely wrong.  It is unseemly that a so called &ldquo;law and order&rdquo; party should be led on this issue by a Labour Minister for Finance and a Democratic Left Minister for Social Welfare who seems to have no difficulty whatsoever in demanding and achieving every now and then what he seeks.  It is a sad day for the Fine Gael Party that it has let itself go to the extent that decisions are made behind the back of its own Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach will not support his own Minister at Cabinet and makes vital decisions about the Department in her absence.</P>

She is also examining the whole issue of payment of fines and debts by such means as attachment of income or a phased payment system. Such changes will ensure that punishment other than custody can be used for such offenders.  Although the numbers in custody at any time for such offences are small, the Minister is most anxious that those convicted of more serious crime will occupy prison spaces.</P>
    <P>Within the limits of financial constraints, the Minister will be taking a hard look at the non-custodial treatment of offenders, especially opportunities for the expansion of the community sanctions and other measures, as an alternative to imprisonment in suitable cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Nothing better illustrates the seriousness of the mammoth crime wave than the fact that a robbery took place at the end of last week at the Royal Dublin Hotel, O'Connell Street, Dublin, a hotel in close proximity to the Garda station on O'Connell Street.  The episode would be laughable if it was not so serious.  The worrying fact is that the hotel is located beside the Garda station on O'Connell Street which was specifically established by a previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, in order to have a permanent visible and secure <Col N="741" /> presence on this busy principal thoroughfare.</P>
      <P>The hotel was robbed of in or around £1,500 on Thursday last in a vicious robbery during which the manager and some of his staff were threatened with a hand gun and forced to open the safe. The gun-wielding attacker fled in the direction of Parnell Street with the video tape from the security camera in his hand.</P>
      <P>This robbery only serves to underline the mess this Government is making of the whole law and order issue.  The country is facing a seriously escalating crime problem.  Statistics show that for the first time indictable crime will go over the 100,000 mark, 3,000 tourists have been robbed in the last 12 months, one in three shops has experienced violent crime, over £10 million has been spent on security equipment to protect personnel and discourage attacks over the last two years, and £11 million has been lost in cash, goods and damaged property from retail outlets.  These figures represent only a tiny number of statistics that make for horrendous reading.  Despite the fact that we all bear witness to rising crime levels on a daily basis, the damning truth is that the rainbow Coalition Government, by its consistent inactivity, continues to display an alarming indifference to the incidence of crime and a callous disdain for the plight of victims.  We must remember the innocent parties to all of this crime, people like the staff of the Royal Dublin Hotel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has informed the Dáil that it will not introduce any criminal justice legislation during the current session.  When action is needed it seems that it is only Fianna Fáil who responds. The Minister plays the publicity game, announcing plans, promises and proposals, but where is the meat?  Day after day we witness publicity over substance. Government inactivity is matched by Fianna Fáil activity, and I am not just saying this for publicity's sake.  I have introduced many Bills on behalf of Fianna Fáil to highlight and tackle the surging crime wave.  These include the <Col N="742" /> Proceeds of Crime Bill, 1995, the Criminal Law (Bail) Bill, 1995, the Sexual Offences (Jurisdiction) Bill, 1995, the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill, 1995, the Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitutional Bill, 1995 and the Criminal Procedure Bill, 1995.  We are preparing policies on vital areas of drugs, security and policing, among many other issues.</P>
    <P>At a time when indictable crime has gone over the 100,000 mark for the first time, it is incomprehensible and disgraceful that the Government should decide not to proceed with the building of the Castlerea prison and the proposed new women's prison at Mountjoy. At a swipe 210 prison places are gone. It was only on Thursday last in this House, the day of the announcement of the cuts by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Quinn, that the Minister for Justice confirmed at Question Time that the package of law and order measures would include the provision of prison places.  How long a few hours are.  The fable that the release of prisoners from Portlaoise would solve the prison place shortage will not wash.  We needed the 210 places last week, and we need them this week.  The Minister, Deputy Owen, has been left to hang by her Leader, and by the Minister for Finance.  Decisions were made in her absence from the Cabinet table.  The Government has made a major blunder not just in mismanaging the public finances but by washing its hands of the crime problem which is spiralling out of control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has tabled this matter in the context of a robbery which recently occurred at the Royal Dublin Hotel, Upper O'Connell Street, Dublin.  Before dealing with the general issue of crime.  I would like to set out briefly the details regarding the robbery in question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Thursday, 8 June at 10.20 p.m. a security man at the hotel was ordered at gun point to go behind the counter and into a small office where two members of hotel staff were counting money.  The perpetrator, having threatened the staff, <Col N="743" /> demanded that the money, which was made up of Irish, UK and other foreign currency, be handed over to him.  I understand that a sum of £3,000 was involved.  He also demanded a security video tape which was currently in use in the video camera and, in addition, the video tape which had been used earlier that day.  He then left the hotel through the front door and merged into the pedestrian traffic in O'Connell Street.  As a result of a call to Garda command and control, a large number of Garda cars immediately went to the scene.  The first Garda car arrived at the scene within one minute of the call and a thorough search of the area was carried out with negative results.  The scene has been technically examined and Garda inquiries are ongoing.  Thankfully, no one was injured during the incident.  Nonetheless, I have no doubt that the robbery was a deeply traumatic experience for those involved.</P>
    <P>On the general issue of crime, the Deputy will be aware that the Minister for Justice has dealt with this matter in detail on a number of occasions in the House.  However, let me once again assure the Deputy that the Government is determined to do everything within its power to deal with the crime problem. In the DMA there are approximately 3,985 gardaí, including 88 extra from the last passing out parade.</P>
    <P>We are especially determined to deal with the drugs problem.  Drugs units have been established in each of the city's five Garda divisions and their activities are co-ordinated through the Central Drugs Unit in Harcourt Square. Drug addiction fuels a high proportion of the city's crime.  The Department of Justice has recently finalised a detailed and comprehensive report on important aspects of law enforcement in relation to the drugs problem.  A set of comprehensive and far reaching proposals has been formulated based on this report and these proposals are currently being examined by other relevant Departments. The Minister is confident that the proposals contained in this report <Col N="744" /> will, when implemented, greatly strengthen the hand of the Garda in dealing with the drugs problem and, in doing so, reduce the level of drug-related crime.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Garda Síochána has been engaged in a number of youth diversion projects, such as Give Ronanstown a Future Today (GRAFT) and Killinarden Engages Youth (KEY) which were established to divert young people from crime.  This is an exciting development which I understand has yielded great results to date.  A further two schemes were introduced last year, one in Moyross in Limerick and the other in the Knocknaheeny/Hollyhill area of Cork.  In addition, the Minister for Justice has provided funding this year for the setting up of the WEB (Working to Enhance Blanchardstown) Project in the Blanchardstown area. These schemes involve the participation of the Garda, voluntary groups, the business community and local youths and have been particularly successful to date in diverting young people from crime.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DermotAhern" hpid="Mr. D. Ahern Mr. D. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity of raising this issue.  It speaks volumes that at least three of the four items on the Adjournment are about crime.  I deal with it in the context of the ludicrous suggestions over the last few days that the availability of more spaces in our prisons as a result of the peace process justifies the decision not to build a women's prison in Mountjoy or to go ahead with the building of the Castlerea prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My concern is about the reduction of Garda strength along the Border. Because of the troubles in the North, there has been a larger than usual presence of gardaí in Dromad.  Hackballscross and Omeath, which are literally on the Border.  However, whenever there was a major security operation, which was every week for the last 25 <Col N="745" /> years, all the gardaí were drained away from other areas not so close to the Border, for example, Dundalk, my own village of Blackrock just outside Dundalk, Castlebellingham and other places around the county, to supplement the gardaí who were already on the Border in large numbers.  There were times when roads were closed because of incidents on the far side of the Border and all these gardaí were literally sucked up to the Border area because of what was happening on the other side.  I accept that because of the peace process there is a changed atmosphere.  However, on the other side of the Border there has been no reduction in the British security forces.  They may have been returned to barracks but a withdrawal of security forces from the area has not been announced.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Minister for Justice is not present despite three of the four questions being addressed to her. The withdrawal of gardaí from Border areas should not lead to a reduction in Garda strength in the stations.  When I was an infant there were 300 people in my village, now the population is in excess of 4,000.  The Garda strength comprises a sergeant and two gardaí. When the population was 300 there were four gardaí.</P>
    <P>There is a serious crime level in my county, much of it drug related.  The area has suffered &mdash; more than any other county &mdash; from the 25 years of violence in the North and deserves proper protection.  It must not be left without sufficient Garda strength.  Although peace has reigned for nine months violence could again erupt.  The British Government has not reduced the strength of its security force along the Border even though it has been reduced in Belfast.</P>
    <P>Severe problems have been experienced in Louth and Castlebellingham. Within 100 yards of my home cars were tampered with a few nights ago.  There are only three gardaí for a population of 6,000.  From canvassing in Wicklow I know that the population of Arklow and Wicklow is almost the same as that in <Col N="746" /> my area and I have no doubt that Garda strength there is greater than in my village.</P>
    <P>I implore the Minister to think carefully about this and ensure that the Garda strength in the larger urban areas of Drogheda, Dundalk and Ardee is not reduced.  Cognisance must be taken of the fact that the difficulties we experienced over the last 25 years are far in excess of anything experienced elsewhere.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity to outline the current position regarding Garda manpower in the Border divisions.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice is responsible to this House for the delivery of an efficient and effective police service to the community.  She is seeking to ensure that all opportunities are taken to improve the quality of policing throughout the State.  However, the deployment of resources in the Garda Síochána and the operational control of the force remain the responsibilities of the Garda Commissioner and she must be guided by him in his professional judgment.</P>
      <P>I am aware of yesterday's press report indicating the recent transfer of 20 gardaí from Border areas to duty in Dublin.  This would appear to relate to the recent reassignment of 16 probationer gardaí, who had been assigned to Border areas upon completion of phase 3 of training, to Dublin following graduation.  I refer the Deputy to the Minister's reply to Parliamentary Question No. 132 on today's Order Paper. The Garda authorities have informed me that the strength of the Border divisions has decreased by 53, mainly because of retirements and resignations since 31 July 1994 from 1,646 to 1,593 at present.  The gardaí who would normally fill these vacancies have been assigned to those areas of most need, in particular, the major urban centres.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated in the House as early as last February that a number of charges were already under way with regard to policing in Border areas.  The ceasefire announced last year has provided us with a significant opportunity to make better use of Garda resources in tackling the crime problem rather than having members of the force assigned exclusively to security related tasks.  Checkpoints on the Border have been withdrawn and it makes sense, purely from a management point of view, to direct those resources to areas of greatest demand.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities are aware of the Minister's objective to see worthwhile benefits coming from the peace process.  It is continuing to monitor the situation to ensure an effective police service for the Border areas and, at the same time, ensure that gardaí are assigned to duties and locations where there is most need.</P>

      <NameTxt>Kathleen Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister of State, Deputy Fitzgerald, is in the House as she is exceptionally busy.  It is an indication of the seriousness with which she views the issue.</P>
      <P>Ireland is the only EU country which does not have effective legislation governing the hours of trading, in particular, Sunday and public holiday trading. It is unacceptable that the way should be left clear for a few powerful retailers rather than elected representatives setting the agenda.  Legislation must be introduced to regulate Sunday trading as the current legislative vacuum is leading to a free for all.  Inevitably, the victime will be the weakest players on the retail scene &mdash; small and medium sized shops and workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dunnes Stores led the way by opening on Sundays and public holidays in 15 centres.  Available evidence shows that there has been a noticeable reduction in the trade experienced by other outlets and small and medium sized retailers bear the economic brunt of social <Col N="748" /> change.  Corner shops find it increasingly difficult to compete with large chainstores and the decision by some large retailers to commence Sunday trading places pressure on other retailers to do likewise.</P>
    <P>Workers in the retail sector see their jobs threatened by &ldquo;hire as you like&rdquo; casual labour.  In Dunnes Stores, fewer than 10 per cent of staff are full-time and so-called &ldquo;zero hour&rdquo; contracts are fast becoming the norm.  Staff must be available to work throughout the week but are not guaranteed work at any time.  When I hear of these conditions I need to remind myself that this is 1995.</P>
    <P>Dunnes Stores introduced contracts making Sunday work compulsory at a fixed rate of pay rather than offering double time as is the industrial norm. Not surprisingly, these contracts are fast turning into the straw that broke the worker's back.  Looking at the record of Dunnes through the years one would have thought the workers would have arrived at that position earlier.</P>
    <P>Dunnes Stores workers are due to strike on 19 June and if there is an allout picket there will be a boycott on deliveries to the main chain by members of other unions.  This will have an knock-on effect on suppliers and will lead in the long term to job losses.  I am not only talking about Sunday trading; I am talking about an entire industry coming to a halt.</P>
    <P>People will ask how one can legislate to allow corner shops, public houses, garden centres and DIY shops open on Sundays and prohibit other shops from doing so.  This can be done by prohibiting retailers with a floor space above a certain level from trading on Sundays.  Unregulated Sunday trading not only disturbs the lives of workers, it disrupts the lives of their families and suppliers.  If Sunday trading is allowed to continue unhindered it will fundamentally alter our family centred culture. Legislation on Sunday trading will not deal with the other problems of the Dunnes Stores workers, for example, <Col N="749" /> zero hour contracts, no standard pension plan and no sick pay scheme. Recently Dunnes Stores celebrated 50 years in business by giving away cars. Do the people who won these cars realise how this company treats its workers?  It is a disgrace and must be taken on by someone.  I support the workers and MANDATE in this regard.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister of State for being in the House.  The EU directive on working hours will do nothing to solve the Sunday trading issue or the problems of the Dunnes Stores workers.  We need to legislate to ban Sunday trading and to ensure that people working in retail outlets, the majority of whom are women, can spend time with their families. I accept that the Dunnes Stores issue is a matter for another day but I hope the Minister will keep it in mind.</P>

      <P>On the Dunnes Stores dispute, this will ultimately have to be settled around the table and I call on both parties to come together sooner rather than later.  The Labour Relations Commission is available and both sides should use the existing machinery to settle the dispute.</P>
      <P>Last October my predecessor commissioned a study on the implications of Sunday trading for the retail trade.  I am happy to tell the House that the report has been sent to my Department and will be published this evening.  I welcome the opportunity to outline to the House some of the findings of the report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give the report careful consideration, particularly in the context of the legislation to implement the EU Working Time Directive.  I am conscious of the need to protect non-unionised and part-time workers.  The report documents the divergent views of employers, trade associations and the MANDATE trade union on Sunday trading. Employers, trade associations and consumer representatives are not in favour of further regulation of Sunday trading. The report notes that MANDATE, <Col N="750" /> which represents 25 per cent of retail employees, is in favour of regulating Sunday trading hours for larger outlets within the industry and has indicated that conditions of work for employees should be strengthened to ensure that exploitation of existing staff and new entrants to the industry is avoided.  It also notes that the employers' group IBEC recommended while employers should be free to decide whether they wish to trade on Sunday there should also be protection for employees who do not wish to work on Sundays.</P>
    <P>The report notes that the EU Working Time Directive which requires a minimum of 35 hours weekly rest break, which should in principle include a Sunday, may have a bearing on Sunday working hours.  Member states have a degree of flexibility on how they implement this directive in national legislation.  It also estimates that 16,500 shops employing approximately 28,000 people were open on Sundays in 1993 and approximately 15,200 people are employed in those shops not regularly open on Sundays.</P>
    <P>The report concludes that extra trading hours will not create many extra jobs and that most employers will expand existing part-time hours where possible.  Sunday trading alone will not affect overall spending and changes in aggregate sales will only occur in response to changes in real incomes or retail price levels.  A move to more generalised Sunday trading would be likely to reduce aggregate weekday sales and affect the sales of the mainly smaller shops which traditionally have opened on Sundays.  We need to look at Sunday trading in the context of changes generally in the retail trade.</P>
    <P>The shift in trading patterns has led to fewer outlets, but an increase in overall jobs, most of them part-time.  During the period 1988-91 the number of full-time employees grew by 7 per cent while the number of part-time workers grew by 33 per cent.  This represents approximately 4,000 extra full-time workers and approximately 8,000 extra part-time workers.  During the same period the <Col N="751" /> number of retail units fell by about 2,000.  Changes in retailing, in response to changes in technology and patterns in consumer demand, have led to more out of town shopping centres and supermarkets, an increased concentration of food shopping in a small number of multiples, a blurring of distinctions between what is sold in different outlets and a general extension of shopping hours, including late night opening, pre-Christmas Sunday opening and the weekend opening of large DIY, furniture and garden centres.</P>
    <P>I have consulted widely on the issue of Sunday trading.  Apart from meeting the trade union MANDATE, I have also met the Consumers' Association, <Col N="752" /> the Director of Consumer Affairs, RGDATA, the Keep Sunday Special Group and the Irish Hardware Association. I have listened carefully to the views expressed by them.  It will not be possible to meet the demands of all the groups involved, since in many cases they contradict each other.  However, I am determined in arriving at decisions on this issue that jobs are safeguarded and that those at work are given the protections they need in the context of changing working conditions and living patterns.  I look forward to coming back to the House with legislation which will give protection to those workers who need it most.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 14 June 1995.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The back-to-work allowance was introduced in September 1993 as an integral part of my Department's programme of initiatives designed to encourage the long-term unemployed to return to the active labour force.  This scheme has proved to be a significant success.  To date just over 7,300 people who were previously long term unemployed or lone parents have returned to real jobs as either employees or self-employed persons.  Approximately 4,700 (64 per cent) recipients of the allowance are engaged in a wide range of self employment enterprises while the remainder are working as employees. The average weekly payment being made under the scheme is £64.36.  Back-to-work allowance payments are not subject to income tax or PRSI.  I am very pleased with the success to date of this scheme.  It has proved to be very attractive to the long-term unemployed and has encouraged the creation of new job opportunities in both the services and indigenous industries sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In particular it has demonstrated that there is a wide reservoir of diverse ideas and talents among the unemployed.  The financial incentive provided by the back-to-work allowance has given many of them the opportunity to apply those <Col N="546" /> ideas and talents in what, hopefully, will become profitable enterprises.  A number of the enterprises created as a result of the scheme have now started to generate employment themselves and this is a particularly significant and important development.</P>
    <P>The scheme is being carefully monitored by my Department.  I have recently commissioned an independent evaluation of the impact of the scheme and this should be available to me towards the end of the year.  The results of this survey will be important in the context of the future development of the scheme.</P>
    <P>There is no provision for making advance payments of the back-to-work allowance along the lines suggested. This would be contrary to the rationale behind the allowance in the case of persons engaging in self employment which is to provide financial support to the person and his family for a period of three years while the project is getting off the ground.  I would not therefore, in general, favour such an arrangement.  I am, however, aware of the difficulties which persons who have been unemployed for considerable periods can experience in securing even small loans through the normal commercial outlets. It was for this reason that I recently established a Joint Enterprise Fund of £500,000 with the First Step organisation. Small interest-free loans are available from this Fund to existing and new back-to-work allowance customers who have failed in their efforts to secure funding through normal channels.  They should contact my Department's local job facilitator for further information.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 38, 44 and 76 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the free cross-Border travel concession announced in the budget, adults holding the appropriate passes from my Department or from the Northern Ireland authorities will be <Col N="548" /> given free travel when making cross-Border journeys in either direction. There are certain differences between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland schemes and, as both schemes are continuing, these differences will remain.  Subject to this, the new concession will be applied in similar fashion to all passholders.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements will come into operation on or about 1 July 1995.  Full details of arrangements will be made public as soon as possible but, while I am glad to have this opportunity to provide additional information on the proposals, some of the details still remain to be settled with the transport companies.</P>
    <P>Five transport companies will participate in the new scheme.  These are Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann, Northern Ireland Railways.  Ulsterbus and the Lough Swilly Bus Company.  Provision for expenditure of £200,000 has been made in the budget for the current year but the extent to which the new concession will be used and the share which each company will attract is impossible to predict and, until the demand settles down into a fixed pattern, each company will be paid on the basis of actual traffic on its routes so far as this can be ascertained.</P>
    <P>The free journeys, which will be available, will depend on the routes which the transport companies serve and on the accounting arrangements that exist between them.  Each cross-Border journey will be provided free of charge from its origin in one jurisdiction to its destination in the other jurisdiction.  The return journey need not be the reverse of the outer journey.  It depends on what the traveller wants to do.  There are, however, some limitations.  Every free journey must be undertaken on the basis of one through ticket.  Free journeys must not involve multiple ticket purchases from different operators and they cannot combine bus and train sections.</P>
    <P>There will be certain differences between the bus and train companies for passengers getting free journeys. The bus companies will issue one-way tickets only.  The train companies will issue two-way tickets if the passenger <Col N="549" /> intends to return by the same route. Passengers will be asked to complete an application form for the free rail tickets as these will be needed for accounting purposes.</P>
    <P>While every care is being taken, both here and in Northern Ireland, to ensure that the arrangements will be as satisfactory as possible for pensioners in both jurisdictions, it would be unrealistic to expect that the concession will be free of teething problems.  I am confident, however, that the new concession will be successful from the start in bringing people in the two communities into closer contact and in fostering a better mutual understanding.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>People engaged in self-employment may claim unemployment assistance provided they satisfy the means test.  Any income from self-employment is assessable for means for this purpose and any unemployment assistance is reduced on a £1 for £1 basis by reference to the means.</P>
      <P>The method of assessment involves a calculation of the person's income for the year ahead.  In the absence of any other way of determining the means, the previous year's income, updated for any expected changes, is used as the basis of assessment.  The actual income assessed as means is gross income less all work-related expenses.  In the case of a landholder, for example, the means from the farm are taken as the gross income, less expenses incurred in the running of the farm.  In all such assessments my Department depends on evidence of income supplied by the claimant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="550" /> People in receipt of unemployment assistance for over 12 months can apply for the back-to-work-allowance.  Provided they satisfy the conditions of that scheme they can retain 75 per cent of their weekly payment for 12 months and 50 per cent for the next 12 months, in addition to any earnings they may have, as an encouragement to them to develop viable opportunities for themselves. I will be keeping the system of supports for people to develop employment or self-employment opportunities under review with a view to seeing what further developments may be warranted in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 42, 62, 149, 150, 151, 152 and 153 together.</P>
      <P>In keeping with the commitment contained in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to pay married women their legally determined entitlements to social welfare equality payments, the Government decided that the necessary arrangements should be put in place to give full effect to the judgment of the High Court of 3 February 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under these arrangements, married women affected by the delay in implementing Directive 79/7 will be entitled, in respect of the period of delay, to receive:&mdash; an increase in their weekly payments at that time for their husband as an adult dependant and full rate increases for any child dependants; unemployment assistance subject to the conditions applied to married men in the period of delay: and weekly transitional payments which married men in the same circumstances received for the period not covered by the six year period of limitation laid down in the Statute of Limitations.  In the case of married women who have taken proceedings, the period involved will be six years prior to the date on which the proceedings were initiated.  In order to ensure that married women who have not initiated proceedings prior to the <Col N="553" /> court judgment are treated fairly, I decided to deem all such women to have made a claim with effect from the date on which the legal entitlements were determined by the High Court, that is, 3 February 1995.</P>
    <P>The overall cost of giving full effect to the decision of the High Court is estimated at £260 million of which £200 million will be paid by the end of this year.  All married women will receive a payment on account in August 1995. These payments will consist of the adult dependant allowance for the period December, 1984 to May, 1986; payments in respect of child dependant allowances for the period December 1984 to November 1986 and compensation based on inflation on the payment on account and on amounts already paid under the 1992 retrospective legislation.  Any remaining entitlements in respect of the adult dependant allowance, child dependant allowance or unemployment assistance will be paid from September 1995 to September 1996.  Entitlement in respect of transitional payments will be processed immediately thereafter.</P>
    <P>Payments will be made directly to married women who have not taken proceedings in accordance with the arrangements which I have outlined.  At the same time, they will be provided with details of the make-up of the payments on account and any additional information they may require will be provided by my Department.</P>
    <P>Determining the entitlements of married women affected by the delay involves very complex and detailed calculations in almost 70,000 cases.  Consequently, it will not be possible, when the initial payment on account is made, to supply details of any additional amounts which may be outstanding or to advise the precise time when such payments will be made.</P>
    <P>In the light of the arrangements which I have introduced, discussions are currently taking place with the legal representatives of married women who have initiated proceedings with a view to settling these proceedings on the basis of the decision of the High Court.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="554" /> In accordance with the standard practice in all litigation, the proposed settlements will provide for the taxation of all legal costs before the Taxing Master of the High Court in default of agreement between the solicitors for the plaintiffs and the Chief State Solicitor.  Consequently, the amount of the fees payable are, in the first instance, a matter for the assessment of the Taxing Master unless agreement is reached.  In accordance with normal accounting procedures approved by the Department of Finance, the legal costs involved are payable by my Department.  The question of whether the plaintiffs will be charged additional fees will be determined by the nature of whatever legally binding agreement they may have entered into with their solicitors.</P>
    <P>In keeping with normal practice, discussions concerning the possible settlement of proceedings must take place with the legal representatives of the married women involved and, in cases where a settlement is agreed, details of the entitlements of the plaintiffs involved will be provided to their legal representatives so that they can be checked against their client's instructions. However, following on the implementation of any settlement agreed, any additional information required by the married women involved in relation to their entitlements will be provided by my Department.</P>
    <P>It is necessary that priority be given to the processing of the entitlements of married women who have initiated proceedings prior to 12 March, 1995 when I announced that the necessary arrangements were being put in place to give full effect to the court's decision, following the Government's decision not to pursue an appeal.  For example, 27 cases involving some 4,400 plaintiffs were listed for hearing in the High Court on 1 June 1995.  Under the provisions of any agreement being finalised with the legal representatives of the married women involved, these claims will be processed in full within the next few weeks.  It is proposed that the entitlements of the remaining 11,000 married women who <Col N="555" /> have initiated proceedings prior to 12 March, 1995 will be processed in the order in which the proceedings have been certified, or the order in which they were initiated, where the proceedings have not been certified.  In view of the number of claims involved and the detailed and complex calculations required, this task will not be completed until the earlier part of 1996. All of the married women involved will receive a payment on account by August next however, on the same basis as payments being made to married women generally.</P>
    <P>The issue of payments on account to all married women in August next has very significant administrative implications for my Department which involve the assignment and training of staff to the special equal treatment unit which I have established and the development of new computer systems. Once these payments on account are made, every effort will be made by my Department to process the remaining entitlements as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I have yet to decide on the sequence in which the remaining entitlements of individual claimants will be processed but one option would be to give priority to those married women who, by virtue of the duration of their claims, are known to have higher entitlements.</P>
    <P>The campaign to obtain the equality payments for married women affected by the delay in implementing the 1979 Equal Treatment Directive has been ongoing for almost 10 years now.  It was in this context that the Government gave a commitment in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to pay the legally determined entitlements of married women to the equality payments. The arrangements which I have introduced give full effect to the decision of the High Court and will ensure that the bulk of the arrears due, some £200 million of the overall estimated costs of £260 million, will be paid by the end of this year, well within the time scale provided for in the programme for Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43, 49 and 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this year's budget all personal and adult rates of payment were increased by 2.5 per cent.  These increases come into effect this week &mdash; that is six weeks earlier than in previous years.  So the value of the increase is greater than it would have been if implemented at the end of July, as had been the policy of previous Governments.  The 2.5 per cent increase is in line with current inflation levels.  It is also in line with the official forecasts for inflation made by both the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.  For families with children, the total increase in family income is greater.  This is because of the substantial increase in child benefit.  We <Col N="557" /> increased this payment by £7 per child per month.</P>
    <P>This year's budget improvements to social welfare payments cost £212.1 million in full-year terms.  This compares to £157.1 million last year.  Within the funds available, the Government gave particular priority to child benefit &mdash; accounting for £90.2 million of these costs.  There were very good reasons for giving particular priority to child benefit. Families with children face particular risks of poverty, so giving greater increases to families with children is an effective way of targeting resources. Furthermore, the existing arrangements whereby child dependant allowances are paid with unemployment payments contributes to unemployment and poverty traps; increasing the amount paid through universal payments like child benefit eases this problem.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied with the adequacy of social welfare rates generally.  In line with a commitment in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> I am arranging a review to be undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute of the minimum adequate rates recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 and 59 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In determining entitlement to an old age non-contributory pension, the first £6 of weekly means are disregarded, so that a person with £6 weekly means qualifies for the same rate of pension as <Col N="558" /> a person with no means.  In the case of a married couple the disregard would be £12 a week.  The £6 disregard was introduced in 1975.</P>
    <P>A number of other disregards also apply as follows: £104 per annum of any earnings of a pensioner for each dependent child; the value of the applicant's home and, where a pensioner sells his or her principal residence and either buys or rents alternative accommodation, or moves into a private nursing home, an exemption of the income derived from the sale applies, up to a limit of £75,000.</P>
    <P>As far as capital is concerned a person can have means up to £2,987.50, if single, or £5,975, if married, and still receive the full rate pension.  A couple could have joint capital up to £66,295 and still qualify for the minimum rate of pension and participate in all the &ldquo;free schemes&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The means assessment takes account of money and property, other than the family home, which is assessed on a notional basis, and of income, subject to certain exceptions, which a person or his or her spouse or partner may reasonably expect to receive in the following year.</P>
    <P>From 1975 to date the increase in the rate of inflation is estimated at 360 per cent.  In the same period the rate of old age &mdash; non-contributory &mdash; pension increased by 572 per cent resulting in a real increase in the rate of pension of over 46 per cent.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers for Social Welfare have concentrated on increasing the rate of non-contributory pension rather than further increasing the disregards which would primarily benefit only those who already had means.  An increase in the level of disregard to £40, as recently suggested by Deputy Hughes, would cost an estimated £50 million per annum.  I am not convinced that this would be the best use of such resources.</P>

      <P>Insured pensioners, if they satisfy the contribution conditions, can receive dentures under the treatment benefit scheme administered by the Department of Social Welfare.  Under this scheme, the patient pays 50 per cent of the cost to the private dentist and the scheme pays the other 50 per cent.  The Department's scheme is paid for out of the Social Insurance Fund and, accordingly, must be accounted for separately.</P>
      <P>Pensioners who hold medical cards are entitled to free dentures under the health board dental scheme.  This scheme was recently expanded to provide a choice-of-dentist system whereby the health boards may arrange for the treatment to be provided by a participating private dentist &mdash; as an alternative to the full time health board dentist.</P>
      <P>In practice, the first point of contact for a person in the vast majority of cases is the dental surgery.  In the bulk of cases my Department does not receive details of the treatment until after they have been carried out.</P>
      <P>At a recent meeting between officials of the Department and the Irish Dental Association, it was agreed that a circular would be issued to dentists outlining how medical card holders might best be advised of the most beneficial way of pursuing their entitlements.  This circular, which will clear up any problems which might exist, is in the process of being agreed with the association and will be issued shortly.</P>

    <P>Information on the amount of savings to employers is not available.  However, Departmental records for the 1993-94 contribution year would indicate that savings of an estimated £2.13 million were made by employers under the scheme for that contribution year.  Similar information in respect of 1994-95 will be available later in the year when the contribution details for that year have been fully updated in my Department.</P>
    <P>The current scheme has provision for the exemption to be granted to persons under 23 years taking up employment for the first time regardless of whether they were signing on the live register or not prior to taking up employment.  In <Col N="561" /> addition to this provision, the exemption will be in respect of two full years from the date of recruitment instead of the two nominated tax years under the previous schemes.</P>
    <P>I am confident that these measures will make a worthwhile contribution to the Government's wide-ranging efforts to combat unemployment.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 68, 74, 146 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>The response to the summer students jobs scheme from both sponsors and students has been very positive again this year with over 2,884 sponsors offering 20,804 jobs which is a substantial increase on the 11,250 jobs offered last year.  A total of 15,789 applications from students have been received to date. This figure has already exceeded the 13,815 received in 1994 despite the fact that the closing date for the receipt of applications is not until 30 June next.  At this stage, almost 11,000 students have been issued with job certificates and it is now clear that the number approved this year will be significantly greater than the 11,961 approved last year.</P>
      <P>The scheme was introduced in 1993 to provide income support for less well-off students who were unable to get summer jobs and who were debarred from receiving unemployment assistance during their holidays.</P>
      <P>This year I introduced a number of significant improvements at an additional cost of £1 million.  I widened the criteria for qualification by providing that students with minimal entitlement to unemployment assistance could qualify.  Under last year's scheme a student had to have a minimum entitlement to unemployment assistance of £15 a week before being issued with a job certificate.  This relaxation, coupled with the recent disregard of covenants, allows a significantly greater number of students to qualify this year.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, I have increased the maximum amount payable to £600 in 1995 for a maximum of 200 hours over a six to 16-week period.  The hourly rate this year is increased to £3,00 which is not subject to tax or PRSI.  Students living at home, whose parents are solely dependent on social welfare payments, for the first time, will this year receive an additional £1.00 per hour worked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These improvements have resulted in an unprecedented volume of applications from third level students which <Col N="563" /> will be to the benefit of their local communities.</P>
    <P>As in 1993 and 1994 the scheme is aimed specifically at third level students and students participating in post-leaving certificate courses.  Second level students are precluded and it is not my intention to include them in this year's scheme.</P>

      <P>In accordance with the powers vested in me under section 7 of the Combat Poverty Agency Act, 1986, I am appointing Ms Anna Lee as chairperson with effect from 21 June.

      <P>Anna Lee is well known for her expertise in the areas which fall within the remit of the Combat Poverty Agency.  She has social work and community work qualifications and has extensive experience of working with voluntary organisations and local community projects, for example Cherish and the ISPCC.  She is currently Manager of the Tallaght Partnership Company Ltd., which is one of the companies responsible for local development in designated disadvantaged areas within the EU Operational Programme for Local, Urban and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>She is currently chairperson of Cherish and a member of the board of Crosscare (the Catholic Social Service Conference of the Dublin Archdiocese), the Government Task Force on Ending Long-term Unemployment of South Dublin County Council Enterprise Board and of the Combat Poverty Agency working group on community development.  She also lectures part-time in community work in Trinity College.</P>
      <P>This is an important time for the Combat Poverty Agency as it has been given a strategic role in the anti-poverty strategy recently announced by the Government arising out of the United Nations World Summit on Social Development held in Copenhagen in March 1995.</P>

      <P>The extra £10 million recently approved by the Government to increase average numbers on the community employment programme by 1,500 to an average of 40,000 participants this year is being funded from savings in a number of Government Departments.</P>
      <P>The contribution from my Department is £7.4 million.  It arises mainly because this upward revision in the numbers participating in community employment schemes reduces expenditure on unemployment assistance and unemployment benefit by my Department.</P>

      <Quest>if his attention has been drawn to the fact that there has been no increase in the child dependant allowance in 1995 in respect of old age pensioners or invalidity pensioners; and the proposals, if any, he has to remedy this matter.</Quest>

      <P>Payments made in respect of all children, including those with children on old age pensions, invalidity pension and other social welfare payments, are being increased significantly in 1995, with the £7 across-the-board increase in child benefit.  Channelling the 1995 increase in child income support through the £7 increase in child benefit is more beneficial to pensioners and others as child benefit is not subject to assessment for tax, or for local authority rights, or for PRSI, and is payable whether the recipient is in employment or not.</P>
      <P>Redirecting the State's contribution towards rearing children through child benefit is a first step towards achieving the commitment in the programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> to provide a form of basic income for children.  Having established a good basic child benefit payment this year, work is progressing on the development of a child benefit supplement.  This new child benefit supplement will incorporate both the child dependant allowances paid to people on social welfare and the family income supplement payable to families on low income from employment.</P>

      <P>The living alone allowance is payable to people of pensionable age <Col N="567" /> who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and is intended to recognise the extra cost of living alone. The national fuel scheme is intended to help households which are dependent on long-term social welfare type payment and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  Payment of the allowance is subject to a means test.</P>
      <P>The people to whom this proposal mainly refers, therefore, are people who have not qualified for a social welfare type pension either because they have not a satisfactory record of contributions to the social welfare insurance scheme or are not in receipt of a non-contributory social welfare pension.</P>
      <P>It is open to any person of pensionable age, whose means are inadequate, to apply to the Department for a non-contributory old age pension.  If they satisfy the means test, they can qualify for a full or partial old age pension and, if living alone, may also qualify for a living alone allowance and for the national fuel scheme.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of extending the entitlement to persons who cannot qualify for social welfare entitlements is estimated at £15 million a year at current rates of payment.  Such expenditure could only be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 81 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="568" /> Proposals for the new lone parent's scheme are currently being considered by my Department.  I expect to be in a position to meet with interested groups shortly before finalising the scheme.  I would then hope to be in a position to submit proposals for consideration by Government with a view to having the scheme operational early next year.</P>
    <P>I have indicated my wish to dispense with the requirement to prove desertion. It is generally recognised that the intrusive inquiries often necessary to establish desertion can be distressing. My intention, therefore, is to ensure that the new arrangements which will be implemented will respect the dignity of the individual, particularly at a very vulnerable time, and will ensure equality between deserted and other categories of separated women and between men and women generally.</P>

      <P>Statistics are not available in my Department as to the number or nationality of pensioners who have transferred their residence from the United Kingdom to Ireland.</P>
      <P>According to statistical data provided by the United Kingdom Department of Social Security the number of persons resident in Ireland who were in receipt of their retirement pension or widow's benefit were as follows:&mdash; 1991, 66,236; 1992, no statistics available; 1993, 71,841 and 1994, 74,361.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These figures represent not only payments to persons who have only worked in the United Kingdom but also to persons who have worked in Ireland and <Col N="569" /> the United Kingdom.  It is estimated that many recipients belong to the latter group, are Irish citizens and may also be in receipt of an Irish pension either under our national legislation or EU social security legislation.  The figures also include persons who have acquired an entitlement to a United Kingdom pension based on their spouse's insurance in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>The legislation of the European Union provides for free movement of persons and equality of treatment between our own nationals and nationals of other EU member states who are workers or former workers and who are resident in this State.  Our social welfare legislation is fully in accordance with these principles.  This legislation also provides for payment of contributory pensions to persons who are resident in other member states.  Some 13,200 people resident in the United Kingdom are in receipt of Irish contributory pensions at an estimated cost of £22.8 million per annum.</P>
    <P>The Deputy mentions &ldquo;inducements&rdquo; offered in Ireland to United Kingdom pensioners.  I assume this refers to additional benefits, such as the free schemes, available in this country. Everyone agrees that the free schemes are very important to the pensioners as they enable them to lead an active retirement and maintain social contact. Over the years the free schemes have been extended to include those in receipt of United Kingdom or Northern Ireland pensions similar to the qualifying Irish payments, those in receipt of pensions from other EU member states or from a country with which we have a bilateral social security agreement.</P>
    <P>Those in receipt of United Kingdom payments and also in receipt of free schemes are receiving benefits to which they are legally entitled.  I should like to point out to the Deputy that the Department of Social Security estimate that the annual cost of pensions to persons resident in Ireland is in excess of £100 million per annum.  The Deputy will appreciate that this inflow is a considerable benefit to the Irish economy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>The free electricity allowance scheme is one of the group of free schemes which includes the free natural gas allowance scheme, the free television licence scheme and the free telephone rental scheme which are available only to people who are in receipt of welfare type pensions and who satisfy the living alone conditions of those schemes.  The purpose of the free schemes is to encourage elderly or disabled people, who are living alone on limited means, to continue to live in their own homes rather than go into residential care. About 200,000 people benefit from these schemes at present at an annual cost of £60 million.</P>
      <P>The living alone conditions attached to these schemes allow certain people to live with the pensioner without affecting his entitlement.  The excepted people include a dependent spouse, dependent children and a carer, in the case of an invalid.  Where the pensioner is 75 years of age or over, the allowances continue in place where the living alone conditions cease to be satisfied because a non-excepted person moved in with the pensioner.</P>
      <P>Any proposal to broaden the current application of the living alone condition or to abolish it altogether would have cost implications which could only be considered in the context of available resources and other priorities.</P>

      <P>Over the years there has been ongoing contact, both at ministerial level and official level between the Department of Social Welfare and the Social Security Agency of Northern Ireland.  As a result of this contact, co-operation in social security matters between officials and their colleagues in Northern Ireland has been enhanced.</P>
      <P>Co-operation in relation to eliminating cross-Border fraud, especially that of working in one jurisdiction while claiming in another, has been particularly good.

      <P>Community employment is administered by FÁS under the aegis of the Department of Enterprise and Employment.  The programme promotes the provision of work for unemployed persons towards providing them with opportunities for personal and skills development.  The programme replaced the social employment scheme, the community employment development programme and teamwork from March 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the programme, part-time employment is provided in non-commercial socially desirable projects which are sponsored by, among others, local authorities and community groups.  Participants must be aged 21 or over and in receipt of unemployment assistance or either unemployment benefit or lone parent's allowance for at least one year. Employment under the programme is normally limited to one year but may be extended depending on the nature of the work.  No PRSI payment is required <Col N="573" /> of the participant &mdash; while a reduced rate PRSI contribution is payable by employers in respect of this employment which covers participants in respect of occupational injuries benefit. Participants in community employment are awarded credited contributions in respect of each week of participation. These credited contributions ensure that a participant's social insurance record is protected in relation to qualification for future benefits and pension. Under the legislation, periods spent on FÁS courses, educational schemes and on community employment is disregarded in deciding a break in the claim.  Where the claimant afterwards resumes his claim to UB or UA, entitlement is resumed as applied at the point where they departed that is they are entitled to the number of days UB unclaimed (390 less days paid) at the point they commenced the scheme-course or to resume payment of UA at the long term rate if they had previously been in receipt of the long term rate.  In addition, participants continue to receive the secondary benefits to which they were entitled while on the live register.</P>
    <P>To extend full rate PRSI cover to employees would substantially increase the costs of implementing the community employment programme which caters for some 40,000 persons a year and such a change is not being considered.</P>

      <P>Increases in the real value of social welfare payments since the Commission on Social Welfare's report have meant significant progress towards the achievement of the commission's recommended rate.  In 1994, all social welfare weekly rates had reached the commission's &ldquo;priority&rdquo; rate.  This <Col N="577" /> year's budget improvements to social welfare payments cost £212.1 million in full year terms.  This compares with £157.1 million in 1994.  Within the funds available, the Government gave particular priority to child benefit &mdash; this accounted for £90.2 million of these costs.</P>
      <P>As stated in our policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal</i> the rate for disability and unemployment payments will increase towards the main rate recommended by the commission.  Notwithstanding this significant progress, I have made it clear in this House that I do not regard the current rates of social welfare as adequate in any sense, even where we have reached or have almost reached the lower end of the commision's main rate recommendation.  The whole area of adequate payments is in need of fundamental review.</P>
      <P>The Government's programme for renewal gives a commitment to commission the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) to review the minimum adequate payment rates which were recommended by the Commission on Social Welfare.  The study is being commisioned with a view to recommending new rates in the light of improvements in social welfare and other changes since that report was published. Discussions on this study are ongoing with a view to having the report finalised next year.</P>
      <P>The commission recommended regular reviews of their proposed rates to ensure that they evolved in line with general economic developments.  I think that this review is badly needed and it will make an important contribution to determining the path of social policy as we move towards the end of the century.</P>

      <Quest>if he will extend the lone parent's allowance to persons who opt to live at home with their parents without loss of allowances, such as free television licence and free electricity; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>The free television licence scheme and the free electricity allowance scheme are two of the free schemes administered by my Department which also include the free natural gas allowance and the free telephone rental allowance.  The purpose of these schemes is to encourage elderly or disabled people living alone on limited means to continue to live in their own homes instead of going into residential care.</P>
      <P>In order to qualify for the free schemes, the applicant must be in receipt of a social welfare type payment as an elderly or disabled person.  A recipient of a lone parent's allowance would have to be aged 66 years or over to be eligible.  Applicants must also satisfy the living alone conditions of these schemes which means the applicant must either be living alone or only with certain excepted persons such as dependants or people with a personal entitlement to the free schemes.</P>
      <P>I understand the Deputy has in mind a situation in which a lone parent goes to live with his or her parents.  If, previous to the move, both households had entitlements to a free television licence and to a free electricity allowance, one set of the allowances would cease because only one allowance is payable per household and the payment is made only to the person responsible for the licensing of the television set and for payment of the electricity accounts.  The usual situation, however, is that only the parents have qualified for the allowances and the arrival of the lone parent in their household is a breach of the living alone conditions and the parents, therefore, lose their entitlements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A lone parent may move back to the parental home because of the advantages for all the parties concerned and these usually outweigh the loss of the entitlement to the free schemes that may result in some cases.  Any change in the rules of the free schemes to allow <Col N="579" /> the parents to retain the allowances in such circumstances would have substantial financial implications for the cost of the free schemes which could only be considered in the context of the resources available and other priorities.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that men and women are treated equally in relation to access to all social welfare schemes and services.  All initiatives undertaken by my Department are gender-proofed as a matter of course.</P>
      <P>The Second Commission on the Status of Women was established by the Government in 1990 with, <i>inter alia</i>, the following terms of reference: (i) to review the implementation of the recommendations of the First Commission on the Status of Women as set out in that commission's report to the Minister for Finance in December 1972 and (ii) to consider and make recommendations on the means, administrative and legislative, by which women will be able to participate on equal terms and conditions with men in economic, social, political and cultural life and, to this end, to consider the efficacy and feasibility of positive action measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The commission presented its full report to Government in 1993.  The report contained 210 individual recommendations, covering a wide range of issues in the public, private and personal spheres.  Since then a monitoring committee was set up to oversee the implementation of the commission's recommendations. My Department is <Col N="580" /> represented on that committee.  In addiion, an interdepartmental group, representative of those Departments into whose remit the bulk of the commission's recommendations fall, was also established.</P>
    <P>The monitoring committee produced its first progress report in May 1994 and the report records progress made in implementing the commission's recommendations up to 1 March 1994.  The main recommendations relating to my own Department where substantial progress has been made cover issues such as: the improvements made in the means-test arrangements for lone parents; the launch of the household budget scheme in 1993; the funding of mens' groups which was undertaken for the first time in 1994; funding of locally based womens' groups was increased to £1.4 million in 1994, well over the £1 million recommended by the commission; the more established womens' groups are now being core-funded for a three year period; dental benefit for dependent spouses was introduced in 1987.</P>
    <P>The progress achieved on these issues and the other recommendations of the commission appropriate to my Department is outlined in the report.</P>
    <P>Since the report was produced, further progress has been made in a number of important areas as recommended by the commission.  The 1995 budget has provided for up to 20 years credits for carers of children up to 12 years of age or while caring for an elderly or disabled person.  A new health and safety benefit for women at work was introduced in October 1994.  Adoptive benefit has been introduced with effect from 19 April 1995.  A new unified lone parents scheme is being prepared by the Department which will apply equally to men and women.  Under the Social Welfare (No. 2) Bill spouses of either gender will have their pension entitlements protected in the event of divorce.</P>

      <P>It is not clear what additional benefits the Deputy has in mind.  While overall the levels of all social welfare payments need to be increased, old age pensions have increased, in real terms, by over 40 per cent over the past 20 years.  Social welfare expenditure on transfers to the elderly amounts to £1,068 million this year equivalent to over 26 per cent of total social welfare expenditure.  This expenditure is in respect of over 321,000 elderly people, including their dependants.</P>
      <P>The free schemes administered by my Department include free travel, free electricity allowance, free natural gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence.  They are available, in the case of free travel, to all persons in the State aged 66 years and over and to certain disabled people under age 66 and, in the case of the other schemes, to persons who are in receipt of a welfare-type payment who satisfy the living alone condition.  In addition the free fuel allowance is available to elderly people who are in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The free schemes are intended to serve specific purposes in relation to the people who are entitled to them.  Free travel is intended to encourage the elderly or disabled to remain active in the community while the free electricity allowance, free natural gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and the free television licence schemes are designed to encourage elderly or disabled people who are living alone on limited means to continue to live in <Col N="582" /> their own homes and to provide them with an element of security <i>vis á vis</i> their basic needs.</P>
    <P>Additional weekly allowances are payable to pensioners in receipt of a social welfare payment who are living alone and to those who are over 80 years of age.</P>
    <P>The payments to the elderly, taken together with the value of their non-cash benefits, mean that the elderly are at the higher end of the social welfare payment structure and I have to take this into account in allocating further resources.</P>
    <P>My Department is currently examining the final report of the National Pensions Board, which <i>inter alia</i>, looked at the structure of pension provision.  In addition, as part of the budgetary process we examine the various reports of the voluntary groups in this area.</P>
    <P>Any further improvements in or enhancements of the existing programmes would have to be considered in the light of these reports and the availability of additional financial resources.  If the Deputy has any specific proposals in mind I will have them considered.</P>

      <P>Members of the travelling community do not have to satisfy any special qualifying conditions for social welfare payments over and above those required of the settled community. Special signing arrangements did apply to members of the travelling community who were in receipt of unemployment assistance whereby they were required to sign on at a specified time each week at designated social welfare local offices. The arrangements were reviewed last <Col N="583" /> year in the context of improvements to the signing arrangements for unemployed people generally.  Members of the travelling community, in common with claimants generally, are now required to sign on once a month only and at the social welfare local office nearest to where they are living.  They are paid each week at their local post office.  I am keeping the new arrangements under review to see what further changes may be necessary to improve the present arrangements and reflect more closely the particular life-style of travellers.</P>

      <P>The child benefit paid by the Department of Social Welfare is specifically exempted from income tax liability by virtue of Section 354 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  It is presumed, therefore, that the Deputy is referring to the child dependant additions (CDAs) which are payable in addition to the basic Social Welfare payment which a claimant is entitled to.</P>
      <P>The position is that under Social Welfare legislation the basic Social Welfare payment to which a beneficiary is entitled to is increased by an appropriate amount in respect of each qualified child dependant.  The CDAs form part of the entitlement due to a claimant and are not the entitlement of the qualifying child or children concerned.  The moneys paid are, consequently, income in the hands of the claimant and where the Social Welfare benefit is liable to income tax the entire amount received by the claimant is assessed for tax.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the 1995 budget exempted the CDAs payable with unemployment benefit and disability benefit from income tax.  This change, together with the other income tax improvements which I announced in the budget, meets the commitment in the Government's Programme of Renewal to restructure the method of taxing UB and DB in order to improve the position of those most adversely affected.  This exemption, however, applies only to CDAs payable with these two specific Social Welfare benefits.</P>
      <P>I have no plans to change the tax liability of CDAs payable with other social welfare payments which are liable to income tax.</P>

      <P>The basis on which any foreign company pays tax in the State depends on the facts in each particular case.  The general position is that a foreign company which has a permanent establishment in the State will be liable to pay corporation tax in respect of the profits arising from its trading activities carried on in the State.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics are not recorded or processed in such a manner as would enable the information requested by the Deputy to be provided on the extent of Irish corporation tax paid by the British newspaper companies whose products are sold here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that, for reasons of confidentiality I cannot comment in detail on the tax position of individual companies.  However, I understand that many of the British newspaper companies do not have a permanent establishment here but that <Col N="589" /> their newspapers are sold in the State through distribution companies.  In such a case, the foreign newspaper company would not be liable to Irish corporation tax because it would not be carrying on a trade in the State.  The distribution company would, of course, be liable to Irish corporation tax on its profits from this activity.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should point out that the sale of all newspapers in the State is liable to VAT at 12.5 per cent rate.</P>

    <P>The licensing year for the main intoxicating liquor licences, including publicans's licences, runs from 1 October to the following 30 September.  Because many publicans who applied for tax clearance, after it was introduced in October 1992, were initially unsuccessful (because their tax affairs were not in order) but subsequently were successful in 1993, there is a marked reduction in the figure shown for the 1992 calendar year when compared with figures quoted in previous calendar years.  In other words, many licences which would in previous years have been renewed before the end of December were not in fact renewed until between January and September of the following year.</P>
    <P>As regards tax clearance, I am informed by the commissioners that as the Collector-General's Office does not maintain a record of applicatons for tax clearance by reference to the different categories of intoxicating liquor licences, it is not possible to give separate figures for holders of publican's licences.  However, the current overall position in respect of the licensing year 1 October 1994, to 30 September 1995 <Col N="591" /> is that out of a total of 12,780 applications for tax clearance certificates in respect of intoxicating liquor licences (including publicans' licences, manufacturers' licences, dealers' licences etc.) which have been received 11,735 applications have been approved while the balance are under consideration.</P>
    <P>The commissioners have also informed me that as information is not readily available on the number of licences which have not been renewed since the introduction of tax clearance it has not been possible to provide this figure in the time allowed.  However, this information is being compiled at the moment and I will provide it to the Deputy when it becomes available.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I should first of all like to point out to the Deputy that the South-Eastern Health Board has responsibility for the delivery of health services in its functional area.  The board's development of its mental health services is in line with the recommendations of the report <i>Planning for the Future</i>&mdash; which was published in 1984 and which has been accepted by successive Governments.  This report advocated a shift in the delivery of mental health services from a predominantly institutional to a community based approach in caring for and treating persons with mental illness.  There is a planned reduction by the board in the number of in-patients beds at St. Otteran's Hospital as the development of appropriate community residential accommodation on a phased basis continues.</P>
      <P>The board has a total of 34 beds for elderly mentally infirm patients, including those suffering from alzheimer disease, in the Waterford community care area.  These beds are located in St. Otteran's and in St. Patrick's Hospital, Dungarvan.  This number is in line with the norms contained in <i>The Years Ahead &mdash; A Policy for the Elderly.</i>  At present two people are awaiting admission to the 24 bed EMI unit attached to St. Otteran's.  There are no patients awaiting admission to St. Patrick's. Admissions to each unit are continually monitored and the board is satisfied that the units are capable of meeting normal demand levels.</P>

While there is no specific plan for a community unit and health centre for the elderly in Dalkey, a unit which is planned for Dún Laoghaire will cater for a catchment area which includes the Dalkey area.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The provision of health services in the Wicklow area is a matter in the first instance for the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that current acute hospital services in County Wicklow are well provided for by St. Vincents' Hospital, Elm Park; St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire and St. Colmcille's Hospital, Loughlinstown. In addition to the annual allocations received by these hospitals, a sum of over £3.3 million has been allocated in the past two years in respect of additional service developments, maintenance and the purchase of new equipment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will also be aware that West County Wicklow is included in the catchment area which will be served by the new Tallaght Hospital which is the largest hospital project ever commissioned in the history of the State.  It will be a 513 bed teaching hospital with an out-patient and accident and emergency department, a childrens' unit, psychiatric unit and a geriatric assessment and rehabilitation unit as well as nearly 300 general medical and surgical beds.  Building is due to be completed in December 1996 and the hospital is <Col N="600" /> scheduled to open in 1997.  When completed, the people of west County Wicklow, Tallaght and south Kildare will have a hospital with state of the art technology and patient facilities which will compare favourably with the best international standards.</P>
    <P>In relation to mental handicap services a sum of £2.665 million has been allocated to the Eastern Health Board area for the development of these services in 1995.  Details of the proposals agreed with the Eastern Mental Handicap Central Planning Committee are currently being examined by my Department.  The proposals include a number of service developments for the Wicklow area.</P>
    <P>With regard to psychiatric services, the main in-patient base for those with mental illness is Newcastle Hospital, County Wicklow.  Care is provided in two wards in the hospital, an acute admission ward with 36 beds and a long-stay psycho-geriatric ward with 38 beds. Community residential facilities comprise a range of high, medium and low-support community residences.</P>
    <P>The quality of care provided in both the hospital and community residence is of a very high standard and the inspector of mental hospitals, who carries out a statutory annual inspection of all public psychiatric hospitals and associated community residences, is most complimentary of the Newcastle service and considers the hospital to be one of the better ones in the country.</P>
    <P>I am very satisfied with the level of health services being provided for the people of County Wicklow and wish to assure the Deputy of the Government's continuing commitment to the further development of these services.</P>

      <P>The Grand Canal Corridor Study report which I published last July, recommended a strategy and proposals for the development of the Grand Canal from Ringsend to Lucan Road Bridge.  In relation to the canal stretch between Tyrconnell Road and the 10th Lock the report recommended a programme of environmental and amenity improvements to be carried out by the Waterways Service in conjunction with local communities.</P>
      <P>The Waterways Service recently invited representatives of local communities in the area between the 3rd Lock at Tyrconnell Road and the 10th Lock, to work with them in preparing such a scheme.  It is intended that when a scheme is agreed it will be submitted to FÁS for assistance under the Community Employment Scheme, the Community Youth Training Programme or other appropriate measure.  It is envisaged that the scheme will be undertaken by community groups with the assistance of and in close co-operation with the Waterways Service.  The Grand Canal Corridor Task Force, which I established to co-ordinate and monitor the activities of the various agencies responsible for the development of the corridor, and to provide the necessary impetus for the implementation of the strategy and proposals, is taking an active interest in the proposed scheme and will continue to do so.</P>
      <P>With regard to funding it is intended that labour will be funded under the FÁS schemes and the necessary materials etc., will be provided by the Waterways Service from the overall allocation for environmental improvements on the canals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While it is too early at this stage to say what the extent of the work to be undertaken will be, I am anxious, <Col N="602" /> however, that the project will have a significant impact in improving the environment and amenity of the area.  The discussions with the community groups are still at an early stage and it is not possible to say how soon work will commence. I am anxious, however, that this should happen at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of the canal will remain with the Waterways Service.</P>

      <P>The strategy document &ldquo;Recycling for Ireland&rdquo; sets out the general approach being adopted to promote waste recovery in the period to the end of 1999.  The recently published Waste Bill, 1995, contains extensive measures to promote waste recovery including powers to require the provision of waste receptacles at sales outlets. I have no plans to make additional provision in this regard in planning legislation.  The provision of car parking facilities in conjunction with shopping facilities is, in any event, a matter for decision in each particular case; specific requirements do not arise from planning regulations.</P>

      <P>The Garda authorities are responsible for the allocation of manpower and resources to individual areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand from the Garda authorities that the strength of the Border <Col N="613" /> Divisions has decreased by 53 since 31 July 1994.  This was due to retirements, resignations and the reassignment of 16 probationer gardaí to Dublin following graduation.  The gardaí who would normally fill these vacancies have been assigned to those areas of most need, in particular, the major urban centres.  The situation is being kept under continuous review by the Garda authorities.</P>
    <P>Drugs units have been established in each of the city's five Garda Divisions and their activities are co-ordinated through the Central Drug Unit in Harcourt Square.  Full-time drug units also operate in Cork East, Limerick and Galway.  The Garda, Customs and Excise and the Naval Service work closely together to prevent drug importation. Some very substantial finds have been made recently.</P>
    <P>With regard to the drugs problem in general, my Department has finalised a detailed and comprehensive report on important aspects of law enforcement in relation to this issue in the country. Based on that report, I have prepared a set of comprehensive and far-reaching proposals which I will put before the Government very shortly.  The main task of the report was to identify the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem by existing law enforcement agencies and the proposals will be mainly concerned with this aspect.  The report also examined the legal powers of members of the law enforcement agencies and the need for legislative changes to assist the law enforcement response.  The contribution in health and education areas in developing strategies to reduce demand for drugs is also considered.  The proposals which I will be bringing to Government shortly will cover all these aspects.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 133 and 134 together.  The variety and complexity of policing arrangements in many European states makes it difficult to establish accurate comparisons in this regard.  The following table which is based on a report published by the Centre for Study of Public Order at the University of Leicester compares the ratio of police to population in the principal police forces in the European Union in 1993.  The figure for Ireland in that study was based on a strength of 10,500.  However, the present strength of the Force is approximately 10,800 which represents a police to population ratio of approximately 1:326.</P>
      <P>For a true comparison of relative manpower commitments to policing in other jurisdictions, it would also be necessary, of course, to take account of other relevant factors such as the overall level of crime in those jurisdictions.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are Garda sub-stations at Dublin and Shannon airports and that a permanent Garda presence is provided at Cork Airport from Anglesea Street Garda station.  They inform me that there is a total of 57 members of the Force permanently attached to these airports.  These members perform duties in relation to immigration and security. In the other airports in the State, these duties are performed by gardaí from within the district where the airport is located.</P>
      <P>The policing arrangements at airports are, of course, a matter for the Garda authorities and like all operational arrangements within the Force are regularly subject to review.  These arrangements are currently being reviewed by the Garda authorities but they inform me that there are no plans at present to alter the number of gardaí attached to these units.  Any other changes that may be considered necessary by the Garda authorities will be implemented on a phased basis and will involve discussions with the members' representative associations.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to answer Questions Nos. 147 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>The free travel companion pass is a variation on the standard free travel pass.  The companion pass is available to people who qualify for free travel and who, on account of a disability, are unable to travel alone.  Such incapacitated people are facilitated to use public transport services when they are accompanied by a companion, was also travels free of charge.  The majority of existing companion passholders are either blind or mentally handicapped.</P>
      <P>From 1 July 1995, the companison pass scheme is being extended to existing free travel passholders who are being cared for by a recipient of a carer's allowance.  This will enable both the person being cared for and the carer to avail of free travel when travelling together on public transport.  However, a person over 16 other than the carer may accompany the passholder.  This will ensure the carer can be relieved as they choose.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure that as many qualified people as possible benefit under this extension, my Department is currently contacting all existing recipients of carers' allowance to notify them of this development in the free travel scheme.  It is not possible at this stage to quantify the exact numbers of people who will benefit under this extension of free travel services.  There are nearly 5,700 recipients of carer's allowance at present.  It is expected that a large proportion of the incapacitated people they are caring for will avail of this concession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>Any person employed as a home help by a health board is subject to the normal PRSI rules and are insured at the class A rate of contribution in respect of any week in which earnings exceed the £30 threshold.  PRSI at the class A rate gives cover for the full range of contributory benefits and pensions available under the social welfare system, subject to the usual statutory conditions.  Persons whose earnings fall below £30 per week are insured at a reduced rate which covers occupational injuries benefits only.</P>
      <P>Home helps working part-time and earning below £60 per week are exempt from the employee's share of PRSI while those earning in excess of that amount benefit from the £50 PRSI allowance introduced by this Government in the last budget.</P>
      <P>Home helps are eligible to apply for unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, as appropriate, for any days or weeks during which they are not engaged in home help duties but are otherwise available for work.  The social welfare legislation already provides that, in the case of unemployment assistance and other means-tested payments, earnings from home help duties will not be taken into account for means-test purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The legislation also provides for circumstances where the adult dependant of a social welfare recipient is employed as a home help.  In these cases, the dependent spouse is entitled to earn up to £60 per week without affecting entitlement to any adult dependant allowance or child dependant allowances in payment.  Other measures taken to encourage and support the concept of home help work include an arrangement whereby entitlement to payments such as the family income <Col N="625" /> supplement or lone parent's allowance is not adversely affected by earnings from home help duties.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, a considerable degree of flexibility within the social welfare system to enable recipients or their adult dependants to engage in home help duties while still retaining existing social welfare payments in most circumstances.  Any further improvements in this regard would be a matter for consideration in the context of available resources and other priorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in reply to the Deputy's previous question, No. 200 of 7 February 1995, I found the Combat Poverty Agency's pre-budget submission very useful in considering proposals for the 1995 budget.  I also arranged for copies of the submission to be sent to all Government Departments for information and attention in so far as their areas of responsibility are concerned. The Combat Poverty Agency's submission recommmeded that priority emphasis should be (i) on productive measures to enable the long term unemployed to access work and (ii) income <Col N="627" /> transfers which target the poorest sectors, in particular households raising children.  The agency submission also called for increased resources to be made available for support for community development and that any increased demands on the Combat Poverty Agency itself would be matched by increased resources.</P>
      <P>I detailed the social welfare improvements made in the 1995 budget in my speech to the House on 9 February 1995.  Specific measures in the budget which address issues raised by the agency include:</P>
      <P>Households with children</P>
      <P>An additional £7 per month in child benefit allowance, together with an extension for 18 year olds in full-time education or attending certain FÁS courses; extensions of child dependant allowances up to 22 years of age for those in full-time education; an increase of £5 for each child in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.</P>
      <P>Long-term unemployed</P>
      <P>Changes to the PRSI system to benefit both employers and employees and improvements in the back-to-work allowance, which is one of the main elements of my Department's employment support measures designed to assist the long term unemployed access job opportunities; a further extension of the PRSI exemption scheme to include young people under 23 years of age being taken on in a new job as their first employment; an increase from £10 to £25 in the minimum payment of unemployment assistance where board and lodgings are assessed for people living at home and the abolition of board and lodging assessment for those living other than with their parents.</P>
      <P>Community development</P>
      <P>An additional £3 million for supports to voluntary and community organisations in 1995.</P>
      <P>Combat Poverty Agency</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A net additional £400,000 of funding for the Combat Poverty Agency to <Col N="628" /> enhance its existing work and allow it to undertake additional pilot anti-poverty programmes.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Deputy will note that one of the broader recommendations made by the agency was for the introduction of a social audit system to assess the equity implications of all aspects of Government expenditure.  As already announced, the Government has accepted my proposals for a national poverty strategy, which will involve putting in place mechanisms to ensure that the issue of reducing poverty and social exclusion is firmly on the agenda of all Government Departments and agencies, and that there is appropriate co-ordination across and between Departments on policy in this area.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme assists householders who are in receipt of social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their own heating needs.  An applicant for a fuel allowance must live alone or only with qualified dependants or another eligible claimant and must satisfy a means test.</P>
      <P>The scheme was reduced from a period of 30 weeks to 26 weeks in October 1988 by the Fianna Fáil administration. The scheme now runs for a 26 week period from mid-October to mid-April each year.  The 1995-96 national fuel scheme will start on week commencing Monday, 16 October 1995 and finish in week ending Friday, 12 April 1996.  A payment of £5 per week will be paid to eligible households during this period. Only one fuel allowance is payable per household.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An applicant and his or her household who have a combined income from any source of more than £5 per week <Col N="629" /> above the relevant contributory social welfare income will not qualify for the allowance.  I have increased this £5 means limit to £10 with effect from the start of the 1995-96 fuel scheme.</P>
    <P>In addition to the national fuel allowance, a smokeless fuel allowance of £3 per week was introduced in October 1990 to assist people living in the built-up areas of Dublin to meet the additional costs arising from the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in these areas.  This allowance has been extended to cover Cork to coincide with the ban on the sale of bituminous coal in the city and adjacent areas which came into effect on 13 February 1995.</P>
    <P>In 1993 expenditure on the fuel scheme, on a calendar year basis, was £37.55 million.  Final figures are not yet available for 1994, but provisional returns indicate that expenditure for the calendar year will be in the region of £39.9 million.  A sum of £44.5 million has been provided for the fuel scheme in the 1995 Estimates.  To extend the scheme by one month would cost £7 million.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to improve the pensions of senior citizens to keep them in line with inflation in view of the fact that many of the increases are used up by the increases in local authority rents.</Quest>

      <P>The rate of old age contributory pension and old age non-contributory pension increased by 559 per cent and 572 per cent respectively in the period 1975 to date while inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, in the same period is estimated at 359 per cent, resulting in a real increase in the rate of pension of over 43 per cent for old age contributory pension and 46 per cent in the case of old age non-contributory pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition these pensioners are entitled to the free fuel allowance and <Col N="630" /> the other schemes i.e. free travel, free electricity allowance, free TV licence and free telephone rental allowance subject, of course, to the eligibility conditions applicable to each scheme.  The level of payments to the elderly was maintained in line with inflation in this year's budget.</P>
    <P>The setting of differential rents by local authorities is a matter for each individual local authority and I would have no function in the matter.  I am aware that Dublin Corporation is limiting its rent increase from 1996 to ensure that not more than 15 per cent of any social welfare increase will be included. I propose to take the issue up with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, to clarify that the current arrangements are working satisfactorily in all local authority areas.</P>
    <P>The compilation of the Consumer Price Index takes account of changes in housing costs and so linking social welfare rates to this index does maintain the real value of these payments.</P>

      <P>There are two social welfare local offices and three social welfare branch offices servicing County Wicklow. The social welfare local offices situated in Bray and Arklow provide a full information service to customers as well as dealing with all unemployment payment claims and the acceptance and registration of disability benefit claims. The branch offices in Baltinglass, Blessington and Wicklow town which are managed under a contract arrangement by branch managers for the Department <Col N="631" /> provide an unemployment payment service for unemployed persons who are resident in those areas.  A job facilitation service is provided for persons registered as unemployed at these five offices by staff from the Department's employment support services section.</P>
      <P>In addition there are social welfare inspectors based in Bray, Wicklow and Arklow who investigate social welfare claims and carry out PRSI inspections at employer premises.  They also provide an information service on designated days.  Inspectors based in Athy, Naas, Newbridge and Tallaght provide these services for the west Wicklow area.</P>
      <P>The social welfare office in Bray which at present operates from two locations is not considered suitable for present needs and is due to be replaced. In this regard the Office of Public Works is involved in discussions with a developer about the provision of a new office.  While it is not possible at this stage to give a definite date for the opening of a new office it is expected that significant progress in this matter will be made soon.</P>
      <P>The service provided in County Wicklow is considered to be satisfactory.  The Department's aim is to provide the best possible locally based service and in this regard the services in County Wicklow will be kept under review in the light of developments generally.</P>

      <P>The primary <Col N="634" /> responsibility of the insurance supervisory authority is to ensure that insurers authorised to carry on business in this country meet their statutory reserve and solvency requirements.  In order to fulfil these requirements, insurers must be free to set their premiums in the light of their underwriting experience.  Insurers maintain that, on the basis of their underwriting experience, drivers with certain disabilities are likely to be a greater risk than the average motorist, particularly where a disabled driver is also an inexperienced driver.</P>
      <P>The question of high risk loadings applied to insurance premiums of disabled drivers has been taken up by my Department on many occasions both with individual insurance companies and with the insurance industry representative bodies.  Arising from the referral of the problem of disability loadings to the Motor Insurance Advisory Board it was agreed that: provided the driver remained claims free, a maximum loading of 20 per cent disability would apply in the first year of insurance; this would decrease to 15 per cent in the second year of claims free insurance and no loading at all would apply thereafter provided that the driver remained claims free.  This arrangement is being operated by all the authorised motor insurers.  It does not apply in the cases of degenerative illnesses and is subject to the insurer's right to call for a medical examination.</P>

      <P>Area aid under the EU arable support system is confined in the case of peas to those which are harvested in a dry state.  Vining peas, which are harvested at a green stage, are not eligible for area aid.  I made a submission to Commissioner Fischler earlier this year seeking the inclusion of vining peas in the aid system. Representations were also made to the Commission at official level and the question of the inclusion of peas which were mechanically dehydrated after harvesting was raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received a detailed response <Col N="639" /> from the Commissioner setting out the reasons for excluding vining peas from the area aid system.  The main reasons are: in the reform of the CAP agreed in 1992, area aid payments were included for producers in order to compensate them for loss of revenue caused by the Council's decision to reduce institutional prices for cereals and abolish those for oilseeds and pulses.  As vining peas had never been covered by a previous support regime, no loss of revenue was attributable to the Council's decision and hence there was no provision for compensatory payment; inclusion of these peas in the support system threatened to create distortions in the market, partly due to the differentiated rates of aid for small and large producers.  It also became evident that contracts for vining peas could be structured in such a way that the benefit would go to the processor and not the producer.  For these and other reasons there was strong opposition from producers of vining peas in the major production regions to the inclusion of this crop in the area aid system; the de-coupling of area aid from production protected this form of internal support from reductions required under the GATT agreement.  The introduction of an end use obligation such as air or freeze dried peas could jeopardise the protected status of these payments.</P>
    <P>In the light of this response I am considering whether the issue can be more successfully raised in the future.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 178, 182, 183, 184 and 185 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 27 May 1995, Defence Forces personnel have provided an emergency fire service in Wexford.  The provision <Col N="642" /> of the service, which involves a total of 126 Defence Forces personnel, followed a request for assistance from Wexford County Council through the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>The cost incurred by the Department of Defence in preparation for the provision of the emergency fire service operation was approximately £21,000. This previously planned expenditure, involved some work in Wexford Barracks, i.e. the widening of the entrance and the fitting of showers (£15,000) and the purchase of communications equipment (£6,000), was advanced because of the industrial dispute.  Accordingly, it is not planned to seek recoupment of these costs from any source.  The beds supplied to Wexford Barracks were taken from Army stores and will be returned when the dispute is over.  No television sets were purchased by the Department.</P>
    <P>The provision of the emergency fire service by the Defence Forces is being undertaken on the basis that any additional costs incurred by the Department of Defence will be recouped from Wexford County Council.</P>
    <P>All members of the Defence Forces involved in the provision of the emergency fire service are being paid a Maintenance of Essential Services Allowance. The estimated weekly cost of the allowance is £15,000 approximately.  In addition to the cost of the allowance, some other costs will arise in relation to the use of vehicles, fuels etc.  Accommodation costs for those members of the Defence Forces who are not being accommodated in a military barracks are being paid directly by Wexford County Council.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the Defence Forces involvement in the provision of the emergency fire service will depend on the duration of the dispute.</P>
    <P>The question of any involvement of members of the Garda Síochána in the provision of the emergency fire service in Wexford is a matter for the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <P>The Department has under consideration proposals to release certain personnel from daily duties in dining complexes in barracks.  These duties relate, for example, to the serving of meals and to clearing up utensils and equipment afterwards.  In order to establish parameters as to feasibility and cost, a pilot project is being undertaken at Cathal Brugha Barracks involving the contracting out of the duties indicated to a civilian firm.  Following the holding of a tender competition a contract has been awarded to an Irish company which is a subsidiary of a British-based group involved in the catering trade.  It is <Col N="645" /> understood that the majority of staff to be engaged on the project will be recruited in Ireland.</P>
