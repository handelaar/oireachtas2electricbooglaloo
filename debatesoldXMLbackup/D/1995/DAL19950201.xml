      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a notice of motion under Standing Order 30 from Deputy Noel Dempsey.  I now call on Deputy Dempsey to state the matter of which he has given notice to me.</P>

      <P>Under Standing Order 30 I seek permission to move the Adjournment of the Dáil to discuss the following matter of extreme public concern and importance requiring consideration, namely the urgent measures required to be taken to alleviate the distress and losses suffered by those affected by recent flooding and also the long term measures the Government proposes to take to limit the effects of such flooding in the future.</P>

I understand further that the Minister for the Environment, Deputy Howlin, will be answering questions on this subject tomorrow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach agree that the leak in today's edition of the English newspaper <i>The Times,</i> of a version of the Framework Document, which appears to be a very recent draft of that document and certainly one that has been produced since the change of Government on 15 December 1994, is extremely damaging to the national interest?  Will the Taoiseach assure the House and the public that he will carry out a vigorous investigation as to who might be responsible?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter adverted to by the Deputy is not in order.  It is not one for the Order of Business and should be dealt with as a serious matter in a more formal way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a serious matter and it should be taken seriously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind the Taoiseach &mdash; I do not believe he needs me to remind him &mdash; in case it is necessary that a leak of the Irish draft of the Framework Document 18 months ago, in the autumn of 1993, almost wrecked the Downing Street Joint Declaration. Even if the matter is not in order can the Taoiseach, at least, give an assurance that a major and vigorous investigation as to who might be responsible for the second leaking of a document of major national importance will be carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have ruled on the matter.  Does the Taoiseach wish to intervene?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Ahern that any leaking of documents involving important discussions like this is damaging not just to any one national interest but damaging to the entire process towards peace and reconciliation on this island and the interest in that extends far beyond the boundaries of this island.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="856" /> The Government is working on a balanced Framework Document.  Given that it is intended to be a balanced document, any selective leaking of certain parts of it is inherently wrong and misleading, because other phrases that might balance the one that are released are not released and, therefore, the impression created is an unbalanced one.  I assure the House, and everybody concerned that this Government's objective &mdash; this was true of the previous Government &mdash; is to achieve a balanced framework document that is fair to everybody.</P>
    <P>This document is a framework for agreement between all the parties concerned. It is not our intention to impose it without ample opportunities for agreement between the parties concerned. Ultimately there will be provision for the people to have their say in a referendum.  I will insist that everything be done to trace the source of this leak, wherever it is.  I have no evidence to suggest the leak came from any particular quarter &mdash; I certainly have no evidence to suggest it came from an Irish quarter.  To the extent that it is possible for me to trace the source of the leak, I will insist that it be done.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to dissuade Members of the notion that we can debate this matter now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not debate it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly we cannot do so.  I will hear a brief question from the two Deputies who have offered and I will then proceed to other business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Taoiseach's remarks.  The journalist concerned claimed this morning that the &ldquo;ultimate source&rdquo; of the leak is Dublin and it is for that reason I ask the Taoiseach to carry out a vigorous investigation into its source.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Government of my full support in trying to <Col N="857" /> agree a balanced framework document. Will the Taoiseach agree there is a pattern in these leaks in that the leak last year and this leak were designed to upset one particular side and the information is not given by anybody who wants to develop the peace process?</P>
      <P>I agree with the Taoiseach that the greatest assurance that can be given to the communities in Northern Ireland that nothing will be imposed, is that there will be a referendum so that they ultimately will decide on the matter. The vacuum that has existed in recent weeks &mdash; for some time we have been told the document is almost ready &mdash; cannot be helpful in present circumstances. I know the Government is very committed to a balanced framework document and I urge the Taoiseach to ensure that we have that document as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Ahern and Deputy Harney for the way they have approached this subject this morning.  I agree with Deputy Harney that this leak is plainly designed to upset one particular side and that is why it should be treated with scepticism.  It is an attempt at news management for a purpose that is difficult to define.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Ahern who referred to a quotation from a journalist that the &ldquo;ultimate source&rdquo; is Dublin, the phrase &ldquo;ultimate source&rdquo; has all the marks of weasel-wording.  It is not a specific statement that the source is actually Dublin.  The phrase could mean almost anything; it could mean that the document was drafted in Dublin, passed to somebody else and leaked by them. It may not necessarily mean that any of the process of the leak occurred here.  I warn everybody to analyse words used in this context for their true and full meaning and to particularly pay attention to adjectives such as &ldquo;ultimate&rdquo; which are designed to conceal rather than reveal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the matter I tried to raise under Standing Order 30, the widespread flooding with loss of property and livestock and the consequent hardship that is causing, when does the Taoiseach expect the legislation to amend the Arterial Drainage Act will be brought before the Dáil? The Bill was in the final stages of preparation before the previous Government fell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That legislation has not been promised by this Government. The work done on that subject is under active review by the Government and we will be in a position to make our <Col N="859" /> intentions on that legislation known at an early stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should not lead to argument.  As I said earlier, there are many ways of raising this matter and the Chair will facilitate Members in doing so.  There was reference to flooding on the Adjournment debates of last evening.  The Minister for the Environment will deal with questions on this subject tomorrow and there are still ways open to Deputies to raise the matter.</P>

      <P>The question specifically relates to arterial drainage and amendment of that legislation.  I put down a question to the Minister for the Environment on this matter but it was ruled out of order.  I am asking the Taoiseach for a straight answer.  Will the Government bring forward legislation <Col N="860" /> in view of the serious hardship being caused by flooding?  The previous Government recognised the problem, which has got even worse since then. May we have a straight answer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>

We want a clear, straight answer to whether the Government will bring in the promised legislation on arterial drainage, or is the Taoiseach's indifference the reason 12 counties are not represented in the Cabinet or the Second Front Bench?

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 5, lines 8 to 10, to delete &ldquo;MARRIAGES ARE ANNULLED, OR AS RESPECTS WHICH THE SPOUSES BECOME JUDICIALLY SEPARATED,&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;SPOUSES BECOME JUDICIALLY SEPARATED&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the scope of the Family Law Bill is very wide.  The Bill deals with the courts' jurisdiction in cases of nullity, strengthens the law on maintenance of spouses and children and repeals and re-enacts with more comprehensive provisions the courts' powers to order support of spouses and children following a judicial separation by, among other matters, giving the courts power to make orders in relation to occupational pensions.  It empowers the courts to make declarations of status, that is to say declarations on the validity of a person's marriage and on the recognition by the State of foreign decrees of divorce.  It allows the courts to make financial and property orders consequent on the grant of decrees of <Col N="866" /> nullity.  It raises the minimum age of marriage from 16 to 18 years, provides for a notice of intention to marry and puts the reporting role of the probation and welfare service and health boards in a range of family law cases on a statutory basis.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 82 to 85 will extend the scope of the Bill even further.  If accepted, these amendments will result in comprehensive provisions in the Bill to deal with tax aspects of marital breakdown, namely capital gains tax, capital acquisitions tax, probate tax and stamp duty.</P>
    <P>It was represented to me in the House and by some interest groups that, while the provisions giving the courts power in cases of nullity to make financial and property orders, including orders to enable provision to be made out of the estate of the parties to an annulment, are welcome and overdue, there is the possibility that those powers could be open to challenge on the basis of constitutionality. In regard to those powers Deputies who are members of the select committee will recall that a number of amendments were made at the select committee to strengthen the provisions further.  Those amendments were framed in a way which would require the courts to take into account the interests of all parties concerned, including the rights of parties to a marriage which is contracted after the annulment of the marriage of either of those parties.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies questioned in particular the validity of rights given to parties to an annulled marriage in cases where the marriage is void and where there never was a marriage in the eyes of the law.  Concerns were expressed only in relation to the rights of the &ldquo;spouses&rdquo; in question.  I use the word &ldquo;spouse&rdquo; even though they are not technically spouses. The same concern did not arise in the case of children because the law already gives those children the right to be maintained in the same way as children of a valid marriage.  I emphasise that the provisions in the Bill on nullity were based largely on those contained in a <Col N="867" /> paper prepared by the Attorney General in 1976 which took account of the laws in other jurisdictions and they were contained in the 1992 White Paper on marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>As a matter of policy, I am satisfied that the parties to a marriage which is annulled should be in a position to apply to the courts for maintenance and other orders in support of their welfare, including orders in relation to the home in which they may have resided together for a considerable time.  I am now of the view, however, that it would be better to provide for those matters, perhaps in a modified form, in separate legislation. To proceed in that way would also avoid delay in implementation of the wide-ranging measures elsewhere in the Bill.</P>
    <P>To allow for deletion of the nullity provisions it has been necessary to provide for a total of 50 amendments: amendments Nos. 1, 2, 4-17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26-29, 32-35, 37-39, 41, 42, 44, 50-61, 63, 64, 68 and 69.  They are being taken together.  In the circumstances I described I am confident of the support of the House for the approach I am taking.</P>
    <P>While the Bill retains the substantial provisions for support of spouses in the context of a judicial separation and in the case of foreign divorces I would not now, on the basis of the amendments proposed, also extend those powers to nullity.  The aim was to have all those provisions consolidated in one Bill.  In time that may be possible but Deputies will agree that the better course at this stage is to progress this important Bill without the nullity provisions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is proposing to make approximately 75 amendments to the Bill.  This represents substantial change at this late stage.  We have agreed to recommital on the grounds that it appears to be necessary.  When it was recommended to the Government and initiated in the House the Bill was put forward by the Minister as the cornerstone or foundation of the preparatory work before asking the people in a <Col N="868" /> referendum to amend the Constitution to enable the introduction of divorce legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister acknowledged that before the question was put to the people once more the issues of property, pensions and maintenance which caused so much concern in the last referendum should be dealt with comprehensively and that clear and unambiguous laws should be put in place well in advance of holding a divorce referendum. The Minister recognised that this was a necessary precursor.</P>
      <P>We all remember of the unhappy history of the matrimonial home Bill which was expected to give women a secure share in the family home.  Notwithstanding the fact that a year has now elapsed since the Supreme Court struck down that Bill the Minister has failed to bring forward new legislation to deal with that vital issue and it appears he has no proposals to address it.  In the context of that disturbing failure, what amounts to the decimation of this Bill with the removal of 75 parts is particularly depressing.  Above all, there is a need for great clarity and simplicity and a direct and open approach if we are to avoid confusion in the lead up to the divorce referendum and meet the legitimate concerns of citizens in this area.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the issue of nullity will be dealt with in separate legislation but did not say when it will be introduced.  Will he indicate when it will be published?  It is important that this legislation should be referred in its entirety to the select committee or else it should be so clear that it can be dealt with by Members in a helpful way so far as the referendum is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Family Law Bill was supposed to address all the other financial problems associated with marital breakdown such as maintenance, property and pension adjustments and succession rights.  The clear strategy of the Bill as initiated was to put in place appropriate reliefs and to cater for judicial separation and nullity so that in the event of divorce being approved by the people in a referendum <Col N="869" /> those reliefs could be extended to divorce. Whether a person sought a judicial separation or a decree of nullity their position would be recognised by the State and their rights and entitlements would be preserved under this major Bill.  It is important to remember that the essential feature of this stepping stone approach was the extension of the reliefs already available in cases involving legal separation under the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, to nullity.</P>
    <P>This Bill has now been decimated and it is unprecedented to make such major changes on Report Stage.  That is an understatement in light of the amendments proposed at this extraordinarily late stage by the Minister under the guise of technical amendments but when one analyses them one finds that they strike out almost all references to nullity and the extension of reliefs to nullity.  For whatever reason &mdash; I hope he will offer a good explanation &mdash; the Minister is now in the extraordinary position of being unable or unwilling to extend these reliefs to nullity as intended in the Bill as initiated and when passed by the Select Committee on Legislation and Security which dealt with the Bill on Wednesday, 18 May 1994.  At column 651 of the Official Report of that date the Minister said:</P>
    <P>The nullity issue must be addressed by the Oireachtas.  The Law Reform Commission recommended measures in this regard as far back as 1984 and it is time the matter was addressed. This Bill covers a range of areas in family law and the measures dealing with nullity are incorporated in it.</P>
    <P>All aspects of the matter, including the constitutional question, were examined with great care by the Attorney General who took the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Matrimonial Home Bill into account. This is the advice I have received and I accept it.</P>
    <P>He went on to insist that the Bill would proceed as it was on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="870" /> I will not delay the House by going into the other questions raised but many were not answered in committee. Indeed, the Minister seemed to be certain about the line he was taking and about the constitutionality of the Bill. Now on Report Stage he has changed tack entirely and has said he recognises the possibility of constitutional challenge.</P>
    <P>When I considered the various measures in the Bill it seemed a little strange that the provisions should be the same for judicial separation as they were for nullity.  As a lay person I found that difficult to understand, although I could see that some aspects would be quite similar.  Nevertheless, I questioned that immediately on reading the Bill in the past week, since I have only recently become directly involved.</P>
    <P>Obviously there has been a major change in the Bill.  There is an onus on the Minister to explain at greater length the reasons for the change, because in terms of the passage of legislation here, it is quite an extraordinary development to have such a major change on Report Stage.  As I said, I will go along with the Minister in making the change.  My initial feeling was that there was a need for a change but the extent of it and the major impact it has on the Bill is disturbing.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give an assurance that the original stepping stone approach to a divorce referendum is intact and if, for whatever reason, he cannot deliver on this strategy, he will tell us in an open and direct way.  If such measures are not to be taken in this Bill, the Minister must move immediately to introduce separate legislation dealing with these issues.  In that way they will be clarified and dealt with well in advance of the holding of a referendum.</P>
    <P>I appreciate there is a great deal of pressure on the Minister, and his Department, with the variety of legislation with which they are dealing but it is particularly important that these issues be tackled before the Government moves forward with the divorce referendum.  This can be done without <Col N="871" /> much delay but I accept it places additional pressures on the Minister and his Department.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been altered considerably since it went through Committee Stage.  There has been, of course, the addition of a number of tax provisions which will be of value.  When one closely examines these tax provisions it becomes apparent that they will have little impact on the vast majority of people involved in marital breakdowns. Indeed, the apparent anomalies in these provisions are clear evidence that they have been strung together hastily in order to save the Minister from acute embarrassment over the extent of the changes which must take place.  The tax provisions do not comprehensively address the tax implications of marital breakdown.  This is an issue about which people are very concerned and one that frequently arises.  I am glad the Minister is, in a general sense, tackling the issue of the tax implications but when one examines these provisions, it will be obvious they will not make much difference to the vast majority of people in addressing the tax implications of marital breakdown in the context of judicial separation, nullity or divorce.</P>
    <P>The Minister must get it right on these important issues.  Whatever the reason that has driven him to dismember the Bill, he should face up to the situation now rather than proceed with an inadequate measures.  It would be better for all concerned if the Minister reconsidered his position with regard to the Bill.  If he is prepared to give an assurance that he will introduce separate legislation to deal with these issues in relation to nullity, I will accept that as a reasonable approach on his part in the difficult situation in which he finds himself.  A new Bill will, I hope, address the issues which must be tackled and which this Bill was originally intended to address.  The many proposed amendments will leave those who seek a decree of nullity out in the cold.  Does the Minister intend to provide for them in any other way?  It is essential that <Col N="872" /> there is a well thought out scheme of reliefs for people who have attained a decree of nullity.</P>
    <P>This is a delicate and difficult subject because one can, through legislation, create a situation whereby people will see no value in seeking a decree of nullity in that all the reliefs would relate to judicial separation or to divorce.  In effect, we could be disadvantaging those who might, in accordance with their own consciences, be interested in seeking a decree of nullity.  It is most important, therefore, that we get these measures on to the Statute Book as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>In the case of voidable marriages it is not uncommon that couples may live together for many years and take on the usual variety of financial commitments and assets, the house, property and commitments to dependants.  At present there are no statutory reliefs for them. As far back as 1976 it was recommended to the then Attorney General that statutory reliefs be provided in this area.  In 1984, the Law Reform Commission in its report on nullity stressed the need for similar statutory reliefs.</P>
    <P>Report Stage is a difficult one for discussion. Members can only speak once and that is a limitation as Members do not have the opportunity to questions the Minister on proposed measures.  That is one of the reasons why it would have been preferable to recommit this Bill to the select committee and continue the debate which was taking place there.  In fairness that committee raised that issue, identified the possibility which is now accepted and recognised by the Minister and expressed concern about it.  However, the committee was prepared to go along with the steps taken by the Minister at that stage.  I assume this measure is not being used as a device by the Minister.  I assume also that he is facing a genuine difficulty and that the quickest way to get himself out of that dilemma is to remove the 75 Parts &mdash; that is why I used the word &ldquo;dismember&rdquo;&mdash; from the Bill agreed in select committee.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> We on the Opposition side of the House do not get a comprehensive opportunity to discuss or question the changes because one may only speak once on an amendment on Report Stage.  One could insist on speaking on every amendment but I do not want to do that.  I realise the Minister has found himself in this situation and that this is probably the quickest way of dealing with it, but it is not the best way to handle a Bill.  The Minister was right in the first instance &mdash; it would have been preferable to include the issue of nullity in this Bill and have a more comprehensive Family Law Bill.  I would like the Minister's assurance that he intends to bring in further legislation as a matter of urgency.  Otherwise we will be dismembering this major piece of family law without catering for those who look to us to provide remedies and reliefs in the areas of judicial separation, foreign divorce and nullity.  I trust the Minister will deal with the issues I have raised. We will certainly facilitate him in processing the Bill through the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure we will get it right eventually.  The Second Stage was debated on 24 February 1994, almost a year ago, which shows how tortuous and difficult it has been.  I will not rehash the Second Stage debate but it was anticipated then that there would be difficulties, and I was one of those who adverted to the problem of nullity at that time.  I realise the Minister does examine points that are made and, if not immediately, eventually may take them on board and, in this case, has had to change the Bill. I remarked that the Bill mentioned nullity and separation in the same breath when the courts had been at pains to <Col N="874" /> keep them apart, and that the Bill repeals the provisions of the 1989 Act, re-enacts it and includes nullity.  From that point of view I support the Minister's amendments.  It seems that the Bill was not properly thought through at the time.</P>
      <P>My view of the Bill came about from talking to practitioners and people who are involved.  A point that was made at the time was that we were moving from a stage where there were relatively few annulments to a stage where an annulment is regarded as divorce, Irish style, and the next step is divorce.  The Minister's view was that the Circuit Court should hear cases.  My fear at the time was that there would be an enormous increase in the number of cases which would flood a court which was already overburdened.  Now we will have to have yet more legislation.</P>
      <P>The Minister's portfolio is full of proposed legislation and the trouble is that when we want legislation, particularly in the field of family law, we want it now and, as we have seen, that is virtually impossible because it is such a minefield. Now, because of the amendments the Minister has brought forward, we have to have new legislation.  I wonder when we will have this and what will be the implications, if any, for the divorce referendum.  What are the Minister's views on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is making other amendments to the Bill which I will deal with when we come to them.  However, I would make the general point that it is particularly difficult when one is on the Opposition benches to deal with Bills into which enormous new tracts have been inserted.  I am no tax expert, and I believe the tax proposals will improve the situation, but during the Committee Stage debate on pensions, etc., many of us were out of our depth because we were faced with amendments at short notice.  This is not the best way to discuss legislation.  We should not have gone as far as Committee Stage with these provisions.  On Report Stage one should be, so to speak, fine-tuning the legislation, not changing it completely.  I <Col N="875" /> am quite unhappy that we should at this stage be addressing amendments that considerably change the nature of the Bill, although I am glad the question is being addressed.  Had this been dealt with on Committee Stage what we are doing today would be unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I have no grounds whatsoever for objecting to the amendments but, on the wider question of how legislation is presented, we should not have to agree to amendments on Report Stage that could have been taken on board at an earlier stage.  The contributions on Second Stage pointed to difficulties that might arise.  I am, therefore, disappointed that we had to wait until Report Stage to address them.</P>

      <P>I agree with some of what Deputy Keogh has said.  I was amazed that at this late stage the Minister was forced to withdraw a substantial portion of the Bill because of advice he had received as to its unconstitutionality.</P>

I will not dwell on the issue of personalities but it surprises me that the Attorney General's office did not see the constitutional difficulties which have emerged at this very late stage.  I accept fully that following this advice the Minister has no option but to withdraw the amendments. We are all aware of the fate of the Family Home Bill which was struck down by the Supreme Court.  I do not know if there are proposals to replace it but I presume the Minister will address that issue when he replies.  If this Bill, however, were to suffer a similar fate it would be absolutely catastrophic from the point of view of the divorce referendum. The Minister will be aware that <Col N="876" /> the main problem with the previous referendum on divorce was uncertainty but this legislation is designed to deal with that and provide answers to questions. Will the Minister assure us that he has now received very clear advice that the Bill as amended, meets the requirements of the Constitution and that as far as the Attorney General's office is aware there will be no further difficulties with it?</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister will bring in separate legislation on nullity and presumably it will stand apart from the provisions of this legislation.  I ask the Minister for an assurance that this Bill is constitutionally sound because I would not like to see further slip-ups in this regard.</P>

      <P>There appears to be 79 amendments.  Perhaps the Minister knows how many there are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a large number of amendments but I think Deputy Woods is gilding the lily because the overwhelming bulk of amendments are directed at a specific objective, which is taking the nullity provisions out of this Bill.  It is not quite as overwhelming or such a decimation of the Bill as he described it.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to cover consequential orders and the situations of domestic judicial separations, foreign judicial separations, foreign divorces and nullity.  It is the nullity aspect that is now being deleted from the Bill and I can assure Deputy O'Dea that I have been advised that the Bill is fully and entirely constitutional and that there is no possibility of any successful challenge to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position on nullity was raised by a number of Deputies on Committee Stage and perhaps earlier.  As Deputy Keogh has said, I always keep and open mind on these things and when questions are thrown into the arena it is my responsibility to consider them seriously.  I put the matter no higher than that, with the inclusion of nullity provisions, there would be a possibility <Col N="877" /> of challenge on a constitutional basis. My feeling was &mdash; and I am grateful for the support of the Deputies opposite in this regard &mdash; that even that element of risk was too high to take and I did not want to have even the possibility of a challenge to this Bill left open.  I sympathise with people in void or voidable marriage situations.  There are cases of hardship and that branch of the law has been neglected for a very long time. Having thought about the matter very carefully and taken into account the contributions of Deputies from all sides of the House on Committee Stage, I concluded that the prudent thing to do was to delete the nullity provisions from this Bill.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening statement, I certainly intend to examine all aspects of nullity, which, as far as I recall, has never been touched.  It needs careful examination in regard to the aspects of it dealing with consequential orders, property and so on.  Also the grounds for nullity are antiquated and based on Church laws going back to the 18th century. The question of nullity, including the grounds for nullity and the consequential orders following on a decree of nullity, is a very complex area and I think it would be a major contribution if I was enabled and had the opportunity during the remaining term of this Dáil to bring in legislation in this area.  It is my intention to conduct an examination and should it be possible nobody will be more pleased than I, but I am not in a position to give a commitment on the timescale.  As the Deputies opposite know, and to which they kindly referred, we have a very heavy schedule of work ahead of us.  The question of nullity will be very much to the forefront of my mind and I would very much like to introduce legislation to cover all aspects of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister intend to do that before the referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is quite disconnected from the referendum.  Nullity is disconnected from divorce.  In cases of <Col N="878" /> nullity we are talking about a situation where there never was a marriage so the question of divorce simply does not arise in that context.  It stands apart and has no bearing on the divorce referendum. In divorce we are talking about dissolution of marriages but that does not arise in the context of nullity.  I can assure the Deputies opposite that the stepping stones, as Deputy Woods puts it, are still intact and are not in the slightest degree affected by the deletion of the nullity provisions from this Bill. If they were essential that would have been a different matter altogether.  The key factors in the Bill so far as the blueprint for divorce is concerned are the provisions dealing with foreign divorce, and in the event of the people giving an affirmative decision in the referendum, then that blueprint applicable in the Bill to foreign divorces would be re-enacted to apply to domestic divorces.</P>
      <P>I thank the Deputies opposite for their understanding of the position, which is somewhat unusual but this is unusual legislation.  As Deputy Keogh rightly pointed out, it is difficult and complex enough.  The reason that our parliamentary system involves so many stages of a Bill &mdash; five stages in the Dáil and five stages in the Seanad &mdash; is to ensure that all these matters are considered very carefully and at length. With no fewer than ten stages provided in all between the two Houses, which are being used to the full and to the benefit of our democratic system, this legislation has been produced with the assistance of the skills and knowledge of Members' from all sides of the House who have made contributions which as I have said, I very much welcome and which, as Deputy Keogh has said, I have taken on board.</P>

      <P>I think the Minister is making a mistake by not tackling separately the question of nullity.  I ask him to think again about that before the referendum is held.  The very reason it was included in the Bill in the first instance was to ensure that measures would be adopted on nullity at the same time as <Col N="879" /> the other areas.  I know some people have fewer concerns about nullity than others but I ask the Minister to think again about it.  We will not, however, oppose the amendments at this stage.</P>

I accepted the principle of the amendment but had certain reservations regarding its precise wording.  I undertook to examine the wording between Committee and Report Stages.

      <P>&ldquo;(5) Spouses may agree to settle matters in relation to property adjustment by Deed of Separation which will constitute a full and final settlement of all such issues between them.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was not prepared to take this amendment on board on Committee Stage.  One case I know of prompted me to put down the amendment.  Many people want a clean break settlement particularly where children are not involved.  It copperfastens the idea that the agreement reached is final.  It is over and done with and there will be no revisiting of it.  People fear that an agreement may be revisited, in other <Col N="884" /> words, that the agreement arrived at is not the final settlement.  The purpose in putting down the amendment is to copperfasten a clean break where people want to put the past behind them and do not want to revisit it again.</P>
    <P>The Minister said spouses already have this right.  Even though they have the right in relation to agreement, they have the right to revisit that agreement. I ask him to re-examine the amendment and see if he can take it on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment purports to give spouses who separate the right to agree on a distribution of property between them.  As spouses already have this right there is no need for the amendment.  I must oppose it.  It does not add anything to the existing position. It is open to parties to enter into separation agreements distributing property and dealing with other rights and many of them do.  There is provision for such agreements to be made rules of the court by a simple <i>ex parte</i> procedure. That has the effect of translating the terms of the agreement into a court order.  There is no need for the amendment as people do that all the time.  If the amendment were put into the Bill it would cause confusion.  The position is quite clear and is availed of by thousands of people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that this amendment, tabled by Deputy Keogh, would render it final and absolute, constituting a full and final settlement of all such issues between the spouses.  Quite often such an arrangement could operate to the disadvantage of one spouse, quite possibly the woman.  While the amendment relates to property only I am somewhat concerned that the wife could be driven into a bad bargain.  I <Col N="885" /> accept that Deputy Keogh is endeavouring to have finality, an attractive proposition in many ways, but I have reservations about it.  In present circumstances the essential difference is that one can revert to seeking a variation whereas what is sought in this amendment is a deed of separation constituting a full and final settlement of all such issues between the spouses.  While it sounds a very clean arrangement, I am concerned that in practice it might transpire differently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am endeavouring to understand the implications of this amendment.  If a deed of separation is drawn up can parties go back only by agreement to have a property adjustment provision varied or does it have to be made by an order of court?  Is there a difference between drawing up a deed of separation, signed by both parties, and drawing up a deed of separation and getting a court to sanction that reversal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand the position, if the agreement is drawn up and nothing further is done with it, that is deemed to be a binding contract between the parties each party being answerable for the responsibilities in it. On the other hand, if in the procedure to make that separation agreement, a rule of court is taken &mdash; which procedure is laid down in section 8 of the Family Law Act, 1976 &mdash; my understanding is that gives the status of what is agreed in that separation agreement the status of an order of the court. Therefore, one is not talking about a contractual arrangement between the two parties to it, <i>per se</i>, one is talking <Col N="886" /> about an order of the court; it is as though it went to a judicial hearing and these various orders were made by the court.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is always provision for variation; one can always go back.  If new circumstances arise, one can always revert to the court under an existing separation agreement, even under orders made on a judicial separation.  I am advised I am correct in that one can go back to the court later because new circumstances arose.  For example, circumstances might arise in which a couple might have been in poor circumstances at the time of separation and a very low maintenance provision might have been made for the wife.  It transpires later that, say, the husband wins the lotto, when it would be unfair to say: Ah, well, the order was made on the old basis, a further application cannot be made&rdquo;.  It is only reasonable that that option should be available as and when new circumstances arise.</P>

      <P>Yes, but the provisions of this amendment would not affect maintenance, people could revert to the court anyway for maintenance.  I thought this had to do with the division of property only.  Therefore, if a separation agreement is made an order of court and a variation sought at some time in the future, can one or other party seek to vary it or does the application for variation have to be written by prior agreement; can both parties go together, or can one party go?</P>

      <P>I perfectly understand the point the Minister made, with most of which I am content, but I am thinking about the occasional circumstance only which relates solely to property, as is stated in the amendment, the objective being that there be a final settlement between the parties.  We must remember that some people want to put the past completely behind them and, in such circumstances, it would be preferable that a full and final settlement be agreed.

      <P>I tabled this amendment in an attempt to secure recognition of the work of the spouse within the home.  The last time I moved this amendment I was unsuccessful in having it accepted.  However, now that there has been a change of Government and some members of the former Opposition supported this amendment, I am hopeful that it will be accepted and that at long last the work of the spouse in the home will be given the recognition it deserves.  The Minister has heard me speak on this matter four times so he is aware of what I will say.  I have found it difficult to get legislation in this area passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods referred to the legislation dealing with the matrimonial home and how disappointed we all were when the Supreme Court faulted the Bill despite a great deal of work undertaken by Members on all sides of the House to ensure that it would be passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  An opportunity arises here to enshrine this <Col N="891" /> clause in the legislation.  The Minister has not given any indication as to whether he intends in the near future to revisit the whole area of joint ownership of the family home.  Having failed in Private Members' time to introduce a Bill to deal with this matter and at other times, I am attempting once again to insert a clause in the legislation that will recognise the work of the spouse within the home.  The law provides that where the matrimonial home has been purchased in the name of the husband and the wife has either directly or indirectly made contributions towards the purchase price or towards the discharge of mortgage instalments, the husband will be held to be a trustee for the wife of a share in the house roughly corresponding with the proportion of the purchase money represented by the wife's total contribution.  Such a trust will be inferred when the wife's contribution is of such a kind and size as will justify conclusion that the acquisition of the house was achieved by the joint efforts of the spouses.  Where the wife's contribution has been indirect, such as contributing by means of her earnings to a general family fund, the courts will, in the absence of any expressed or implied agreement to the contrary, infer a trust in favour of the wife on the grounds that she has to that extent relieved the husband of the financial burden he incurred in purchasing the house.  That summary of the legal position was given by Mr. Justice Henchy in 1986.  The Supreme Court ruled that anything that would help to encourage the basis of full sharing in property values as well as in every other way between the partners of a marriage must directly contribute to the stability of the marriage, the institution of the family and the common good.  We are all agreed on this and there should not be any difficulty about it.  I have framed an amendment that will give due recognition to the work of the spouse within the home.  As the Acting Chairman said, the two amendments are related and amendment No. 70 which I framed gives a more detailed analysis <Col N="892" /> and appreciation of the difficulties in this area than amendment No. 40.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he is committed to dealing with the joint ownership of the family home and I believe acceptance of this amendment would go some way towards recognising the contributions made by the non working spouse within the home.  It would put a value on the work within the home and having regard to social circumstances, it would value the work of women because mainly women work within the home. Regarding the area of family law, women who work within the home to some extent feel threatened because their rights to joint ownership of the family home are not provided for in legislation.  I look forward to support on this amendment.  I did not accept what the Minister said about it on Committee Stage and I hope he will not repeat the argument he used then.  What I have said is not open to rebuttal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take amendment No. 70 first.  This amendment proposes to enable a spouse who has made a non-financial contribution to the household to go to court with a view to establishing an ownership interest in the matrimonial property in proportion to that contribution, up to a maximum of 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>I appreciate that the Deputy is seeking to give some legislative recognition to the contribution to the family made by a spouse by working in the home and caring for the family.  We are all conscious of the value of that contribution. It has already been given such recognition in Part II of the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act, 1989, which is being repealed and updated by this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These provisions deal with situations where proceedings for judicial separation have begun and where the matrimonial property may have to be divided between the couple concerned.  In those cases it is essential that the decision of the court should take fully into account any non-financial, as well as financial, contributions made by each of the <Col N="893" /> spouses and particularly the contribution made by a spouse in looking after the home.</P>
    <P>This amendment is dealing with spouses who are not separating or proposing to separate.  It provides that, if one of those spouses wishes to assert an ownership right in the matrimonial property based on non-financial contributions and the other spouse disagrees, the dispute can be settled, and can only be settled, by the court.  This litigation would involve substantial expense and, irrespective of the outcome, it would adversely affect the marriage relationship.</P>
    <P>It is true that under the present law financial contributions by a spouse towards the acquisition of matrimonial property can give rise to a proportionate ownership interest which can be determined by the courts in default of agreement, but there is a world of difference between establishing the extent of financial contributions, which are ascertainable and difficult to dispute, and that of non-financial contributions made by either spouse from the date of the marriage up to commencement of the litigation.  This uncertainty would increase the likelihood of disputes and consequent recourse to the courts and it would also increase the costs of the litigation, which would normally have to be borne by the defendant spouse, irrespective of the outcome.  It might also be open to a spouse who had successfully established a share in a matrimonial property of less than 50 per cent to return to the courts more than once to get credit for work carried out in the home in the meantime and eventually build up his or her share to the 50 per cent limit.  In contrast, the determination of non-financial contributions on the occasion of a separation is a once-off evaluation of those contributions made during the period when the couple were living together.</P>
    <P>Moreover, I would not accept, as has been suggested, that such a provision would help spouses to get their partners to convey to them formally a share in the family home or other matrimonial <Col N="894" /> property, on the basis that otherwise proceedings would be taken against them.  Indeed I believe that such an implied threat of litigation could have the opposite effect.</P>
    <P>What is wanted most by spouses who work in the home and who do not want to engage in litigation with their partners is some practical recognition of their contribution.  The real deterrent is the formality and costs associated with putting the family home into joint names.  I am giving consideration to whether legislation would facilitate more simplified and less costly arrangements. Such provision might enable couples who live in harmony to give full and effective recognition to the contribution made by the spouse who works in the home.</P>
    <P>I regret I cannot regard the Deputy's amendment as other than a minimalist approach to the problem we are all anxious to solve, that is, to establish joint ownership of the family home as the norm.  By encouraging litigation between spouses it could do more harm than good.</P>
    <P>The Deputy's related amendment &mdash; No. 40 &mdash; to paragraph (f) of section 16 (2) proposes that there should be a rebuttable presumption that a spouse's work in the home should give rise to a joint interest in the home unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary.</P>
    <P>I understand the Deputy's motivation in putting down this amendment but we are dealing with the matters to which the court must pay particular regard when making an order under various sections of the Bill.  These orders could include maintenance orders or, say, pension adjustment orders where the grant of a property adjustment order, giving a spouse an interest, or an enlarged interest, in the family home, might not be the best or most appropriate option for the parties.</P>
    <P>In those circumstances obliging the court to give an ownership interest in the home to one of the spouses might be contrary to that spouse's best interests.  I appreciate that the presumption is <Col N="895" /> expressed to be subject to there being compelling reasons for not granting a joint interest in the home but it would be much better to leave the fullest discretion to the court to do justice in the circumstances of each particular case, once it has had particular regard, as the section requires, to any past or future contributions made by each of the spouses to the welfare of the family.</P>
    <P>I regret that for these reasons I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's difficulties which have existed for some time, particularly since the Supreme Court overruled an aspect of the former family home Bill.  However, I support the spirit of this amendment which proposes that there should be a rebuttable presumption that the work of the spouse within the home should, unless there are compelling reasons to the contrary, give rise to a joint interest in the family home.  I believe most Members would share my concern that the contribution of a spouse who works full-time or to a large extent in the home should be recognised.  I am sure most Members want that problem solved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not sufficient for the Minister to say we will allow the courts to decide. That has happened far too often and, in many cases, is disadvantageous to women because more than 90 per cent of cases affect the female spouse.  It is time we addressed this issue and found a solution which will not be overruled by the Supreme Court.  Deputy Keogh put forward a reasonable proposal to meet this difficulty but, as is the case with all amendments from the Opposition, the Minister stated that there are technical difficulties which need to be resolved.  The Minister and his staff should provide such advice.  There has been a great deal of talk recently about openness, accountability and transparency. Part of that openness should include the availability of drafting <Col N="896" /> advice to Members of the Opposition when they table amendments such as that by Deputy Keogh.  In other parliaments such drafting advice is available not only to departmental officials but to members of the parliament.  That is real openness and transparency, effeciency and professionalism.  The Minister, in effect, said that the idea behind the amendment is worthwhile, but would require a great deal of thought, drafting and so on.</P>
    <P>I am sure the essence of this amendment would have a great deal of support here.  In a physical sense, the woman working in the home contributes towards its maintenance.  The house would not be as well maintained if she was not working in it.  She also contributes greatly to the stability of the home and the family.  Women working outside the home are seeking the option to spend more time at home through social welfare and labour legislation.  They want to spend more time working in the home as well as participating in the workforce.  This matter was mentioned yesterday in the context of the adoptive and parental leave legislation.  People should have an option in that regard.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Keogh's amendment. We are anxious to have the matter of joint interest in the family home resolved.  The Minister said he wants to simplify the legal aspects involved in both spouses sharing an interest in the family home.  Much work needs to be done in that area.  The majority of young people provide for this when buying their homes, but many people would welcome the simplification of the technicalities and legalities involved.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal to simplify the matter, but I also support the objective in Deputy Keogh's amendment. It is another example of where the legislation needs to be addressed urgently and should not be left for the courts to decide.  Most people want the position of the spouse in the home protected in legislation.</P>

      <P>My colleague, Deputy Woods, mentioned openness and transparency. The only transparency I see here is the transparency of the excuses offered by Ministers not to do what they promised in Opposition.  This is a worthwhile amendment and I support it.  The Supreme Court decided that the family home Bill was unconstitutional because it was designed to confer a definite interest on the non-owning spouse.  This amendment does not do that.  It simply creates a presumption and a rebuttable one at that.  As there is no definite transfer of an interest to the other spouse this amendment is constitutional.  If I understood the Minister's argument correctly he said it would encourage litigation between husband and wife.  That is not real.  If this amendment is accepted every non-earning spouse will not rush to the courts to have the presumption accepted by the courts.  If people want to litigate they can, but the reality is that people will only litigate when there is trouble.</P>
      <P>There are a few possibilities.  If this amendment is accepted and if there is litigation in a break-up the courts can consider that presumption and can decide the presumption is discharged if there are no compelling reasons to the contrary.  If the parties wish to settle their differences by way of agreement, without litigation, that this presumption will exist in law will be a powerful bargaining counter for the more vulnerable party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the Supreme Court decision the family home Bill created a sense of security in many spouses throughout the country.  The Minister, as a former practising solicitor, will know that often lawyers were approached by spouses, almost invariably the wife on her interest in the family home and it was almost impossible to advise her.  The law &mdash; Deputy Keogh mentioned a 1986 case &mdash; on non-financial contributions is evolving and is not settled yet.  I envisage that in the future the courts will take a more liberal non-earning spouse oriented approach.  We may reach a <Col N="898" /> stage when this amendment will become law.</P>
    <P>The family home Bill created a great sense of security.  It was possible to assure every spouse who had forebodings for the future and who felt there might be difficulties down the road that she would definitely have a half share in the family home but that Bill was found to be unconstitutional.  This amendment is a good substitute and I compliment Deputy Keogh on tabling it.  I would like to be able to say to spouses who foresee trouble that there is now a law providing for a presumption that if they did not neglect their duties in the family home, were not racegoers, gamblers or were drinking every night, the courts will almost certainly find that the spouse has a half share.  This amendment is a very good substitute for the family home Bill; a Bill, to which the Minister was committed, and in which I was tangentially involved.  It had created a great sense of security for spouses.  It gave me great satisfaction to advise women who came to me that I did not have to explain High Court decisions that might be taken into account.  I did not have to ask whether the spouse made a direct or indirect financial contribution and so on.  This amendment will send out the message that, despite the Supreme Court decision on the family home Bill, we are anxious to assist non-earning spouses.  Where people are trying to settle their differences it will be a powerful bargaining counter.  In the event of litigation in the case of break-up it will be a matter for the court to decide.  It will not encourage spouses to rush out immediately and litigate to establish their interest.  They will wait for the presumption to operate if necessary.</P>

      <P>The principle of joint ownership of the family home was supported by Opposition parties.  The legislation had a long and difficult passage through the House and many difficulties were dealt with excluding the one on which the Bill fell.  I am trying, in the most simple way possible, to give recognition to the work of a spouse within the family home.  Security of ownership is a simple ambition of mine but it is deeply felt particularly by women.  If the legislation does not provide for a half share in the family home legislation should provide something that goes a long way towards allaying women's fears and gives them the security so many want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Committee Stage I did not agree with the point made by the Minister &mdash; I realise I said on the Occupiers' Liability Bill that we are a litigious nation &mdash; that there would be litigation on the family home just because there was a <Col N="900" /> presumption of joint interest.  That does not hold water.  Women deserve recognition of their role within the home, the work they do and an acknowledgement of their role in society.  It does not give any credence to the Minister's efforts in family law in general when at every opportunity to enshrine this recognition in legislation he finds fault with the efforts that I and others have made.  He is in a difficult position in the whole area of family law.  He is supposed to be the one who will champion the divorce referendum and I hope divorce legislation will be in place during the course of 1995.  If this issue is solved to the best of our ability and if people recognise this it will, in some small way, make his task a little easier.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the Minister is adopting this attitude to amendment No. 40 but I would understand his objection to my amendment No. 70.  In terms of approaching legislation in a simple and straightforward way and in an effort to include the type of amendment we need I am satisfied &mdash; I never said my abilities as a draftsperson were perfect &mdash; that this is a good amendment and I intend to press it.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 24, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) Parties to an order shall be required to make full financial disclosure to include income and property of the parties.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On Committee Stage there was a degree of confusion about full financial disclosure and the Minister agreed to table an amendment dealing with this issue on Report Stage, which he has done. However, I am surprised at the wording of his amendment.  Everyone agrees with the principle of disclosure and the difficulty on Committee Stage was that the Minister felt that this principle was covered by the rules of court.  He subsequently said he would look again at this issue.</P>
      <P>It is very important that parties be required to make full financial disclosure, including property and other assets. Why has the Minister dealt with this issue in a more qualified way and why are children involved?  There may be disclosure to brothers and sisters.  What is the Minister trying to achieve in his amendment?  I am concerned about his orders for disclosure, which can be a lengthy process.  The principle of the amendment has been accepted and there is no need to debate it.  However, I am somewhat bemused at the Minister's decision not to accept my amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>On Committee Stage, I agreed in response to an amendment tabled by Deputy Keogh, to look again at the inclusion of a provision for the disclosure of information relating to the property and income of parties in proceedings. I accept the principle of the Deputy's amendment but there are drafting and technical reasons as to why my amendment would achieve better <Col N="905" /> the desired result.  It is for that reason only that I oppose her amendment and ask her to support my amendment No. 73.</P>
      <P>I have included in my amendment a responsibility on a dependent member of the family to make disclosure of his or her property which would have a bearing on property distribution positions in a case arising under the Bill.  I want to give an example of why this is necessary.  A wealthy child in a family &mdash; he or she might have inherited a substantial sum of money from a grand-parent &mdash; would have a bearing on the distribution and maintenance position of the family whose case was before the court.  That child might not necessarily be a party to the proceedings.</P>
      <P>The differential is marginal but the important point is that the principle of the amendment has been accepted.  In those circumstances I ask the Deputy to withdraw the amendment and agree to my amendment No. 73, which has been approved by the parliamentary draftsman.</P>

      <P>Under amendment No. 48 parties to an order would be required to make full financial disclosure to include income and property of the parties, whereas amendment No. 73 states that &ldquo;such particulars of his or her property and income as he or she may reasonably require for the purposes of the proceedings&rdquo;.  There is an essential difference in that there will be a limitation on the extent of the disclosure.  I understood that this was already provided for under the rules of court but the Minister's amendment will make specific provision.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I also welcome the Minister's amendment and the extension to dependants, which is necessary.  Nevertheless, as he rightly said, while the current practice will be covered by law, Deputy Keogh's amendment goes much further, and I am not clear on the reason the Minister is not going that far.  It would be eminently logical to do so. While I welcome the Minister's amendment it will not change anything.  If the court is to make a settlement between two parties or if the two parties wish to reach agreement between themselves, it is right and proper that they and the court should know about all the property owned by each party, as is required under Deputy Keogh's amendment. Otherwise, it is easy to envisage situations where the settlement would not be fair or equitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has accepted the principle of my amendment.  While I accept the point about dependents, which has been well made, I am concerned that there is a qualification and unhappy with the phrase &ldquo;such particulars of his or her property and income as he or she may reasonably require for the purposes of the proceedings&rdquo;.  This qualification is unnecessary; full disclosure should mean exactly that.  It is important that there be openness in all separation proceedings.  While I am disappointed the Minister has not accepted my amendment I am glad he has accepted the principle.  I wish to press it however to indicate that I am unhappy that the Minister's amendment does not go as far as I would like.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a major drafting defect in amendment No. 48 which states: &ldquo;Parties to an order shall be required...&rdquo; This would present a major difficulty because the information would be required well before an order was made.  It is not, therefore, a question of parties to an order but rather parties to the proceedings who would require the information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the limitation on the extent of the disclosure &mdash;&ldquo;such particulars of his or <Col N="907" /> her property and income as he or she may reasonably require for the purposes of the proceedings&rdquo;&mdash; this will cover a case where a spouse makes a claim against the other which is totally unmeritorious, where this is used as a device for their own private purposes and where the court recognises the situation for what it is.  Under Deputy Keogh's amendment full disclosure would be required automatically irrespective of whether this was reasonably required for the purposes of the proceedings. All the Oireachtas could expect from any litigant in such a case is what is reasonably required for the purposes of proceedings.  It would not be appropriate to go beyond this.</P>

    <P>(6) Notice of an application under this section shall be given by the applicant to the spouse (if any) of the deceased spouse concerned and to such (if any) other persons as the court may direct and, in deciding whether to make the order concerned and in determining the provisions of the order, the court shall have regard to any representations made by the spouse of the deceased spouse and any other such persons as aforesaid.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 82:</P>
      <P>In page 41, between lines 19 and 20, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>48.&mdash;(1) Subject to subsection (3), stamp duty shall not be chargeable on an instrument by which property is transferred pursuant to an order to which this subsection applies by either or both of the spouses who were parties to the marriage concerned to either or both of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(2) Section 72 (2) of the Finance (1909-10) Act, 1910, shall not apply to <Col N="919" /> a transfer to which subsection (1) applies.</P>
    <P>(3) (a) Subsection (1) applies to a relief order made following the dissolution of a marriage.</P>
    <P>(b) Subsection (1) does not apply in relation to an instrument refered to in that subsection by which any part of or beneficial interest in the property concerned is transferred to a person other than the spouses concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The areas of the tax code to which these amendments relate are stamp duty, capital acquisitions tax, capital gains tax and probate tax.  Under the Bill as it stands, the court is being given power to make financial and property orders in support of a former spouse whose foreign decree of divorce is recognised in the State.  The main effect of these amendments is to extend the tax exemptions which currently apply in financial and property dealings between married couples to those cases covered by the Bill where the foreign divorce is recognised here.  These provisions will ensure that couples who are divorced abroad will not be at a disadvantage in terms of our tax code.  The added significance of these tax provisions is that they will in substance be the same as those in any future domestic divorce legislation.  I propose to deal briefly with the amendments as follows:</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 82 exempts from stamp duty the transfer of property which is the subject of a relief under the Bill between spouses whose marriage have been dissolved abroad and the decree of divorce recognised in the State and the order provides for the transfer of property.  There are already similar provisions in the law in relation to the transfer of property between spouses.  The amendment also provides that the instruments of transfer do not have to be adjudicated on by the Revenue Commissioners, thereby minimising the costs involved.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment No. 83 exempts from capital acquisitions tax a <Col N="920" /> person whose foreign divorce is recognised here and where a specified order e.g. a relief order, an order for the provision of a spouse out of the estate of the other spouse, a maintenance order, a secured maintenance order or a lump sum order are made by the courts following the dissolution of the marriage. As a result, any deemed gift or inheritance arising from the making of such orders will be entirely exempt from capital acquisition tax.  I think it only right that any property or money transferred in such circumstances should be dealt with in the same way as transfers between spouses.</P>
    <P>The rules governing the assessment of capital gains tax on married couples are contained in section 13 of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975.  They apply only in the case of a married couple where the wife is a married woman living with her husband.  By virtue of section 2 (3) of the Capital Gains Tax Act, 1975, whether the wife is such a married woman is determined in accordance with the rules set out in section 192 of the Income Tax Act, 1967.  That section provides that a wife will be treated as living with her husband unless they are separated under a court order or a deed of separation or they are in fact separated in such circumstances that the separation is likely to become permanent.</P>
    <P>In general, disposals or transfers of assets from a husband to his wife who is living with him and <i>vice versa</i> are ignored for capital gains tax purposes, that is, they are treated on a no gain, no loss basis.  In addition, the spouse acquiring the asset is treated for the purposes of determining indexation relief and the rate of tax on any future disposal of the asset as if that spouse had acquired the asset on the same date and for the same consideration as the disposing spouse originally acquired it.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the section proposed to be inserted in the Bill by amendment No. 84 is to avoid similar capital gains tax treatment in the case of disposals of assets between separated spouses or, as the case may be, former spouses where <Col N="921" /> the disposal is made by virtue or in consequence of (a) an order made under Part II of the Bill on or following the granting of a decree of judicial separation or (b) a relief order made following the dissolution of a marriage to which section 4 of the Bill applies.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 115 (a) of the Finance Act, 1993, is to fully exempt spouses from probate tax and any assets passing to him or her on the death of his or her spouse.  Amendment No. 85 provides that on the death of one of the parties to a dissolved marriage, no probate tax will be payable in respect of any provision that the court, under section 26 of the Bill, makes in favour of the surviving spouse out of the estate of the deceased spouse.  If the provision which the court makes consists of a life interest in property, the probate tax on that property is postponed until the death of the surviving party.</P>

      <P>I welcome the measures, but they do not go far enough, particularly in the case of marriage breakdown. In so far as they apply to foreign divorces they are a useful improvement. Amendment No. 82 provides that stamp duty shall not be chargeable on property transferred pursuant to a relief order which, in this case, only applied to foreign divorces.  That is fair enough, and we will support it.  Amendment No. 83 covers exemption from capital acquisitions tax.  Does that apply only to foreign divorces?  If so, it is welcome.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 84 relates to a decree of judicial separation or a foreign divorce.  As far as it goes it is welcome, but what is the position on nullity?  Amendment No. 84 states:</P>
      <P>(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of the Capital Gains Tax Acts, where, by virtue or in consequence of&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) an order made under Part II on or following the granting of a decree of judicial separation, or</P>
      <P>(b) a relief order made following the dissolution of a marriage.</P>
      <P>either of the spouses concerned disposes of an asset to the other spouse, both spouses shall be treated for the purposes of those Acts as if the asset was acquired from the spouse making the disposal...</P>
      <P>This amendment does not seem to apply to nullity.  Does that fall to be dealt with on another day?</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 85 is also welcome. It applies just to foreign divorces and we will be supporting it.</P>

      <P>I too support the amendments in so far as they go.  I realise they are restricted in their remit at present. This underlines the difficulty of bringing in a new section on Report Stage because there are questions that would benefit from further discussion.  I have no difficulty with the amendment but I do object to the introduction of a new section to a Bill on Report Stage.  There was also an objection on Committee Stage to the introduction of a different section.  This practice makes life more difficult particularly if the section is contentious. Thankfully, this is not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome these amendments which apply to relief orders following foreign divorce decrees that are recognised here.  What the Minister has done is a good idea.  I take it to be a <Col N="923" /> signal that the provisions that apply to the taxation treatment of property and property transfers in the case of foreign divorces will, in the event of the introduction of divorce here, apply to people who would not be looking for foreign divorce decrees because they are domiciled here.</P>
      <P>In regard to the capital acquisitions tax provisions, may I take it that a gift by a former spouse is exempt from capital acquisitions tax and that aggregation will not apply to any subsequent gift or inheritance?  Favourable tax treatment will apply to property transferred in consequence of a relief order following the dissolution of a marriage.  Is there some objection to making such tax treatment general so that it would apply to all ex-spouses in relation to gifts other than those received by way of relief order?  In the case of marriage breakdown a relief order is made, property is transferred and the appropriate tax provisions apply as if the parties were still married.  However, at some time in the future, because he has come into wealth, or is dying, or has decided that he did not provide properly for his ex-spouse in the first place or had not declared all his assets at the time, the donor party may want to give her something extra.  That would be treated as a gift or a capital transfer to a stranger with tax implications and there is a substantial difference between that and a gift from one spouse to another.  Is there a major objection to making the tax treatment applicable to all ex-spouses? It would seem more equitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Woods raised the question of nullity.  The Bill, as now framed, does not include nullity and, consequently, these provisions will not have reference to that.  We are examining the question of bringing in a new Bill on nullity in due course.  Certainly the tax implications of that would be considered in that context.  The considerations might not necessarily be quite the same, but the tax aspect will be looked at at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="924" /> To answer Deputy O'Dea's question, aggregation will not apply any more than it would following on transfers between spouses.  In regard to transfers between divorced couples being treated differently for tax purposes, depending on whether or not the transfer was made as a result of a court order, that is because the Bill is confined to orders made by the courts.  It was not appropriate to include tax provisions that went beyond the scope of this Bill.  However, I will raise any other side issues going beyond that position with the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <P>The purpose of my amendment is to abolish the outdated denominationally based rules dealing with civil and religious ceremonies.  Since 1844 the statutory regime for marriage law has been denominationally based.  The Minister moved an amendment on Committee Stage which we agreed to. We were of one mind in what we would like to achieve and at that time he said it was the subject of a complex review. I will not press this amendment because the point was well made, but I would like to know the position and if a review is in train.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to thank you for your help and also all my <Col N="930" /> colleagues who contributed to the debate on Report and Final Stages this morning.  It has been a tricky, difficult and complex Bill with major alterations on the way.  I cannot give any guarantee that it might not yet be back here following amendment in the Seanad, but I know I will continue to have the co-operation of my colleagues. This difficult and complex Bill gives very many important improvements to people whose marriages unfortunately break down.  It will be a major help to a great many people in that context.</P>
      <P>I thank the officials of my Department who worked so long and hard unravelling these complexities.  I would like them to know that their help was very much appreciated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important Bill but it is unfortunate that because of the events that occurred, in spite of the concerns expressed all along, the Bill has had to be altered to a great extent on Report Stage.  We have made the point that this should not really happen on Report Stage and it is desirable that such alterations be dealt with earlier. Nevertheless we have co-operated with the Minister because of the importance of this Bill and the work he is doing.  I have requested him specifically&mdash; because the Bill has been dismembered to a large extent by the removal of the sections dealing with nullity&mdash;to come back as a matter of urgency with legislation on nullity, providing reliefs of a similar nature for cases of nullity.  It is particularly important that these reliefs are set out in advance of the referendum. I know there is a temptation to leave a great many of these matters until after the divorce referendum but it would be wiser to deal with them in advance of the referendum as they would have been if it had not been necessary to remove them from this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that I welcome the work of the Department, the officials and the Minister in bringing the Family Law Bill, 1994, to this stage and I can assure the Minister that he will have our full <Col N="931" /> support in tackling issues of nullity as a matter of urgency.  I have pleasure in supporting this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HelenKeogh" hpid="Ms Keogh Ms Keogh">
      <NameTxt>Ms Keogh</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, a year later we have come to the last stage of this Bill. It has been a very difficult process and I congratulate the Minister for his commitment to family law.  It is even more difficult for him than for us on this side of the House.</P>
      <P>I realise there is a difficulty with nullity and it behoves the Minister to act quickly on legislation but I am glad he took on board the Opposition's comments on Second and Committee Stages.  I am pleased that he has been open to amending the Bill and has taken some amendments on board.  However, I could not let the opportunity pass without saying how disappointed I am that my amendment concerning the joint interest in the family home was lost, particularly as I had received support from my then colleagues in Opposition, the Fine Gael Party and the Democratic Left Party.</P>

      <P>Notwithstanding that this Bill stands alone there is still a great <Col N="932" /> deal of legislation to be brought through by the Minister.  I agree with Deputy Woods that if we are to have divorce legislation it is important that we have the corpus of legislation in place before we go ahead with the referendum.  The Minister should pursue the wording for the legislation on divorce in tandem and should not wait for everything to be complete.</P>
      <P>At different stages I have said that if you want something badly enough you have to try and try again.  Often Deputies in this House have had to seek election several times before being successful. We need a similar determination to maintain belief in the legislation we want enacted.  I intend at every opportunity to amend or bring forward legislation that will enshrine the principle of joint ownership of the family home in our legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>The three senior posts in the Government Press Secretariat and Government Information Service are: Government Press Secretary; Deputy Government Press Secretary and Head of the GIS; Assistant Government Press Secretary.</P>
      <P>Details of their terms of employment are set out in the schedule I am circulating in the Official Report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the Government Press Secretary is to act as the spokesperson <Col N="934" /> for the Government.  Just as in the case of previous coaliation Governments, he works with his other two colleagues, as a team, in providing joint briefings for the media.  I meet the three of them every day prior to these briefings and I believe that this contributes to more effective communications, both interally and externally.</P>
    <P>Mr. John Foley's previous contract as Assistant Government Press Secretary and Head of the GIS terminated only on 15 December 1994 when the former Taoiseach ceased to hold office.</P>
    <P>The post of Head of the GIS has been a temporary appointment for more than 20 years, occupied by various persons.</P>
    <P>The three senior posts are:&mdash;1. Government Press Secretary; 2.  Deputy Government Press Secretary and Head of the GIS; 3.  Assistant Government Press Secretary.</P>
    <P>The appointees are engaged on the standard terms and conditions as approved for such appointments, i.e. they hold temporary unestablished positions under contracts that terminate notlater than the date on which the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, ceases to hold office.</P>
    <P>Their remuneration is £50,140, £45,146 and £32,000 respectively.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach think there was a conflict of interest in the role played by the head of the GIS between 17 November and 15 December when he was acting on behalf of the Labour Party Leader's entourage and was involved in meetings I attended with Deputy Bruton in an effort to put an alternative Government together at a time when he was paid to represent the minority Fianna Fáil Government?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My recollection is that he did not attend the meetings but handled the arrangements regarding the statements that were to be made subsequent to the meetings.  My experience of dealing with Mr. John Foley suggests that he fully understands the requirements of his job and would not allow himself to enter into any situation which <Col N="935" /> would lead to a conflict of interest or where there would be difficulty for any of those for whom he was working.  I believe that has been the experience of those who worked with him in any capacity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not remember that Mr. Foley came to a meeting to assist us on how to handle media briefing?  At that time he was acting as Head of the Government Information Service and presumably being paid by the taxpayer to represent the then interests of the minority Fianna Fáil Government.  Would the Taoiseach not accept that was a clear conflict of interest?  Would it not be better to have an established civil servant as head of the GIS who would be in a position to represent the Government's interests even when a minority party pulls out of Government?</P>

      <P>I would prefer to answer that charge which I regard as gratuitous and unnecessary.  In my experience.  Mr. Foley acted in every respect with the height of integrity and honour.  I have no reason to suspect that any of those with whom he worked are in any way unhappy with the way he worked.  I am happy with the work he is doing for the Government and I have no doubt that the previous Government was happy with the work he did for it. Anyone acting in a professional capacity as Government Press spokesman understands that the job is to convey the message for those who give instructions. That being the case, given that the job is one of communication rather than origination of the message, no conflict of interest arises.  I do not see any problem with anything that happened in this area.  I apologise for replying at such length notwithstanding your discouragement. Sir, but since the position of a person who is not a Member of the House and cannot defend himself has been called into question it is necessary for me to do so, even though I may have incurred your wrath in the process.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that but if someone is paid by the taxpayer I am entitled to ask a question.  Is it acceptable to the Taoiseach that a person who is a party political appointee and that party is not part of the Government, can continue as head of the Government Information Service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no reason to believe that the then Taoiseach, Deputy Reynolds, had any problems with the continuance in office of Mr. John Foley as head of the Government Information Service.  If he objected to it, he had the means of putting that to an end but he did not.  Therefore, I have every reason to assume that there is no problem. However, I would have to say that this is not without precedent.  For example, the Coalition Government, of which I was proud to be a member, from 1982 to 1987, came to an end with the withdrawal of the Labour Party but the Attorney General in that Government, who had been nominated by the Labour Party to that position, continued in office and advised the then Government even though, for the remainder of its short period in office, it was a one party Government and worked very professionally. I have no doubt that was the case in regard to any advice or assistance tendered by Mr. Foley to the Fianna Fáil Government when it remained in office in the few weeks following the break-up of the previous Coalition Government.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The Government is preparing proposals for the relaxation of the Cabinet confidentiality rule in circumstances in which the public interest would warrant this.  These proposals will be referred to the Law Reform Commission for its views, in advance of being finalised and put to the people in a referendum.</P>

      <P>Given that the composition of the Supreme Court has changed, and the stated views at the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Beef Processing Industry by the now Chief Justice, will the Taoiseach say whether the Government would consider introducing legislation which could be referred to the Supreme Court, when we might not then need a referendum, or to add to the Constitution something that could become unnecessary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <P>Given the pressure of work on the Law Reform Commission, is the Taoiseach confident that he can put this to the public, this year or next? The great work the commission do is important but over the years, they have been inclined to spend a lot of time on issues &mdash; which I fully understand&mdash; and particularly in view of the item contained in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> where it is said that the commission really have to define the public interest, that the Government is waiting for the commission to inform the Government, where matters of public interest dictate, that the absolute rule on Cabinet confidentiality will be relaxed.  Given the complexity of establishing the public interest on the part of the Law Reform Commission can the Taoiseach tell the House that it will be put before the public within the lifetime of this Dáil?</P>

That is the reason I decided, rather than simply refer the question to the Law Reform Commission, I would ask the Government to prepare its own ideas first, so that we would be referring specific ideas to the Law Reform Commission for reaction rather than requesting them to originate proposals. I am anxious that this matter be dealt with with reasonable speed, which is the reason we took the course we did, which is a slight alternation, if you like, of what was contained in the original programme for Government, precisely <Col N="940" /> because I accept the validity of the points just made by Deputy Séamus Brennan.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the proposal contained in the Programme for Government is a twostage one.  The first stage will take place during 1995, comprised of a group of experts, in which there will be no particular party representation, although membership of a party will not disqualify people from taking part if they have the necessary expertise.  A report will be prepared which will then be referred to an all-party committee of this House in 1996 and subsequently.  Obviously, at that stage, there will be a very substantial and formal, all-party, input to this process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach bear in mind that the Constitution has served us well, that a body of judgments has been built up on the strength of it and that, therefore, any proposals for change in it would be few?  Will the Taoiseach now outline to the House what constitutional referendum he expects will be held during the current year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Ahern in regard to his general observations in regard to the Constitution because it is very important to recognise that a significant body of jurisprudence has been built up in regard to the interpretation of particular Articles and that, therefore, any change in those Articles, however, minor, could alter or invalidate the existing jurisprudence which gives certainly to constitutional lawyers in interpreting the Constitution.  The Deputy made a very valid point which I hope will be taken into account by anybody examining the Constitution.  At the same time there is no doubt that some aspects of the Constitution, not necessarily those subjected to controversy particularly frequently, could be improved.  To make that type of improvement possible this review is being initiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a number of hopes in regard to issues that might be dealt with by referendum this year.  The only one I would say that most certainly will take place is <Col N="943" /> a referendum in respect of divorce; that is something which I believe must take place this year, if possible.  Indeed it is not just possible but probable that other matters will be dealt with simultaneously. It is my intention, if possible, to bring a number of other issues before the people where the Government has already indicated an intention to do so. For example, I mentioned the matter of Cabinet confidentiality and the issue of representation of emigrants in the Seanad.  Those are two issues I should like to see dealt with, if possible, this year.  However, I will not get myself into that dangerous territory, of putting dates on things and finding, for reasons that may not be foreseeable at this stage, that they cannot be adhered to.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Taoiseach cannot give exact dates, but will he confirm that, the last Wednesday or Thursday of May, the date tentatively agreed by the last Government still applies for the holding of a divorce referendum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, if possible.  I have avoided setting precise dates in public statements and I encourage Ministers to do likewise.  In a matter of this complexity it frequently proves impossible to meet dates because of the programme of work the Government set itself.  We are aiming to hold a referendum in May, if possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that changes in the Constitution are essentially political matters and are not necessarily matters for consideration by experts?  Will he be prepared to meet the Leaders of Opposition parties to discuss membership of the expert group and maybe accept nominations or suggestions from Opposition parties? Will the Taoiseach be prepared to meet with the Leaders of all parties to discuss the mechanics for holding a divorce referendum? I am sure he will agree that if it is to be passed it is important that <Col N="944" /> we have all-party support in a referendum campaign?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say yes to the second part of the Deputy's question.

      <P>Well said.  I hope that will be included in the quotes of the week.  I do not want to enter that process, but I will be more than happy to have discussions with Deputies Ahern and Harney about any matter affecting this process and to take their views into account.  However, I am not willing to commit myself to accepting specific nominations as that would be imprudent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has given me some information on the divorce referendum.  I assume we will not have to wait until the end of an examination by the constitutional review group for an indication about the referendum on bail.  Regarding constitutional change, will the Taoiseach not agree that it would be better to put fewer items before the people at any one time rather than a number of amendments which I presume would result from an examination by a constitutional review group?  That is not the practice in other countries and I would not like to see it develop here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has made a very good point.  None of us in the <Col N="945" /> House would like to see 20 constitutional amendments being presented to the people and they being asked to make 20 separate decisions on the one day.  Even if there were 20 proposals for amendment to the Constitution at the end of this process clearly there would be advantages in not putting them all to the people on the one day.</P>
      <P>In regard to bail, as the Deputy is no doubt aware the Programme for Government commits us to refer the matter to the Law Reform Commission. It is a matter that probably will require constitutional amendment.  Given that it is identified as a separate item within the Programme for Government, it would not have to await attention until completion of the comprehensive review.  It is something we will deal with separately whenever we are in a position to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reassured to hear the Taoiseach say that a referendum on bail will be brought forward.  It is a vital issue given the revolving door syndrome in our justice system.  I encourage him to bring forward such a referendum at the earliest possible date.</P>
      <P>An issue that is an irritant for many thousands of people, one that has been debated here many times is the iniquitous ground rents.  It should be a simple issue to address and a simple question to put to the people.  Will the Taoiseach consider including a question in a referendum on the abolition of the last vestiges of ground rents?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, there are references to the question of ground rents in the Programme for Government.  If I correctly recollect, ground rents do not necessarily require constitutional amendment and I would prefer if a non-constitutional route to deal with them was explored before reaching a conclusion that a constitutional amendment is necessary.  However, I stress that it is an issue that needs to be dealt with.</P>

As his predesessor might have said &mdash; that's new for you.  I am rephrasing what his predecessor said about women.  I am simply raising the point because there are some very offensive articles in the Constitution regarding the role of women about which women feel very strongly which are separate from any legal changes we might make.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with the Government's programme for renewal, a commission will be established, as recommended in the Barrington report, to oversee a phased programme of devolution and a widening of the role of local government.</P>
      <P>I am anxious that the approach taken will, in addition to developing the principle of subsidiarity, provide a framework for supporting a broadly participative approach to local democracy.  In particular, I intend that the arrangements made will reinforce the support for local and community development which is being promoted through the Government's policy on local development.</P>
      <P>The Barrington report recommended that the commission's establishment should be preceded by a Government statement on the role of local government and its future development.  That statement will be issued by the Government by the end of April, at which time the commission will be appointed.  In the meantime, I will meet with members of the Barrington committee and initiate more general consultation on the complex issues involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know the answer to that question at this juncture. The Government must issue its preliminary or general views on the remaining issues in the Barrington report, which will provide the agenda for the commission to oversee implementation of the reform.  I am somewhat daunted by the task I have set of having a comprehensive statement on this matter ready by April next, but the Government will benefit from setting itself a date in this <Col N="949" /> regard.  Until now local government reform has always been considered important but never important enough to be placed at the top of a Government's agenda.  I hope this comprehensive approach, which places responsibility for local government reform in the hands of the Taoiseach, will give it the necessary priority, but I in no way underestimate the political minefield into which I am entering in endeavouring to initiate such reform.  I look forward to the comprehension, if not the support, of all Members on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be a combination of all.  Members of the House, many of whom are members of local authorities, will find the forthcoming report of the National Economic and Social Council on rural development very interesting because it seriously criticises traditional local government as, for example, the preferred vehicle for rural development.  While the natural tendency of all of us involved in party political politics will be to react negatively to such criticism, we must recognise that local authorities do not command the level of community support they should.  We must resolve that difficulty and make them, not just formally the vehicle for reform, but one for <Col N="950" /> reform that commands widespread support. I hope the debate on this matter will be honest and those involved in local government will be willing to examine the weaknesses of the system &mdash;including weaknesses for which they are responsible &mdash; as well as taking the traditional attitude of saying that if central Government gave them more power, they would solve everything, when that is not always the case.</P>
      <P>There is not as much broadly based political support, outside the political class, for local government reform as we would like to believe there is.  Perhaps the reason so much community effort has been poured into initiatives such as the Leader programme is that they provide a way for people to by-pass tradiional local government.  We must ask ourselves why that is so and what can we do to make local government the chosen vehicle for that type of community initiative, which is not the case.</P>

      <P>Does the Taoiseach accept that anybody who considers further or future deliberations on local government reform and does not, from the outset, take on board the key issue of funding will not make any real contribution to the future of local government?

The reason local authorities and corporations lose much of their focus in large city areas is that their representation is different from that of rural areas and the system loses out as a result.

      <P>The Government share the widespread view that the <Col N="953" /> forum is making a very worthwhile contribution to the cause of peace and reconciliation on this island.  As indicated in our programme, we are of course fully committed to its continuation for as long as is necessary to enable it to complete its important work.</P>

      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation which was established on 28 October 1994 by his predecessors is working well and making a significant contribution to the peace process?  Will he accept that the mandate to the forum is open-ended and that it should continue until there is consensus among the parties that it has served its purpose? Further, will the Taoiseach use this opportunity to give the House an indication of the state of the nation address which the Prime Minister, Mr. Major, will give today?  Has he had discussions during the day with Prime Minister Major in an effort to alleviate the fears and concerns of the people whom we have been trying to bring into the forum during the past three or four months? This is a difficult day and if the forum is to continue to achieve success we must focus on the concerns of the Unionists. Perhaps the Taoiseach would give an outline of the position since morning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As, no doubt, the Deputy will recollect when the forum was being established and I was in Opposition I was extremely anxious to ensure that everything possible was done to ensure that the Unionist community was represented and took part fully in the forum.  Indeed, I made public and private efforts which, I have no doubt complemented the efforts being made by the then Government, to persuade some or all of the Unionist parties to take part.  I believe their absence is sorely felt in the forum as there are many issues on which we wish to have their views.  I have not the slightest doubt, from my experience of the way in which the forum has worked, that they would receive a very good hearing for <Col N="954" /> their views from all sides.  I heartily endorse what has been said about the valuable work the forum has been doing.  Perhaps I can say something personal about it.  It has not been just the formal sessions that have been useful, it is the ability which the forum gives us all to interact with other parties whom we might not meet informally all that often.  That has been especially useful.</P>
      <P>I do not know if I am in order in widening my replies to include matters that do not come strictly within the compass of the forum.  However, I wish to repeat what I said this morning, that both the Irish and British Governments are working to achieve a balanced framework document which creates a framework in which all communities in Northern Ireland, the rest of us on this island and those in Britain can work together for a better future for all.  We are dealing with extremely complex issues where one is talking about long held and inherently contradictory views about the constitutional position.  If we on this island can find new ways of defining the problem and overcoming it, we will not only help to solve our own problems but perhaps set a headline for other countries in Europe, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe, where similar problems in regard to ethnicity and national loyalty exist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  Will he agree that in working towards a balanced framework document we have to take all views into account?  Will he endeavour, through the Tánaiste and the Department of Foreign Affairs, to ensure that any statement made tonight, in response to the leaked document, keeps in perspective the Nationalist and Unionist views? The Taoiseach could have a valuable input to the Prime Minister's statement. As I understand it the whole emphasis is on reassuring the Unionists and on working towards a balanced framework document which we all want to see.  The Taoiseach has our support in trying to achieve this.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inclined to respect your ruling.  I cannot say what the Prime Minister will say tonight.  It is a matter for each Prime Minister in his or her jurisdiction to make statements to the people in regard to the matters they regard as important.  Obviously, we would have something to say if an address by me was to be the subject of any external interference.  Having said that we must recognise that, in this matter, we are dealing with a matter in which Ireland and Britain have a shared interest.  It is extremely important that the point made by Deputy Ahern in regard to maintaining a balance between the interests of both communities to achieve parity of esteem is at the forefront of everybody's mind.  All contacts, formal and informal, I have on an ongoing basis with the Prime Minister will be designed to achieve that objective in everything he and I do on behalf of our respective Governments.</P>
      <P>Perhaps I can reply to a question I omitted to answer in regard to a suggestion that the forum would continue indefinitely until the last party agreed it should stop.  That is not practical.  We must recognise that at some stage a point will be reached &mdash; everything is temporary &mdash; when the forum will come to an end but I do not see that looming in the near future.  The forum is doing excellent work and I think we are all happy with that.</P>

In respect of a smaller matter, the Taoiseach will acknowledge that when we on this side of the House were in Government, my predecessor and the Ministers made a practice of attending meetings of the forum.  This is not always possible for the Taoiseach but, at least, the Ministers should be there.  I do not wish to be over critical in the early weeks of the Government but the Taoiseach will know what I mean.  Perhaps a special effort could be made to ensure that senior Government officials attend all meetings of the forum.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will acknowledge that I have been assiduous in my own attendance at the forum and that is an example I hope all members of the Government will follow.  I have every reason to believe they have been following it.  Of course, we have a special interest in the Nationalist community. I am proud to be a former member of a Government which negotiated the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the first formal expression in an international treaty of the specific concerns which this Government has for the minority Nationalist community in Northern Ireland.  That is certainly to the forefront in my mind in everything I do as the Leader of this Government.  It is important in our international relations to be tactful and to recognise that other Governments have their responsibilities too.  While I would wish to make representations to the British Prime Minister on an ongoing basis I expect to make them on the same basis as he would make representations to me.</P>

Does the Taoiseach intend getting in touch, or has he been in touch today with the British <Col N="957" /> Prime Minister to discuss the leaking of this information?</P>

      <P>I have been in contact with the British Prime Minister's office. I agree that in all aspects of life nature abhors a vacuum, but at the same time it is important that we have a framework document that gets it right and I would not wish an artificial timetable to place either Government under constraint which would prevent it from getting it right.  I recognise that much work was done by the previous Government and, particularly, by the Tánaiste in the last months in advancing this process.  We are down to a few remaining difficult issues, probably the ones that require the most attention, and I will not set a time limit for the Government.  I recognise the point made by Deputy Harney about the need to finalise matters as quickly as possible so that any measure of uncertainty that exists is removed.</P>

      <P>The Government is fully committed to the strategic management initiative, a commitment which has been demonstrated by the appointment of Deputy Avril Doyle as Minister <Col N="960" /> with specific responsibility in this area. Earlier this week I met with Secretaries of all Departments and heads of offices to re-emphasise the importance of this process.</P>
      <P>Phase I of the SMI is now essentially complete.  This initial phase focused on the identification of objectives by Departments in the light of the Government programme and sets out the broad strategic approach to achieving these aims.

I would envisage all Ministers being fully involved in this process within their Departments.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically there is a particular problem &mdash; this is identified in the strategic management review &mdash; in dealing with issues that run across a number of Departments.  Breaking logjams that affect a number of Departments is a matter which, in the final analysis, requires detailed political leadership.  The additional Ministers of State who have been appointed, Deputies Carey and Doyle, and also Deputy Currie who was appointed in the original series of appointments, have responsibility for a specific theme of work, whether it be western development, consumer of public services or child care&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="The Taoiseach John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; which run across a number of Departments.  That is a good way of bringing in the appropriate political input to break the logjams that have existed in every Government since the foundation of the State.  I can produce from the record of the previous Government several examples of issues which simply were not decided because one Department would not let another Minister do so and the result was that nobody made the decision.  I hope that by establishing this approach &mdash; a horizontal political input on issues rather than a vertical input &mdash; we will be able to solve matters through creative application of political leadership by the Ministers of State concerned.  This is a good measure and one which should be judged by its results.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire Ealaíon, Cultúir</NameTxt>
      <P>agus <b>Gaeltachta (Mr. M. Higgins):</b> Tógfaidh mé Ceisteanna Uimh. 17, 18, 40, 43, 47, 56, 67, 74, 94 agus 97 le chéile.</P>
      <P>D'fhógair mé le déanaí go raibh cead tugtha agam do RTÉ tús a chur leis na hoibreacha caipitil i ndáil le Teilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
      <P>I gcomhréir le cinneadh an Rialtais den 20 Eanáir 1995, íocfar costas iomlán caipitil an togra, a mheastar a chosnóidh £16.1 mhilliún, ón Státchiste agus ón airgead atá carnaithe ag RTÉ ón bhfarasbarr thar an teorainn airgid a leagadh síos faoin Acht Craolacháin, 1990, £6.4 mhilliún le hús carnaithe go dáta atá san áireamh.  Tá soláthar déanta sna Meastacháin do 1995 chun deontas-i-gcabhair £3.6 mhilliún ón Státchiste a chur ar fáil maraon leis an tsuim £6.4 mhilliún atá ag RTÉ, rud a chuirfidh ar chumas RTÉ £10 mhilliún a chaitheamh ar oibreacha caipitil i ndáil leis an togra i mbliana. Cuirfear an fuílleach (£6.1 mhilliún) a bheidh riachtanach chun tógáil an bhonneagair theicniúil a chríochnú ar fáil ón Stáchiste i 1996.  Cuirfear £32.5 mhilliún ar fáil ón Státchiste i 1995 mar dheontas-i-gcabhair i ndáil le costais reatha, mar aon le £10 mhilliún i 1996. Agus cuirfear £10 mhilliún ar fáil ón Státchiste i ndáil le costais reatha an Stáisiúin nua i 1997 agus sna blianta dá éis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar thoradh ar an gcinneadh seo, beifear in ann an bonneagar teicniúil atá riachtanach don stáisiún a chríochnú. Íocfaidh cionnroinnt an Státchiste do chostais reatha as riarachán bliantúil agus costais fheidhme an stáisiúin agus as uair an chloig de chláir in aghaidh an lae.  Cuirfidh RTÉ uair an chloig eile de chláir ar fáil don tseirbhís nua saor in aisce.  Ní tharlóidh de thoradh na gcinnithe sin go ndéanfar aon mhéadú ar chostas an cheadúnais teilifíse.  Ní bheidh aon bhac ar Chomhairle Theilifís <Col N="965" /> na Gaeilge, i gcomhairle le hÚdarás RTÉ, moltaí a chur os mo chomhair a ghinfeadh cistíocht ó fhoinsí seachas an Státchiste le haghaidh cláir bhreise.</P>
    <P>Áireofar sna hoibreacha caipitil atá le déanamh i mbliana ceannach na dtarchuradóirí agus trealamh eile, tógáil agus insealbhú an ghréasáin tarchuradóirí, tógáil agus feistiú an cheannárais i mBaile na hAbhann.  Contae na Gaillimhe, agus áiseanna eagarthóireachta ag ceanncheathrú RTÉ i nDomhnach Broc.</P>
    <P>San áireamh i dTuarascáil an Choiste Theicniúil ar Theilifís na Gaeilge, bhí tuairisc mhionlaigh ag moladh go mbainfí úsáid as an speictream VHF do Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Rinneadh tagairt fhorleathan don ábhar sin i dTuarascáil an Choiste, cé gur aithníodh go mb'fhéidir go gcaithfí ceisteanna polasaí a bhí lasmuigh dá théarmaí tagartha a chur san áireamh sula bhféadfaí cinneadh críochnaitheach a dhéanamh.  Is ceist go príomha don Aire Iompair.  Fuinnimh agus Cumarsáide speictream minicíochta do chraolacháin raidió a shonrú do Theilifís na Gaeilge.  Tuigim go bhfuil i gceist ag a Roinnse ceann den ceithre aicme de mhinicíochtaí teilifíse náisiúnta UHF atá curtha ar leathaobh don tír seo faoi chomhaontuithe idirnáisiúnta a chur ar fáil do Theilifís na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Tuigim ó RTÉ gur caitheadh thart ar £423,000 d'airgead caipitil go dáta ó airgead and &ldquo;chaipín&rdquo;, sé sin suim £415,000 i 1994 móide £8,000 i 1995. Tuigim uathu freisin go bhfuil conarthaí ar fíú £1.7 mhilliún breise iad déanta chomh maithe.</P>
    <P>I 1994 fuair RTÉ deontas thart ar £565,000 ó Vóta mo Roinnese i ndáil le caiteachas reatha chun an réamh-abair don tseirbhís nua a chur sa tsiúil.  Tá suim bhreise de £391,000 íochta ag mo Roinn le RTÉ go dáta i mbliana agus tuigim ó RTÉ go bhfuil thart ar £52,000 de sin caite go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Ar bhonn chinneadh an Rialtais, tá mé ag súil leis go mbeidh an stáisiún nua ar an aer roimh dheireadh 1996.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, i gcead don <Col N="966" /> Teachta Micheál Martin &mdash; agus tréaslaím leis as ucht a cheapacháin &mdash; tá earráid chló i gCeist 18, is é sin, ba chóir go mbeadh i ndiaidh &ldquo;Chun a fhiafraí den Aire Ealaíon, Cultúir agus Gaeltachta&rdquo; na focail &ldquo;ag aithint na hoibre...&rdquo;</P>

Tuigfidh na Teachtaí go bhfuil an cheist beagáinín casta toisc go gcaithfimid fadhbanna craolacháin i gcoitinne a réiteach i gcomhchainteanna le húdaráis eile.

Beidh an chomhairle in inmhe plé le <Col N="967" /> moltaí a bhaineann leis an gcóras craolacháin agus, ar ndóigh, bheadh sé le ciall an córas craolacháin nua seo bheith in ann nithe nua ar nós oideachas teilifíse a fhorbairt.</P>

      <P>Go dtí seo tá comh-oibriú iontach ann ó RTÉ maidir le coincheap an stáisiúin nua agus is í an chosúlacht atá ar an scéal ná go mbeidh RTÉ lansásta leanúint ar aghaidh leis an gcomhoibriú seo.  Bíonn áiseanna ar fáil in RTÉ agus má bhíonn siad in ann cabhrú leis an tseirbhís nua, is ú mo thaithí féin go mbeidh siad lánsásta an comhoibriú seo a chur ar fáil.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Tuigfidh an Teachta, de réir chláir Rialtas Fhianna Fáil agus Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre, go mbeadh seir-bhís dhá go dtí trí huaire ann.  An Rialtas ina dhiaidh &mdash; sin an Rialtas mionlach &mdash; ní raibh siad in ann ceist chostas reatha a réiteach.  An Rialtas atá ann faoi láthair, an rud atá socraithe ná go mbeidh ar a laghad an dá uair seo ach is féidir an córas a fhorbairt agus b'fhéidir airgead a fháil ó fhoinsí eile, seachas an Státchiste, chun am breise a chur ar fáil.  Caithfidh mé ará gur chuir sé ríméad orm féin go raibh an oiread sin suime ag na Teachtaí éagsúla a thóg ceisteanna faoi Theilifís na Gaeilge agus tá mé lánsásta go n-éireoidh go geal leis an tseirbhís nua.</P>

      <Quest>his view on the claim that a United States District Judge has jurisdiction to settle ownership of the wreck of the Lusitania; the way in which he intends to bring the paintings into Irish ownership should they be retrieved and verified; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>
      <QRef>[1957/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19, 20 and 72 together.</P>
      <P>I refer the Deputies to my statement regarding the <i>Lusitania</i> on the Adjournment of the House on 25 January last. Following media reports that valuable paintings in which this country might have a legitimate interest may still be infact in waterproof lead cylindrical containers on the wreck of the <i>Lusitania,</i> the Commissioners for Public Works, with my agreement, made an underwater heritage order on 25 January 1995 in respect of the <i>Lusitania,</i> because of its historic importance.</P>
      <P>In addition, I have sought legal advice on the question of using my powers under section 24 of the National Monuments Act, 1930, as amended by section 14 (4) of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act, 1954, to designate the wreck and its contents as archaeological objects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Investigation of the media claims is ongoing.  At this stage, while there is some suggestion to the effect that unknown paintings may have been carried on the <i>Lusitania,</i> there has otherwise not been satisfactory confirmation of the media reports.  The matter will continue to be actively and urgently <Col N="969" /> pursued but it would be foolhardy to say when the investigations will be concluded satisfactorily as the key people involved reside outside the jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The questions of legal ownership of the wreck and of the possessions of third parties that may still be on board are two separate issues, with two separate sets of problems to be resolved.</P>
    <P>As to the actions taking place in the American courts, I am taking legal advice as to the implications of those actions, if any, for this jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>It is premature at this stage to consider the question of recovering any particular item.  Any initiative of that nature would have to be contingent on the outcome of the investigations now taking place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>How can the Minister and his Department establish with any degree of certainty whether the paintings in question remain in the wreck? Is the Minister aware that some would argue that the paintings, particularly those by Rubens, could not be intact because of the weight of the water and the length of time involved while others would argue that, if they were there in 1914, because of the frequency of unauthorised dives, they may have been plundered?  What steps is the Minister taking to clarify whether the paintings are still in the wreck before we proceed any further with expensive legal transactions and procedures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>With the greatest respect to the Deputy, who is very interested in this matter.  I suggest she is putting the cart before the horse.  This is not a matter of being involved in expensive legal initiatives which would be unnecessary if it is proved, for example, there is no basis to the suggestion that there were paintings which were the property of Sir Hugh Lane and that the National Gallery might be the beneficiary; I suggest it is the other way around.  We should remember that for 1,098 people the <i>Lusitania</i> is a grave. That is a most important point.  It would be improper if there were uncontrolled <Col N="970" /> tampering with a site in which so many people in 1915 &mdash; in 18 minutes &mdash; lost their lives.</P>
      <P>Following the development of the law of the sea at the end of the 1980s and particularly following the passing of maritime jurisdiction legislation in the early 1990s here which established the 12 mile limit &mdash; this is an important issue &mdash; it was appropriate for me to protect the interests of the people by making an underwater heritage order. This means that no one can tamper with the site without a licence from the Office of Public Works under conditions.</P>
      <P>There are two remaining issues; ownership of the vessel &mdash; this matter is being discussed in the courts in the United States &mdash; and ownership of objects which is the most complex because one is dealing with the rights of heirs, successors and others.  This has to be taken into account.  I have been seeking to establish what was being carried by Sir Hugh Lane and we have made progress.  In one newspaper report there was a reference to two paintings by Rubens and one by Monet.  Under the codicil to the will of Sir Hugh Lane the moral right in relation to expressionist paintings has already been dealt with by me when renegotiating the agreement between Ireland and England in 1993 in relation to the paintings by Rubens.  In his main will he made considerable bequests to the National Gallery.</P>
      <P>We have to approach the matter in that sequence: what is the right way to deal with the site?  What is the appropriate way to deal with the vessel?  How do we vindicate the right of the Irish people and make sure that nothing improper is done which would affect any benefit to this country or individual? I also sought legal opinion on how we can vindicate the right of the Irish courts to decide against any claims made by a court in any other jurisdiction.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister and support his action in enforcing the underwater heritage order.  Will he <Col N="971" /> indicate if the newspaper reports that Navy patrols will enforce the order are true and whether the Navy is in a position to enforce it?  As the Minister knows, its primary role is to protect our fisheries and it has to cover 132,000 nautical miles with only seven ships.</P>
      <P>My second question may help the Minister.  I can quite understand the sensitivities in this regard as this vessel is the grave for many people but it occurs to me &mdash; and the Minister knows I am not a lawyer &mdash; that a claim to the wreck, its contents or the artefacts therein by anyone other than the State would be statute barred after 80 years. Will the Minister consider seeking legal advice on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first point I had an opportunity on another occasion to congratulate Deputy de Valera on her appointment and I wish her well in her position as party spokesperson.  I am sure my colleague, the Minister for Defence and the Marine, will welcome her support for greater resources for the Navy.  Many newspaper reports have speculated upon whether the Navy should do this but that is not the issue. Primary and specific duties are allocated to different parts of the service but I would remind Deputies that there are times when the different services, be it Army or Navy, are asked to be of assistance to the civil authority.  It is in that sense, and in the best interests of the country, that I have made an order.  I have written to the Minister for the Marine seeking his co-operation by way of assistance to the civil authority, whose rights have been vindicated by the making of a heritage order.  On the second issue, there is merit in considering the making of an order under section 24 of the 1930 Act, as amended by section 14 (4) of the 1954 Act, for the simple reason that it would at least discipline the reporting of all objects.  I would be very concerned if newspaper reports suggesting that the requirements of the keeper of wrecks, in consultation with the Director of the National <Col N="972" /> Museum, had not been observed were true.  The Deputy will be aware that when we discussed the 1993 national monuments legislation, the whole thrust of my arguing for the abolition of treasure-trove was to put an end to the idea that a person could take temporary ownership of something that was the people's right but rather that we should reward responsible citizenship and not give to individuals ownership rights of the people in common.</P>

We have had only 20 minutes to deal with questions to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  One hour was given to dealing with questions to the Taoiseach and it seems to be a severe restriction of the rights of the Members of this House that they have only 20 minutes&mdash;and that was for dealing with Priority Questions&mdash;available to them.  Therefore, ordinary Members had no opportunity to put questions to the Minister on such important topics.  It makes a mockery of Dáil reform and I would ask that the questions be retabled for the next Question Time involving the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>

    <Title>Heritage Council Bill, 1994    [Seanad]:    Instruction to Committee (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the Committee on the Heritage Council Bill, 1994, has power to make provision in the Bill that the functions of the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to the national heritage under certain enactments shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, be performed subject to the supervision of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and to such directions as the Minister may give in relation thereto and that the Commissioners shall provide the Minister with such information as the Minister may require for those purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main purpose of the Bill, which was introduced in the Seanad and received a Second Reading in this House in November 1994, is to establish a statutory Heritage Council to advise the Minister on heritage policy.  I am proposing to <Col N="1034" /> introduce amendments which will ensure that the implementing agency, the Commissioners of Public Works, carry out that policy.  This is theoretically the position which has pertained for the past two years &mdash; about which I was often asked questions &mdash; that is, since February 1993 when the then Government assigned to me, as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, responsibility for the formulation and development of future policy on inland waterways, national parks and wildlife, and national monuments and historic properties, with the Commissioners of Public Works continuing to exercise their day to day functions in those areas but in accordance with policy decisions by me, setting out my priority areas and proposed implementation targets.</P>
      <P>This position was unsatisfactory in that the Commissioners have certain statutory powers which cannot be transferred by way of Government order, and there were difficulties in practice in reconciling this position with the responsibilities for policy assigned to me as Minister.  In order to remedy the situation, I am introducing amendments to the Heritage Council Bill, 1994, and these will be discussed following the passage of this motion.</P>

      <P>I do not wish to be unhelpful or disruptive, but I must protest at this procedure.  Last week we debated the Second Stage of the Heritage Council Bill only to find that it is not to be the Heritage Council Bill but the Heritage Bill.  While I understand the technicalities this motion is intended to deal with, the Minister must recognise that he is proposing a very different Bill to that discussed on Second Stage and this is outside the scope of the Bill as read on Second Stage.  This is not how parliamentary business should be conducted.  We should have an opportunity to have another debate on this Bill on Second Stage.  I would also like to see a copy of the Minister's statement. This side of the House cannot agree to this approach to business and I, therefore, cannot support this motion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>Inasmuch as I understand the implications of the motion, I have no difficulty with it.  What the Minister is proposing is in accordance with what has been requested over the years by a number of Deputies who felt that there was lack of co-ordination between different Departments, all of whom were charged by public policy to do the same kind of work.  We have all asked for better co-ordination between policy-making bodies and bodies that implement that policy.  That is what is proposed in this motion, and for that reason I support it.  The Heritage Bill will be a better Bill because of this.</P>
      <P>However, I also agree with the point on procedure made by Deputy de Valera.  This motion properly belongs to the Second Stage of a Bill and ought to have been taken in the context of the Second Stage which was taken in this House as late as last Thursday.  This is not the correct way to do business and I very much regret that this motion was not taken on Second Stage.  I agree with that element of Deputy de Valera's objection.</P>

      <P>I too share the concerns expressed.  Irrespective of the merits or demerits of the amendments the Minister might bring forward, the critical issue is one of procedure and of proper regard for the rights of Members to proper advance notice of the Minister's intentions.  His statements should be circulated in advance to the Opposition spokespersons so they can properly assess what he has in mind in terms of changing both the Title and the content of the Bill.  We have talked for a long time about respecting the dignity of the House and the rights of Members to have an informed view.  We are talking about substantial amendments and changing the nature of the Bill.  Some might say they amount to aggrandisement that would do the Medicis proud in terms of empire building within the Government and certain Departments.</P>

It represents sharp parliamentary practice and should be withdrawn. This House should be seen to behave with the utmost propriety.

Some Members might agree with what the Minister is doing, but it stands to reason that others may disagree and they should have the opportunity to articulate their views on Second Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I am very disappointed indeed with what can only be seen as a slight on our Legislature, that the issue this afternoon has been treated in a very cavalier and casual manner.  We all know the Minister can be very creative and imaginative but I hope he will be able to use those traits to ensure that this Bill reverts to Second Stage.  I assure him that this side of the House would allow Opposition time to facilitate him.</P>
      <P>Having been appointed spokesperson for my party on Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht I had had great hopes and expectations that there would be many areas in which the Minister and I would be able to work together.  We are talking about issues that need not necessarily be party political but about heritage.  I am very sorry there has been all this hubbub over procedure which would not have happened if the Minister had taken the original Bill in the ordinary way.  My fear is that much may well be lost in terms of time discussing issues of heritage rather than those of parliamentary procedure.</P>
      <P>Once again I offer the Minister an opportunity to take this Bill, on Second Stage, in Opposition time so that it can receive proper attention and allow us all to consider it in what should be a thoughtful, comprehensive way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht (Mr. M. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 15, to delete Council&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 14 is proposed to give effect to the commitment in the policy agreement &mdash;<i>A Government of Renewal</i>&mdash; of December 1994, that the Heritage Council Bill will be amended on Committee Stage to provide that the <Col N="1048" /> functions of the Commissioners of Public Works, under legislation relating to the national heritage, will be performed by them, subject to the general directions in writing of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  The background to this amendment, as I have already stated to the House, is that in February 1993 the Government assigned to me, as Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht, responsibility for the formulation and development of future policy in relation to waterways, national parks, wildlife and national monuments and historic properties, with the Commissioners of Public Works continuing to exercise their day to day functions in these areas but in accordance with policy decisions taken by me setting out priority areas and proposed implementation targets.</P>
    <P>The Government decision also provided that, to assist in exercising my policy functions, the Commissioners should report annually to me in relation to developments and the attainment of targets in these areas and furnish such information as I might require from time to time for that purpose.</P>
    <P>It is very desirable that these principles are embodied in legislation. Therefore, the amendments I am introducing are in accordance with the policy agreement <i>A Government of Renewal.</i> The policy agreement also provides:</P>
    <P>All the statutory powers of both policy and implementation of the Minister for Finance relating to heritage and cultural institutions (other than powers of a fiscal nature) will be transferred to the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>Already, the functions vested in the Minister for Finance under the statutes relating to wildlife, by a Government Order under the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act, 1939 &mdash; viz. Heritage (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order, 1994 (Statutory Instrument No. 443 of 20 December, 1994) &mdash; have been transferred to the <Col N="1049" /> Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. An order providing for a similar transfer of non-wildlife heritage functions, which is a more complex matter, is being prepared.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 14, the reference to the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, whereby the functions of the Commissioners of Public Works shall, notwithstanding the Ministers and Secretaries Act, 1924, be performed subject to the supervision of the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht and any directions given by the Minister, has been inserted as, under section 1 (ii) of that Act, the Office of Public Works is: &ldquo;...a particular branch of administration assigned to the Department of Finance.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 1 and 18 are consequential and take account of the fact that the Bill will not be dealing solely with the Heritage Council but also, under the proposed new section 24, with the heritage functions of the Office of Public Works.  Amendment No. 1 amends the short title of the Act from the Heritage Council Act to the Heritage Act.  Amendment No. 18 amends the long title of the Bill to reflect the provisions of the new section 24 to be inserted by amendment No. 18.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment Nos. 1 14 and 18 all refer to the new references in the Bill.  To be consistent I must say that because of the manner in which this Stage of the Bill was introduced, because of the difficulties regarding procedure, all of which appears to have happened very quickly in relation to Committee Stage rather than Second Stage, I cannot support these amendments. That is regrettable.  If the legislation was taken in another context there could have been agreement but it is being rushed through and, therefore, not being given the necessary consideration which such an important Bill warrants.</P>

      <P>I am in an extremely difficult position.  As I indicated briefly when I spoke on the motion before the <Col N="1050" /> Vote, I had no difficulty with the substance of what the Minister is proposing to do, but I have enormous difficulty with the manner in which he has proceeded on this issue.  The proposals he is making here today alter fundamentally and quintessentially the nature and scope of the Bill as it was initially presented to this House on Second Stage.  I fully accept the reasons for the alterations and I also understand the circumstances involved.  There was a change of Government and one Programme for Government was replaced by another.  As a result various changes to this legislation were proposed.  Those changes would make such difference to the Bill that the original Bill ought to have been rescinded and a new one drafted.  I am intensely upset and annoyed that the Bill was not dealt with in that way.</P>
      <P>If this is to be the first of a series of Bills that were in midstream before the change of Government, that have been altered radically as a result of that change and are to be presented to the Dáil in this manner, I predict to this Minister and any other Minister who might contemplate a similar course of action that it will lead to a good deal of tension and hostility between Members of the Dáil and members of the Government. That is something I would not wish to happen particularly on a Bill such as this on which there was uniform agreement and total support from all parties for what the Minister proposed on Second Stage.  It is most regrettable that that atmosphere of support and co-operation has now been ruptured.  I respect the democratic vote that has been taken and I will abide by it, but I caution the Minister.  I will write to the Taoiseach on behalf of my party and point out that if this is to be a feature of the new Government and the manner in which it plans to reintroduce legislation that was already in the pipeline, it is on a collision course with the backbench TDs and Opposition spokespersons.  It augurs very badly for the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been talk of openness and accountability.  Who is the Government <Col N="1051" /> accountable to in the first instance, if not to the elected representatives of the general public?  I deeply regret that the Minister has proceeded in the manner in which he has done.  I regret it more deeply still because I believe the Bill is a better Bill as a result of the changes made, but I reject fundamentally the manner in which they were made and presented to the House.</P>

      <P>I wish to address the amendments and be consistent with the views expressed by other Deputies.  The amendment proposes to delete the word &ldquo;Council&rdquo;.  I do not believe anybody is critical of the thrust of the Bill.  This is possible legislation but we have a problem in that we were made aware only late last night of the details of what was being proposed.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage the Minister stated that he would table amendments for Committee Stage.  It would have been more desirable if the breadth of what was going to be proposed had been indicated at Second Stage.  Failure to have done so means that Members have been denied the opportunity of a Second Stage debate on the drastically changed proposals before us now.  That is the point at issue.  We are now dealing on Committee Stage with a major broadening of the Bill and that is what we object to rather than the improvements in it and a broadening of its role.  I am sure the Bill will eventually pass through both Houses but to have notified Members at the last moment of the substantial changes in the Bill is a very bad way of ordering our business.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to reply to Deputies.  As one who has worked on heritage legislation, introduced legislation on national monuments, brought forward this legislation, intends introducing legislation on museums and libraries as well as amending the Wildlife Act, I, too, appreciate consultation and goodwill on these issues.  I wish to make a point which I suggest Members should consider calmly.  From February 1993 onwards we had a stated position which was throwing up practical day to day difficulties and it was agreed that the Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht of the day would have responsibility for future policy.  However, where did policy and practice come in?  Even with the best will in the world the commissioners, for example, had functions which derived from the authority of the Minister for Finance and others but which had been laid down in their own way.  It was agreed that it was much better when moving from one Government to another to make the relationship explicit, I wish there had been more time to discuss the changes and to give notice of the motion.  Immediately I found the motion was necessary, I consulted with the Ceann Comhairle's office, the role of which is one of advice, and was advised that the way I suggested proceeding by way of motion was in accordance with Standing Orders.  I want people to advert to what has happened and I will answer Deputies' questions in a straightforward manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tosóidh mé leis an méid atá ráite ag an Teachta Killeen agus cuireann sé as dom a chuid cainte faoi uisce faoi thalamh &mdash; ní raibh aon uisce faoi thalamh <Col N="1053" /> ag baint liomsa riamh agus ní raibh aon easpa misnigh ann maidir le labhairt amach go hoscailte.  B'fhéidir nach mbeadh an rud céanna le rá ag gach comhalta den Teach seo agus tuigeann sé cad é atá i gceist agam.</P>
    <P>Deputy Killeen need not be concerned that I will say one thing one day and something else the following day. The purpose of these amendments is to implement what is proposed in the Government's programme and this is included in that programme because it is necessary to make explicit the relationship between policy and administration. As a result, people will be able to point to where the responsibility lies by way of Dáil question or otherwise. This proposal will simply make a process explicit because, as I understand it, I am not being given powers other than those given to me in February 1993 by <Col N="1054" /> the Government.  The only difference now is that the gap between policy and its implementation, which was left open to misconception at that time, is being filled.  That gap was not intentional on the part of either party involved.  The powers transferred to the Department of Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht have been laid down and the relationship between the Minister and the commissioners, the commissioners responsibility to the Minister and, in turn, his responsibility to the House and Government is being made explicit.  There is no other uisce faoi thalamh or devious intent in this proposal.  This change in the legislation will provide openness, orderly relationships between policy and administration and it will also strengthen the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(g) railways and related buildings,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In this section the Minister sets out to define a list of items that come within the ambit of the Bill such as monuments, landscapes, wrecks and seascapes.  The purpose of my amendment is to include in that list, railways and railway buildings.  Railways and railway buildings are a very important aspect of our heritage and a crucially important part of our social and folk history.  We have a whole body of ballads that belong to the brave men who with muscle power and will power built our railways at the end of the last century and several branch lines at the beginning of this century.  I know of whole families who were involved in that type of activity and whose names and whose prowess live on as part of local and folk history.  Their contribution must be acknowledged in the context of a heritage Bill.  As well as that, they have left behind a fine physical heritage of engineering works in terms of railway tracks and railway buildings and an architectural heritage in terms of railway station houses, bridges and viaducts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the loveliest cut limestone buildings, bridges, viaducts or station <Col N="1057" /> buildings, up and down the country are adjacent to railways.  In some railway stations &mdash; I travel a lot by train, especially in wintertime &mdash; the most beautiful Victorian wrought iron was used and it is important to protect and preserve those fixtures in the context of heritage policy.</P>
    <P>A matter of concern to me was the closure in the 1960s of a number of branch railway lines, a policy with which I fundamentally disagreed.  I was young and certainly not active in politics then, but I still disagree with it.  Branch railways were not only closed down but the prospect of their ever being opened up again by another generation was put paid to because in many cases they were uprooted and the sleepers taken away and sold.</P>
    <P>To add to that act of official vandalis farmers whose lands adjoin railway lines have begun, without permission, to extend their holdings onto the railway lines.  Will the Minister ensure that practice is stopped?  For those reasons and many others I ask the Minister to take on board my recommendation that some measure be introduced in this Bill, and any other appropriate legislation, to protect what is left of our railways to ensure they are handed on to the next generation in proper condition and to maintain that fine heritage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Quill's amendment.  Her argument about local history is very strong.  All those involved in the building of railways and the families who worked on them for many generations should be remembered in the conservation of such lines.  There are hopes that a former railway in my constituency, the west Clare railway, will be rebuilt under local schemes.  I know the Minister has a particular interest in this railway, about which there are many songs and fables. It has been suggested that the rebuilding of part of this line will be a tremendous boost to tourism in the constituency, the county and the region.  As a matter of heritage such railway lines should be <Col N="1058" /> preserved and I am very happy to support Deputy Quill's amendment in this regard.</P>

Work on some of the old railway bridges &mdash; for example, on the DART line could have been carried out much more effectively if the bridges had been left in their original state.  Will the Minister say whether lock-keepers' houses along canals are included in this legislation?</P>

Dúirt mé freisin nach raibh sé de nós agam aon rud a rá go hindíreach agus nach raibh aon bhac orm rud ar bith a bhí ar m'intinn a nochtadh go neamhbhalbh agus bhí mé ag súil go mbeadh de dhánacht ann an stíl chéanna a chleachtadh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share Deputy Quill's concern and her views on encroachment.  The specific inclusion of railways and related buildings within the definition of archaeology is unnecessary in that they are included in monuments as defined in section 2.  They also come within the definition of architectural heritage, which is proposed in amendment No. 3 in my name.  This is a better way to deal with the matter instead of making specific reference to railways and related buildings because, for example, the argument might be made that stone buildings or places nearby are related to the railway or, in terms of people who lived there, to work carried out on the railway.  The architectural heritage definition in amendment No. 3 includes <Col N="1059" /> all these matters and I prefer to deal with it in that way.  For that reason I ask the Deputy to accept that her concern is met in the Bill, specifically in amendment No. 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Minister's intention in this respect and I am sure there is a body of people who readily recognise that railways ought to be part of our architectural heritage, but there is also a wide body of people who speak a different language.  A recent example of professional people speaking a different language when talking about the same item was at the Select Committee on Security and Legislation.  While the Minister and some experts may accept that railways are included by definition, there is a large body of people who contend that railways should be included in the Bill in their own right.</P>
      <P>Railways are huge installations and most ordinary people, including me, would not regard them as monuments.  I consider myself to be a reasonably thoughtful person and I would never describe a railway as a monument.  A number of railways and railway buildings are still in use and to relegate them to the status of monuments is to ignore those still in use which could be put to other use if there was a change of heart. Future generations may see the commercial, heritage and other values of railway stations.  Given the magnitude of the railway infrastructure, the importance of railways and the precarious position of many railway lines, I appeal to the Minister to accept my amendment failing which I will reserve the right to re-enter it on Report Stage.  I ask him to think very carefully before he decides to include railways in a body of language which might not be understood by the general public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have unintentionally misled the Deputy.  If railways qualify for inclusion in the definition of &ldquo;archaeology&rdquo; they will be monuments. That is not my case.  Under amendment No. 3 &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; will <Col N="1060" /> include all structures, buildings, traditional and designed, and groups of buildings including street-scapes and urban vistas, which are of historical, archaeological, artistic, engineering, scientific, social or technical interest, together with the setting, attendant grounds, fixtures, fittings and contents.  I assure the Deputy there is no way even an unreasonable person could disqualify railways and railway buildings from that definition.  Dealing with the issue in this way is more inclusive.  I am confident &mdash; I may have misled the Deputy slightly in this regard &mdash; that the protection she correctly wants is included in that definition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. Barry Mr. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not enter into the debate earlier as I was not sure of the Minister's attitude to Deputy Quill's amendment.  The insertion of the Deputy's proposed wording may pose a problem for the Minister but I think we are all at one on this point.  I support the spirit of Deputy Quill's amendment.  The culture and history of railways is unique. Many of the railways in North America, the English midlands and other parts of the world were built by Irish labourers. This point is peripheral to the debate but it is of historical interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Quill correctly said, many beautiful small railway stations have been taken over, I presume legally, and destroyed.  The Horse and Jockey station building on the main Cork-Dublin railway line which was derelict but usable up to 20 years ago is now gone. The same applies to Goold's Cross and the Kenmare-Cork line.  There is an interesting advertisement for this line in the Parknasilla Hotel, which is really a railway hotel.  By definition, railway hotels should be preserved not only for their historical and cultural value but also for their architectural and archaeological value.  This advertisement, which must be 100 years old, advertises weekends in the Parknasilla Hotel for people living in London.  The travelling time between London and Kenmare 100 years ago was not much longer than it is today &mdash; one caught an express train to <Col N="1061" /> Fishguard, took a streamer to, I presume, Rosslare, and then took the train to Kenmare.  The train stopped at many small railway stations, including Kent station in Cork city which is a magnificent curved structure &mdash; someone said there was a slight bend in it so as to reflect the character of the Cork people. I do not know why it is this shape but I do not think that is true.  That structure and the tunnel which connects the station to Kilbarry, a small railway station outside Cork, are a very valuable part of our heritage.  I do not for one moment question the Minister's goodwill on this issue but I agree with Deputy Quill that it would be helpful to recognise the unique nature of railway structures in this Bill.</P>

      <P>I very much appreciate Deputy Barry's support.  I had intended to refer to the branch line from Kenmare to Parknasilla but decided that I would not become nostalgic today.  I will withdraw my amendment, and accept that I have the total support of the Minister, but depending on the remainder of the Committee Stage debate I will reserve my right to re-enter it on Report Stage.

      <P>Amendment No. 3, Amendment No. 6 is consequential and amendments Nos. 9 and 17 are related.  I suggest that we discuss amendments Nos. 3, 6, 9 and 17 together.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 4, subsection (1), between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following definition:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo; `architectural heritage' includes all structures, buildings, traditional and designed, and groups of buildings including street-scapes and urban <Col N="1062" /> vistas, which are of historical, archaeological, artistic, engineering, scientific, social or technical interest, together with their setting, attendant grounds, fixtures, fittings and contents;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 17 arises from a commitment I gave on Committee Stage in the Seanad, in response to strong representations by Senators, to amend paragraph 9 (2) of the Schedule during the debate in the Dáil so as to provide for the establishment of standing committees on architectural heritage and inland waterways.  A definition of the term &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; will be inserted in section 2 by amendment No. 3.  I appreciate Deputy Quill's generosity in accepting my assurances in regard to the definition.  Under amendment No. 3 &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; will include all structures, buildings, traditional and designed, and groups of buildings including streetscapes and urban vistas, which are of historical, archaeological, artistic, engineering, scientific, social or technical interest, together with their setting, attendant grounds, fixtures, fittings and contents.  If Deputy Quill thinks there is a way of making this more certain between now and Report Stage I will be generous in my response.  Nevertheless, I believe I have dealt with the matter in a way which gives assurance.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;inland waterways&rdquo; is defined in section 2.  The proposed amendment to paragraph 9 (2) of the Schedule provides that in addition to the mandatory establishment of standing committees on wildlife and archae-ology, which will effectively replace the Wildlife Advisory Council and the national Historic Monuments Advisory Council, the council must also establish standing committees on architectural heritage and inland waterways, both of which are important elements of our rich heritage.  I am committed to making inland waterways a part of our living heritage by encouraging leisure activities on them and by involving local communities. Members will be aware of the <Col N="1063" /> corridor studies to which I am committed and one of which I have published.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 3, 6 and 9 are consequential on amendment No. 17. Amendment No. 3 proposes to insert a definition of &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; in section 2 (1).  This definition will effectively replace &ldquo;works of architecture&rdquo; as defined in that section which, under amendment No. 6, will be deleted.  The term &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; is considered more appropriate than &ldquo;works of architecture&rdquo; as this is the term used &mdash; this is another advantage &mdash; in the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of the Architectural Heritage of Europe which this country signed in 1985 in Granada in Spain which &mdash; as the House will welcome &mdash; we are currently preparing to ratify.</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; is based on the definition contained in Article 1 of that convention which is broad and comprehensive.  For example, it includes the setting, fixtures and fittings of buildings.  The term &ldquo;setting&rdquo; is included as buildings do not exist in isolation and must be viewed in the context of their surroundings such as gardens, parks and the landscape generally.  Fixtures and fittings include such items as fireplaces and furniture.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 9 substitutes &ldquo;architectural heritage&rdquo; for &ldquo;works of architecture&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;national heritage&rdquo; in section 6 (1) which sets out the functions of the council in relation to national heritage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MairinQuill" hpid="Miss Quill Miss Quill">
      <NameTxt>Miss Quill</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the amendments. This Bill is all inclusive in terms of what it seeks to preserve and promote but I must ask the Minister to accept that much of what he proposes will be aspirational unless it is followed quickly by a conservation Bill.  There is no legislation available to require local authorities to preserve streetscapes and buildings.  The powers available are minimal with the result that the local authorities do not have the power to require the owners of private property to preserve it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> I will not make a long speech on this matter as I fully accept it is not possible for the Minister to go any further in this Bill but much of what he proposes in these amendments will be aspirational until a proper conservation Bill is introduced to compel the owners of public or private property to protect and maintain buildings.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that it is important to introduce a conservation Bill.  In many cases the local authorities are the greatest offenders in that they have allowed buildings of historical importance to fall into a state of disrepair.  In Dublin many buildings that should be preserved are in a dreadful state.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works is also guilty in this respect.  Some fine Georgian buildings situated nearby have been allowed to fall into a state of disrepair. This is outrageous.  When the matter was discussed at the planning Committee of Dublin Corporation we were shown photographs of the condition of the buildings &mdash; taken inside &mdash; which amounts to vandalism.  This should not be allowed to happen.  Many other buildings in public and private ownership are in a dreadful state.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is long overdue for the reasons outlined but it must be followed quickly by a conservation Bill.  If there is any delay many unscrupulous people will move quickly and either pull buildings down or allow them to fall down.  Will the Minister ensure that such legislation is introduced quickly to compel local authorities and the owners of private property to carry out the necessary work and, if they are not in a position to do so, to pass it on to those who are.  Very often local authorities retain buildings with the result that they fall into a state of disrepair.  If a good proposal is made to a local authority to refurbish a building it should be forced to sell it.</P>

      <P>I accept fully that these amendments have merit and are desirable. Notwithstanding the fact that some <Col N="1065" /> excellent work has been carried out under the urban renewal scheme, the villages of County Dublin need to be protected.  Last week the Minister's colleague, Deputy Costello, gave a good example of crisis management in a local authority which was able to screen a site on which a building had been demolished but which did not have the wherewithal to protect the building, which was demolished.  Many streetscapes and buildings of historical importance are worthy of protection.</P>
      <P>The Minister has to try to bring the local authorities and local community groups together to prepare an action plan covering semi-derelict buildings of historical importance and buildings in reasonably good repair.  In particular, the streetscape in both Lucan and Malahide should be protected.  I urge the Minister to make the necessary resources available to ensure that the intent of the legislation is met.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the agreement that there is merit in an inclusive definition of this kind which includes not just individual buildings but streetscapes.  I take the point that my responsibility this week is to put a heritage regime in place and share the concern that we need to provide the necessary resources to make the best use of the legislation and the interaction between planning authorities and those charged with the responsibility for heritage and, if necessary, to introduce legislation to bridge the gap between the two if there is a vacuum.  Rather than noting the shortcomings of other legislation it may well be necessary to consider a Bill to fill the vacuum.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1066" /> In page 4, subsection (1), line 49, after &ldquo;books,&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;implements,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I do not know if my amendment has been overtaken by the Minister's amendment but since I have tabled it I will speak to it.  The Minister has sought to define &ldquo;heritage objects&rdquo; in the Bill which states that the term means objects over 25 years old which are works of art or industry, including books, documents and other records of cultural importance.</P>
    <P>Our main industry is agriculture.  For that reason, and because of an exhibition in the Cork public museum last year celebrating the mining past of Cork city, I decided to ask the Minister to accept my amendment and include in that list all tools and implements.  I refer in particular to farm implements, which are very much part of our heritage as agricultural people and part of the craftsmanship of an older generation in that many of the older implements were beautifully fashioned by hand.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister of the fine exhibition in Cork Public Museum where two of Ireland's most unique archaeological treasures, a wooden pick and shovel almost 4,000 years old, formed the centrepiece of an exhibition entitled &ldquo;Our Mining Past &mdash; the Metal Mining Heritage of Cork&rdquo;.  The objects were found at Mount Gabriel in west Cork and formed the basis for a fine exhibition including a series of photographs and graphic panels, ore samples, stone tools, bronze weapons and tools of copper and bronze.  It was one of the most interesting exhibitions which that museum, which is 50 years old this year, has ever held.  It was attended not only by school children but by people from the city and county and by international visitors.  It was nominated for a pres-tigious award which I hope it will win in due course.  That exhibition prompted me to ask the Minister to make specific reference in the Bill to implements since they are such a fundamental part of our history and because they are proven to generate such widespread interest.  They <Col N="1067" /> are attractive museum and heritage items and, as I said with regard to the railways, they are fundamental to our history and our heritage.  I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope, we are making our way back to the equanimity which prevails normally in heritage matters. There is not a difference between the Deputy and me on the specific principle of function and aesthetic which is at the base of Deputy Quill's interest. It is important in considering matters of heritage that an object does not merely have to be visually pleasing.  Last night I opened an exhibition of Japanese pottery. The pottery from different parts of Japan for tea ceremonies is both functional in the ceremonial sense and is also very beautiful.  That would apply to many objects bought as implements.  A difficulty I would ask Deputies to bear in mind is that by being too specific one runs the danger of excluding other items.  I appreciate the work put into this amendment, but the inclusion of a specific reference to implements is unnecessary as implements are already included in the general reference to objects over 25 years old which are works of art or industry.  The inclusion of a specific reference to books, documents and other records was necessary to remove any doubts that they were included in the definition.  The same necessity does not arise in the case of implements.  In addition, there is a danger that by specifying particular descriptions of heritage objects, the broad definition of heritage objects could be unduly restricted.  I know what Deputy Quill wishes to achieve but I suggest that the definitions in the Bill address her concern.  By making the language more narrow, we are in danger of entering into debate on an object that is not strictly an implement but is still of <Col N="1068" /> value.  I would draw the Deputy's attention to the definition of archaeological objects which provides comprehensive protection.  That is the way to proceed and while I appreciate the interest that led to this amendment being tabled, I cannot accept it.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 5, which is being taken with No. 4, seeks a specific reference to genealogical records in the definition of heritage objects in section 2 (1).  On Committee Stage in the Seanad, Senator Taylor-Quinn and other Senators made the point that the definition of national heritage in section 2 (1) did not include the many valuable documents in institutions around the country in which there is a great deal of interest.  Many letters and representations have been received by me from genealogical societies expressing the view that the genealogical heritage should come within the scope of the Bill and, therefore, I introduced an amendment to the definition of heritage objects in section 2 to include documents and records of cultural importance which will include genealogical records.  The way I did that was to refer to documents and records of cultural importance so that I would not face a problem of narrow definition of what was genealogical or otherwise.  I use that by way of illustration.  I am not refuting the case made by Deputy Quill but I am seeking a more inclusive definition to ensure that in making specific references, I do not leave anything out.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but there is an old saying in Irish, &ldquo;Léann an púca a scríbhneoireacht féin&rdquo;.  The Minister understands his definition fully but I also understand my definition.  If, for example, we are to include books &mdash; and the Minister has decided to include books without deeming that to be too <Col N="1069" /> restrictive &mdash; the same argument can be applied to implements and tools because for a civilisation that has only very recently become literate historically many more weapons and tools were fashioned in Irish society than books written or published.  I defend my right to ask the Minister to include a specific reference to implements and tools because I would argue they have equal right to primacy as have books in the context of heritage legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>As I read it, only implements or tools under 25 years old would suffer any disability under the protecting definitions I have given.  The Deputy must remember we have referred to objects over 25 years old which are works of art or industry.  I cannot see how an implement or a tool could be argued as having no connection with industry.  My own memories go back as far as the McCormack mowing machine but I do not believe that 25 years is too short a period.  I will reconsider the matter between now and Report Stage if the Deputies so wish, but if we define something so narrowly and it then becomes a matter of interpretation and something can be argued that is outside the boundary of the narrow definition, it is put at risk.  If one puts down the fundamental definition and specifies the generic categories of objects, as I have done, one gets the most protection.  The case against that is that there are people who argue in favour of lists.</P>
      <P>There is equally a very great weakness in that anything that is not so listed is therefore explicitly removed from protection.  That is my reason for trying to get a balance on the description of categories which are not vague but will cover the concerns of Deputies.  That is what I have attempted to do.  I am not, therefore, disposed to accept the amendment.  I will consider it between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 12 form a composite proposal.  Amendment No. 11 is consequential on amendment No. 8.  The suggestion, therefore, is that amendments Nos. 7, 8, 11 and 12 be taken together.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 7:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (3), lines 42 and 43, to delete &ldquo;but shall not have power to hold&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;and to acquire, hold and dispose of&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Amendments Nos. 7 and 12 are being introduced to give effect to the commitment contained in the policy agreement for Government of December 1994 entitled <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to amend the Heritage Council Bill to enable the council to own land and buildings.  Effectively, and put simply, there was a restriction on the form of property which the council could own. This removes that disability to some extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 7 provides that the council may acquire, hold and dispose of land, including buildings.  Amendment No. 12 removes the prohibition on <Col N="1071" /> the acceptance by the council of gifts of land and buildings.  The power to acquire, whether by way of purchase or gift, hold and dispose of land and buildings is a standard provision in legislation setting up similar statutory corporate bodies such as the Arts Council, Bord na Gaeilge and An Bord Glas.  Without being contentious, what is involved here is whether the Heritage Council is an advisory body or a statutory body with the usual powers that the other bodies have.  There is a strong and less strong version of what the council should be, and this is giving it the same property functions that a full statutory corporate body would have.</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 8 and 11 provide that this power will be exercised by the council subject to any directions which I. in consultation with the Minister for Finance, may decide to give it.  This power will enable the council to, for instance, acquire its own premises and to intervene in the acquisition of certain heritage properties where it is considered appropriate.  I do not envisage the council becoming involved in the routine acquisition of heritage properties. In any event the council will, no doubt, be restricted by the limits of its financial allocation.  This does give it the power, should it be possible for it, and also the power to receive.  That is the purpose of these amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>These amendments make me feel most uneasy.  As I understand it the section implies an executive function that is in direct conflict with the responsibilities of the Office of Public Works.  As the Office of Public Works is the State's property agency, a statutorily based council should not be empowered to acquire, hold, dispose of land or other property.  What the Minister is trying to do in this Bill is draw all the strands together so as to have all the necessary regulations under one Bill dealing with heritage.  I can understand the logic of that but at the same time, in accepting these amendments, we would be duplicating existing arrangements <Col N="1072" /> with the Office of Public Works.  That is why I could not support the Minister's amendments Nos. 7, 8, 11 and 12.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me be straight about this.  The Office of Public Works has property owning and management functions.  One can take the view that that being the case one therefore must keep the Heritage Council weak.  I take the view that the Heritage Council must enjoy the same statutory certainty, the same corporate possibilities, the same capacity as other bodies such as the Arts Council, Bord na Gaeilge and others that I have not mentioned.  There is a case, that can be easily disposed of, that it must be kept inherently weak because of the existence of the Office of Public Works.  That is to overstate the concern and anxiety that might be felt.  This is a good and necessary balance.  Deputies cannot have it every way.  They ask, on the one hand, that the council be able to operate effectively.  Providing it with resources is another matter, but it must have the capacity to operate effectively. If, for example, somebody wanted to leave a significant building or estate to the people through the Heritage Council, we should not prohibit that by Statute on the basis that it may upset an extreme view of the Office of Public Work's powers and intentions.  I am quite convinced that the council needs these powers and that is why I must press this group of amendments.</P>

      <P>I indicated at the outset that although I disagreed with the manner in which this group of amendments were introduced, I had no difficulty with the substance of the amendments.  On Second Stage I pointed to inherent weaknesses in the Bill, including the fact that the council did not have the functions it is being given by these amendments. This is a move in the right direction and gives the Heritage Council greater functions than it had under the Bill as initially drafted, and that is important if it is to achieve its aims and objectives as opposed to being like a good mother-in-law telling everybody <Col N="1073" /> how to run the house but having no further function or authority.  I support each of these amendments.  As a result of them we will have a much better Bill. They contain elements of arguments that I made on Second Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to emphasise that it is not my intention to keep the Heritage Council weak.  That was a rather emotive way of putting it.  I come back to what I believe to be the kernel of the argument, that giving such powers to the Heritage Council would simply be duplicating existing arrangements with the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDHiggins" hpid="Mr. M. Higgins Mr. M. Higgins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not for a second impute anything other than concern for efficiency to the spokesperson opposite, Deputy de Valera.  However, I make this point because it is a very important one.  We are faced with a choice.  Having decided to have a heritage regime with heritage legislation and a Heritage Council which will be strong, I want to stress that all that has been given the Heritage Council are such powers as other statutory bodies have.  One can come at it the other way and say that because the Office of Public Works exists, and it is a State property management body, that no one else should have the right to be given a gift of property, to acquire property or to manage property, etc.  It is entirely proper that the Office of Public Works carry out its functions, but you could not interpret that in such a way that the Heritage Council should be at a disadvantage compared to another statutory body in regard to our heritage.  I have been through this argument before and I am convinced, the Heritage Council can have these powers without it interfering with the Office of Public Works in any way.  It certainly will not conflict with the role of that body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us suppose that after having accepted this it transpired not to be so, the council is restricted by the way that I have given it this right and must comply with &ldquo;such directions as may be given to <Col N="1074" /> it by the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Finance&rdquo;.  In order to exercise its functions with regard to property the council would have had to have a direction from me and I would have had to consult with the Minister for Finance.  It would be only reasonable to expect the Minister for Finance of the day if there was a gross duplication of functions to take cognisance of the views of other relevant State agencies.  I am happy that this will not interfere in any way but, equally, I am certain that the Heritage Council is the stronger and more certain of its territory.  It will simply have the same rights as the other bodies I mentioned such as, the Arts Council. Bord na Gaeilge and others.</P>
    <P>I hope I have made the case for these amendments.</P>

      <P>In page 7, subsection (3) (b), line 14, after &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, including educational bodies,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I hope I am not talking to myself again in moving this amendment.  I must be part of the &ldquo;write it down school&rdquo; as the way to get things done and I am seeking to include a provision that deals with the functions of the council.  In section 6 (3) I am seeking to insert in paragraph (b) after the word &ldquo;authorities&rdquo; the words &ldquo;including educational bodies&rdquo;.  I appeal to the Minister to accept my amendment.  I have two reasons for specifically wanting the words &ldquo;including educational bodies&rdquo; inserted.  When I speak about educational bodies I have in mind curriculum development units as part of the public education process because if we are to have new heritage legislation and if its aims and objectives are to be met we need to ensure that a generation understand and appreciate their heritage much better than is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not unusual to see fine pieces of our heritage despoiled for commercial gain or defaced by young people who clearly do not understand their importance and who due to the lack in their education do not have any sense of identification with these objects of our heritage.  For that reason they tend to want to vandalise them or despoil them in some way.  That is a great pity but it is a product of the way we teach civic responsibility and history in the educational system.  I taught history for years and if I had my time all over again I would have an entirely different approach to teaching that subject.  I could describe every battle in the Thirty Years' War culminating in the Treaty of Wesphalia in 1648 and reproduce it for my exam but there were whole areas of local history about which I knew nothing.  Perhaps the fault was mine and I did not have the inquiring mind that I <Col N="1076" /> ought to have had but whatever the reason I knew very little about local history. I also had very little knowledge of archaeology and not a great appreciation of it but in our home there was a great appreciation of the items we talk about here when we discuss heritage.  If it were not for the great work done by local voluntary historical or archaeological groups a good deal of what is important to us today would have been lost entirely.  Great credit is due to such groups and I pay tribute to them this afternoon.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there has been a vast improvement in the history courses that are now taught in school.  However, for a body as set out in the original terms of the Bill to be a policy making body it ought to seek to influence and inform the curriculum development units of education so that future courses will at least embody elements of heritage which could be acknowledged as examination subjects.  We should try to instil in young Irish people a greater awareness, appreciation and identification with their heritage.  When you travel around the country it is not unusual to meet young Germans who know a great deal more about the background and history to some of the ruins and monuments than Irish people of their generation would know.  For example, if you visit Sceilig Mhicil or one of these great monuments any day during the summer, invariably you will find that you are the only Irish person on the rock on that given day.  That tells its own tale.  If the aims and objectives of the Bill are to be met we have to instil in the next generation and, indeed, in all our citizens a greater sense of respect for and responsibility for the preservation and protection of heritage items.  For that reason I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    <P>Another important point is that with the growth of all these new type heritage centres around the country there is a danger that a number of people who work in those centres will not be fully appraised of the importance of the items that are entrusted in their care and will <Col N="1077" /> have a very superficial understanding of heritage items.  For that reason they will be in a poor position to explain and interpret the items.  I know this is an issue between the personnel of the National Museum and those who seek to appoint staff for the new heritage centres.  Those who work in heritage centres ought to have a deep and clear understanding of the importance of the items entrusted to their care.  I would argue that people should be educated about their heritage at an early stage and then develop their knowledge in a more structured and professional way. This would lead to more employment in heritage centres which should be staffed by people who have the same knowledge and understanding of our heritage as the present staff in the National Museum and other museums.</P>
    <P>I would like to forge an active bond between the new body and educational authorities.  It is important to mention educational authorities because when we mention public authorities people think of local government, county councils, regional bodies and so on but do not include educational bodies.  I appeal to the Minister to take this amendment on board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SiledeValera" hpid="Miss de Valera Miss de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Miss de Valera</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not agree more with the sentiments expressed by Deputy Quill.  I too, was a history teacher before I was elected to Dáil Éireann and share many of the views she expressed on the history curriculum. There is a greater emphasis now on local history and young children can participate in projects.  Perhaps the Minister would have further consultations with the Minister for Education on this area.  Not only must we educate young people to have a love and respect for our heritage at an early stage but adults must be given an opportunity to expand their knowledge of what heritage means.  In this age of materialism everything has a price.  However, some things are beyond price and our heritage is one of them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pay tribute, as did Deputy Quill, to local historical and archaeological <Col N="1078" /> societies.  There is a very active one in Ennis.  They play a part in heightening awareness of the importance of our heritage.  Our heritage should not be seen as elitist &mdash; something for the few who have time to enjoy it.  It is something to which we all have an equal claim.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am influenced by the arguments made.  The argument I made previously was that the specific mention of items in the Bill could be interpreted as excluding others.  I am satisfied that does not arise here.  One could argue that public authorities includes educational bodies but I do not think it is a strong argument.  The principle of having a link with education is important.</P>
      <P>As worded, the amendment refers to educational bodies and would be limited to educational bodies which are public authorities.  I undertake to bring in an amendment on Report Stage which will embrace the principle in a way which will not restrict them to being public bodies.  There is State education, private education and voluntary education and I want to find a form of words which will be all embracing.  I undertake to do that on Report Stage and implement the principle of amendment No. 10.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I argued on Second Stage that this body ought to report back not later than six months, ought to be accountable to this <Col N="1080" /> House in some way and that those of us who played our part in the formulation of this Bill have a right to know how it is working in practice.  We can ascertain whether it is achieving its aims by reading an annual report rather than tabling sporadic questions to the Minister at Question Time, some of which may never be taken.  If necessary we can initiate a debate on the report and formulate questions on its contents.</P>
    <P>It is more important than ever since new powers are being given today that we specify that the Council shall report back within six months of the end of any financial year.  Anybody that cannot report back within that time cannot be seen to be carrying out its duties efficiently and well.  It is very reasonable to request that the Council report back within six months of the end of any given financial year.</P>

Should the accounts not be ready, should one then delay the report thereon?  What this is doing is isolating the principle of financial accountability.</P>
      <P>This is a good amendment, which I accept.  It is only reasonable that the Council should be obliged to submit their accounts to the Comptroller and Auditor General not later than six months after the end of any given financial year.</P>

      <P>This amendment to paragraph 1 (1) of the Schedule provides that the council will consist of, in addition to a chairperson, a minimum number of 14 ordinary council members.  This is a technical amendment which will remove a potential anomaly, in that paragraph 1 (1) of the Schedule provides for a maximum of 16, but no specific minimum number, of ordinary council members in addition to a chairperson, whereas paragraph 2 (1) of the Schedule &mdash; which, similar to the Broadcasting (Amendment) Act, 1993, provides for an equal gender balance &mdash; assumes that the council will have at least a total membership of 14 as it provides for the appointment of at least seven men and seven women.

      <P>This amendment amends paragraph 6 (5) of the Schedule to provide that the council may continue to act, notwithstanding vacancies in its membership which include vacancies resulting in the gender balance requirements of paragraph 2 (1) of the Schedule not being complied with &mdash; that is, vacancies resulting in fewer than seven men and seven women being members of the council.  This is to ensure that vacancies in council membership resulting in a breach of those gender balance requirements will not prevent the council from acting, pending the filling of such vacancies.</P>
      <P>The amendment is similar to the provision in section 10 (5) of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, which was inserted in section 71 (1) (b) of the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1993, where I also legislated for gender equality.</P>

      <P>Crime has reached crisis level in many parts of Dublin with which I am familiar.  This has not happened in the past six weeks or in the past two years, it probably happened during the past 20 years as society has adopted a do-good liberal trend and we <Col N="1089" /> seem to be over concerned with civil liberties. We are still going down this road and if we were seen to have turned the corner there would be hope for many people who are oppressed and afraid in their homes.</P>
      <P>Since the Minister assumed office six weeks ago, we have had the biggest robbery in the history of the State, a man has been kicked to death and a journalist has been shot.  All three events happened close to each other in the north side of Dublin.  People are shocked by these events and by other events which have been made public. Last week we had the argument as to whether the Garda have specific information in relation to the robbery, whether they had surveillance on the premises or whether they fell for the dummy signals given by the criminals while they were having their surveillance at another premises.  People look to the Minister for hope, answers and reassurance.  Slagging Members on this side of the House, be they backbenchers or Members of the Front Bench will not get you anywhere.  The comments about Deputy O'Dea last night were totally unjustified.  During the past two years while he was Minister of State at the Department of Justice much new legislation was introduced but its balance has been all wrong.</P>

      <P>The Department of Justice has been very good at producing legislation but it does not seem to solve the problem.  While the Garda are getting new powers and while resources and technology are being made available to them the criminals are modernising at a faster rate.  Every time legislation is put on the Statute Book &mdash; This was referred to last night &mdash; there is a campaign immediately by people both inside and outide this House to have it watered down.  This is a problem for the Department of Justice.  I will not criticise the Department for bringing forward legislation but I accept that a group is demanding civil liberties for criminals and the balance is wrong.  We have to tilt that balance in the direction of protection for the ordinary God fearing, genuine citizen.</P>
      <P>During the past 25 years we accepted that large Garda resources had been tied up with the problems in the North. I received a reply to a parliamentary question last week from the Minister in which she gave me the current establishment of the Garda in a number of counties. In Donegal there are 473 gardaí, in Carlow there are 62, in counties Cavan, Monaghan and Louth there are 200-plus in each county, in Kilkenny there are 95 and in Laois there are 187 &mdash; that number is probably due in large measure to Portlaoise Prison.  It is obvious that Garda resources have been concentrated in certain counties.</P>
      <P>We are five months into the ceasefire and it is about time Garda resources were moved from those counties to certain parts of Dublin where they are needed.  I accept there may be problems for some gardaí and that there may be a problem with property values in certain northern counties.  That is another problem. There is no point in having so many gardaí in those northern counties if the security problem there no longer exists.  They should be moved to parts of the country and Dublin city where they are needed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of drug related crime is one which I have consistently raised in this House during recent years.  I regret that the heroin problem has never been given the priority it deserves from Government. The former Minister began to take the problem seriously but up until then resources were scandalously inadequate. Despite that I believe the heroin trade is virtually out of control simply because it was confined to poor areas of this city and allowed to fester there for too long.</P>
      <P>I pointed out what I regard as some basic facts.  All the main heroin dealers-suppliers are known to the Garda. Clearly it is difficult to get evidence that will convict these people.  Meanwhile, they accumulate huge sums of money in bank accounts and invest in property, some even continue to claim social welfare. It is vital to concentrate additional Garda resources specifically on the heroin dealers and to set up a task force of Garda, the special investigation branch of the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social Welfare to see whether existing powers can be used against their undeclared and illegal income.  The question must be asked why this has not been done.  I have never heard that question answered adequately.</P>
      <P>I am speaking here about the north inner city.  It is important to point out that the main suppliers do not use drugs. In two instances they are prominently involved in different types of sporting activities.  They are the picture of health and fitness in their respectable roles in sport while they inflict misery and cause death to young people and even children of the inner city.  This is not sensationalist speculation, and there has been much of that in recent times.  It has been established by the Garda in the last two to three years, yet these people walk about freely flaunting their wealth. In recent months the Garda has had some significant successes but this merely reflects how widespread the problem has become.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest caution regarding the recent <Col N="1092" /> Brinks Allied robbery.  It is one thing to identify heroin dealers after years of drug dealing when the dogs in the street know who they are, but it is quite another to, within hours or less of a major robbery, leak to the media details of individuals, claiming with apparent certainly that they were responsible.  I do not know who was responsible or what evidence exists for this speculation but I have been long enough around to remember the Sallins train robbery when the Garda claimed to know with certainty who the culprits were.  I do not have to remind anyone here of the Nicky Kelly case and its outcome.  The immediate certainty with which all the newspapers reported the day after this crime has some parallels at least with that case &mdash; I hope it will not be a complete parallel.  Everybody should be more responsible and cautious about major crimes such as this.</P>
    <P>Much has been said recently and rightly so, about freedom of the press.  I fully support and welcome investigative journalism provided it is responsible and accurate.  I have been concerned in the last six to eight months about media reports in which identifiable individuals have been linked to specific murders despite the fact that all available evidence suggested that the persons referred to were not involved.  In one instance about six months ago I felt obliged to write to the editor of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> outlining my concerns about articles written on a high profile murder.  I even contacted the editor's office and explained my views and concerns, but the <i>Sunday Independent</i> did not see fit to publish my letter, even though the articles related to the area I represent.  Such serious matters require responsibility from all of us.  I felt I was acting with responsibility on that occasion, but clearly the editorial staff of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> did not accept that.</P>
    <P>In the short time available to me I wanted to use the opportunity to refer to those issues.  I know I can only refer briefly to them and perhaps not develop them as I would like.  The one problem <Col N="1093" /> in this city about which I am almost tired speaking &mdash; up to very recently I think nobody was listening &mdash; is the problem of heroin and the effect it has on whole communities and on crime in this city.  It seems extraordinary that when attention is attracted to this matter and specific individuals are known to be organising such crime on a daily and weekly basis, the resources are not applied to hound those individuals and at least make it extremely difficult for them to continue to operate.  This is a relatively small country with a small population in terms of the international drugs scene and if resources were made available and priority given to deal with the heroin problem it could be more effectively dealt with.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil motion before the House amounts to nothing more than an admission of failure by that party, a failure over seven years in Government on its own and in successive coalitions with the Progressive Democrats and the Labour Party to deal adequately with crime.  It is a capitulation, a confiteor for once by the Fianna Fáil Party.  More than that, this motion is an opportunistic exploitation of three crimes which took place this month, a cynical manoeuvre in which Fianna Fáil has been enthusiastically and stridently supported by Deputy Mary Harney.  We have heard about the Brinks Allied robbery, the outrageous attack on Veronica Guerin and the vicious murder of a man in Fairview, but we heard nothing about the murder of The General in Ranelagh a few months ago, the murder outside a leisure centre in Crumlin last year or a spate of sexual crimes, to mention a few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of Fianna Fáil were silent about the performance of Deputy Máire <Col N="1094" /> Geoghegan-Quinn at the time those crimes took place.  We heard very little from Deputy Mary Harney then.  Was the reason simply that nobody slipped her a copy of an internal Garda memorandum about any one of those crimes which she could subsequently wave about and misrepresent in this House and on the airwaves?  Is that why, in not a single one of those other cases, Deputy Harney did not put forward the revoltingly dishonest pretence that this House is another part of the State's machinery for investigating crime?</P>
    <P>This motion calls for additional legislative measures, but what are they?  We still do not know.  Deputy O'Donoghue made a number of speeches in this House and on television and radio and he sounded as if he had learned every one of them off by heart, but at no point did he specify the additional legislation he wants.  It was left to Deputy Haughey last night to mutter darkly about changing the law on the right to silence. Deputy O'Dea last night, in a performance that was worthy of Groucho Marx, informed us that everybody knows who carried out the Brinks Allied robbery, as if it were enough for him to say that in order for the whole matter to be resolved.  Even Deputy Bertie Ahern in this House last night, to his utter discredit, talked about the northside of Dublin being awash with rumours, implying that if those rumours were acted upon, crime would be solved.  If Deputy Ahern had any decency he must have felt sick last night when the Minister for Justice debunked a whole series of rumours one after the other.</P>
    <P>I watched Deputies on the Opposition benches last night as they listened to the Minister for Justice talking about another one of these rumours, that the Brinks Allied company was alerted not by its own staff but by somebody else. The Minister pointed out that the Garda indicated that statement was untrue and said she did not wish to be tied to that at this point as a statement of fact.  The Opposition thought it had hit a nugget, but what the Minister was saying, which the Deputies opposite should know, was <Col N="1095" /> that that could not be confirmed until the company concluded its investigation. Until that point, that is simply another rumour.  Thank God the Garda has more sense than to shoot its mouth off in public about a major investigation on the basis of rumours.</P>
    <P>If members of the Fianna Fáil Party spent less of their time, like members of the Progressive Democrats, listening to backstairs title tattle and trying to make a federal case out of it, we might make more progress in resolving these crimes.  It is clear from the performance of all the Deputies on the Opposition who spoke about this issue in recent days that not a single one of them could be trusted to get to the bottom of the theft of a biscuit from the cookie jar in their own kitchens.</P>
    <P>What changes does the Opposition want in the law?  A change in respect of the right to silence of persons suspected of or charged with crimes, extra powers for the Garda to detain suspected persons or changes in the law on bail?  If it wants these changes, is it seriously suggesting that the need for them came about only after 16 December last? Does the Progressive Democrats Party really believe that this is the case?  It is stretching credulity a bit far to suggest that even Deputy O'Donoghue believes that.  However, he is good at putting a face on it when he has learned the lines.</P>
    <P>What are the facts?  Fianna Fáil in Government over the past seven years refused to change the law on bail and refused numerous requests in this House from the then Opposition, including the Progressive Democrats, to change it.  I am sad to see the Progressive Democrats moving back into the wake of Fianna Fáil &mdash; it will be back with that party in no time.</P>
    <P>The other matters I raised came before this House during the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill in 1983.  On 9 November 1983 Deputy David Andrews stated at column 1935 of the Official Report: &ldquo;there is no evidence that the police are, in fact, hampered to any great degree by the exercise of the right <Col N="1096" /> to silence&rdquo;.  He quoted authoritative grounds for that statement.  At column 258 of the Official Report for 4 December 1983 Willie O'Dea described the Criminal Justice Bill, which at that stage proposed changes in the right to silence and other matters to which I referred, as &ldquo;the most insidious and far-reaching erosion of personal liberties since the foundation of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>He had not thought of junkie junction at that stage.  On the same day Deputy Harney, Politically correct even then, warned us against making facile statements about law and order issues and stated, at column 281, that &ldquo;Powerful law and order speeches by politicians are always guaranted to get a few votes&rdquo;.  It is said, tagann ciall le haois.  I am very much afraid that Deputy Harney seems to have reversed that process.  Her statement at that time contrasts very sharply with her unprincipled stand of today.  On the same day at column 808 she said: &ldquo;Our legal system has one very good provision, that is, that a person is innocent until proven guilty.  That is fundamental to our legal and judicial process&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>During his contribution on the Act of 18 January 1984 &mdash; columns 270-77&mdash; Deputy Bertie Ahern expressed concerns about provisions in the Bill concerning detention.  He worried about the possibility of the Bill giving rise to Garda harassment of some of his constituents &mdash; he did not seem to be worried about anybody else at that time.  He seems to have stopped worrying about that now.  The Minister for Justice correctly pointed out last night that when it comes to the crunch it becomes &ldquo;notoriously difficult to secure wide support&rdquo; for changes in the law of the kind very darkly and obliquely hinted at by Fianna Fáil in the House last night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In recent days Fianna Fáil speakers have inveighed against the facility which accused persons have in our system to ensure they are defended by the best <Col N="1097" /> legal brains in the land at the expense of the taxpayer.  Deputy O'Donoghue and others have engaged in this.  It is worth recalling that during the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill in July 1993 Deputy Woods proposed a Report Stage amendment &ldquo;to provide legal aid for persons detained pursuant to section 4 of that Bill so that persons who do not have the means to engage a solicitor shall be able to do so&rdquo;.  Curiously enough, his amendment provided for no means test.  He did not propose that accused persons should be asked if they had any money at the laundry before they got legal aid out of which they could afford to pay for their defence.</P>
    <P>I strongly believe &mdash; I hope members of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats will take this to heart &mdash; that the interests of justice will not be served by knee-jerk and unspecific motions such as the one put down by Fianna Fáil.  Neither will it be served by what I can only describe as the most revoltingly histrionic cynical comments by Deputy Harney who seems to be much more concerned with the drafting and publication of Garda memoranda than with action to apprehend criminals.  Justice will be far better served by a clear headed Minister for Justice who refuses to prejudice the course of Garda investigation but who can be relied upon to support and equip the Garda in a manner fitting to the demands of equity, democracy and efficiency.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, has inherited the most difficult of all Departments.  During the past seven years we had high profile initiatives, photocalls, announcements of taskforces, new management structures and reorganisation, tape cutting ceremonies, structures and decisions.  Yet at the end of the day the crime problem has spiralled out of control. The Minister for Justice is expected by the Opposition to have prescribed the necessary medicine to heal all the ills in this area during her six weeks in office.</P>
      <P>All one has to do is walk down Grafton Street, Henry Street or any of the once friendly shopping thorough fares in Dublin and other towns to see that shops have become like fortresses, with their windows no longer visible, and houses and domestic dwellings ringed in steel.  Entire pages of the daily newspapers are devoted to court cases and graphic descriptions are given of the most preverted crimes such as child sex abuse and physical violence against the elderly and others.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gregory referred to the drugs scene in his constituency.  There has been a massive increase in the drugs problem over the past seven years.  As a result of the way in which the market has been flooded, a fix of heroin, ecstasy, cannabis or cocaine is now half the price it was a few years ago.  The age threshold for drug addiction is now as low as the early teens.  As Deputy Ring <Col N="1099" /> said, rural Ireland has fallen prey to raids by people from Dublin who have crossed the Shannon before the crime is even detected.  If the Government does nothing other than smash the drug scene in Dublin it will have made a worthwhile contribution.</P>
    <P>Our jails are bursting at the seams and one quarter of the inmates are under 21 years.  It is a case of the age old principle of put them away with little rehabilitation and any attempt at reform being considered solely in terms of cost.  Our jails have become universities of crime.  That is the scenario the Minister has inherited.  That is the legacy of seven years of Fianna Fáil promises and inaction in the Department of Justice, the mess which the Minister must clean up.</P>
    <P>The Brinks Allied raid was undoubtedly a long time in the course of planning. It is very interesting to listen to the Fianna Fáil accusations about money laundering when the person generally perceived and reported in the weekend papers as being at the centre of the crime has been at large &mdash; the authorities know this &mdash; for the past seven years or so.</P>
    <P>Although he was under Garda surveillance the previous Administration failed to put a finger on him or obtain any conclusive evidence to put him and his associates where they belong.  It is ironic that the tax amnesty which we said at the time was a classic charter for tax cheats and criminals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In June 1993 thugs who raided a building society not far from where Deputy Ryan resides in this city were duly arrested but not charged.  On the <Col N="1100" /> same day they attacked the same building society a second time, were apprehended when in possession of a few thousand pounds and released.  They have yet to come before the courts.</P>
    <P>Some of the people involved in this crime have been in and out of prison on a regular basis.  It is clear the existing powers need to be strengthened to allow the Garda and the courts enforce the law.</P>
    <P>The Brinks Allied raid must be viewed in the context to the massive profits being made by the banks and financial institutions and the paltry contribution they make towards the cost of the protection of their core business. The banks, building societies, financial institutions and security firms must bear a greater share of the security costs and put their own house in order.  No one denies private commercial enterprise the right to make a profit; last year AIB made a profit of £330 million and the Bank of Ireland £290 million.  These are enormous sums of money when viewed against the contribution of £500,000 this sector makes towards the cost of State security.  It should have to carry a greater share of the responsibility.  Like every small shopkeeper, they should be compelled to present a security plan which should be subject to Garda inspection and modification if deemed to be inadequate.</P>
    <P>The transportation of money between financial institutions should be financed primarily by the financial institutions and not by the taxpayer who should not be expected to bear such a high percentage of the cost of such security when the institutions in question make enormous profits, considerably in excess of the norm in other countries.  I wish to see proportionality in terms of the enormous profits made, ability to pay and the task to be undertaken by the Garda and security forces.  The financial institutions should be made to pay a fair percentage of the profits they earn towards the cost.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity to wish Veronica Guerin, a constituent of <Col N="1101" /> mine, a full and speedy recovery following the vicious and cowardly attack that took place in her home on Monday last. Not only was this an attack on Miss Guerin, it was also an attack on free speech, the cornerstone of our democratic system.  Notwithstanding the differences in approach which have emerged during the course of this debate it is vital that this House sends a strong message that this type of gansterism is unacceptable and that the full resources of the State will be used to apprehend those responsible and put the criminals out of circulation for a long time.</P>
      <P>I wish to address the increasing drug problem within our community.  I must admit that I was taken aback by the extent to which drugs are readily available throughout my constituency.  I recently met a number of young people who outlined in a very graphic way the extent to which drugs are readily available to our youth, some as young as 12 and 13 years of age and school-going. They were also able to identify the pushers, the locations and times. However, they were unwilling to inform the Garda for fear of retaliation.</P>
      <P>It is clear we will have to build a better relationship between our youth and the Garda.  The pushers do not care about the damage they are inflicting on our children, in many cases leading them into a life of crime.  This scandal must be addressed.  I hope the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, will respond to this serious issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like most other constituencies, the level of petty crime in Dublin North has increased to such an extent that many business people are warning that the crime levels are posing a threat to their livelihoods and jobs.  The Dublin area is under-policed relative to the rest of the country.  I appeal to the Minister to provide additional Garda resources.  My constituents are demanding a greater Garda presence, be it in Portmarnock, Malahide, Swords or Lusk.  In order to provide these resources additional funding will be required.  I hope that Deputy Harney and her party, the Progressive <Col N="1102" /> Democrats, will acknowledge this when calling for cuts in public spending.</P>
    <P>Juveniles commit one-third of all crimes and have a high propensity to reoffend.  The reason juvenile crime is such a problem is that there is a lack of adequate places of detention.  I hope this matter can be dealt with.</P>
    <P>On the causes of crime, we must get tough.  The lack of employment and community facilities must be addressed if we are to encourage young people to move away from a life of crime.  Funding for our youths services will have to be increased.  It should be borne in mind that it costs £500 per week to keep a juvenile offender in custody.  We must provide community facilities, create long term jobs and discriminate in favour of those living in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I wish my constituency colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, every success in her new post.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKenny" hpid="Mr. S. Kenny Mr. S. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I deplore the vicious and brutal attack on Veronica Guerin and wish her a speedy recovery.  In supporting the Government amendment I wish to refer briefly to the report of the Commission on Crime in Dublin, chaired by Judge Moriarty, which was presented in the Mansion House yesterday. It deals mainly with Dublin Corporation housing estates, although crime is by no means confined or limited to such schemes.</P>
      <P>The report concluded that bad urban physical planning, such as the shape of housing estates, street and road layouts and the lack of recreational facilities, is a major contributory factor.  It also concluded that laneways which were once considered amenities have become havens for anti-social behaviour and the scourge of residents.</P>
      <P>Housing estate management was considered by the commission and the decentralisation of housing services was recommended.  The commission found on its visits to certain estates that a constant theme was the trauma caused by intimidation and anti-social behaviour. The report stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1103" /> Indeed, for many citizens this form of crime impinges more than any other on daily life and is the most urgent problem related to crime which needs to be tackled.  We have encountered chilling instances of physical violence, property damage, constant threats and harassment brought to bear particularly upon females who are active in representative associations.</P>
    <P>On the question of harassment, the report stated that it is primarily the Garda operating within the legal system which is responsible for the protection of citizens.  If it is unable to deal with intimidation it is wishful thinking to expect the local authority to solve something which is basically a matter of law and order.</P>
    <P>The report recommended that a special team headed by a senior officer be set up by Dublin Corporation to improve control of housing estates and the setting up of a confidential telephone by the corporation to deal with complaints of harassment and intimidation. The report found that 80 per cent of indicatable crime in the Dublin Circuit Court was drug related.  Because of the impact of drugs on crime, priority must be given to a review of the integrated roles of all the relevant agencies.</P>
    <P>In dealing with the drug problem, there should be greater availability of public residential treatment centres and a specific treatment and rehabilitative structure established within the prison system.  The report recommended that the recent Garda activity in the locations known to be focal points of drug dealing should be expanded and increased resources be directed towards detection and bringing to justice the major importers and distributors of drugs.  It is important that the vigilance and commitment of the Medical Council in policing the prescription of drugs be maintained and intensified.</P>
    <P>On policing, the report recommends that the Garda review facilities for <Col N="1104" /> receiving reports, complaints and information from the public by telephone and that a system be introduced to provide information to victims of crime regarding the progress in dealing with their cases; that the non-policing duties currently undertaken by the gardaí be civilianised and that a new concept of a mobile garda station be considered because the community needs the reassurance of a strong garda presence when necessary.</P>
    <P>In Denmark, a crime prevention council was set up in 1971 representing a wide range of interests from both the public and private sector which provides a forum for discussion of current issues with regard to crime and initiates practical activities which help to reduce crime. A body on broadly similar lines, called the national crime council, should be set up in this State.</P>

      <P>I listened carefully to the debate last night.  Fianna Fáil has not only exposed the incompetence and inadequacies of the Government's handling of this crisis but it also put forward specific proposals which we ask the Minister to take on board.  Last night I found the Minister's explanation of the Brinks-Allied raid inadequate, although I wish her well in her new portfolio.  According to the Minister last night, the Garda Commissioner said that gardaí had information that there would be an attack but their intelligence as to the timing and target had been incorrect.  I find that explanation quite vague&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

Does the Minister expect these criminals to fax information to the gardaí with maps, dates and the times of proposed raids?  Why does she continue to hide behind these vague statements? Perhaps we will hear a little more about that.</P>

      <P>I can only reply to the Minister's speech of last night.  The robbery at the Brinks Allied premises &mdash; followed by the shooting of Veronica Guerin &mdash; which has been described as the worst in the history of the State has exposed the whole issue of security and law and order in a way that it has never been exposed previously.  Deputy Dukes talked about Fianna Fáil's response but if Deputy Dukes or the Minister Deputy Owen were on this side of the House they would ask many questions, which is in the spirit of democracy.</P>
      <P>Every Deputy in this House will agree that crime is the most serious issue facing us, particularly in Dublin.  Our elderly citizens are very concerned about this and it is appropriate that we have a comprehensive debate on this issue in this House.</P>
      <P>In the aftermath of the Brinks Allied raid and the shooting of Veronica Guerin many people are wondering who is in charge and who is setting the agenda.  It is unfortunate that the gangland criminals appear to have free rein and the Government must take control.</P>
      <P>I wish to make a number of specific recommendations in this regard.  Two years ago, an advisory committee on fraud, chaired by Peter Maguire SC, made a series of sweeping recommendations on which there has been no follow up.  I would accept that whereas we introduced some legislation, more could have been done in this area.  We have no comprehensive fraud Act covering all types of fraud.  Fraud, in whatever shape or form, must be made an offence.  There have been various Bills through the years dealing with fraud but that legislation has never been consolidated and I am asking the Minister to do that in a comprehensive way.  In 1872 we had the Debtors (Ireland) Act, in 1878 there was the Falsification of Accounts Act, in 1871 we had the Larceny Act and the Forgery Act was introduced in 1930.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A special fraud section in the Garda should have investigating teams that would include lawyers and accountants because of the sophistication of the <Col N="1107" /> types of fraud now being committed.  To put it simply, the financial expertise of the authorities should at least be as good as, if not better, than that of the gangsters.</P>
    <P>I support the calls made here for more gardaí on the beat because of the general fear on the streets, but this crime is one of great magnitude and sophistication.  The £3 million stolen in the Brinks Allied raid will not be put under somebody's mattress.  Attempts will be made, and probably are being made as we speak, to process the money through investment, property or accountancy mechanisms.  That is why the gardaí must be given back-up support of lawyers and accountants in eliminating these fraudulent activities.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to show a greater sense of urgency in bringing into effect the provisions of section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1994 so as to prevent money laundering operations which obviously will follow from this raid.  As the Minister is aware, it is difficult for a garda to get a search warrant where a person is suspected of fraud. This matter should be pursued by the Minister.  There is no effective legal means whereby the gardaí can freeze or seize the proceeds of last week's robbery if they suspect them to be held in a financial institution.  The gardaí should have this power and, as Deputy O'Donoghue said, we will introduce a Bill to give this power to the gardaí if the Minister chooses not to do so.</P>
    <P>The drugs issue has been referred to and I know my colleagues intend to refer to it also.  The Brinks-Allied raid has exposed the inadequacies of security systems and Brinks-Allied has many questions to answer.  I propose that licensing of security firms and the imposition, on a statutory basis, of standards for transit handling and storage of cash be introduced.  I also question the suitability of an industrial estate as the location for storing large amounts of cash.  Surely in the times we live in and <Col N="1108" /> with the level of intelligence the criminal fraternity has, it would be appropriate to have one or two holding points for the greater Dublin area which would have the highest possible degree of security.  The Minister should take this on board and the issue should be addressed in a co-ordinated way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvorCallely" hpid="Mr. Callely Mr. Callely">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to Deputies Dukes and Higgins who referred to the previous Minister for Justice who had one of the most outstanding records of introducing wide-ranging legislation.  However, on nearly every occasion when legislation was introduced Fine Gael opposed its introduction. It may have acknowledged the legislation as sensible but voted against it.  I have no doubt Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn would have introduced even more legislation had she been given the opportunity.  Unfortunately, the Labour Party pulled the plug and she was unable to do so.  It cannot be overstated that to reduce crime the Government must introduce legislation.</P>
      <P>In regard to the recent serious crimes, I agree with what has been said about Veronica Guerin.  She is a personal friend so I will do no more than echo what has already been said.  I hope she will have a speedy recovery and be able to continue her successful career in journalism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the crime committed against Veronica Guerin and the tragic murder of Mr. Hurley, who was kicked to death in Fairview Park, the biggest ever raid in the history of the State was carried out at Brinks-Allied in Clonshaugh. All of these crimes took place within a three mile radius.  It is alarming that such serious crimes were committed within such a small radius in such a short time.  It raises a number of questions the Minister should answer.  What role does the Minister envisage the Garda and the Army playing, particularly in regard to the services offered to security firms?  Current legislation must respond to the threat posed by organised crime whether those crimes are perpetrated by paramilitaries or by <Col N="1109" /> criminal gangs.  Where does the Coalition Government stand on the issue of crime prevention?  Are we to be assured that the enforcement of law and order in Ireland is a priority?  Are we to witness reactive rather than pro-active policies? What measures does the Minister intend to introduce?</P>
    <P>I wholeheartedly support the motion of my friend and colleague, Deputy John O'Donoghue, and the Government amendment is admirable, but it is vague.  What does the Minister mean by &ldquo;all necessary resources&rdquo;?  The Book of Estimates provides for a 2 per cent increase in Garda salaries.  That does not meet inflation or public pay recommendations. Is the Minister talking about reducing Garda numbers in 1995?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Callely</NameTxt>
      <P>Drug related crime is probably our biggest problem not alone in Dublin but in urban areas generally. Is the Minister serious about addressing drug related crime?  There is one area in which the Minister has a figure on the pulse, where she can make immediate changes.  I refer to people in prison because of drug related crime who are able to obtain drugs freely within the prison system.  That is known by the Minister and by the Governors of the prisons.  When asked why they do not take action to prevent the free availability of drugs in prisons, the response has been that it would take draconian measures to do so.  I do not care what draconian measures are necessary but I would welcome an answer from the Minister about what action she will take to stop it and when she intends to take such action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EoinRyan" hpid="Mr. E. Ryan Mr. E. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I too join with others in wishing Veronica Guerin a speedy recovery.  Like Deputy Callely, I know her and hope she will be back at her job, which she does so well, as quickly as possible.  I also take this opportunity of wishing the Minister well.  She has had a particularly difficult time since she took <Col N="1110" /> over the Justice portfolio.  It is a very difficult portfolio.  As her predecessor showed, one has to be extremely tough to take on the Department of Justice.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen is extremely loyal to her colleagues in Government, but until a few minutes ago there was nobody from among them here to sit beside her.  That is a strange way to treat somebody who is under a lot of pressure.  The remarks made by a Government backbencers, Deputy Eric Byrne, were extremely unhelpful.  For anybody in Government to say that the Garda are a laughing stock is to undermine them.  The vast majority of gardaí are fine, hard-working people.  They may make mistakes but their record on crime prevention and on solving crime is not bad.  For anybody in the Government to say they are a laughing stock sends out a misleading message to the public and, unfortunately, nowadays preception can become a reality.  Like others, I have had telephone calls from my constituents who feel that the Garda have let them down.  However, one must look at these things in an overall context.  Some things may need to be changed in the Garda Síochána but a statement like Deputy Byrne's is extremely damaging and dangerous.</P>
      <P>On many occasions I raised with the previous Minister for Justice the subject of the drug problem in the inner city which is part of my constituency, and she came into the constituency to see the problem.  Drugs related crime is a huge problem worldwide and the Minister will face great difficulty in tackling it here.  Is it any wonder that drugs get a hold in inner city areas where unemployment is high?  There has been huge neglect of our inner cities and in parts of my constituency there are no facilities. The children have nothing to do so people who stand to make money move in to sell drugs.  Will the Minister do whatever she can to tackle the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can guarantee the Minister 100 per cent support from the people in the inner city communities.  They want to <Col N="1111" /> fight the drug problem.  They will go out of their way to do it and are getting themselves organised to work with the Garda to try to bring facilities back to the city centre.  The Minister will not have any difficulty working with community groups in my constituency and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The bail law has to be tackled quickly. The Garda will tell you it is demoralising, having put in a great deal of effort to arrest someone, to see him walking free on the street two days later.  That is extremely difficult and I have no doubt the Minister has spoken to gardaí about this.  We can all give examples of such incidents but the issue must be tackled now.  I am aware that the previous Minister for Justice referred this matter to the Law Reform Commission but it should get priority as the present situation is extremely damaging to the Garda and makes them think they might as well not be doing any work.</P>
    <P>The report of the Lord Mayor's Commission on crime shows that it has not increased during the past few years.  To a certain extent, that is true but there is a great deal of petty crime, anyone whose handbag has been snatched or whose car has been broken into, is extremely irritated by it.  I do not believe the level of such crimes had dropped, in fact it has increased substantially.</P>
    <P>The report also showed that the level of violent crime committed by young people had increased, this is interesting because surveys conducted in America have shown that the area of crime which will increase is the number of young people involved in violent crime although the levels of other crimes have decreased.  I ask the Minister to consider this because it is very dangerous for young people to become involved in violent crime for no reason.</P>

      <P>The only thing that makes this debate different from other motions on crime during the past two and a half years I have dealt with Justice matters is that it has been prompted by the largest armed robbery ever in the State and the related shooting of a journalist.  Veronica Guerin, who was investigating organised crime.</P>
      <P>The Progressive Democrats Party, instead of engaging in routine condemnation of crime last year put forward a Private Members' Bill which proposed radical and achievable reforms of the criminal procedure &mdash; the Criminal Justice Bill, 1994 &mdash; and proposed among other measures a new system of interrogation of suspected persons before a judge of the District Court. There is often a great deal of controversy as to the nature and admissibility of interrogations in Garda stations.  In order that certain serious offences can be investigated it was proposed that suspected persons should be liable to be questioned formally before a District Court judge other than in public and that the record of that interrogation should be admissible at a subsequent trial.  The rights of an accused person not to be obliged to incriminate himself would still be preserved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The District Court judge before whom the examination took place would be obliged to warn the person to be interrogated that a court of trial may draw adverse inferences from his failure to answer questions or to an answer given.  The provision was also made for the court to draw an inference from the failure of the accused person to mention <Col N="1113" /> matters at the time the crime was investigated on which they rely at their trial. The prosecution was given a right to call on the accused to give evidence at his trial and provision was made for a forensic test to be carried out on people remanded in custody, which is a loophole in the law.</P>
    <P>We also addressed the necessary and much heralded need to reform the law of bail in respect of which the Supreme Court has twice ruled that preventive detention is not consistent with the Constitution and, consequently, the withholding of bail on the grounds that the person is likely to reoffend is unconstitutional. Given that constitutional problem, we proposed in Part II of our Bill to introduce a jurisdiction on the part of any court granting bail to direct that the bail would be liable to be forfeited if the accused commits an offence on indictment while on bail; effectively the bailsman would be surety for the good behaviour of an accused while on bail. We also proposed new minimum levels of bail with a hardship clause for those unable to raise it.  This measure would at least have made some impact on the constitutional paralysis in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>We also made detailed recommendations for changes in the current petition system whereby the Minister for Justice can sanction the release or remission of prisoners for which there is no public accountability.  The whole system of petitions and the practice of temporary releases of prisoners is not transparent and accountability and from time to time serious crimes have been committed by people on temporary release from jail.  Unaccountable remissions of sentences undermine the criminal justice system.  The Minister for Justice, in making a plea for calm last night when faced with these people baying for reform of the criminal justice system, actually pointed to measures which no party in this House has requested. She referred to the abolition of bail and over-radical measures which would not be in accordance with the Constitution. All the reforms called for by my party <Col N="1114" /> would have preserved and protected due process and civil liberties.  Our practical suggestions were not, of course, taken on board by the previous Government, nor is there any indication that this Government intends to introduce radical reform of the criminal justice system to restore credibility in this time of escalating crime.</P>
    <P>The armed robbery and the subsequent shooting of Veronica Guerin highlights the need for the retention of the Special Criminal Court.  It appears that if these people are prepared to shoot a journalist investigating their activities they will have no qualms about intimidating jurors, if they were to come before ordinary courts.  We need to retain the Special Criminal Court to deal with this sort of organised armed gangs.</P>
    <P>We have called also for the establishment of an anti-racketeering unit in the Garda Síochána to investigate the assets of known criminals, given that the Criminal Justice Act requires a conviction before any assets of crime can be confiscated.  This is essential and urgent. I am glad that the Minister indicated that the regulations which flow from the Criminal Justice Act (No. 3), sections 31 and 32, on moneylaundering will be brought into effect at the earliest possible opportunity as&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I stand corrected on that.</P>
      <P>There is no shortage of policy statements and specialist reports on the need for reform in the crime area.  We have had several Law Reform Commission reports and now the report of the Lord Mayor's Commission.  A select committee of this House has dealt with crime and has detailed a radical reform of the criminal justice system as it applies to juveniles and yet we are still baying for the necessary reforms.</P>
      <P>I will now deal with the Minister's response to the allegations that she misled the House last week.  The Minister for Justice tried twice, in a fuddled and clouded way, to explain to the Dáil her account of the robbery of £3 million from the Brinks-Allied premises.  That account does not stand up to any serious scrutiny.  Throughout her speech she belaboured the point that Garda intelligence related solely to the possibility of a raid on a van in transit or cash in transit, as she variously put it.  She went on to claim there was no intelligence to the effect that any premises would be attacked.  Elsewhere she claimed that Garda intelligence both as to timing and target was simply wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the Minister is on a very sticky wicket and is now compounding her weak and evasive performance in the Dáil last week with an interpretation of what the Garda intelligence meant.  That is simply pathetic. Let us examine the facts.  Late last year Garda intelligence concluded that a gang of known criminals were planning a raid on a cash carrying security firm. The intelligence was reinforced when one of the suspects was spotted staking out a security van at a Dublin northside shopping centre.  We must ask how would hardened criminals carry out such an operation?  They might try to hijack the van in transit, to quote the Minister, but this would be most unlikely if they were targeting a really <Col N="1116" /> big haul since such vans in transit are accompanied by armed gardaí and the Army.  A raid on a van in transit would be the most risky and least likely option for a gang.  Given that they would be unlikely to risk martyrdom by raiding a van with an armed escort their attention would extend, one would imagine, to a possible raid on a store or bank where money was being picked up &mdash; there were 19 pickup points that day &mdash; a possible raid on the security company cash holding depot or the kidnapping of vulnerable people to force the handing over of cash by a security company, precisely the manner in which an attack on one of the banks was carried out a few years ago.</P>
    <P>It is ridiculous to suggest, as the Minister did, that the only concern of the gardaí was for cash in transit.  Once there was good Garda intelligence that a dangerous gang was planning a security company robbery &mdash; we know only too well how accurate this intelligence was &mdash; all these options had to be considered and I believe they were.  The Minister confirmed last night that a senior garda visited the Brinks premises in Santry a few weeks before the robbery but sought to explain this as being due to a change of management.  Given that Operation Liffey had been mounted in November-December it is incredible that this was merely a courtesy call.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>The cash carrying security firms took precautions against some of the other possible criminal actions I outlined.  There is the uncontradicated report that the Brinks-Allied staff were circulated with a memorandum warning about a possible attack on the Santry premises.  Despite this the Minister continues to ramble on about no specific information and no specific target.  It would appear that the only Garda intelligence which the Minister would regard as credible would be information to the effect that a raid would <Col N="1117" /> take place on specific target A, on specific day B, and at specific hour C.  It is simply nonsense.</P>
      <P>As to the evasive and misleading response to the specific questions put by my colleague Deputy Harney last Wednesday which the Minister, unbelievably, insists on defending, it is worth considering whether the quality and content of the replies would have been the same if three gardaí had been murdered during the raid or if the Minister could not point the finger so legitimately at Brinks Allied Security.</P>

It is a pity that in the debate last night some Members not only ignored these measures but made claims that fly in the face of reality.</P>
      <P>Since last November money laundering is an offence under criminal law. This is broadly defined and essentially means that anyone involved in handling proceeds which they know or believe to be the proceeds of crime will be liable for heavy penalties &mdash; unlimited fines and up to 14 years imprisonment.  To suggest that our criminal law does not recognise the seriousness of money laundering is to be wide of the mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue asserted last night that there is no effective mechanism under the criminal law which would permit the gardaí to freeze or seize the proceeds of last week's robbery if they suspected it was held in a financial institution. The perpetrators of last week's robbery would be foolish to take any consolation from the Deputy's assertion <Col N="1118" /> because it completely overlooks the provisions of the Criminial Justice Act, 1994.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Donoghue said &ldquo;one of the greatest money laundering operations in the history of the State is underway&rdquo;. The Deputy is wrong.  The single biggest money laundering operation in the State was organised by his Government.</P>

    <P>What is the deadline for the juvenile justice Bill?  The Minister of State has responsibility in the area of child care. There are three important Bills dealing with the provision of adequate and full child care services.  The Fianna Fáil Administation brought in two of them, the Child Care Act and the Adoption Bill.  When will the juvenile justice Bill be brought forward?  Will the Minister give us the date she called for so frequently when she was on this side of the House?  Fianna Fáil did a tremendous amount of work in drafting the legislation. If the Minister gives us the dates and provides the necessary resources we will compliment her but if she reneges on the contents of this motion, vague as they are, we will call her to task, we will berate her, just as she occasionally <Col N="1120" /> berated our Government when on this side of the House.</P>

    <P>It is abundantly clear that the Minister's contribution last evening emanated from the bowels of bureaucracy. It was as confusing as it was convoluted, difficult to understand in places, low on <Col N="1121" /> recommendations and absolutely hopeless in resolving the current problem.

There is provision, in the Criminal Justice Act, 1994, to enable assets or moneys deposited by a convicted criminal be seized or frozen.  There is no legislation which would allow the Garda to freeze or seize assets in the course of an investigation.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - County Carlow Flooding.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne1" hpid="Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny) Mr. Browne (Carlow-Kilkenny)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Carlow-Kilkenny):</i> Walking the plank in Carlow is a serious matter.  While it is almost 40 years since Carlow was flooded in 1947, flooding occurred there on three occasions recently, in 1990, 1993 and again this year.  Nothing much has changed in the town since 1947.  The streets have not been lowered nor have many new buildings been erected, but for some reason Carlow has been flooded three times in five years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Office of Public Works should carry out a study on what caused the flooding.  Householders and business people deserve to have that office examine the position and take steps to alleviate the flooding by carrying out three <Col N="1129" /> relatively cheap jobs in the area, proposals for which were submitted by the urban council on 26 June 1993.  First, the construction of training river walls along the Barrow track, second, the provision of a flat valve at Graiguecullen and, third, the construction of a new junction where the river Burren meets the Barrow at Graiguecullen.  At an estimated cost of £120,000 these three constructions could bring relief to the people of Carlow and Graiguecullen.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works should immediately undertake another study the feasibility of dredging works on the Barrow in the environs of Carlow town and downstream.  Leighlinbridge an Graiguenamanagh are also flooded downstream from Carlow.  The question is whether dredging is being done upstream with no preparation to allow the water to flow into the sea.  The removal of silt would be a major help in preventing the second biggest river in Ireland &mdash; the Barrow &mdash; from flooding again.</P>
    <P>Compensation must be provided to individuals, private business people whose property is flooded because their financial loss is great.  They cannot get insurance cover because the danger of flooding has always existed.  While the European scene is dreadful, the people of Carlow suffer the same fate.  A flooded house is a flooded house regardless of location.  Not only should compensation be paid to them, it should be paid quickly.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is not directly involved in the provision of bridges, the long awaited bridge over the river in Carlow would at least allow people to travel from Rosslare to the west without going through floods.  It is unfortunate that we waited two years for an inquiry and signing a bridge order.  If this had been done we might be close to providing the badly needed bridge.  I ask the Minister to give the people of Carlow some hope that the Office of Public Works will deal urgently with the second biggest river in Ireland which is slow moving and silts up.  I hope the Minister has good news.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Hogan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Browne for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to address the serious issue of flooding.</P>
      <P>The payment of compensation to relieve hardship caused by the flooding is outside my area of responsibility. However, the question of compensation should be examined and I will be bringing the matter to the attention of the appropriate Ministers.</P>
      <P>I now turn to the issue of what, if anything, can be done to try to prevent future occurrences such as the flooding experienced in Graiguecullen, Carlow, and indeed in other areas.</P>
      <P>Under the Arterial Drainage Act, 1945, the Commissioners of Public Works are empowered to carry out schemes for the relief of flooding in river catchments.  This Act has always been interpreted as requiring the Commissioners to undertake work on a complete catchment basis but not empowering them to undertake work to deal with localised flooding.  A great deal of work has been carried out in catchments throughout the country and many areas which escape flooding in recent years would have been damaged but for such schemes.</P>
      <P>The problem in Graiguecullen, Carlow, has been caused by the river Barrow bursting its banks and inundating low lying areas in the town.  I understand that flooding to the extent experienced this week was not recorded since 1947.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an area which, unfortunately, has been subject to regular flooding and is generally at risk in February and December.  While the Office of Public Works has at present no statutory role in relation to flooding in Graiguecullen, Carlow, it maintains a general interest in such matters because of its functions under the Arterial Drainage Act.  In this regard, I understand it devised a system which would provide some advance warning of the likely occurrence of flooding in the towns.  While this would not enable action to be taken to prevent the flooding, it would allow some time <Col N="1131" /> for people to be evacuated or for other precautionary measures.  The system may have been of some assistance as Carlow County Council gave early warning of the impending flooding.</P>
    <P>I want to assure the House that the Government is keenly aware of the difficulties caused by the present flooding in many areas of the country and that all relevant Departments are monitoring the situation to determine what measures may require to be taken in the short and longer term.</P>
    <P>I am aware that many areas have not benefited from arterial drainage schemes carried out under the 1945 Act and I am conscious that several areas, including Graiguecullen, have suffered flooding as a result of the recent heavy rain.  It should be said that preliminary information from the Meterological Office indicates that rainfall during January was, in some cases, 86 per cent over normal.  I am very concerned at the widespread hardship caused by flooding. As the Deputy may be aware I have visited and met delegations at Graiguecullen, Sixmilebridge, Cappamore and Gort and I have seen the effects of flooding first-hand.  I would like to take this opportunity to express my concern for all those who have suffered hardship as a result of flooding and my appreciation of the magnificent response of the emergency services everywhere.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to see what, if anything, can be done to prevent similar occurrences in future.  The Office of Public Works found that it is virtually impossible to design economically viable catchment drainage schemes.  With this in mind I have instructed the relevant officials to prepare proposals for legislation that would enable them to undertake work to deal with flooding on a more localised basis.  It is vitally important that the Government is in a position to respond immediately and with maximum effect to alleviate distress and suffering caused by large scale flooding.  These proposals are currently under consideration in the Department of Finance and I have been in contact <Col N="1132" /> with the Minister for Finance to try to expedite that process.</P>
    <P>I expect to be in a position in the next few weeks to decide what action may be taken in specific areas.</P>

      <P>I propose, if possible, to share my time with my party colleagues, Deputies Killeen, O'Rourke and O'Dea.  In all my time in this House the present flooding in County Galway is the most serious crisis affecting my constituents.  Homes, farms, property and roads have been destroyed by constant flooding.</P>
      <P>In my own parish some houses and properties have been flooded at least once and others twice, during the past three weeks.  In Ballinasloe private houses and commercial properties have had to be evacuated.  In Loughrea a housing estate and some other properties have been flooded and people have had to evacuate.  The same situation prevails in Gort, Portumna and elsewhere. The Shannon and Suck rivers have, once again, burst their banks. Lands in Ballinasloe, Clontuskert, Laurencetown, Clonfert, Eyrecourt, Meelick, Ballycrossaun, Tiernascragh, Portumna, Tynagh, Abbey and Woodford and private properties in these areas have been covered in water.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my own area the Dunkellin river has once again flooded thousands of acres of farmland and the river Clare and other tributaries have burst their banks.  Houses and commercial properties have been destroyed and land will be useless for at least six months of this year.  Roads are impassable, bridges are under threat, lifestock, including horses, <Col N="1133" /> have been lost and in some cases livestock have been moved from lands and housing to other locations.</P>
    <P>On behalf of the people of County Galway I appeal to the Government to put a co-ordinated plan which would involve the Department of the Environment &mdash; I am delighted to see the Minister present &mdash; the Office of Public Works, the Geological Survey of Ireland and local authorities into action to alleviate flooding and that a further plan be drawn up to enable the problem of flooding to be dealt with if and when it occurs in future.  It is vital that a compensation fund is set up immediately to alleviate misery, loss of income and destruction imposed on many private citizens.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Killeen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to support the case made by Deputy Treacy.  The position in County Galway is mirrored exactly in County Clare, in some areas much more seriously than in others.  For the fourth time in a month, the people of the village of Sixmilebridge have had to abandon their houses.  In Ennis, Fergus Park and other areas of the town have had to be abandoned.</P>
      <P>Deputy Treacy outlined the difficulties which people who have to leave their homes encounter: the enormous financial loss, the inconvenience and the fear that flooding will recur.  Deputy Treacy has eloquently outlined the problem.  There is an urgent need for State intervention to ensure that the people who have suffered on this and previous occasions have their cases dealt with in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an element of State responsibility for the problems encountered in the west.  Obviously weather conditions have played the major role but other <Col N="1134" /> developments have contributed to the problem, one of which is that there has been virtually no arterial drainage programme for a number of years and none is envisaged.  There has been a lack of routine maintenance of rivers and drains with a knock-on effect which has had disastrous consequences.  There has also been enormous development in forestry and land reclamation, developments which have been aided by State funds.  It is patently unfair of the State to fail to take responsibility for the consequences of its support for these activities.</P>
    <P>I visited a number of houses on Saturday last in Sixmilebridge and the people there who had to leave their houses in December due to flooding, had refurbished them and, once again, had to leave them, with built-in furniture, carpets and fittings destroyed for the second time within a month.  Since then they have been flooded twice.  It is incumbent on the State to meet its responsibility in this matter and take action to ensure these people do not continue to suffer such inconvenience and loss.</P>
    <P>I am pleased both Ministers are in the House and I am pleased the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, took the opportunity to visit Sixmilebridge, but there is a cynicism about politicians in that people expect them to show up on media occasions but to be absent when action is needed.  Remedial action can be taken in this instance.  It is within the power of the Government to remedy the defects in Ennis, Sixmilebridge and elsewhere in the west and I call on the Minister to ensure action is taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanHowlin" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin) Brendan Howlin">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Howlin)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank both Deputies for raising this important issue and giving me the opportunity to address the House again on the matter of flooding.  I have held ministerial office for the past two years and my record is not one of turning up for media occasions but rather of action, and I hope that will continue in the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Adverse weather conditions are an <Col N="1135" /> unfortunate feature of our climate but the bad weather of recent weeks has been quite exceptional.  I understand that the Meterological Service's preliminary reports for January's rainfall show that Shannon Airport recorded 85 per cent more rainfall for the month while other substantial increases were reported from Malin Head, Dublin and Cork Airport.  All this was, of course, additional to the heavy rainfall experienced in December 1994 &mdash; the western part of the country had about 50 per cent more rain than the normal December level.</P>
    <P>A number of Government Departments and offices, as well as other local and public authorities, have responsibility for measures to respond to the effects of the bad weather, either during the particular weather episode or in the immediate aftermath or in regard to measures, where these are feasible, to avert a recurrence of damage.</P>
    <P>As Minister for the Environment, I have no overall responsibility for response measures of any of these kinds, nor have I any specific directly exercisable functions in these matters.</P>
    <P>My concern is to ensure that when adverse weather conditions arise, the local authorities are geared to respond promptly and effectively to ameliorate the worst effects in relation to these aspects for which they have a direct responsibility and, in particular, to limit the effects on individuals whose lives may be put at risk, or who may be exposed to serious hardship in the immediate aftermath of severe weather conditions.</P>
    <P>I believe that the local authorities through advance planning and training, are generally well equipped to deal with this type of emergency in co-operation with the other emergency services such as the Garda Síochána and the ambulance service.</P>
    <P>I would, indeed, like to pay tribute to all concerned in the current response efforts and, in particular as Minister for the Environment, to the local authority management and personnel, including <Col N="1136" /> the fire service personnel, who have worked so hard and who continue to work hard, often in very difficult conditions, to alleviate hardship and protect the lives and property of those worst affected by the recent storms and bad weather.</P>
    <P>As regards Galway, there has been widespread flooding in Galway city and throughout the county, particularly in Gort and the surrounding area as well as damage to sea walls, piers and roads. I am aware, of course, that many other areas in the west including Ennis and other parts of Clare have been badly hit, particularly by flooding.</P>
    <P>As to flooding, arterial drainage schemes are, of course, the responsibility of the Office of Public Works.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Hogan, who has responsibility for the Office of Public Works, said, that office is preparing legislative proposals to amend the arterial drainage Acts to deal with more localised and pronounced areas of flooding.  Drainage requirements in urban areas, such as run-off from streets, houses and overflow from drainage networks, may have a limited relevance to flooding in some cases; the initiative in making provision for such works would rest with the local authorities concerned.</P>
    <P>Damage to harbours is the concern of the Minister for the Marine and matters relating to the impact of weather conditions on the agricultural sector are, of course, proper to my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry. Those Ministers are directly involved in monitoring the position and, I hope, will put forward proposals in due course.</P>
    <P>There are no funds available to me for the purpose of providing assistance to householders for damage to houses caused by flooding.  Householders would normally have buildings and contents insured against losses of this nature but, in necessitous cases, it is open to the health board to provide assistance to elderly householders, through the task force or Special Housing Aid for the Elderly, to remedy damage to the <Col N="1137" /> householder's living conditions.  A health board may also assist a person under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme where an urgent need arises.  Local authorities may help through the provision of temporary accommodation where this is necessary &mdash; local authorities have been communicated with in this regard.</P>
    <P>The general conditions notified annually to local authorities grants for non-national roads require them to provide a contingency sum from their overall allocations so as to finance road restoration works which may be necessitated by extreme weather conditions.  I will shortly notify local authorities of their grant allocations for 1995.  It will then be a matter for each local authority to determine its programme of road works, including remedial works, taking account of the overall resources available to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this matter on the Adjournment because I received a particularly enlightening and unhelpful reply to a parliamentary question to the Minister about the committee dealing with this matter and his plans to introduce a code of practice to deal with allegations of child sexual abuse within sport.  I understand the committee was set up by the former Minister.  As I know from experience, one of the features of setting up a code of practice in regard to any measure to protect children is that it takes a long time to be implemented.  I am raising this matter on the Adjournment to jolt the Minister into action and to get a progress report on the committee's work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the recommendations in the report on the Kilkenny incest case was that there should be mandatory reporting of allegations of child sexual abuse.  I have been hounding Ministers for Health and Justice on those Protocols and procedures and on the guidelines which were in draft form for many months last year.  Mandatory reporting <Col N="1138" /> of child abuse works very well in Canada. It is the only way we can properly protect children and ensure that when children make disclosures to adults they trust, the adult is legally bound to pass on the information to the Garda. Obviously there are difficulties with this system but we must move along that road and I am glad the Minister for Health is committed to the introduction of mandatory reporting.</P>
    <P>The Rape Crisis Centre, which receives many allegations of abuse, has also called for mandatory reporting.  It deals in the main with adults.  For years children made disclosures of abuse, but one of the features of such disclosures is that adults tend to turn a blind eye to them.  This was evidenced during the heady days of the Fr. Brendan Smyth affair.  His order failed over many years to report his activities.</P>
    <P>People who hear about child abuse cases are afraid to report them to the Garda because of the fears of being sued by the alleged perpetrators of such crimes.  Such is the fear of litigation that the Irish Amateur Swimming Association decline even at this stage to remove life membership from George Gibney, the former national swimming coach who successfully avoided prosecution for child abuse by claiming that the lapse of time meant he would not get a fair trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have expressed concern in the House about the way this case was handled by the Director of Public Prosecutions' office.  I raise the <Col N="1139" /> matter again because it is relevant and has prompted my call for the introduction of standardised guidelines for sports clubs and voluntary sporting organisations on how to deal with allegations of child abuse.  For many years children have been abused while in the care of people they trusted and to whom they were devoted.  Given that the Garda had brought the prosecution for serious child abuse offences to such an advanced stage, it is incredible that no formal complaint about the gentleman to whom I referred has ever been made to the swimming association.  The case was dropped because the Director of Public Prosecutions did not appeal the decision of the High Court to stop the prosecution.  I feel like making a formal complaint to the Irish Amateur Swimming Association if this is what is required.</P>
      <P>As the Minister will appreciate, this type of child abuse is particularly tragic as it is usually dependent on and accompanied by the devotion of a child to an adult whom he or she trusts.  It is domination and an abuse of power by the adult.  It would be horrific if a country which is so devoted to and fanatical about sport allowed its children to go unprotected merely by virtue of the fact that adequate standardised procedures have not been put in place by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Allen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Donnell for raising this important issue and for giving me the opportunity to outline the current position. The Deputy said she wished to push the Minister into action.  This Minister does not need any such pushing.  I wish to correct one point the Deputy made.  The previous Minister announced the setting up of a body to draw up codes of practice but no such body was set up.  On coming into office I had to satisfy myself that I was the best person, and my Department was the best Department, to deal with this problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have already had discussions on this <Col N="1140" /> subject with the Chairman of Cospóir, the National Sports Council and with the staff of my Department's sport section.  The purpose of my discussions is to develop the most effective and appropriate means of preventing and dealing with abuse of children and young people in sport.</P>
    <P>I share the concern and upset expressed by so many people at the recent media reports containing allegations of child sex abuse in a particular sport.  I am also very conscious and appreciative of the dedication and commitment of so many excellent people, especially those voluntary workers who have enriched sport and the lives of their communities over the years.  It is vital that this good work is sustained and that the good name of sport and of the many thousands of decent sportspeople is preserved.</P>
    <P>My intention, therefore, is to appoint without delay a special committee or working group which will draw up a code of ethics and good practice for administrators, coaches and players working with children and young people in sport.  I am anxious to ensure that this committee will comprise people with appropriate experience and expertise in sport, childcare, health and psychology as well as parents who have the most vital role to play.  A considerable amount of work and research has already been done in the Council of Europe, here and in other countries and the committee will have regard to this material in its deliberations.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that the appropriate State and voluntary bodies will be fully consulted in the whole process of drawing up the code.  It is vital that the knowledge and experience of people in a wide range of disciplines be brought to bear on the work of the committee.</P>
    <P>This is a delicate and sensitive area and it is most important that we get it right and that the best professional advice is available to us.  The code wil focus on the needs and welfare of the child or young person as being paramount and will provide guidelines and <Col N="1141" /> standards to be adopted by administrators, coaches and players.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputy for this opportunity to discuss a matter of grave concern to all of us involved in sport and with the welfare of our children.  I assure the Deputy that I will deal with this matter as quickly and effectively as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue and welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, to the House.  Notwithstanding all the slagging he has got from this side of the House, I congratulate him on his appointment.</P>
      <P>I raise this matter to ascertain the action being taken by the Government arising from the collapse of the offshore bank, International Investments Limited, Gibraltar, in view of the heavy financial losses incurred as a result by so many Irish investors, both from the North and the Republic.  I have no doubt that the Minister and this House are aware of the background to this scandal.  When International Investments Limited, which was registered in Gibraltar and run by Mr. Finbar Ross, collapsed more than ten years ago it owed £7 million.  Mr. Ross fled the country, leaving more than 1,000 investors, mostly from Northern Ireland, with heavy losses.  The Collapse of the bank is still being investigated by the Northern Ireland authorities.  I ask the Minister to give me the up-to-date position on the investigation.  I understand a lengthy file was compiled for the Director of Public Prosecutions in Northern Ireland and that it has been with the Crown Counsel since November, with a decision expected soon.  What co-operation has there been between the Garda and the RUC in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The collapse of the bank and its effect on many vulnerable people, some of whom were elderly, has correctly been described as the greatest unresolved scandal in recent times.  This scandal <Col N="1142" /> was raised in the House of Commons and, as the Minister is aware, it was recently highlighted by a reporter with the <i>Sunday World</i> who tracked down Mr. Ross in the United States where he is living with a small religious sect in the Ozark Mountains.</P>
    <P>When he was a member of the previous Government, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, rejected pressure to appoint a High Court inspector to investigate the scandal &mdash; he gave reasons for that decision.  When in Opposition, the Taoiseach, Deputy John Bruton, was very sympathetic to such an approach, as was the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Rabbitte.  On the basis that the Northern Ireland Director of Public Prosecutions is soon to make a decision on this matter and that the Taoiseach and Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, were concerned about this case in Opposition, I ask the Minister to say if he will now agree to initiate a high level investigation into the collapse of this offshore bank.</P>
    <P>This unresolved case led to the bankruptcy of hundreds of small investors, some of whom are widows and many of whom had invested their life savings and pensions in the bank.  As the Minister is aware, this case has united Northern politicians in their demand for action by the Government.  This is a very appropriate time for politicians, North and South, to tackle the issue once and for all.  I ask the Minister to give me an assurance that after so many years he will come to the assistance of the many Irish people who have suffered so much for so long as a result of this débâcle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise and Employment (Mr. Rabbitte)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for his gracious remarks; he is the first Fianna Fáil speaker to acknowledge that I attract more than my fair share of slagging from both himself and his colleagues. I also thank him for giving me the opportunity to deal with this long running issue.  As he correctly said, I am only one of the Deputies in the House <Col N="1143" /> who have taken an interest in this matter during the years.</P>
      <P>The company to which the Deputy refers was incorporated in Gibraltar in November 1976.  I understand it once held a banking licence granted by the authorities there.  In 1984 the Supreme Court of Gibraltar ordered that the company be wound up.  There was an Irish dimension as it seems to have been, by all accounts &mdash; certainly to my satisfaction &mdash; under the control of an Irish national.  In addition, many of those who invested in it appear to have been from Northern Ireland.  The company could be regarded as having its genesis here although no definite evidence has been found to suggest that it ever was registered as carrying on business in this jurisdiction.</P>
      <P>The genesis of the company goes back to the 1970s in the form of an industrial and provident society.  This society was registered in 1975 and ceased operations around 1978 when new legislation was imminent for the better regulation and supervision of deposit taking industrial and provident societies.  Certain assets and liabilities of the society were transferred to the Gibraltar based company. The then Registrar of Friendly Societies carried out a thorough investigation of this transfer of assets, even to the point of placing public advertisements in the national newspapers.  These advertisements did not elicit any substantiated claims from depositors that moneys were owed to them by the society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allegations have been made over the years concerning irregularities in the affairs of the company.  These allegations were subject to full investigation by the Garda in 1984-85 and 1988 as well as reviews on a number of occasions.  I understand that a file in the case was referred to the Director of <Col N="1144" /> Public Prosecutions but the director signified that there should be no prosecution. I am also informed that the Garda authorities have indicated that if any new evidence is adduced in the case it will be thoroughly investigated and, if appropriate, again referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>I have certain powers under the Companies Acts relating to the appointment of inspectors to conduct investigations into the affairs of companies.  The persons asserting that they are owed money by the company have such powers also, although I appreciate the related costs may be prohibitive.  However, none of the representations and allegations made over the years have produced any new evidence that might further advance investigations into the affairs of the company.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the foregoing, I am aware that members of all parties have in the past raised issues concerning the affairs of this company.  I am extremely concerned at allegations that people from Northern Ireland and this jurisdiction have been defrauded by the company.  I have therefore ordered a review of the case in my Department and this review is ongoing.  It is my intention to make whatever decision is required immediately on completion of that review.  I will make the Deputy aware of this as speedily as possible because I acknowledge a great deal of what he said and the fact that serious hardship was imposed on many small depositors, a great many of whom are from Northern Ireland &mdash; I have met their representatives &mdash; and some of whom are pensioners and not in a position to endure the hardship visited upon them.</P>

    <P>The annual labour force survey covers over 45,000 households and provides very detailed analyses of the level <Col N="973" /> and structure of both unemployed persons and those at work.</P>
    <P>The live register provides timely information on the number of registered unemployed persons classified by age, sex, area and duration of unemployment. It is a valuable source of information on short term unemployment trends.  These statistics were reviewed in detail in 1991 by an expert group established under the aegis of the Central Review Committee of the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress</i> (PESP).</P>
    <P>Two initiatives currently under consideration may lead to further improvements in the range of unemployment statistics.  The CSO is examining the methodological and resource implications of a National Statistics Board recommendation that sub-annual labour force surveys be initiated and will submit proposals to Government later in the year.  The full computerisation of the local offices of the Department of Social Welfare may also allow more comprehensive live register analyses.</P>

      <P>The appropriate method of providing a statutory basis for the election of worker directors to the Authority would be an extension, by order of the Minister for Enterprise and Employment, of the provisions of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Acts, 1977 to 1993.

      <P>In the absence of administrative controls on the movement of persons into and out of the <Col N="979" /> State the Central Statistics Office makes full use of available alternative information sources when estimating annual migration flows.  These include the annual labour force surveys, the country of residence inquiries conducted at sea and air ports, passenger statistics and administrative records such as the register of electors and the child benefit scheme.  Traditionally, the main focus has been on producing an annual estimate of &ldquo;net&rdquo; migration i.e. the difference between inward and outward gross migration flows.</P>
      <P>A check on the accuracy of the net migration figures is provided by comparing the results of successive Censuses of Population with due allowances being made for the effects of births and deaths.  This may result in revisions to the preliminary estimates of migration for inter-censal periods.</P>
      <P>A new series of gross migration flows was introduced by the Central Statistics Office in May 1994 in a release entitled &ldquo;Annual Population and Migration Estimates 1987-1993&rdquo;.  The corresponding release in 1994 was published in October 1994.</P>
      <P>The immigration and emigration figures contained in the new release are broken down by sex, age group and origin/destination.  This represents a major advance on the previous situation whereby only one annual figure for net migration was published.</P>

      <P>I have availed of every appropriate opportunity in recent months to emphasise to the British authorities the need to respond to the new situation created by the ceasefires, including by giving consideration to the dismantlement of emergency legislation enacted over the past 25 years.  It has been pointed out that this would not only be appropriate in the context of the ending of the campaigns of violence, but would also be helpful in creating a climate conducive to agreement and political progress.</P>
      <P>It has been made clear to the British authorities that the Prevention of Terrorism Act should receive early attention in this regard.  In this context officials of my Department recently met with the reviewer appointed by the British Government to examine the operation of the Act.  They made clear our view that serious consideration should be given to the non-renewal of the Act, or at least to allowing significant sections of the Act to lapse, when it comes up for renewal in a few weeks time.  It was emphasised that in current circumstances the case for ending a number of provisions about which concern had been expressed by members of the Irish community in Britain, or Irish citizens travelling to and from Britain, as well as individuals and groups in Northern Ireland was particularly strong.  It was, of course, pointed out, that for so long as the Act remains in force, the Government will continue to insist that the legislation must be applied sensitively and in an evenhanded manner.  We will continue to raise individual cases about which concern has been expressed with the British authorities through the appropriate channels.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with the statement made by President Santer, in the course of his recent wide-ranging address to the European Parliament introducing the programme of the new Commission, that a strong single currency is necessary in order to develop fully the potential of the single market <Col N="982" /> and to stimulate investment, and that a single currency will bring substantial benefits to people in their everyday lives.</P>
      <P>President Santer also drew attention to the fact that the path towards economic and monetary union is mapped out in the Maastricht Treaty.  The Treaty provides that if the European Council is to take the decision by the end of 1996 to proceed to the third stage of economic and monetary union and thereby, in effect, bring the single currency into being, a majority of member states must meet the economic and budgetary performance criteria which the Treaty lays down.  President Santer stated that the Commission will insist that these criteria are strictly applied, as indeed they must be if the single currency is to receive the necessary support and to engender the necessary confidence from the outset.</P>
      <P>The Treaty also provides that if a majority of member states do not meet the necessary conditions at the end of 1996, then those member states who do may proceed to stage three of European Monetary Union (which includes the establishment of a single currency) in 1999.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Council decided in November 1994 that Ireland meets the budgetary performance criteria, one of only two member states (with Luxembourg) to do so.  This decision constitutes formal recognition of the progress made by the Irish authorities in respect of the public finances in recent years.</P>
      <P>The Programme of Renewal commits the Government to the targets set out in the Maastricht Treaty.  The Government is determined to maintain the necessary fiscal discipline to ensure that Ireland continues to meet these targets and is among those member states which qualify to engage in the third stage of economic and monetary union.</P>
      <P>President Santer in his speech promised a catalogue of the remaining necessary work for economic and monetary union as well as a Green Paper on the conditions for the transition to a single currency.  I await these with interest.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that in view of the greater responsibility placed on Customs for protecting not only Ireland but the EU as a whole against drug smuggling with the abolition of systematic checks at internal Community frontiers since 1 January 1993, a Customs National Drugs Teams was established.  The CNDT, comprising over 70 staff, consists of intelligence units, operational units, maritime units and sniffer-dog units, which are strategically based at locations throughout the country.  All units are mobile and employ the most modern means of communication and have access to aerial and sea surveillance.  These specialist officials supplement the general cadre of Customs and Excise staff who are also responsible for the detection and prevention of drug smuggling as part of their normal duties.  The CNDT liaise and co-operate with the Garda, Navy and Air Corps as required and maintains contacts with Customs administrations throughout the world by means of International Conventions to which Ireland is a contracting party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CNDT has negotiated memoranda of understanding with trade associations and companies involved in the transport of goods and/or persons as part of the continuing drive against drug smuggling.  Additionally, they recently launched the coastal and airfield reporting pack under the drug watch programme.  The pack has had wide distribution and enlists the assistance of <Col N="984" /> coastal communities, maritime personnel, people residing in close proximity to airfields and other members of the public and encourages the reporting of unusual occurrences in their areas to Customs by Freefone or Freepost.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I am not satisfied that any proposal to man disused coastguard stations for surveillance purposed and to combat illegal drug importation would be productive and cost-effective having regard to the present deployment of Customs resources and the availability of intelligence in particular from coastal communities and maritime personnel.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been longstanding Government policy that farmers should be assessed to tax in the same manner as other taxpayers, i.e. on their actual income in all cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The farm profile is a simplified return of income specially designed for <Col N="986" /> farmers to enable them to make returns without the need to produce full farm accounts thus ensuring a lower compliance cost to the farmer.  A commitment was given in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Works</i> (PCW) to hold discussions between the Government and the farm organisations to examine the operation of the existing system of farm taxation, including the farm profile system.  The examination was to &ldquo;take account of the views of the farm organisations that the farm profile should be capable of being completed without professional assistance and that it should be extended to the maximum possible number of farmers&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Discussions have been ongoing over the past year with the farm organisation with regard to this commitment. The Revenue Commissioners have indicated that they will continue to make a concerned effort to inform farmers about the availability and advantages of using the farm profile system.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, low income farmers can be excluded from return-filling altogether by completing the farm profile&mdash; basic form which is a screening device used to help identify famers whose level of activity is so small that they are unlikely to have a tax liability in the current tax year and in future years.  Where an inspector of taxes decides that the level of activity of a farmer is unlikely to result in a tax liability the farmer will be advised that a return of income will not be required for that particular tax year of later years unless circumstances change.  Farmers who are so advised will, however, be subject to periodic reviews by the inspector of taxes.</P>
    <P>In addition it must be remembered that the choice of accounting system remains a voluntary choice for each individual farmer and a considerable percentage of farmers are likely to remain on the full accounts system given that it has its own inherent advantages for farmers of a particular scale or in particular sectors.  Many farmers may require full accounts for other purposes such as banks etc.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="987" /> For these reasons the introduction of an additional system for the calculation of farmers' tax liabilities is not warranted.</P>

    <P>
      <i>Column (a)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i) The average tax payment for each year is obtained by dividing the net receipt of PAYE tax in each calendar year by the number of taxpaying units effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends, e.g. the 1989 net receipt is divided by the number liable to tax in 1989-90.</P>
    <P>(ii) The figures in column (a) of the table are based on income tax collected through the PAYE mechanism which covers more than income tax on ordinary wages and salaries.  It income tax paid by directors of close companies who are akin to the self-employed as well as tax on &ldquo;other income&rdquo; of employees such as rent and other investment income.  It also includes the tax paid under PAYE on the income from employment of farmers and other self-employed individuals.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (b)</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i) In calculating the figures in this column the estimated net receipt of income tax paid by full-time farmers in each calendar year has been divided by the number of full-time farming tax units which were formally assessed for tax on their farming profits in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends, e.g. the 1989 receipt is divided by the number assessed for the year 1989-90, irrespective of whether tax was actually payable in all cases.</P>
    <P>(ii) Unlike previous calculations, the current figures for averages do not take into account the tax attributable to the farming profits of farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession.  Farm tax represents a fraction of their overall tax liability and the emerging average farm tax payments could not be regarded as representative of the normal average tax yield from the farming sector.</P>
    <P>(iii) Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally and the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are, to some extent, estimated.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Column (c)</i>
    </P>
    <P>The figures contained in this column are obtained by dividing the estimated net receipt of income tax in each calendar year from tax units whose main sources of income is from selfemployment, other than full-time farming, by the estimated number of those units assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note (i) for column (b).</P>
    <P>
      <i>General notes</i>
    </P>
    <P>(i) A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband is counted as one tax unit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="990" /> (ii) Some figures in the columns differ from those given previously.  This is due to more accurate information becoming available in the meantime.</P>
    <P>(iii) Receipts of deposit interest retention tax and tax deducted by building societies under the former composite rate arrangements are not included in the calculations.  Basic data are not available which would enable the amounts of these taxes referable to interest paid or credited to particular classes of taxpayers to be ascertained.</P>
    <P>(iv) The yield in 1991 from farmers and other self-employed was reduced by the once-off effect of deferring payment of the balances of 1990-91 tax from 1991 to 1992.  Ordinarily these balances, amounting to about £50 million, would have been paid in 1991 but were deferred to 1992 as a transitional effect of introducing the Current Year Basis of assessment for self-employed persons in 1990.  The yield from farmers in 1991 was further reduced because of a decrease in farming profits.</P>
    <P>(v) For these calculations, the yields in 1993 and 1994 under the 15 per cent incentive amnesty in respect of declared amounts of income and gains has been attributed solely to the self-employed.  The breakdown of this yield between farmers and other self-employed is assumed <i>pro-rata</i> with their ordinary tax payments.</P>

    <P>A comparable figure is not available for community health services in 1974 as <Col N="992" /> the current method of classification of expenditure was not in operation at that stage.  It should be noted that a number of services previously delivered through the psychiatric programme have been transferred to other programmes in recent years.  Persons with mental handicap have been transferred to mental handicap centres under the community care or mental handicap services.  Many elderly patients have transferred from psychiatric hospitals to more suitable accommodation in homes for the elderly. A number of acute units have been opened in general hospitals to replace admission facilities in psychiatric hospitals.  It is not possible to provide definitive figures for expenditure on services for the elderly as they avail of a wide range of services spread through a number of programmes, which are also used by other client groups.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The question of opting for the contracting out of services, such as cleaning, laundry and catering services, is a matter for each health agency to evaluate in the context of ensuring maximum efficiency in the use of limited resources.  Such an evaluation must necessarily involve consideration of the standard and the quality of service concerned as well as the cost.  The only guidelines issued by my Department, in this regard, relate to the statutory obligations of employers to part-time employees where agencies were asked to ensure that contracts are not awarded to any company which is in breach of its statutory obligations or is considered to be taking measures to evade its obligations.</P>

    <P>All known landowners and occupiers of land in the candidate SACs will be notified and their views will be sought prior to the submission of the list to the Commission.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service Ranger Force started identifying landowners and occupiers in 1994 and this work is continuing.  To date approximately 70 per cent of landowners have been identified.</P>
    <P>Advertisements will be placed in newspapers notifying the general public. In addition, Government Departments, local authorities, the main farming bodies and non-governmental organisations will be advised.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 116, 119 and 124 together.</P>
      <P>The national fuel scheme assists householders who are in receipt of long term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their heating needs.  An applicant for a fuel allowance must also satisfy a means test to establish that he or she is unable to provide for his or her heating needs.  One fuel allowance is payable per household.  An applicant and his household who have a combined income, from any source of more than £5 a week above the relevant contributory social welfare income, will not qualify for the allowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Depending on their income, a person in receipt of an occupational pension <Col N="1008" /> may be entitled to receive an old age &mdash; non-contributory &mdash; pension from my Department.  In that event and where the other conditions are satisfied, they will qualify for the fuel scheme.</P>
    <P>Final figures for the cost of the 1994 fuel scheme are not yet available. However, the outturn is expected to be in the region of £40.3 million.  The estimated annual cost of increasing the weekly rate of fuel allowance by £1 is £7.3 million.  The estimated annual cost of increasing the £5 means limit to £10 is less than £100,000.  The estimated annual cost of increasing the £5 means limit of £15 is less than £200,000.</P>
    <P>The question of increasing the limit for additional income and extending the scheme to additional groups not currently covered would have financial implications which would have to be considered in the light of available resources.</P>

      <P>The free schemes administered by my Department include free travel, free electricity allowance, free natural gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence.  They are available in the case of free travel to all persons in the State, aged 66 years and over, and to certain disabled people under age 66 and, in the case of the other schemes, to persons who are in receipt of a welfare-type payment and who are either living alone or who otherwise satisfy the living alone condition.</P>
      <P>The free schemes are intended to serve specific purposes in relation to the people who are entitled to them.  Free travel is intended to encourage the elderly or disabled to remain active in the community, while the free electricity allowance, free natural gas allowance, free telephone rental allowance and the free television licence schemes are designed to encourage elderly or disabled people who are living alone, on limited means, to continue to live in their homes and to provide them with an element of security.</P>
      <P>The annual cost of the free schemes is of the order of £90 million.  Improvements and enhancements of those schemes are considered in the light of perceived need and the availability of additional financial resources.  Consequently, the extension of the existing schemes to groups of recipients not already covered, such as widows, widowers, and those on public service occupational sickness pensions, would have to be considered in that context.</P>

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions (or 24 in the case of a retirement pension) registered since January 1953 (when the unified system of social insurance came into effect), or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>The yearly average condition gives rise to particular problems for people with gaps in their insurance records. While a number of these problems have been addressed by my Department in recent years, the National Pensions Board (NPB) report recommended a <i>pro-rata</i> pensions scheme which, in their view, would resolve the problems arising from gaps in coverage in a more comprehensive way.</P>
      <P>The NPB report recommended, <i>inter alia,</i> a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured lifetime, where, for example an average of 45 or over (as against 48 at present) would qualify a person for the maximum rate of pension while a minimum 30 per cent of full rate pension would be payable for an average of ten to 14 contributions.  They also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for retirement and old age contributory pension be increased from 156 (three years) to 520 contributions (ten years).  As such proposals could lead to a reduction in entitlement for future pensioners, when compared with present arrangements, they have to be evaluated very carefully.</P>
      <P>The NPB report, which is both comprehensive and complex, is at present being studied in detail within my Department and I intend to bring forward proposals on the issues addressed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Under the supplementary allowance scheme, health boards may pay a weekly supplement towards the rent costs of persons whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.  The supplement is calculated so as to leave the client with a disposable income, <Col N="1014" /> after payment of rent, which is equivalent to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to his family size less £6.</P>
      <P>In assessing the level of rent supplement payable, health boards are required to take into consideration the accommodation needs of the applicant, the prevailing level of rents in the area for the family size and the type of accommodation sought.  This method of determining rent applies in all health board areas and limits may be set by reference to what is considered a reasonable level of rent for the particular area. The setting of any local limits is a matter for each health board.  In setting such limits the board would always retain the right to make payments in excess of the limits where there are exceptional circumstances.</P>
      <P>There is nothing in the guidelines issued by my Department which would prevent the payment of a supplement where a client changes address and decisions of health boards in respect of the new accommodation would be taken on the basis of the considerations already outlined.</P>
      <P>In relation to any decision on entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance, the client has a right of appeal to the appeals officer of the health board. My Department has been in touch with the Eastern Health Board who have no knowledge of any case corresponding to that described in the Deputy's question. However, if the Deputy has a particular case in mind with which there are difficulties, I will be glad to ask the health board to have it examined.</P>

      <P>In their review of Bord Fáilte, Arthur D. Little anticipated that, beyond 1999, project developers may have to rely far more on commercial sources of funds, provided primarily on estimates of commercial value.  The consultants added that making the current grant allocation process more commercial in its execution would help project developers adapt to these future requirements and become more profit-ability-driven and self-reliant.  I fully agree with their views.</P>
      <P>The proposed new process for the management of European Regional Development Fund funds for private sector product development projects is, therefore, an evolution of the former system designed to reflect these new realities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Overall appraisal and assessment of financial viability will in future be functions of a third party commercial body with a demonstrable track-record in <Col N="1016" /> project assessment and investment skills.  An important input into its overall assessment function will, of course, be BFE's and Shannon Development's role in advising on whether or not proposals fit the tourism strategy for Ireland and are supported by suitable marketing.  Ultimately, however, decisions on whether projects will be supported or not will be taken only by the new management boards which have been appointed for this purpose and which the third-party commercial body will service in its overall project appraisal role.</P>
    <P>Given the rationale behind the new process, any third-party commercial body involved will require the key investment-related profile and experience I have described and will most likely, therefore, be found in the banking and investment trust community. Suitable arrangements to select the most appropriate body for the purpose will be undertaken under the direction of the Steering Committee which has been established to see through the Bord Fáilte changes.  In the interim, to facilitate investment activity, the Management Boards will be serviced fully by BFE and Shannon Development.</P>

      <P>I am aware that reservations have been expressed in certain quarters about the dangers of uncontrolled tourism growth.  These fears are understandable in the light of the experience of other tourism destinations, but I believe we have a sufficient awareness of the danger and adequate mechanisms in place to avoid the pitfalls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1017" /> Ireland is not, nor do we want to be, a mass tourism destination.  One of our major tourism strengths is our green and clean environment.  We have a low population density with large open spaces, uncrowded roads and areas of great scenic beauty.  Clearly, if we are to develop a sustainable tourism industry, we must preserve and enhance that which attracts visitors in the first instance.</P>
    <P>To this end, the Operational Programme for Tourism, 1994-1999, acknowledges that a balance must be struck between development and conservation. The targets set for the industry in the programme aim to maximise Ireland's tourism potential by increasing revenue which will, in turn, create much needed employment.  In continuing to expand, develop and market the Irish tourism product, my aim will be to attract the more discerning and high-spending visitor.  Furthermore, the Operational Programme for Tourism aims to increase the proportion of non-peak visitors from its current level of 60 per cent to 66 per cent.  At present, a disproportionate number of our visitors arrive in July and August.  Measures that will help to achieve this include marketing campaigns focused on specific product areas, such as golf, equestrian, sales meetings and conferences and city weekend breaks and festivals. The proposed national convention centre will, of course, have an important impact in this context.</P>

      <P>The Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council have just reported to me in relation to their review of Irish science and technology policy as a whole.  There is a separate working group established by my Department specifically to examine the feasibility of setting up a science and technology park in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>This latter working group is still considering the issue but I expect it to make a report on the matter very shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I expect that the group will, in their report, address the issues of potential funding for such a development as well <Col N="1020" /> as possible sites, having regard to existing and planned public and private sector industrial development in the Dublin area over the next few years.</P>

      <P>The EU Horizon Initiative operated from 1992 to 1994 and supported innovative pilot projects over a defined period.</P>
      <P>It was made clear to all project promoters at the outset that the funding period was finite.  All promoters were also made aware of the essential difference between funding under the Horizon Initiative and assistance funded through mainstream national programmes. Under the criteria for funding as set out by the European Commission no Horizon project may receive continuous funding from the European Social Fund on completion of the pilot phase.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, Horizon funding was not withdrawn from the project in question. Like all 95 Horizon projects which were cofunded in the 1992 to 1994 phase of the programme the St. Michael's House project completed the full pilot phase.  The first Horizon programme ceased to be operational at the end of 1994.  A new set of human resources community initiatives which will include an Horizon programme, will be operational in the course of this year.  My Department is now involved in a national information campaign to publicise the EU human resources initiat-ives to prospective participants.</P>

      <P>There were 198 officers of the Permanent Defence Force serving in acting ranks on 31 December, 1994.  A breakdown on this number by rank, Corps and Command is given in the schedule which I will circulate with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Promotion to acting rank, mainly arises when officers are promoted to fill temporary vacancies created by the assignment of personnel on duty overseas with United Nations, European Union or other missions.  Officers so promoted are normally made substantive in their new rank after a period of service in an acting capacity.  Pay and allowances are the same for acting and substantive ranks.</P>
      <P>On 31 December, 1994, 24 officers of the Permanent Defence Force were serving beyond normal retirement age. A breakdown of this number by rank, Corps and Command is given in the attached schedule.</P>
