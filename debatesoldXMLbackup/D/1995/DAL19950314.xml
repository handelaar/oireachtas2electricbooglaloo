    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1, 39, 147 and 148 together.</P>
      <P>In September last year, my predecessor, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, requested Mr. Kieran Mulvey, chief executive of the Labour Relations Commission to assist, in a personal capacity, in efforts to resolve the dispute in the Garda Representative Association. Both sides in the dispute, the Garda Representative Association and the Garda Federation, agreed to Mr. Mulvey's appointment.  On 27 October 1994, Mr. Mulvey, having had a series of meetings with the groups involved, submitted a report containing his recommendations for settling the dispute.</P>
      <P>In December 1994, the Garda Federation, following a ballot of their entire membership, voted to accept the Mulvey report in full.  The Garda Representative Association convened a special delegate conference on 24 January 1995 to discuss the Mulvey report.  That conference voted to reject the findings of the Mulvey report with the exception of two minor proposals.</P>
      <P>The sides involved in the dipute appear to be as far apart now as they ever were.  In fact, the situation worsened recently when a third group, representing members of the Garda Representative Association in four Garda divisions, became involved in the dispute. This group is in favour of the acceptance of the Mulvey report.</P>
      <P>I invited all sides in the Garda dispute to meet me on 22 February last, so that I could fully understand each sides position. I listened attentively to what was said and I have since given the problem careful consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have invited the representatives of the three groups concerned in the dispute to meet me again on Monday next, 20 March 1995, for further discussions with a view to resolving the differences between them.  Proposals which I might <Col N="1123" /> put forward to settle the dispute will be based on the long standing premise of one association which will represent all members of the Force at the garda rank in relation to pay and conditions.  As I have invited the Garda Representative Association, the Garda Federation and the third group to meet me I am anxious to put my proposals to them first, as would be the normal practice in disputes of this kind.</P>
    <P>The attainment of success will require tolerance of differing viewpoints and a willingness on all sides to reach an acceptable settlement.  I will do my best to encourage a positive approach by all sides.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the Mulvey report in its totality and that morale within the Garda Síochána is approaching an all time low, as witnessed by the disputes between the lower and senior ranks about the recent Lansdowne Road fiasco?  Does she further accept it is her responsibility to ensure that one unified body is put in place without further delay in the interests of morale within the force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Federation has accepted the proposals in the Mulvey report and the four divisions have indicated their support for them. However, the Garda Representative Association rejected them.  I am endeavouring to find a positive solution to the dispute within the Garda so that further divisions are not created.  The Garda Representative Association has accepted elements of the Mulvey report.  I hope that when I meet it again next week we can move forward, under proposals which I will put to it, in resolving this dispute which has given rise to low morale among a large number of gardaí who no longer feel they are represented by the Garda Representative Association, because it is my job to ensure that all gardaí are represented by it.  At present approximately 9,500 gardaí deserve representation.  The <Col N="1124" /> Garda Federation represents approximately 2,300 gardaí while the new group represents approximately 1,000.  I do not want to impose a solution which will further exacerbate this problem.  I want to approach it in a positive way to ensure a resolution.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of the view that internal discipline within the GRA should be modelled on discipline within the force?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know if the Deputy is referring to some particular element where there is a lack of discipline. The Garda Representative Association was set up under the 1977 Garda Act.  One of the reasons the dispute arose was that elements of the Garda believed that the association was not representing them properly.  Last July a number of gardaí withdrew from the executive because of differences with other members.  Any solution to the problem will have to involve a recognition by the Garda Representative Association that it must represent all gardaí and that if changes need to be made in the way committees are elected and appointments are made then they will have to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say why certain members felt that the Garda Representative Association was not representing them adequately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy knows the answer to that question.  It would not be helpful for me to rehash the newspaper reports about the dispute between various elements of the Garda. Suffice it to say that I am very disturbed that this dispute is continuing.  Like other Members, I was extremely disturbed by the scenes at last year's Garda Representative Association Conference in Galway and I want to ensure that similar scenes do not recur.  My motivation in meeting the Garda Representative Association, the Garda Federation and the other group last week and next week is to try to find a resolution to this <Col N="1125" /> dispute as quickly as possible so that gardaí will have an effective representative body.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 27 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda Authorities that on 26 February 1995 a bale was located by a local person on the shore at Fanore.  County Clare.  The bale, which had apparently been washed up, contained approximately 20 constituent packages weighing 20 kilogrammes in total.  Tests carried out at the Forensic Science Laboratory indicate that the substance contained in these packages is cocaine.  The investigation is, of course, at an early stage and it is not yet known where the bale originated. However, because of the significant size of the find the Garda consider it most unlikely that the drugs were destined for the domestic market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The find in County Clare once again reminds us of the need for constant vigilance when it comes to drugs trafficking. This applies equally to whether drugs are intended for the domestic market or, alternatively, imported for transhipment to elsewhere in Europe or other countries.  In each case, it is imperative that all possible measures be taken to prevent the importation of this <Col N="1126" /> lethal cargo.  In so far as the law enforcement agencies are concerned, we will not become a soft touch for drug traffickers who may entertain notions that we are a convenient back-door to Europe.  We have an international responsibility and we take it seriously.</P>
    <P>I am aware that from time to time fears have been expressed with regard to the vulnerability of the south-south west coastline which is very long and has many remote piers, coves and other scheduled areas.  For this reason, it has been the subject of special attention from the various law enforcement agencies concerned.  In so far as the gardaí are concerned, there is a strong emphasis in the divisions along the seaboard on the problem of drug trafficking and gardaí have received specialised training.</P>
    <P>I know that there has been some public concern about the level of co-ordination between the various law enforcement agencies charged with the fight against drugs.  For this reason, a senior official at the Department of Justice is finalising a report designed to identify the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem.  I intend to bring proposals to Government very shortly based on the report.</P>
    <P>While I cannot, of course, set out today what these proposals will be, I can respond to the question as to whether a drugs enforcement agency should be established.  This matter was considered in detail by my predecessor and, having looked at it afresh.  I have come to the same conclusion as she did.  I am not convinced that the establishment of a separate drugs enforcement agency would be appropriate to the drugs situation as it pertains in this country.  For this reason, my proposals will be designed to enhance the co-operation and effectiveness of the existing law enforcement agencies.  To this end, I will bring forward practical proposals designed to ensure maximum co-ordination and co-operation between the Garda, the Customs and Excise Service and the Defence Forces in the fight <Col N="1127" /> against drug trafficking.  I should also add that Ireland is a party to the Europol Drugs Unit which exchanges information and intelligence about the movement of drugs.  We have a full time liaison officer in that unit in The Hague.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept the assertion by the Cork State solicitor that anti-drug teams are starved of resources and, if so, what does she intend to do about this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Garda Commissioner has assured me that any resources required by the drugs teams are made available.  I do not believe, however, the present system can be absolutely watertight to prevent the drug hauls that are coming into the country.  I commend the gardaí on the number of major drug seizures in recent months.  My objective in bringing proposals to the Government will be to ensure that every possible resource required to rid us of the scourge of illegal drugs will be given to the gardaí and the other agencies involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept reports, for example, that a customs work to rule has resulted in overtime being eliminated and that numbers in the Drugs Squad have been reduced by two?  How can she say this is consistent with a genuine attempt to prevent the importation of drugs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have to table separate questions to the Minister for Finance on the issue regarding customs as it is not my responsibility.  With regard to the changes in the deployment of gardaí, it is a matter for the Garda Commissioner to decide how manpower is deployed within the force.  If the Deputy wants to highlight a particular instance I will be glad to talk to him about it later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that there is what is perceived as <Col N="1128" /> faction fighting between the various authorities fighting drug trafficking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I have heard reports going back some time of a lack of cohesion between the services fighting the importation of illegal drugs through ports around Cork and Clare.  That is why I am determined to ensure this kind of cohesive co-ordinated approach is introduced as soon as possible so that there cannot be any criticism of gaps in the system that allow such reports to emanate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 31 together.</P>
      <P>Where a complaint or allegation is made to the gardaí on child abuse, a detailed investigation is always carried out.  Arising from this investigation, the gardaí will refer the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions if the evidence supports such action.  However, in certain exceptional cases where there is reason to believe that the suspect may abscond, the gardaí may arrest and charge the suspect without first obtaining the directions of the DPP.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that not all cases reported to the gardaí will, ultimately, be referred to the DPP.  For <Col N="1129" /> instance, some allegations may be withdrawn. In other cases, despite exhaustive investigation on the part of the gardaí, there will be little or no evidence to sustain a prosecution.</P>
    <P>Where the evidence is deemed sufficient, a file is forwarded to the DPP for a decision as to whether a prosecution should be instituted.  Having examined the investigation file, the DPP will then decide whether a prosecution should be taken.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, the process of investigation and referring the matter to the DPP will almost inevitably result in a lesser number of cases ultimately being the subject of a prosecution as compared to the number of complaints originally made to the gardaí.  This is not due to any discrepancy but rather to the fact in this, as in other forms of crime, cases go to court only where the evidence is sufficient to support such a course of action.</P>
    <P>The fact that not all complaints of child abuse ultimately result in a prosecution should not, of course, deter anyone from making such a complaint.  It is important that all such complaints are brought to the attention of the gardaí.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the gap between the number of validated allegations and prosecutions brought represents a failure of child protection in this State and that there is a need for a review of the guidelines used by the Director of Public Prosecutions in making a decision on whether to proceed with a case to trial? I refer the Minister to the 1993 annual report of the Garda Síochána in which it is stated that out of a total of 552 sexual offences, including children and adults, reported to the Garda, the State achieved only 17 convictions even though 232 proceeded to trial.  I put it to the Minister that the whole area of non-prosecution of sexual allegations &mdash; allegations of sexual abuse and sexual crimes &mdash; needs to be reviewed by this House in the context of the operation of the DPP's office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1130" />
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the work of the DPP is independent of me or any Minister for Justice.  I share the Deputy's concern about the gap between the number of allegations made and the number of prosecutions, but it is a matter for the DPP to decide when prosecutions will be taken.  On the later question I will deal with the machanisms whereby the gardaí and other agencies relate to child sexual abuse reports.</P>
      <P>I am not happy with the way statistics and information have been gathered in recent years.  The Garda research unit which was set up last year will assist greatly in ensuring that this type of question can be answered more fully and realistically.  The introduction of technology into the Garda will ensure that such statistics are broken down in a way that makes it possible for us to take the necessary action.</P>
      <P>The statistics in question do not use the term &ldquo;child abuse&rdquo;, nor do they refer to a specific crime.  In 1992 there were 225 crimes against children, in 1993 there were 243 and in 1994 there were 249, but they cover a number of categories of crime against children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The statistics in the 1993 report refers to all victims &mdash; adults and children &mdash; unless otherwise stated.  In 1993 there were 40 proceedings taken for rape, 174 for indecent assault on females, six for defilement of girls under 15 years, five for defilement of girls between the ages of 15 and 17 and seven under incest.  There were 143 reported offences of rape in that year, and 40 proceedings were taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information, but I will communicate with the Deputy in that regard.  I have information only on the number of offences <Col N="1131" /> and prosecutions taken.  I am not satisfied that in answering questions relating to statistics it has ever been possible for Ministers to be as specific as they should be and I have taken action to ensure such statistics are more readily available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that no arm of the criminal justice system, particularly the DPP's office, should be independent and thus incapable of review?

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can answer part of the Deputy's question, although I have information about the case to which she refers.  Up to 1974 the Attorney General was also the public prosecutor in Ireland.  In 1974 the Government decided to remove prosecutions from the political arena and did so through the Prosecution of Offences Act, 1974 by creating an office of the Director of Public Prosecutions which is totally independent.  Accordingly, the director is completely independent in the exercise of his functions and any changes we wish to bring about would require changes in legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister for <Col N="1132" /> Justice agree that it would be appropriate for the Director of Public Prosecutions to appeal against the mitigation of this sentence by the court today on the grounds of leniency?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Seán Treacy">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me comment in a general way on the powers of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The DPP has powers to appeal against a lenient sentence provided it comes from a trial court.  The case in question today has come from an appeal court and, therefore, he has no power to appeal.</P>

      <AskConj>asked the </AskConj>

      <Quest>if she will introduce legislation giving new powers of arrest to the Garda in cases of domestic violence; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that existing powers of arrest for the Garda in domestic violence cases need to be clarified and extended.</P>
      <P>I am at present in consultation with the Minister for Equality and Law Reform about the form of a section, dealing with the powers of arrest for gardaí in domestic violence cases, to be included in a domestic violence Bill which he will introduce shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can inform the House that in 1994 the Garda Commissioner issued a policy document on the procedures to be followed by the Garda in incidents of domestic violence.  This policy document sets out the manner in which investigations should be conducted, and reported.  It also states that where a power of arrest exists in respect of a domestic violence incident, that power <Col N="1133" /> should be exercised and the offender charged.</P>
    <P>In relation to powers of arrest generally I am currently discussing with the Attorney General the text of a criminal law Bill, the aim of which is to update and clarify the law in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the primary difficulty seems to be that offences are classified as misdemeanours and felonies and that it is not possible to arrest on foot of a misdemeanour?  Will the Minister accept that it would be preferable to have offences classified as arrestable and non-arrestable offences without further delay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the existing laws, which in many cases date back to the last century, require updating and clarification.  This we are proposing to achieve through the domestic violence legislation to be introduced by the Minister for Equality and Law Reform.  The powers of entry to premises without a warrant are tied into arrest laws, and this matter will also be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that legislation already exists under which the Garda can exercise powers of arrest, for example, the Family Law (Protection of Spouses and Children) Act, 1981, the Criminal Damage Act, 1991, the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, section 18, the common law breach of peace, the Dublin Police Act, 1842 and the Criminal Law (Rape) (Amendment) Act, 1990 which abolished any rule of law by virtue of which a man could not be guilty of the rape of his wife.  The document which the Garda Commissioner has circulated to all Garda stations has spelt out clearly for the Garda what their powers are and also instructs that where a power of arrest exists the arresting member will utilise his or her power to arrest and charge the offender.  Deputies will note that often in cases of domestic violence <Col N="1134" /> it happens that when the Garda arrive one or other person in the midst of that violence asks the gardaí not to arrest, and that must be taken into account. There are at least protocols for the Garda to fulfil and the Commissioner keeps a constant watch on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider it beneficial to have a system of mandatory Garda recording of incidents of domestic violence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an area of crime that has not been properly recorded.  It is mainly voluntary groups who have made available most of the information on which we work.  That is why I am anxious to ensure that recording and statistics-gathering are more effectively done than has been the case for a long time.  I hope over the next year there will be changes in that area.</P>

    <P>Successive Ministers for Justice have ensured that they have had the required manpower and resources to enable them to enforce the road traffic laws effectively.  The DMA traffic corps has 50 vehicles, including 28 motor cycles, assigned to it.  Outside the DMA the traffic corps has 55 vehicles of which five are motor cycles.  I intend to ensure that the corps continue to be adequately resourced to carry out its all-important traffic functions properly.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that gardaí in the traffic corps do not deal solely with traffic related matters.  Although their primary responsibility is accident prevention and traffic control, members of the traffic corps must deal with all matters requiring Garda attention.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has in mind the suggestion made in 1980 of an &ldquo;enforcement corps&rdquo; which would be distinct from the main body of gardaí, I am sure that the existing arrangement which allows the traffic corps to deal with crime other than traffic related crime is more beneficial to the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that a visit to any sitting of a District Court in the city will show ranks of gardaí spending valuable working hours waiting to give evidence about minor traffic offences?  In that context would the Minister consider my suggestion which would have the benefit of releasing gardaí into the community to carry out valuable policing work at a time when there is serious crime on the streets of our cities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Gardaí are being held up unnecessarily in the courts system. <Col N="1136" /> However, there are proposals in my Department to change the law with regard to the use of witnesses, statements, etc., in the courts.  I share the Deputy's concern that too much Garda time is spent waiting around in the courts but the problem is wider than that.  It has to do with the backlog of cases that has built up in the courts over a number of years, and that is being tackled.  The concept the Deputy is asking for already exists, but it is more effective to have a traffic corps that can also work on other crimes rather than a dedicated traffic corps that cannot also deal with ordinary crime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister at least accept that lay personnel might be more widely used to administer the present traffic corps, thereby releasing gardaí into the community to carry out police work?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>There are already 700 civilian clerical staff employed in the Garda Síochána, and I have resources in my budget this year to increase that by another 200 over the next two years. That will release personnel to go on the beat and do Garda work that is more in keeping with the expectations of the public.  The work being done by gardaí in offices is essential but it can be done by civilians and that is why I am continuing the programme of civilianisation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the hundreds of miles of clearways, bus lanes, single and double yellow lines, and the thousands of parking meters, would the Minister not agree that the traffic corps is the cinderella of the Department of Justice?  I do not know when the Minister last travelled on a bus in the morning or evening when people are not supposed to enter bus ways or clearways, or when she last saw a garda on duty at those times.  The problem is that gardaí are moved between the traffic division and fighting crime which the Department views as a more serious priority.  Would the Minister not agree that it would be <Col N="1137" /> a step in the right direction if the traffic corps were to be given a distinctive role and wore a distinctly different uniform from the ordinary garda on the beat?</P>

      <P>Does the Minister accept that persons charged with certain minor road traffic offences should not end up in court and that it is a waste of Garda time that evidence has to be given in court?  She should change the legislation to provide for on the spot fines in respect of such offences.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister consider granting greater powers to traffic wardens who, for example, cannot prosecute a motorist if they enter a busway or for a wide range of other offences.  If they were granted more powers it could mark the beginning of a good partnership with the Garda Síochána.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The traffic warden system operates effectively, too effectively for many motorists who wish that traffic wardens did not exist, particularly when they receive a ticket.  As traffic wardens do not form part of the Garda Síochána it would be necessary to introduce legislation to extend their powers.  I will consider this.</P>

Because of long delays in the courts system many gardaí spend many hours participating in such cases.

      <Quest>the progress, if any, that has been made with regard to the proposed reform of legislation in relation to non-nationals promised in the programme A Government of Renewal; the proposals, if any, she has in this regard; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 29 together.  The Government's programme includes a commitment to &ldquo;accelerate the proposed reform of the non-nationals legislation, having regard to the Maastricht Treaty, so as to provide comprehensive legislation on the rights of non-nationals generally&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The House will recall that an interdepartmental committee was established in 1993 to examine this area with the following terms of reference:</P>
      <P>to examine and re-state present policy and practice in relation to the admission to residence and right of work in the State of EU and non-EU nationals from the point of view of</P>
      <P>&mdash;general aims of policy;</P>
      <P>&mdash;clarity;</P>
      <P>&mdash;consistency;</P>
      <P>&mdash;efficiency of application;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" />&mdash;appeals mechanisms; </P>
    <P>to examine, in particular, the transparency and efficiency of arrangements which exist for dealing with special categories of immigrant e.g. asylum seekers, refugees;</P>
    <P>to make such recommendations as are necessary for the development of a system of treatment of immigrants which is consistent and transparent, having due regard to the commitment in respect of refugees and asylum seekers which is contained in the Programme for Government;</P>
    <P>to make recommendations on the most feasible way of dealing with the problem of immigrants who have illegally resided in the State for considerable periods of time.</P>
    <P>The committee has already presented its report on applications for refugee status etc. and that report formed the basis for the Refugee Bill which is currently before the House.  The terms of that Bill are being examined in the light of suggestions put forward during the Second and Committee Stage debates and in the light of the Government's commitment to which I have already referred.  When the Government has decided on what changes should be made arrangements for dealing with the matter will be decided by the Whips.</P>
    <P>Since completing its report on refugees issues the interdepartmental committee has continued its examination of the remainder of its terms of reference, which include both the specific issue of immigrants who have resided illegally in the State, referred to in this question and the general question of the rights of non-nationals, referred to in Question No. 29.  I expect to receive a further report from the Committee shortly dealing with these matters.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Government's consideration and decisions on the matters should be informed by that report, especially as the committee received submissions and held meetings with <Col N="1140" /> individuals and agencies with an interest in these matters.</P>
    <P>With regard to an estimate of the number of illegal immigrants currently in the State, it is very difficult to quantify the numbers involved because their presence is often unknown to the authorities. It is the nature of the situation that immigrants who are here illegally generally do what they can to conceal their presence from the authorities.  In the circumstances, I am not in a position to give an estimate of the number involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister is not in a position to do so.  I offer an estimate of 10,000 illegal immigrants.  I am surprised the Minister is so shocked by this figure.  It is difficult to give an accurate figure because of their illegal status. While she waits for the interdepartmental committee to present its report will the Minister offer her own view on the plight of illegal immigrants, non-EU nationals, and does she agree that they are a mirror image of Irish illegal immigrants in other countries, particularly the United States of America?  Does she further agree that they are confronted with the same problems?  For example, they are open to blackmail and exploitation as cheap labour and suffer poor health as they are afraid to attend doctors or hospitals, many find themselves in complicated loving relationships with Irish partners.  We must regularise the position of those who have been living here for five years or more with no criminal record either here or in their country of origin.  The best way to proceed would be to provide for an amnesty</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to give an estimate of the number involved.  I do not know from where the Deputy got the figure of 10,000 unless &mdash; I am not being facetious &mdash; he knows them all.  I do not know if the number is 5,000 or 10,000.  The number of registered legal immigrants is approximately 33,000.  It is appropriate that I wait for the interdepartmental committee to present its <Col N="1141" /> proposals.  We can only give an estimate based on the number who apply for a residency or work permit or refugee status.  In 1991, 31 people applied for refugee status, 39 in 1992, 91 in 1993 and 355 in 1994 when a large number of Cubans arrived in this country.  They are still here.  I share the Deputy's concern, as I did when I was my party's spokesperson on Foreign Affairs, about the way we treat illegal immigrants.  When passed the Refugee Bill will tackle a number of the problems whereby illegal immigrants tend to find themselves in prison before being deported without any proper mechanism under which they can make their case.  When the interdepartmental committee presents its report I will present proposals to the Government and, in turn, the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Following police raids on restaurants, building sites and other locations illegal immigrants have been speedily deported.  Because we have failed to tackle this problem does the Minister agree there are many illegal immigrants who would like to pay taxes and social welfare contributions to the State and who would be first class citizens? Does she further agree that the majority of illegal immigrants would like to have their position regularised but believe that if they apply for a residency or work permit and are refused they will be summarily deported?  Will the Minister agree to publish the guidelines for granting immigration visas &mdash; I have had unfortunate experiences of dealing with visa issues involving immigrants living in my constituency &mdash; so that we can see how the system works?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can make available to the Deputy the regulations relating to the naturalisation of people here.  Many people call to the Department of Justice every day looking for a copy of those regulations.  People who have been in this country as an illegal immigrant for the number of years to which the Deputy referred should have the facility to apply for naturalisation.  If the Deputy is talking about people who <Col N="1142" /> have lived here for five years, they have already fulfilled that particular requirement. People who have been illegally resident here for a number of years know that when their records are examined and all the various mechanisms of obtaining police reports, etc., have been gone through, which is a standard condition, their record will not look favourable because they arrived here illegally and have continued to stay here illegally.  I assure the Deputy that I am carefully examining the backlog of cases in my Department &mdash; they were on my desk when I took office &mdash; that were not handled in previous years.  I will be looking at those cases as sympathetically as I can.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that although we are adhering to our international obligations in regard to asylum seekers and refugees, there has been an absence of policy debate on the whole area of non-nationals and the third pillar of Maastricht?  Will she agree that because all the policy formulation is done at intergovernmental level by the Council of Ministers there has been a lack of debate in this House or the whole area of dealing with non-nationals in the context of the removal of borders in Europe?  Will she further comment on the perception over the years that because of this policy vacuum there has been an obsessively secret and xenophobic attitude in the Department of Justice to the whole issue of non-nationals which needs to be addressed in the context of the newer Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject any implication by the Deputy that there are xenophobic officials in my Department.  The officials operate the system as laid down by the regulations for them.  I am sure the Deputy did not mean to be offensive to any officials in the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to a <Col N="1143" /> xenophobic attitude in the Department of Justice.  There is a system in place but I agree that it has been difficult to find out how the system operates.  With regard to the third pillar, I met my colleagues, the other Council Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs last Thursday and Friday, to discuss a number of these issues including that of asylum seekers. There are divergent opinions among a number of the EU members.  We take a particular view, because of our geographical and historical position, that other countries may not have the luxury of taking.  There are also countries in Europe bordering other countries that have hundreds of thousands of immigrants coming across their borders.  We do not have to face that problem but I am satisfied that when the interdepartmental committee reports to me we will see an opening up of the whole system. I hope also that we will shortly rid the Department of the backlog of applications and get the system into place whereby people will not have to wait many years for decisions to be made on their applications.</P>

There are <Col N="1144" /> 33,000 legal immigrants here and, as I already told the House, 355 people applied for refugee status in 1994.  I do not yet have figures for 1995.  In regard to the number of applications for naturalisation there is a backlog in the Department of approximately 1,000 applications for various forms of naturalisation. Not all those people would be illegal immigrants but they have fulfilled the conditions of residency, etc.  Those applications are dealt with on a day-to-day basis.</P>

There were many people present in the Council Chamber when we were discussing it, including many journalists.

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>In our prison system we operate a more humane regime for offenders and their visitors than exists in many other countries.  There is little doubt but that in some prisons visitors are abusing visiting arrangements by passing illegal drugs on visits, and that offenders are abusing free association within the prison by passing drugs to one another.</P>
      <P>It is important, first, to make the point that the availability of drugs is a problem for the general community and not just the prisons.  Deputies will be aware that I am putting in place a strategy to tackle the wider drugs problem in the community.  Success with this strategy will clearly have benefits in restricting the supply of illegal drugs not only to our prisons but also to society in general.</P>
      <P>It would be possible to restrict the regime for prisoners in such a way as to virtually eliminate the availability of drugs in prison.  That revised regime, however, would have to include severe restrictions on free association between prisoners, more frequent searches of cells and prisoners, including strip-searches, the searching of all visitors, including children, to prisons, the erection of barriers between prisoners and all visitors to prevent personal contact, even with children, and the introduction of more intrusive technology.  While we will all accept that the drugs problem in prisons is a most serious one I do not believe that we would be justified in introducing so restrictive and inhumane a regime, which would punish the families and friends as well as the prisoners, and could cause irreparable harm to relationships with families, including children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not to suggest that we can do nothing.  Steps which are being taken to keep drugs out of the prisons include a <Col N="1147" /> high level of staff vigilance, closed circuit video surveillance of visits, screening of prisoners after visits and regular searches of the prisons.</P>
    <P>I should like to draw attention again to the Department's policy document, &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo;, which was published in June last, which contains in chapter 13 a discussion of the problem.  The document indicated that it was planned, through the medium of the departmental steering committee which is in place to implement the recommendations of the advisory committee on communicable diseases in prisons, to carry out a full review to establish how best to manage the problems of both the access to drugs and the treatment &mdash; rehabilitation of drug-addicted offenders.</P>
    <P>The committee is active in dealing with the issue.  One of the options it is considering is the establishment of drug-free units in the prisons.  These units can be an effective catalyst in breaking the drug habit.  The prison medical director, and other senior officials, have visited drug-free units in England and a number of prisons in the Netherlands to review drug free units there and to see how they might be adopted here.  The committee is looking at the possibilities offered by controlled methadone maintenance treatment programmes.</P>
    <P>It is also examining limited control arrangements which would help in containing the problem without making prison regimes unduly harsh.  I announced in Cork recently an initiative of this kind to deal with a particular problem in Cork prison.  What is happening is that small packets of drugs are being thrown over the wall of the main exercise yard from the outside where they are being collected by prisoners on exercise before staff can intercept them.  To counteract this it has been decided to cover the yard with special fine mesh netting, install closed circuit TV cameras on the perimeter wall and erect a security fence outside the perimeter wall to limit unauthorised access.  These <Col N="1148" /> measures should work for that particular problem.  So far as other prisons are concerned specific, targeted measures of the same kind are also being considered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that some prisoners who are drug abusers may not tell the prison authorities they are HIV positive, thereby creating a danger for other prisoners? In this context it is desirable that, at the very least, there would be a separate wing for prisoners who are drug abusers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The advisory committee on communicable diseases in prisons made a number of recommendations, including video surveillance, prosecution of those who attempt to smuggle drugs and disciplinary action against prisoners found with drugs.  There are special arrangements in prisons to deal with people who are HIV positive.  One cannot force somebody to tell the truth when giving information as a prisoner, but every effort is made to ascertain whether a prisoner has a particular medical problem that needs special attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept, given that one-third of male prisoners in Mountjoy are IV drug users and 75 per cent of women prisoners in Mountjoy are heroin addicts, it is time to review the current system with a view to containing the problem?  Will she agree it is high time this category of convict is dealt with in a focused and targeted way, if necessary, by segregation and certainly by the introduction of a <Col N="1149" /> detoxification programme within prisons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree the existence of drugs in prisons is a matter of great concern. The problem has existed for some time and, sadly, exists in many prisons throughout the world.  At present 40 per cent of all inmates in the Irish prison system are known to have a history of serious drug abuse.  Many prisoners come into prisons as drug abusers, they are not there pedalling drugs.  Most women prisoners also have a history of serious drug abuse.  At any time up to one in eight of the 7,000-plus known drug addicts is an inmate in our prison system.  I agree with Deputies &mdash; I have expressed similar concerns &mdash; we must find mechanisms to prevent drugs getting into prisons and to allow prisoners who come in with a drug abuse habit to use their time in prison to break that habit so that they will come out clean.  A number of recommendations have been put forward by the Advisory Committee on Communicable Diseases in prisons such as the enhancement of video surveillance, possible prosecution of those who attempt to smuggle drugs into prison and disciplinary action against prisoners found with drugs.  Those recommendations are already being acted on in our prisons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot help but smile at what is going on in Cork where a net is needed to prevent drugs being thrown over the prison wall.  Presumably guns and knives may also be thrown over the wall to prisoners, which is crazy.  There are enough groups talking about how to deal with the problem.  It can be relatively simply solved by placing a drugs team in Mountjoy Prison and prescribing physeptone.  However, that alone would not be sufficient.  We would need satellite clinics, community drugs teams and an expanded Merchants Quay centre to help stabilised drug users who are sent back to the community, otherwise the problem will increase.  Will the Minister agree we should stop playing games <Col N="1150" /> with the drugs problem?  It could be easily solved by the method I mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's comment about drugs being thrown over prison walls, I have moved to stop that practice.  It may seem a slightly frivolous action but the governor of Cork prison was delighted I made available £60,000 to cover the exercise yard in Cork prison. Sometimes simple solutions are the answer to serious problems.  This may not seem a very sophisticated solution but it is one the governor assures me &mdash; I see Deputy Batt O'Keeffe from Cork nodding &mdash; will stop that point of access to drugs.  On the provision of a methadone maintenance programme and the suggestion that a drugs team be placed in prisons, dealing with the people inside prison who are using drugs is one element but we also must tackle the problem of drugs getting into prisons. Without introducing an enormously strict and severe regime it is almost impossible to prevent drugs getting into prisons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Prisoners will not need them if they are getting free drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy and for that reason the methadone maintenance programme is being introduced in prisons.  Some prisoners are already taking part in that programme. The Department of Health has recently issued a Protocol for agencies undertaking such treatment.  I heard an interview this morning in which it was stated that there are many drug addicts who cannot gain access to methadone treatment centres.  That is a matter I will discuss with the Minister for Health.  When prisoners leave prison they become the responsibility of other agencies.  I agree with Deputies that we have to try to get people to break the habit of drug abuse as well as to stop drugs coming into the prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the drug problem in Cork prison is intolerable.  Any measure to <Col N="1151" /> bring about a decrease in the availability of drugs &mdash; whether they be thrown over the wall or brought in by visitors &mdash; would be welcome.</P>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that when people first enter prison, certain categories of prisoners should undergo medical tests?  Is she also satisfied with the level of monitoring during prison visiting times?  It is quite clear that, irrespective of the monitoring being carried out, drugs are being passed to prisoners and there has been a proliferation of drug abuse.  Will the Minister consider far stricter searching of prisoners after visiting times?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in my reply, there is a system for searching prisoners: there is a high level of staff vigilance, close circuit video surveillance of visits, screening of prisoners after visits as well as regular searches of the prison.  These mechanisms have not stamped out the availability of drugs.  Very often drugs are carried in the most obscure places by visitors and through various mechanisms, I will not go into detail, which the Deputies know about.  Drugs are also carried in through mechanisms involving children.  Without introducing a severe regime which may well harm the visitors and the children of prisoners, I think more strict camera surveillance is probably the best way of ensuring that there is minimal contact that would allow drugs to be passed to the prisoner.</P>
      <P>On their arrival prisoners are subject to a medical&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BattOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. B. O'Keeffe Mr. B. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that on a voluntary basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is essentially on a voluntary basis but very often the prisoners do not give the full story when answering questions.  It is a matter for prison officers to eventually assesss whether somebody is a drug abuser after they have come into prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LizODonnell" hpid="Ms O'Donnell Ms O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the vigilance and surveillance <Col N="1152" /> to date have not worked and have not prevented our prisons, particularly Mountjoy, from being sumps of despair, drug addiction and idleness.  Does she agree with Deputy Eric Byrne's suggestion that the only way to deal with this is to segregate the categories of convicts, introduce a drugs detoxification programme and not allow the general population of the prison to integrate with that category who have problems and need rehabilitation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We are examining the possibility of introducing drug-free units which would result in segregation.</P>
      <P>Known drug abusers or drug users who are suspected of trying to get illegal substances into prison face a far more rigorous system during visits, they are put into specially partitioned boxes and there is special camera surveillance on them.  Although every effort is made it has not stamped out the availability of drugs in prison.  However, if the regime that really works and perhaps exists in other jurisdictions were brought into this House, no doubt there would be no support, for the kinds of measures that would be absolutely foolproof to prevent drugs coming in, such as strip searches, undressing babies and examining the clothes children are wearing. This would have to be done to be certain of ridding the prison of drugs.</P>
      <P>Deputies may suggest that some of these mechanisms are necessary.  I want to tackle the availability of drugs in prison as well as the problem of drug addiction.  If a man or woman can beat the drug habit in prison, there is an obligation on us to ensure they have the same facilities outside to continue as drug free members of society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnODonoghue" hpid="Mr. O'Donoghue Mr. O'Donoghue">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donoghue</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of prisoners using illegal drugs in prison will the Minister accept we have reached the stage where the use of illegal drugs as opposed to their possession &mdash; which is already an offence &mdash; should be an offence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The way we treat people <Col N="1153" /> who abuse drugs is slightly different from the way we deal with drug peddlers. Drug abusers who come into the prison system should be given an opportunity in prison to break the habit.  Such programmes are working in the prison and I would like to see them extended. Without breaking the habit of prisoners in the prison the need to bring in drugs will continue.  You stop the access of drugs to prison and at the same time you stop the demand for those drugs inside prison.  It will not happen overnight as the Deputy knows having been in Government.  The growth of drugs availability in prison has grown and grown.</P>
      <P>I hope some of the mechanisms already in place will begin to tackle the problem and that the mechanisms I will put in place during my term in office will help also.</P>

      <askee>Minister for Justice</askee>
      <Quest>her views on whether remission of sentence for convicted persons in child sexual abuse cases can cause problems if these persons are perceived to have returned too soon to the area where the crime was committed; and the plans, if any, she has to change the law relating to remission of such sentences.</Quest>
      <QRef>[3568/95]</QRef>
    </Qst>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Under prison rules all prisoners are entitled to 25 per cent remission of sentence for good conduct. Remission may be forfeited by the governor, visiting committee or Minister for Justice for a breach of prison discipline. The grant of remission and the threat of losing it for misbehaviour encourages offenders to co-operate with prison managements in maintaining order and control.  I am, therefore, satisfied that, for sound management reasons, remission should continue to be granted as heretofore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Remission, when granted at present, is unconditional.  To meet the point <Col N="1154" /> raised by the Deputy would require the rules to be changed to allow the Minister to impose conditions as required for the duration of the remission period &mdash; in this kind of case a condition not to return to the area where the crime took place.  I can see some merit in the suggestion and will examine it in the context of the drafting of new prison rules which is underway.</P>
    <P>I should add of course that the courts, in determining the sentence to be imposed in individual cases, is aware of the fact that a standard 25 per cent remission rate applies as a matter of entitlement for good behaviour.  The existence of standard remission does not mean, therefore, that the offender is released earlier than the judge thinks appropriate &mdash; what it means in practice is that the offender who misbehaves while in custody may serve a longer period in custody than would have applied had he been of good behaviour.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Laoighis-Offaly):</i> I am glad the Minister mentioned the new rules.  The question was tabled in response to concerns of constituents for some time that many matters militated against reporting these types of crimes. Does the Minister agree that generally and, specifically in light of the ruling this morning, sentencing policy, the length of sentence and remission in cases of child sexual abuse needs urgent review, particularly as the Minister referred to the problem of not returning the perpetrator to the area of the crime too early?  Does she agree there is a need to educate the Judiciary in dealing with sexual crimes against children so that the views and perceptions of the victims and their families are to the forefront in the minds of the Garda, the DPP and the Judiciary when dealing with such cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The House will agree that over the past few years a greater effort has been made to ensure that sexual abuse crimes against children are made public and that our laws reflect the needs in such awful cases.  As outlined in the Programme for Government, the <Col N="1155" /> proposed prison rules will be referred to the Committee on Legislation and Security and all Members will have an opportunity to make an input to the proposed changes.  I wonder if the Deputy is thinking in terms of the facility available to give people either short term or full time temporary release from a sentence.  If I receive a request for a day or weekend temporary release in such cases I am conscious that the prisoner may well return to the scene of the crime and I take that into account in making a decision.</P>

It is essential that these kinds of crimes are reported and prosecutions taken as quickly as possible.

As regards the startling and inexplicable reduction in sentence from 14 years to four years announced today, will the three-and-a-half years be taken off the bottom period? If that is so, are we looking at a six months' sentence for a most heinous crime?</P>

      <P>While nothing the Minister's reply dealt mainly with claims for personal injuries to gardaí, would she agree &mdash; in terms of public policy <i>vis-à-vis</i> our criminal justice system &mdash; the clear message should go forth from this House that an attack on a member of the Garda Síochána while on duty is no ordinary assault, that very strict, heavy sentences should be meted out to the perpetrators of such assaults when <Col N="1161" /> brought to justice?

I might avail of this opportunity to commend Garda Peter O'Connor on his bravery and dedication to duty and wish him, as I am sure would all Members, a speedy recovery.

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>The constituency of Dublin north is policed by gardaí from the DMA North Division and by the gardaí in the Balbriggan District which forms part of the Louth-Meath Division.  Community policing was first introduced in 1987 and is now in operation throughout the country in densely populated urban areas. There are seven sergeants and 49 gardaí engaged on community policing duties in the DMA North Division.</P>
      <P>Gardaí involved in community policing duties have as their primary responsibilities the development of closer links between the gardaí and the local communities in which they serve. They achieve this through constant and regular liaison with local community groups such as youth clubs and residents' associations.  They are also responsible for the establishment of neighbourhood watch schemes and attending meetings with the area co-ordinators for these schemes to ensure they are working effectively.  These gardaí are also currently involved in the establishment of business watch schemes in the Malahide, Swords and Portmarnock areas.  Community gardaí perform foot patrols through the areas for which they have responsibility on a regular basis with a view to detecting and preventing crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Community gardaí play a vital role in the improvement and development of relations between gardaí and young people, and the operation of the schools programme is one important element of this work.  This involves structured visits <Col N="1166" /> by the gardaí to local schools and discussions with the young people on various matters relating to safety awareness, etc.</P>
    <P>The problems faced by the community gardaí in Dublin north are similar to those encountered by their counterparts in other densely populated urban areas.  They include reducing the number of young people loitering in residential or shopping areas, reducing the level of intimidation and fear in the community by meeting regularly members of the community and helping to divert young people from crime by assisting with the organisation of sports and recreational events for young people.</P>
    <P>The number of community gardaí and the work performed by them is kept under continuing review by the Garda authorities and any changes considered necessary will be made and supported by me.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply.  I am sure she will join me in commending the work of the community gardaí, not only in her constituency but throughout the country. One of the most frequent shortcomings in the community gardaí programme which has come to my attention in my constituency is that community gardaí are absent because of illness or other reasons and their work is not assigned to other gardaí as it is considered specialised.  This leads to a breakdown in the ongoing work of community gardaí and frequently results in difficulties being experienced in the community, particularly by those to the fore, such as youth leaders and those dealing with the schools who depend on the community gardaí and &mdash; through no fault of the gardaí involved &mdash; must do without their service.  Will the Minister address this matter so that the work of community gardaí when absent may be assigned to another garda, perhaps a sergeant to avoid a break in the community garda presence?</P>

      <P>I agree it is important that the link between the community gardaí and the liaison and relationship they form with community groups is not broken, but from time to time gardaí, like everybody else, become ill and cannot be on duty.  I will consider the Deputy's suggestion.  I am aware that the work of community gardaí is specialised and requires special talents to sustain a relationship with members of a community and it may not always be possible to assign another garda who may be able to form a similar relationship.  I will take the matter up with the Garda Commissioner to ensure there is not a break in continuity of that relationship.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the Minister's willingness to address the matter. I understand it is not as simple as it may appear, but it is important that it is addressed.  Will the Minister consider the difficulties being experienced by youth leaders in constituencies in respect of the community garda programme? Will she answer a question I was asked last night at a meeting in Corduff, Blanchardstown, concerning people involved in youth work in that area who bear the brunt of the difficulties resulting from a lack of a community garda presence &mdash; no matter how good it is it will never be adequate in some cases &mdash; and if she can recommend any resources or assistance to which they may tap into or seek in this regard?  The work of those people help prevent problems arising if there is not a proper resourcing of youth work and a community garda presence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the problems raised by the Deputy because a meeting was held in that constituency to listen to the views of community leaders and identify problems.  A proposal is being formulated to introduce a scheme in Corduff and other areas in the Blanchardstown policing area similar to a scheme which has worked extremely well in the Clondalkin area.  I hope that proposal will be in place shortly and will provide a proper relationship between <Col N="1168" /> community leaders, youth leaders and the Garda.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue of crime against tourists is one which receives the highest priority from my Department and the Garda authorities.  Close co-operation is maintained with Bord Fáilte to ensure that crimes of this nature are minimised to the greatest possible extent.</P>
      <P>In answering a parliamentary question on 8 February 1995 regarding tourist crime statistics, I set out, in detail, the measures taken by the Garda to deal with this problem, which include the deployment of additional Garda patrols, both uniformed and plain clothes, in areas of high tourist interest. In this regard, it is noticeable that a limited number of locations feature in many instances of crime against tourists. For this reason, the Garda are targeting these areas to ensure the safety of tourists. Other measures include the provision and distribution of an information leaflet by the Garda which is written in three different European languages and gives advice to tourists on how to protect their property and personal belongings.  These leaflets are also available at all seaports and airports. This is a simple crime prevention device which has proved to be of very practical value.</P>
      <P>Another significant measure designed to help in tackling the problem is the provision of the Garda Office which opened in March 1990 in O'Connell Street, Dublin.  This serves as a central location for advising tourists on preventive measures which they can take to safeguard themselves and their belongings. It also maintains a permanent Garda presence in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1169" /> An initiative deserving of special notice is the launch by the Garda Community Relations Unit of a street map for tourists in Dublin, listing places of historical and current interest and including crime prevention advice. Supervised carparks are depicted on the maps.  I understand that it is intended to extend this project to other areas frequented by tourists.  In addition, gardaí have carried out security surveys of all youth hostel accommodation.  Advice has been given on securing entry and exit points to these buildings and providing facilities to allow tourists to store luggage securely.  I have also made available resources to introduce closed circuit television in the Temple Bar area which, I hope, will be operational shortly after Easter.</P>
    <P>So far, I have dealt with crime prevention. However, we must put in place measures to help those tourists unfortunate enough to end up as victims of crime.  A new initiative in this area is the establishment of the Dublin Tourist Victim Support Service which was launched on 14 April 1994 and which is being operated by the Irish Association for Victim Support &mdash; IAVSI.  This new concept is modelled on the existing Amsterdam Tourist Assistance Service and provides tourists who have been the victims of crime with a practical support service to assist them in overcoming the initial trauma of their experiences.  The Garda Síochána have been involved in setting up this service and have provided premises for its operation at the Garda Dublin Metropolitan Area Headquarters at Harcourt Square.  A coordinator with a victim support background has been appointed to head the team of volunteers who possess a wide range of foreign languages.  All volunteers have received extensive training to allow them deal effectively with tourists who become victims of crime while on holiday in Ireland.  I know that this service will prove to be of immense benefit to visitors to this country who suffer the misfortune of becoming victims of criminal activity.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1170" /> It is necessary in discussing this subject to retain a sense of proportion. Dublin is a relatively safe city for visitors by comparison with the situation in other European and world capitals.  The available statistics suggest that less than one tenth of one per cent of the 3.7 million or so visitors to this country each year fall victims to any form of crime. While not in any way wishing to understate the problem and fully recognising the need for the preventive and other measures which are being taken, I think it is important also that we avoid the risk of overstatement of portraying an image of our country which is excessively negative or which might scare off valuable and welcome tourism revenue from our shores.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonOCuiv" hpid="Éamon Ó Cuív Éamon Ó Cuív">
      <NameTxt>Éamon Ó Cuív</NameTxt>
      <P>On 8 February, the last occasion we dealt with this Bill, I spoke about the question of children's playgrounds.  If a person unlawfully enters a playground in the middle of the night and is hurt, under present legislation the courts may award damages against the proprietor.  This matter should be reconsidered under the provisions of this Bill.  If people cross antipersonnel fencing &mdash; as opposed to fences around farms to keep livestock in &mdash; to gain access to property, the occupiers should be indemnified against claims arising from accidents that may occur on such property.  Should we not include a provision in the Bill excluding occupiers from liability in cases where people enter property by climbing over a fence specifically put there to keep people out?  It is nonsensical that an occupier should be held responsible for a person who gets hurt after entering property by climbing over, say, a ten foot fence in the middle of the night. Such people, even if they are minors, should be held reponsible for their actions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are trying to strike a balance in this Bill, not between occupiers and entrants, but between legitimate compensation and providing reasonable access to facilities.  Because of the way <Col N="1295" /> the law operates at present many legitimate users of, for example, children's playgrounds, are deprived of such facilities. It is no longer feasible for communities to provide those facilities because of high insurance costs.  As a result legitimate users &mdash; people willing to take a reasonable amount of risk &mdash; are deprived of valuable community services. All community organisations are faced with this problem and our young people, in particular, are affected.  The question of liability in respect of youth clubs and so on must also be addressed; if people enter properties during the time they are closed, the occupiers' liability provision should not apply.</P>
    <P>Another important matter is the right of people to use public facilities at their own risk.  If a sign at the entrance to a playground states that children under the ages of 12 or 14 years should not enter without being accompanied by an adult, people should adhere to such regulations.  If, however, a child enters those premises under the supervision of an adult and is hurt, not due to the malfunction of any equipment there, liability should not attach to the occupier but to the person who brought the child into the playground.  I fail to understand why adults should not take responsibility for minors they take to such facilities.</P>
    <P>Responsibility for young people is a vexed question.  We can deprive our young people of facilities by placing too much onus on the occupier.  A number of Deputies pointed out that we must stress the need to attach liability to parents and guardians to ensure the safety of young people.  If young people wander all over the place and are hurt in the process, one must ask how they got there in the first place.  We must strike a balance between ensuring that people are not put at unfair risk and ensuring that the position is not so penal as to deprive people of many facilities. People have told me that it is becoming more and more impossible to provide facilities for young people because of the insurance quagmire.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> It is important that the traditional access to properties that has always been enjoyed in rural Ireland is maintained. I live in an area of wide open countryside where the potential for tourism as an income earner is great.  It is important to strike a balance.  Huge areas of the countryside where I live are unfenced and open to the public and I would hate to see farmers forced to restrict entry on land, mountains, etc. Contrary to popular opinion, there are designated owners of all the land in places like Connemara &mdash; all the hills are owned by somebody, in common or exclusively.  Traditionally ownership meant that one had the grazing rights, not that one could prevent somebody from hill-walking.  Until recent years nobody either worried about liability &mdash; because it was considered that there was none &mdash; or thought of excluding people from such property.  It is important that access to the land and mountains be maintained, but this can only be done if the Bill operates on the basis of reasonable care being taken and nothing being done materially to put people at risk.  In other words, it would be taken that bog holes in open countryside would be treated as a natural hazard and that an occupier would be at no risk as long as he did nothing to increase the inherent risks of mountain climbing or walking across bogs.  It must also be provided that, where in the normal course of farming activities tractors are left unattended in farm yards or in fields at lunch time or in the evening, nobody would be entitled to compensation if they interfered with such machinery and put themselves at risk.</P>
    <P>Many farmers have historic monuments and sites on their land which are subject to preservation orders.  This means they cannot be knocked down, which is good because nobody wants historic buildings, towers, etc. to disappear. On the other hand, many are on private land and in a bad state of disrepair, having exposed stairways, etc.  I do not know what the situation would be if somebody came to grief at one of these historic sites on private land.  It seems <Col N="1297" /> the land owner would be in a invidious situation.  He cannot knock the building down, for good reasons.  Can the Minister confirm that he cannot be held liable for the disrepair of the building? If the answer to that question is not in the affirmative, something will have to be done within the context of the Bill to exclude liability for such sites as long as a sign is put up warning people that they enter the site at their own risk.  I cannot understand why we cannot have the concept of &ldquo;own risk&rdquo; in certain circumstances. The putting up of signs is mentioned in the Bill but there is no guarantee that in such a situation the occupier would not be at risk of being held liable in the case of injury to a visitor.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis the measure of effectiveness of this Bill will be in how the insurance companies amend the premia they charge for occupiers' liability insurance.  If rapidly soaring insurance costs do not drop it will mean the Bill is a failure because it will not have addressed the crucial balance of which I speak.  If insurance costs drop and we achieve a reasonable balance between the rights of the individual who is injured and those of the occupier, that will be a fair measure of the success of the Bill.  If, in three or five years' time there has not been a knock-on effect on insurance premia and the compensation being paid out is the same or spiralling, as at present, we will have to come back and re-examine the situation.  The present situation cannot continue whereby reasonable enjoyment of the pleasures of life is becoming more restricted because of the fear of being sued for damages.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most important Bills to go through the House in many years.  It stems from the fact that, in keeping with other developing societies worldwide, there has been a massive increase in litigation against owners of property.  Substantial public liability claims against local authorities, factories, builders etc., are the order of the day.  It is right that individuals should have the protection of the law where the fault is not theirs, where defective and sloppy work practices lead to serious personal injury or damage. However, a new culture has emerged which is insidious and gravely worrying. It centres around bogus claims against the so-called soft targets like the local authorities where million of pounds are paid to con-men who manage to fall into the same payment cracks with alarming frequency.</P>
      <P>The logical extension of this new bogus claim culture is not lost on landowners. Farmers cringe at the thought that persons who are unwanted, uninvited and trespassing might, under certain circumstances, be able to bring successful personal damages claims against them.  As a farmer I have always objected to this legal interpretation and I am joined by almost every other farmer and land-owner in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a huge improvement on earlier legislation and clarifies many of <Col N="1299" /> the grey areas concerning occupiers' liability.  I acknowledge the commonsense approach by the Minister, Deputy Taylor.  Much work has gone into this legislation and it is immeasurably better than what we had.  It loads the dice against trespassers and there is now less doubt about where landowners stand.</P>
    <P>I have one enormous, fundamental reservation about the Bill.  It refers to the position of minors in relation to occupiers' liability. My understanding of the provision contained in this Bill is that minors, through either their parents or guardians, may have a reasonable opportunity to successfully claim damages against landholders even though the minors themselves are trespassers. This will have awesome ramifications for thousands of farmers.  The mind boggles at the number of opportunities that could be presented to trespassers who are regarded as minors.  For example it would be the most natural thing in the world for a group of children, on a lovely May morning, to jump over a fence into a field owned by a farmer adjacent to a town or village and run, jump and play.  However, they are to be regarded as trespassers as they were not invited and, because of the legal position, were not wanted.  Should one of them fall into a disused pit, trip over an electric fence or walk into an old harrow or other piece of machinery, and break a limb is it possible that under this Bill the farmer would be held liable?</P>
    <P>What about a youngster who swims in the local river, goes fishing along the river bank or accompanies his parents or guardian when they go shooting?  If he ambles off on his own and is involved in an accident, is it possible that the farmer would be held liable bearing in mind that the parents or guardian would not be held responsible if a similar accident was to occur elsewhere?  The law must be clear and unequivocal on this point.  In the first instance minors must be the responsibility of parents or <Col N="1300" /> guardians.  But if the legal position were otherwise and farmers and landowners were not held responsible when minors trespassing on their lands are involved in an accident, one could visualise immediately a change in attitude towards families who like to walk along a river bank or take a stroll across the green pastures of Ireland.  With the fear of liability put to bed, most farmers would extend the hand of friendship to the teeming thousands from our towns and villages who love country life.  Many new relationships between urban and rural dwellers could be formed as a result with urban dwellers being presented with an opportunity to enjoy the many and varied aspects of country living.  If farmers and landowners were satisfied that minors were covered by the Bill much of the anxiety and opposition would evaporate.</P>
    <P>Recently I was elected chairperson of the agricultural committee of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party at which this issue has been raised on a number of occasions.  I have no doubt that farmers have made rural Deputies aware that they are vehemently opposed to this aspect of the Bill.  It is an issue that has been raised at every meeting I have attended in east Galway during the past eight to 12 months.  While this Bill swings the pendulum towards trespassers in cases involving adults there is a perception that in certain circumstances land owners and farmers could be held liable if a minor is involved in an accident. If the Minister gives an undertaking before the Bill is signed into law that parents or guardians will be held responsible for the actions of minors this legislation will be acceptable to most people living in rural Ireland.  As a farmer with a lifelong association with the agriculture industry, I am convinced that such change is necessary.</P>
    <P>I am concerned, too, about other aspects of the Bill.  On the various categories of entrant I have no difficulty with the provisions dealing with trespassers, <Col N="1301" /> which are clear, but the provisions dealing with recreational users and visitors dovetail.  I cannot see where the dividing line is.  It appears that under this Bill entrants will be given, as of right, visitor status.  These include members of the Garda who on occasion have to call on farmers, officials of the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Food, employees of the ESB, Telecom Éireann and the county council.  Where would the land owner stand if, for instance, the local dog warden in removing an unlicensed dog trips over an electric fence and injures himself?  Who would be held responsible?</P>
    <P>What will be the status of signs in the future?  How often have we come across signs stating &ldquo;no trespassers&rdquo;?  What significance in law will such a sign have? Does this Bill provide for the location and size of signs?  What about those who are illiterate or have poor eyesight?  In such circumstances is it possible that the farmer would be held liable in the event of an accident?  It is important to strike a balance.</P>
    <P>If implemented, parts of this Bill will make a dramatic difference, particularly in the tourism sector.  My constituency colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, referred to walkways along river banks and hills. There is a reservoir of goodwill among the farming fraternity most of whom like to see the hunt, tourists and hill walkers pass by, provided that they conduct themselves, do not leave gates open thereby allowing stock to wander but they will never accept that if, for any reason, an adult or a minor trespasses on their land without invitation they are liable in court for whatever might happen to that person.  That is the fundamental issue.  In an urban area, if a person, who is uninvited onto a property, breaks his or her foot while tripping over, say, a child's toy in a front garden, is the owner of that property liable for the medical expenses of that person? That is the central theme of my contribution today.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister, Deputy Taylor, on his serious approach to this issue.  Many Ministers before him <Col N="1302" /> shirked from dealing with it.  We should not have had to wait until 1995 for this Bill.  I have listened to various shades of opinion on this matter over the past ten to 15 years.  If the Minister accepts my suggestion in regard to minors and sees fit to introduce an appropriate amendment, I will roll out the red carpet for him.  Failure to do this will mean that an otherwise good Bill will be regarded less favourably, which is unfortunate.  I cannot suggest a wording for the amendment but with the Minister's legal background he and his officials will have little trouble in coming up with the appropriate wording.  Such an amendment to the Bill would benefit thousands of people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> I welcome the Bill, particularly the principle enshrined in it.  Many of us have reservations about certain sections of the Bill but what the Minister is setting out to do is worthwhile.  Over the years. Deputies from all parties have sought the introduction of the Bill and various Ministers shied away from dealing with the issue.  The previous Government was very much to the forefront in trying to bring this Bill before the House.  On two occasions, the Law Reform Commission prepared and published reports on this matter, having been requested to do so by the Government of the day.</P>
      <P>Farmers, property owners and community groups were to the forefront also in recent years in calling for the introduction of the Bill because of the fears of claims being made against them and the rising cost of insurance.  I, like other Deputies, attended many meetings in recent years of farming, business and community groups, representatives of gun clubs and people who were generally interested in such a Bill.  As public representatives we were urged by those people to bring the Bill before the House as soon as possible.  I thank the Minister for doing so and, more importantly, for remaining in the Chamber to hear the many views of Members.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Traditionally, the majority of farmers <Col N="1303" /> and landowners here have made their lands available to the general public for hunting, shooting, fishing, dog walking and recreational use generally.  There has never been a problem with farmers in this regard.  In my area, greyhound walking is a common activity and almost every morning of the week one can see greyhound owners walking their dogs through lands without any objections from farmers.  Many people living in urban areas avail of the generosity of the farming community, particularly those farmers whose lands lie adjacent to towns.  They engage in hare and rabbit hunting which is a way of life for many townspeople.</P>
    <P>In recent years, however, farmers have become very conscious of people making claims against them for damages and injuries and, as a result, sought this legislation.  It is understandable that farmers, business people and others would become concerned that what was acceptable here some years ago does not appear to be acceptable now.  We have become a claims conscious nation and there has been an alarming increase in the number of people claiming compensation for injuries and damages, many of which have been of a dubious nature.  As a result, insurance costs have escalated causing severe hardship for those who have to pay such insurance costs, namely, farmers, business people and community groups.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the attitude to claims in recent years.  Local authorities have found that the number of claims against them have increased substantially and they are paying out millions of pounds annually as a result.  I accept some claims are serious and warrant the payment of compensation but some are dubious.  In some cases local authorities, insurance companies and people against whom claims are being made pay compensation far too easily.  As a result, people are now making claims willy-nilly. In my area, if a person loses a toenail by accidentally kicking against a step going in or out of work, he or she is usually guaranteed a couple of thousand <Col N="1304" /> pounds in compensation.  This has become a serious problem here and rising insurance costs are affecting job creation and additional facilities that might be provided by farmers.</P>
    <P>Questions have been raised about the actions of some solicitors who advertise in newspapers looking for business.  In my area it is well known that if one goes to solicitor A, one has a better chance of winning a case and getting more money than if one goes to solicitor B or C.  Of course, everyone is going to solicitor A.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Wexford):</i> Cases are taken on a no foal, no fee basis and if the case is won there is a 10 per cent charge by the solicitor which I believe is a rip-off.  The substantial increase in the number of claims has caused great concern among farmers and that is why the Bill is before us today.</P>
      <P>When the Minister introduced the Bill I was a Minister of State in the previous Government.  I attended a public meeting in the local IFA centre in Enniscorthy approximately three days after the Bill's introduction.  Farmers, business people, members of gun clubs and others were in attendance at the meeting. I was the only Government politician in attendance and, of course, I was fair game for almost everybody in the hall.  My Opposition colleagues, who are now in Government, promised radical changes in the Bill if they ever got into Government.  They are now in Government and I hope the commitment given in regard to the radical changes promised that night by Minister Yates and Minister of State Doyle will be honoured.  Some of those promises were feasible but others were not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many discussions on the Bill and I am sure the Minister has received many deputations from the IFA and the ICMSA and is aware of their concerns and of the concerns of farmers generally.  The major concern seems to centre on the liability of farmers for children who enter their lands <Col N="1305" /> without a guardian or other person in charge.  To say that farmers must be responsible for minors is unacceptable, particularly considering the definition of a &ldquo;minor&rdquo;.  I appreciate the difficulties for the Minister because, constitutionally, a minor is defined as a person of 18 years and under.  I understand that the Law Reform Commission had difficulty in advising the Government in this regard.  The farming community in particular is very concerned about this measure.  They made representations to the Minister to the effect that a minor should be defined as a child up to 12 or 14 years of age and I ask the Minister to seriously consider that suggestion.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Connaughton said, farming nowadays is very sophisticated and modern, with state-of-the-art machinery, silage and slurry pits, bailers, combine harvesters and all types of modern equipment.  Whenever children are in the vicinity of machinery when farmers are cutting corn or silage, or bailing hay, will they be responsible if a child is injured?  That is the major concern of farmers.  The Minister should take on board some of the suggestions put forward by farming groups and clearly outline how he intends to exempt farmers from responsibility.  I accept farmers must ensure safety is a priority on their farms and that they should be responsible up to a point, but they believe they should not have to accept full responsibility for children who enter their farms, particularly without a guardian.</P>
    <P>With the advent of agri-tourism, where farmers have been encouraged to diversify into deer farming, animal farms and other types of farming new to this country, many more young people from urban areas wish to travel to villages and farming communities to visit such farms.  It is important that these young people be allowed visit farms, but there must be a balance between the responsibilities of the farmers on the one hand and the parents of the children on the other.</P>
    <P>The Minister should see if it is possible to redefine a &ldquo;minor&rdquo; for the purpose of this Bill.  At a public meeting in <Col N="1306" /> Enniscorthy the message to me and other Deputies was that farmers do not want to be child minders.  They want to be as flexible as possible and to allow people from urban communities to untilise their land and enjoy themselves, fishing, hunting or in recreational activities, but they believe they should not be responsible for children who enter their lands.  The Minister should seriously consider that matter.</P>
    <P>In many towns and larger villages there are no facilities for children.  Community groups are often hindered in their efforts to open facilities such as playgrounds.  In many cases there is little space for playgrounds in large housing estates.  I am glad we are moving away from building large housing estates, but in many such estates there are no community facilities.  The first facility housing committees try to put in place is a playground, but they are often prevented from doing so because of high insurance costs.  As a result in most towns there is no playground for children. The reason given for high insurance costs is that many claims are made, often as a result of the actions of people who have nothing to do with playground facilities.  People who injure themselves breaking into playgrounds are rewarded with substantial financial payments.  It is unfair that because of the actions of people such as these many areas are not in a position to provide playground facilities.</P>
    <P>In the south-east there are more historic sites than in most areas and people travel from abroad and from various parts of Ireland to visit them.  Most of the buildings are on private property, farming property or property owned by landowners.  With the exception of some buildings that have been taken on board by the Office of Public Works and restored to reasonable status, most of them are in bad repair, with walls falling down and the surrounds in decay.  Farmers who have historic sites on their lands are concerned about who will be responsible if there is an accident, such as a wall or boulder falling on a person. <Col N="1307" /> The Minister should say who will be responsible in these cases.</P>
    <P>In many areas there are signs on entering historic sites to the effect that you enter at your own risk and must take full responsibility for injury, damage or loss incurred, but what is the status of such signs?  On the entrance to GAA grounds there is usually a sign stating that you enter the grounds at your own risk and if you lose an item, you do so at your own risk, but I am told by the legal profession that these signs are of very little value and that people may claim in the event of an accident which, fortunately, does not happen very often.  The status of such signs should be spelled out clearly by the Minister.  Many farmers are of the view that if they erect signs on their lands they will be exempt from claims made.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a good idea of what Deputies on all sides of the House are requesting.  The major concerns relate to children entering property, the status of signs, historic sites, playgrounds and so on.  I ask the Minister to take on board our views as we are expressing the concerns of the farming and business community and community groups generally.</P>
    <P>The principle behind the Bill is very good.  As a result of the decisions of judges on issues down the years doubt exists as to the responsibilities of farmers and people entering farm lands.  The Minister is trying to introduce a law that will deal with these matters and I appreciate his difficulty in trying to make everybody happy.  A law was never introduced that satisfied all sections of the community.  Generally there has been a very good relationship between the farming and urban communities. The farming community has a good relationship with tourists who wish to use their lands for recreational purposes, be it mountain climbing, walking along the river banks or fishing.  It is important that the good relationship continues.  There seems to be confusion among the farming groups on whether <Col N="1308" /> this Bill will operate in their long term interests.  The Minister has to convince the farming community and Deputies on all sides that he is striking a balance between the rights of those who use land for all the purposes I have outlined and the rights of farmers who should not have to carry an unfair burden. People may enter on land without permission and at all times the farmer is aware that he may be responsible if something happens and this may put an additional financial burden on him.  If the Minister cannot strike a balance &mdash; and I think what the farmers are looking for is not extreme &mdash; we could find ourselves in a position where farmers say people are no longer allowed to enter their lands.  That would have serious consequences from an economic, social and recreational point of view.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will take those views on board as he will want to see the Bill working in the best interests of people generally.</P>

      <P>The Minister may feel that the points are being repeated but this mirrors the concern being expressed by our constituents in rural communities. The farming community is especially concerned.  I know the Minister has met the farming organisations and listened to their concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his swift introduction of the Occupiers' Liability Bill following the final report of the Law Reform Commission.  This matter has been discussed for many years and my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Deenihan, when in Opposition, introduced a Private Members' Bill on occupiers' liability. That probably initiated the discussion that took place around the country and stimulated interest in this Bill.  It is symptomatic of the times we live in that <Col N="1309" /> there is undue concern not alone among business people but among the farming community.  It was an intrinsic part of rural life that the public had access to land and it was accepted as a public right.  There was camaraderie between the farmers and the community but with the compensation culture of recent times and associated increases in insurance costs, farmers have become extremely concerned about the grey area of whether a person is trespassing or otherwise.</P>
    <P>It would be a pity if the Occupiers' Liability Bill did not strike the right balance.  It would be regrettable if people in rural areas lost the freedom &mdash; which is unique to Ireland &mdash; to walk along someone's lands without being reproached.  In recent times there has been an expansion in activities such as hill walking, rock climbing, mountaineering and mountain trekking.  Field sports are being encouraged and in that encouragement there is the associated risk to the landowners involved.</P>
    <P>In April the Minister will be announcing Leader funding for projects around the country.  It is likely that there will be a further expansion of interest in all these activities.  To a degree they are the bedrock activities that attract tourists to different areas where the Leader programme operates.  It would be a pity if a <i>caveat</i> was included and people were prevented from engaging in certain activities or were allowed into a forest only at their own risk.  That would probably stop tourists participating in these activities and we would lose part of our heritage.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for two classes of users, visitors and trespassers, but the farming community has asked the Minister to consider another category, the recreational user.  The points I raised earlier show the validity for considering that.  The expansion in the numbers involved in recreational activity has made an impact on our tourism industry, and this gives rise to the possible validity of introducing this category. The Minister will be aware from his research that many states in America <Col N="1310" /> have introduced this category successfully. I am sure he is aware of the approaches in different countries and the strategy they have adopted.</P>
    <P>The undercurrent in most speeches is concern with regard to minors, especially children.  The Minister indicated on Second Stage that he would consider carefully the various views expressed by Deputies and would try to encapsulate a certain amount of their thinking before Committee Stage. Farming by its nature is inherently risky and because people are so familiar with the activity they probably expose themselves to risks.  Farmers and farmers' children have lost their lives in tragic circumstances on the farm.  Consider the situation where children who trespass onto the farm may walk into a potential minefield.  One would have to empathise with farmers concerned about this. Farmers whose lands adjoin cities and towns face the inherent risk of trespassers. I would like the Minister to guarantee the farmers and occupiers of land that they will not be liable for accidents when children trespass on their land.  In that situation we are possibly putting the onus on the parents and guardians of those children.  I know there are legalistic arguments in that regard.  If we are to be seen as striking a balance in the Occupiers' Liability Bill we would need to make progress in that area.  If farmers were granted immunity under this Bill, it would go a long way.</P>
    <P>There are many laudable aspects to the Bill.  It is widely acclaimed as being a good one.  In many cases playgrounds were erected in housing estates in the days when people were not concerned about occupiers' liability and children continue to use the equipment which is rusty and defective.  There is the risk of actions being taken against the council even though in many cases it may have relinquished its involvement to various community associations.  At the end of the day, if an accident occurs the council picks up the tab.  That is why one discourages residents associations from erecting playgrounds.</P>
    <P>Mention is made of historic sites. <Col N="1311" /> County Limerick is steeped in history and we have castles and historical buildings all over the county.  We encourage people to visit these areas.  The Office of Public Works has done great work in restoring castles.  It is doing a remarkable job on Desmond Castle in my town of Newcastlewest.  It has also done work on a castle in Glenquin.  There is an inherent risk in people using such sites and that is why the Bill is timely.  I hope the Minister strikes the right balance and will be hailed as the Minister who introduced progressive legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanKenny" hpid="Mr. S. Kenny Mr. S. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, the main aim of which is to increase protection for owners of lands against claims by trespassers and recreational users. One of the main objectives is to ensure recreational use of land is facilitated to the widest possible extent.  It recommends that entrants onto land be divided into two categories &mdash; visitors and trespassers.</P>
      <P>Section 1 defines recreational users as those who enter onto property without payment or charge to engage in recreational activities such as hill walking, visiting sites and buildings of historical, national or scientific importance.  The duty owed to recreational users is set out in section 4.  I am looking at the Bill from a different perspective, coming from an urban constituency which has within its boundaries open space and amenity areas, some in public and some in private ownership.  I wish to refer to a case in point in my constituency, an area of high amenity which is in private ownership in the Howth East Mountain area.</P>
      <P>There are fears locally that the scenic East Mountain portion of Howth Head may be sold by the owner and its recreational use changed.  It could be completely removed from the scope of this Bill.  The following is an extract from a recent report by An Taisce, Hillwatch and a local environmental group in the area, Howth-Sutton 2000:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1312" /> The East Mountain of Howth is the most extensive open natural landscape left in the Dublin area.  It is a multifaceted resource in that this extensive area, which mostly consists of heather and low land heat vegetation, is notable for its absence of roads and is one of the few areas in the greater Dublin area where pedestrians have primacy.  There are magnificent views over this low level vegetation out over Dublin Bay.  On fine days one can see spectacular views over Howth Harbour and Ireland's Eye towards Lambay and up the north Dublin coast towards the Mountains of Mourne and Dalkey Island down to Bray and even Wicklow Head on the south side.  One of the interesting features of this area is the almost complete absence of houses except at either end of the area or where it meets modern development on the western edge of the East Mountain.  There are some ruin structures from the past like Alice's Cottage, Gilmore's Cottage at the Kilrock end and the abandoned Heather Cottage.  Due to the absence of trees, structures and roads it is an area where nature has primacy and thus it is not unrealistic to describe it as a wilderness.  It is all the more remarkable that it has survived as such considering it is so accessible to people and particularly to those in the greater Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Howth Head itself on the north side of Dublin city overlooking Dublin Bay has been at the centre of controversy before as it continuously comes under pressure for new housing development.  We have a continual clash between the interests of landowners who wish to maximise the development of their land and those who wish to retain it for recreational use.</P>
    <P>Two years ago, while Dublin County Council was considering its draft development plan drawn up by its planners and engineers, there was a proposal by members of the county council to completely rezone 14 acres of the East <Col N="1313" /> Mountain area for a development of 56 houses.  That proposal ran contrary to the zoning in the existing plan which was zone F, high amenity.  In their draft plan, the planners recommended an even higher zoning, zone G.  This led to controversy in the area for some months.  The matter was eventually resolved when the rezoning motion was withdrawn.  It represented a victory for the local people who at the time wanted to maintain the amenity and recreational use of the area.  Very often, when one attempt fails another is made.</P>
    <P>The East Mountain has been advertised for sale and is going to tender on 31 March.  A reported figure of £1 million is sought.  Local community groups are urging that Fingal County Council, the local authority for the area, be vested with these lands to protect the high amenity zoning of the area.  The area is not just of importance to local residents but to the people of the wider Dublin region.  It is a green lung for the city and a potential amenity for one-third of the population of the State as well as for tourists.  It is easily accessible by DART and bus from the city centre. Its sale and development would lead to closure of rights of way, loss of recreational use and would remove the area from the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>In the past, planning permission for a luxury housing development on 2.5 acres was overturned by An Bord Pleanála following an appeal by An Taisce on the grounds that the development would constitute an obtrusive element in an open landscape of high amenity and would be out of character with the area.  Now that the owner, Mr. McGuinness, is seeking to sell, local residents wonder what a new owner would propose and call for the Howth peninsula to be given protection under a special amenity area order to prevent the area being saturated with development.  The natural landscape in the area compares to that in the Wicklow mountains or scenery and landscape in the west.</P>
    <P>Yesterday, at the monthly meeting of Fingal County Council it was agreed, <Col N="1314" /> following a proposal by the Cathaoirleach, that the council should seek EU funding to ensure the rights of way to the public at the East Mountain are preserved. In a report to the motion the county manager stated that it was a council objective that the present situation continue, that development should not be permitted and that the provisions of the county development plan should be adequate to ensure that this objective is achieved.  He went on to say that there was no justification for the price of £1 million sought by the owner.  A similar motion, which I proposed, was adopted at a meeting of the Dublin City Council's planning committee earlier today.</P>
    <P>There is a continual clash of interest between development land and land which is in a high amenity and scenic area.  From a development point of view, housing developments would fetch enormous prices but would remove an amenity which has been enjoyed by the residents of the east coast through the centuries.  This is European National Conservation Year.  I call on Mr. McGuinness to enter into talks with Fingal County Council regarding the future use of the East Mountain area of Howth.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. M. Kitt Mr. M. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in welcoming the Bill and compliment the Minister on its introduction.  It is welcomed by the farming community and those organisations which represent them, many of whom the Minister has met.  I deduced from my meetings with them that their general desire was that the Minister would examine the responsibility of those described in the Bill as minors. The ICMSA went so far as to say that the Bill, in its present form, will create greater confusion and uncertainty on the part of landowners unless amendments are tabled.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to bring forward such amendments.  In particular the ICMSA made the case that, unless such amendments are forthcoming, the definition of &ldquo;entrant&rdquo; could mean an uninvited person being deemed a &ldquo;visitor&rdquo;. A letter I received &mdash; which I am <Col N="1315" /> sure was received by all Members &mdash; stated that a &ldquo;visitor&rdquo; or invited person should mean someone with permission to enter premises and that all others should be regarded as trespassers.  The matter of minors should be investigated because organisations I met, including the IFA and the Galway Game Hunting Association, claimed that if responsibility for minors could be taken on board by the Minister, they would be quite happy.</P>
      <P>With so many schemes in existence to help farmers, such as the rural environmental protection scheme, known as REPS, or those covering areas of scientific interest, farmers must be very conscious of our environment if they are to receive grants under their provisions; indeed, they are very interested in the whole matter of conservation.  If they allow visitors on their land, for example, visiting school tours, or if they are involved in the farmhouse holiday scheme, they need to know their exact position with regard to public liability. All these organisations, particularly gun and hunting clubs, have said repeatedly they want to reap the benefit of such conservation schemes and make people feel welcome.  While generally farmers are hospitable to those entering their property, they are anxious that their public liability be clarified.  The ICMSA put forward five proposals on which they sought the Minister's clarification. The first was the greater definition of &ldquo;entrant&rdquo;, second, the greater definition of &ldquo;occupier&rdquo;, third, a clarification of their liability with regard to minors on their land, fourth, entrance as of right and the fifth point they made was on the title of the Bill.  They made the case clearly that, until adequate amendments were effected, farmers would have no option but to restrict entry to their property or lands, in so far as possible, to safeguard themselves and their families from being sued.  It would be a very sad day if farmers, through fear of being sued, erected signs and refused entry to their farms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that the provisions of the <Col N="1316" /> Bill are not concerned merely with the farming community but also with access to community halls, school premises, swimming pools, children's playgrounds, affecting people other than landowners. Acknowledging that we live in an era in which there is tremendous community development we must recognise that it is difficult to promote and develop such goodwill within the community.  People want local facilities and amenities yet may find themselves very frustrated from fear of being sued.  For example, the remit of the county enterprise boards and the Leader programme will be extended this year and will not be as limited as heretofore.  In County Galway, the second largest county, only one application has been submitted, so I hope that it will be successful.  All these groups will be very frustrated if they do not receive adequate clarification of their public liability.</P>
    <P>We can observe the tremendous work being undertaken nationwide by the Office of Public Works.  I have always been loud in my praise of the Office of Public Works but, in many instances, it too has been frustrated as a result of court decisions.  I do not want to go into detail with regard to areas where the Office of Public Works has endeavoured to provide facilities, particularly with regard to our heritage, but it is quite obvious that much of its work will have to cease.</P>
    <P>I note the Minister said that the provisions of this Bill would not impose any charge on the Exchequer, something I find difficult to understand, because the Office of Public Works is in need of funds for the continuation of its preservation works and further development.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister spell out clearly what difference the provisions of this Bill will make since we are not clear on the position?  I endeavoured to table parliamentary questions on public and employer liability but I encountered considerable difficulty in getting one on the Order Paper, as the Department of Enterprise and Employment stated that its Minister was not responsible for such matters.  In this respect I came across an <Col N="1317" /> article written by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Rabbitte, in the magazine <i>Insurance Update,</i> Issue No. 36, March 1995, on the basis of which I understand I will be able to table a question on tomorrow's Order Paper.  In a question and answer-type interview with Mr. Mark Thornburgh, Chairman of the IIF's Accident Standing Committee, the following specific question was posed by Mr. Mike Kemp, non-life insurance manager of the Irish Insurance Federation:</P>
    <P>Do you have any views on the likely impact of the proposed occupiers' liability legislation on public liability rates?</P>
    <P>Mr. Thornburgh's reply was:</P>
    <P>As proposed, the legislation will provide an improved situation over the existing position as it clearly defines the liability which occupiers have towards different types of entrants to their premises.  Entrants will be defined as either visitors or trespassers.  The only liability that occupiers will have towards trespassers is that they must not injure trespassers intentionally or act with gross negligence towards them.  Recreational users of lands on a non-paying basis will be treated as only having the same rights as trespassers but fee paying recreational users will have the same rights as visitors.</P>
    <P>I believe that the proposed legislation will only have a minimal effect on public liability rates.  The legislation will only affect a relatively small part of the overall public liability market.  For risks affected by the legislation, it is unlikely that rates would reduce, but they will probably stabilise.  Insurers will need to wait to see how the legislation is interpreted by the courts before rates would be affected.</P>
    <P>This question of public liability constitutes a real problem, not merely in rural areas, but nationwide as in some cases it is difficult to obtain such cover.  I have <Col N="1318" /> come across a number of people &mdash; indeed it is now almost the norm &mdash; who have had to resort to foreign insurers to obtain public liability cover &mdash; Lloyds of London being one obvious source &mdash; or other insurance companies on the Continent. One insurance broker told me that owners of premises such as sawmills, joinery works, discos or livestock marts, experience enormous difficulty in obtaining public liability cover.  I know the FBD are usually supportive of such premises.  I have observed that, while it is sometimes easy to obtain public liability cover for a publichouse, if there is a dancing area attached, it becomes that much more difficult.</P>
    <P>Soaring insurance costs are very much tied in with the provisions of this Bill in that we must endeavour to contain them while maintaining and enhancing our great tradition in sports, leisure and recreational activities.  The provisions of this Bill will attain that objective if the Minister takes on board some amendments to be tabled later.</P>
    <P>Generally farmers and landowners have been very amenable to allowing the public access to their lands, to forests, rivers, mountains and monuments, a tradition which I hope will continue. Unfortunately, because of litigation arising from public liability claims and increasing insurance costs access to property has become a matter of concern. Speakers have referred to a compensation culture.  Recently &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; devoted a programme to the issue of public liability claims.  Dublin Corporation in particular was mentioned on that programme but local authorities throughout the country encounter serious problems dealing with public liability claims.  It is unfortunate that a compensation culture has developed.  An example was given on that programme of 40 claims being submitted following a bus crash in the United States involving 20 passengers. Allegations were made on that programme that some members of the legal profession follow ambulances taking injured persons to hospitals.  It is sad <Col N="1319" /> that claims for compensation are encouraged in that way.</P>
    <P>Trips by school children and their teachers to farms, heritage sites and national monuments are part of civic and nature studies.  An excellent interpretative centre was built in the village of Aughrim near Ballinasloe to commemorate the Battle of Aughrim.  It includes the land on which the battle was fought.  It is a matter of concern to landowners in that area that accidents might happen while school children, particularly the very young, are visiting that site.  I hope such trips will be organised in the future and visits to heritage monuments and sites will not be prevented because farmers may be afraid of being sued as a result of an accident on their property.</P>
    <P>Cultural tourism is developing and many tourists from Europe visit cultural sites.  My area of east Galway is not known as a major tourism area compared to west Galway, but increasingly history students, particularly from Germany, France and Spain, visit the area to study monastic and heritage sites, particularly the Battle of Aughrim site. As our tourism industry is developing, we would not like tourists to see locks on gates and warning signs indicating that they are not welcome.</P>
    <P>The ICMSA has been concerned about tensions in this area, but members of the farming community have been warm and hospitable in their dealings with visitors.  It is difficult to envisage how farmers may be reckless.  Examples were given of buildings which may be left in an uncompleted state.  Others have mentioned that a bull may be left in a field near a site, but I do not believe that would happen, although accidents have occurred with animals at various times of the year.  By and large the farming community has been very responsible and I hope the Minister will achieve the balance he is seeking between the occupier and the entrant.</P>
    <P>I am most familiar with the local authority in County Galway.  Down through <Col N="1320" /> the years various requests for playgrounds and playground equipment have been made to the council, especially from people in new housing estates.  It is disappointing to get letters such as the one I received last week in reply to a request that the council take responsibility for a play area.  That reply is similar to others I received in the past. The council stated that its policy is not to take over playgrounds because of the requirements of its insurers.  Most councils have insurance with Irish public bodies and it appears that increasingly local authorities are losing court cases. Galway County Council lost a case some years ago and is afraid of potential claims in the future.  It would be very expensive for that council to employ a caretaker from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in every playground, but accidents may happen after 5 p.m. or when a caretaker is absent for part of a day while having a break or ill.  It is unfortunate that advantage can be taken of such circumstances. I hope this problem can be resolved.  It is easy to say that an exemption should be given to local authorities.  Some assistance should be given to them as, in many instances, they provide beautiful playgrounds and the finest equipment but cannot get insurance cover because of the requirements of brokers.  It would be nice to think that local authorities, tourism bodies and property owners would be exempt from the provisions of the Bill, but their concerns reflect many of the problems related to its provisions.</P>
    <P>I hope the Bill will serve the people well.  I believe the Minister has struck the right balance.  I hope the Bill will facilitate the tourism industry and that the people who visit our country to enjoy our hospitality will always be welcome and able to visit monuments and sites of cultural interest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFerris" hpid="Mr. Ferris Mr. Ferris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ferris</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill.  The area covered in the Bill is of particular interest to Deputies from rural Ireland. Many landowners in my constituency of South Tipperary have expressed a good deal of interest and concern about this <Col N="1321" /> subject over a number of years.  The House briefly discussed the concept of liability of occupiers in respect of those, invited or otherwise, who use their land. During the debate on a previous Private Members' Bill my colleague, the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor, who is responsible for this Bill, promised that his Department would prepare legislation, the substance of the Bill before us.  That legislation was prepared after detailed consideration of all the aspects of this problem by the Law Reform Commission.</P>
      <P>I admit it has been said by some of my colleagues and others that in the Law Reform Commission there was a 3:2 majority in favour of the provision concerning responsibility for children.  Of the two people who expressed a different view from the majority, one is now a Supreme Court judge.  That should be sufficient to caution people that some of those who held a contrary view now hold a position where they may have to adjudicate on this legislation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to simplify and clarify the law on occupiers' liability and to give it a statutory basis.  At present the law in this area is governed by common law principles.  The Bill contains specific provisions designed to facilitate the use of land for recreational activities and implements many of the recommendations contained in the Law Reform Commission's report on occupiers' liability.  We all need to be aware that this is a highly complex area of law. It deals with private property and the obligations that go with its ownership, which is protected in the Constitution. Irish people have a particular regard for land and land/and home ownership. Everyone aspires to the ownership of property as opposed to leasing or renting. Property, whether land or houses, confers a special constitutional privilege, particularly in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Land ownership, because of its special place in the Constitution and the privileges conferred in it, imposes certain obligations.   The owner of a property has an obligation to third parties &mdash; particularly if there are areas which are <Col N="1322" /> a risk especially to people unaware of that risk &mdash; to minors and to those incapable of reading or being warned of an impending risk following entry to property, whether invited or not.  The owner of property may be informed by the Electricity Supply Board of dangerous wires in a particular field or over a fence and advised to remove his stock from the field for safety purposes.  The wires are the property of the Electricity Supply Board but are on the land of the private property owner.   A dangerous wire may lie across a path traditionally used by people.  In rural areas there are many such paths leading to churches and other facilities where the right of way is not written into them, as we understand it as members of local authorities, where there are recognised rights of way over roadways.  Traditional Mass paths are used and the owners of these properties welcome such people.</P>
    <P>If the landowner was aware of the fallen power line which was a risk to livestock, took no action to ensure its safety and if a child entered that property, somebody would have to accept responsibility.  That responsibility rests on the property owner.  When we say it is simple to ensure that people have all the rights to protection we must impose responsibility where those rights are protected.  The Bill is balanced in that respect.  It was introduced by the Minister at the request of many Deputies from rural areas and other public users, following serious consideration and on the understanding that it was a major improvement on the present position.</P>
    <P>We should look at the Bill in a positive light as the Minister did on the day he launched it in the presence of many of the farming organisations, who expressed a general welcome, with some reservations about certain sections.  On that day the Minister committed himself to listen to the debate in the House, which has gone on for a lengthy period, to examine whatever areas could be improved on and to protect the whole concept of what the Bill proposes to do. At the same time we must ensure that people have freedom of movement, <Col N="1323" /> within reason, in rural areas for sport, fishing or the hunt which has had a traditional history in Ireland.  This freedom to traverse land and property was usually welcomed by the farmer.  There was a tradition that any damage caused by hounds and huntsman to property would be repaired.  Unfortunately, because of negligence by some in the past, people became conscious of their right to claim.  As the Minister will confirm and as we are aware &mdash; as members of local authorities &mdash; when claims are made to local authorities or anybody else found negligent by the court the court compensates the person, not for the injury they received but because the accident was caused by somebody else's negligence.</P>
    <P>We all &mdash; particularly members of local authorities &mdash; complain about people making claims, and insurers will not accept a risk for children in a playground because if somebody has an accident they will make a claim.  I remind insurers, particularly insurers of local authorities, that it is their duty and the duty of local authorities where services are provided for the public to make every effort to ensure the safety of that service or facility.  If it is safe no case will be taken.  If there is a claim it is substantiated in court, not in an insurance company's office or in the middle of a local authority meeting.  It is decided by a judge, sometimes a jury, if the accident is serious.  It is usually decided by people who have considered all the aspects.  Let us not criticise people who make a genuine claim following injury as a result of somebody else's negligence.  That is a basic right. People have a constitutional right to that protection.  In conferring that right and balancing it with the right of property owners there are constitutional rights on both sides.</P>
    <P>There was a reference to heritage, archaeological and historical sites. There are hundreds of such sites in my constituency &mdash; the Rock of Cashel, Cahir Castle, Carrick-on-Suir Castle, <Col N="1324" /> the Westgate in Clonmel, the Swiss Cottage and so on &mdash; visited by thousands of visitors each year.  Some 150,000 people come to see the Rock of Cashel. Although it is dangerous to go up on the parapets people come to visit it because the State guarantees, within the limits available to it, that all precautions will be taken to safeguard them.  Claims are rarely made except when people have a genuine accident.  The State has properly protected these monuments and sites for the benefit of children and tourists and we should always promote them as places which people can visit.  They should not be dealt with under this legislation which deals mainly with people's right of access, by invitation or otherwise, to land and the right of the farmer to take action against people who trespass on his land.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the points made during the debate.  This is not a black and white issue and he will have to make the best possible judgment.  Aside from the debate, the consideration of the matter by the Law Reform Commission, the advice of the Attorney General, the facilities available to him and his expertise in this area, the Minister is aware that at some stage somebody might find a loophole in the legislation and challenge it in the courts.  That is the basis on which we must proceed.</P>
    <P>This legislation is a substantial improvement on the previous totally unsatisfactory situation where owners of land were responsible for injuries sustained by those who used it.  This has to be balanced with a farmer's responsibility to ensure that people who use his land will not be injured.  As a Minister of State recently said, many accidents occur on farms during the course of normal farming activities.  There is now a greater risk of accidents occurring on farms and farmers are aware of this.  As the main occupiers and owners of land in rural areas, farmers are extremely concerned that they will be open to claims being made against them for accidents for which they believe they do not have responsibility.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1325" /> On the day he launched the Bill the Minister said he would listen to the points made and consider all the genuine cases put to him.  It is only when one travels abroad that one realises that people who enter farmers' land in Holland, Belgium, Spain, etc., are immediately removed.  However, some continental tourists who visit Ireland set up camp on land without asking the permission of the farmer or owner.  They know that people in rural Ireland welcome visitors, particularly those from Europe.</P>
    <P>The Minister is also responsible for looking after the rights of minorities, including those of travellers.  Travellers who set up unauthorised camping sites on a regional or county road cause enormous damage by deliberately putting horses into fields irrespective of the risk of infection or damage to livestock. Travellers who do this have a total disregard for the rights of people.  Those of us who are members of local authorities use the powers conferred on us by the Minister to do something about these unfortunate people who are basically homeless and who, if they got the opportunity, might send their children to school.</P>
    <P>Until such time as this problem is properly addressed travellers will have to understand that they must show some respect for private property; otherwise they will become their own worst enemies and members of local authorities will be isolated in the community for wanting to help people who have a total disregard for property, livestock and old people who live in fear.  I would not mind if travellers who go around begging were in genuine need.  However, they do not seem to be poverty stricken as many of them own new vehicles and equipment.  If these people set up camp along a road we are powerless to move them on.  Farmers are worried about the damage they will cause to their land, yet when they try to talk to them it usually ends up in a fight.  People must respect other people's rights.   We cannot disregard the rights of landowners or the State.  Likewise, those people who are <Col N="1326" /> privileged to own property cannot disregard their responsibilities to the users of that land.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this very important legislation.  It is fair to say that the contributions so far have tended to concentrate on its implications for the farming sector.  This is understandable as, even though some of the more worrying aspects have been addressed the legislation will still have implications for farmers.   However, there are also other groupings in society for whom this legislation has clear implications. I am thinking in particular of local authorities, the boards of management of primary, post-primary and third level schools and voluntary organisations who provide community facilities and amenities for children and manage and operate community centres in towns, villages and cities.  The reality is that occupiers' liability extends to all these people and the legislation is relevant to them.</P>
      <P>Farmers are terrified that people will use their land.  Gun clubs have tried to assuage the fears of farmers and endeavoured to convince them that their insurance provides for a certain level of indemnity.  On closer examination, it was discovered their cover is inadequate under the present provisions.</P>
      <P>School boards of management are constantly concerned and local authorities have had to close playground amenities to reduce the number of claims against them.  The Minister need only speak to any county manager or secretary to discover the astronomical premium demands placed on urban and county local authorities to cover public liability claims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This legislation should be considered in tandem with the long promised legislation on the control of insurance costs. I accept that legislation is not the responsibility of the Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Taylor.  Responsibility for the overall insurance industry rests with the <Col N="1327" /> Department of Enterprise and Employment and, under present arrangements, the Minister of State at that Department, Deputy Rabbitte.  On foot of prompting from constituents, on a number of occasions I raised their concern about what is happening in the area of insurance premiums, public liability, motor insurance and employer liability. For some peculiar reason there appears to be a lack of appreciation and understanding of what is really involved and the implications for jobs in the annual premiums many sectors have to meet. For example, the owner of a small hotel in my constituency rang me a few months ago and told me he had been paying £25,000 per annum in public liability insurance cost for his hotel, but on foot of a pending claim his premium increased to £40,000.  Between full-time and casual employees, that man employs approximately 30 to 35 people and is actively considering the viability of his business.  When the implications of insurance premiums reach that stage there is need for urgent action and the necessary legislative changes to be put in place.</P>
    <P>I am not sure if the Minister is aware of the very important conference organised by Muintir na Tíre that was held in the community centre at Santry a few weeks ago.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Minister for Equality and Law Reform (Mr. Taylor) Mervyn Taylor">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise, that is correct. Unfortunately, because of my commitments to the House on that day I was unable to attend.  It is noteworthy that that conference was organised by Muintir na Tíre, the umbrella organisation for community organisations.  That it was considered necessary to bring a speaker from New Zealand to outline how the insurance industry operates there underlines the concern about insurance matters here.  Insurance premiums here cost considerably more than those in other member states of the <Col N="1328" /> European Union or in jurisdictions outside the Community.  There must be a fundamental reason for that.  We have a relatively well developed infrastructure and I am sure our range of facilities and our position regarding land ownership are similar to those in the United Kingdom or New Zealand.  There is an obvious need to address the legislative position of the insurance industry.</P>
      <P>The implications for jobs is underestimated. I was contacted recently by a constituent involved in the meat sector who is encountering grave difficulties in getting quotes for public or employer liability.  We cannot allow people to operate plants in such high risk areas without adequate insurance.  I accept that much of what I said may not be directly relevant to the Minister, the question of legislation on insurance costs is a matter for another Minister.</P>
      <P>Anyone interested in collecting newspaper cuttings will be familiar with the utterances of successive Ministers for the Environment lamenting the fact that local authorities are paying huge public liability insurance premiums annually, money that could be much better spent on the roads of my constitency and, indeed, that of Deputy Boylan.  I am sure the county secretary or manager of Cavan County Council could tell us of the astronomical amount of public liability insurance premia that local authority pays annually to meet its commitments.  On the basis of present figures, however, no Minister in recent years has sufficiently tackled the position. I have not had an opportunity to examine the papers presented to the conference at Santry by the insurance industry expert from New Zealand, but it would cost nothing if we could learn something from the New Zealand experience.  I am sure the Minister will agree this Bill should be considered in tandem with legislation on the control of insurance costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not prejudge the matter before considering it.</P>
      <P>It is commonly believed that there is a difficulty regarding the submission of fraudulent claims.  A minority of solicitors are in the ambulance chasing business and a minority also operate on the basis of &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo;.  If a person believes he or she can easily obtain money from submitting a claim, an offer of &ldquo;no foal, no fee&rdquo; will be very attractive, particularly if the case is doubtful. This matter must be addressed.  I do not have the answers.  Perhaps it is an attitudinal problem; if so, it should be dealt with by providing leadership.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and the opportunity of expressing my views on insurance cover and the obligations of occupiers, whether farmers or those managing our wide range of community facilities.  It is important that their interests are addressed.  We must strike a balance between responsibility to them and the need to allow people feedom of movement.  At a time when I hope we are on the brink of realising the full potential of our tourism industry there should be minimum restrictions on people who want to visit our national monuments or simply walk around our farm lands, parks and mountains.  Occupiers' liability is integral to tourism development.  It is vital that the legislation be conducive to attracting people to walk the land while appreciating and protecting the interests of the people who own property and have attendant responsibilities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AndrewBoylan" hpid="Mr. Boylan Mr. Boylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on the Bill.  I compliment the Minister on behalf of thousands of land and property owners for having the courage to introduce it.  For too long we have waited to have this serious matter addressed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support everything Deputy Kirk said about public liability insurance which has become a major obstacle to people setting up business.  The problem has got out of hand and the cost of insurance is beyond reason.  Public liability insurance for hotels, small factories, <Col N="1330" /> local authorities etc. has become a major burden.  It is not unusual for local groups providing an amenity to hand it over to the local authority as soon as the work is completed because of the fear that, having opened the amenity, somebody will be injured and the trustees will be held responsible.  That is not acceptable.  I am not saying that there is a compensation culture sweeping the country.  Far be it from me to say that people are not entitled to compensation if they are injured.  However, the figures published in our national daily papers are astronomical.  First time insurance cost for motorists is outrageous, but the Minister, Deputy Taylor, is listening and, being a capable legal person, perhaps he will tackle the problem after this Bill is passed by both Houses.</P>
    <P>As a rural Deputy I have a particular interest in this Bill.  I am well aware of the fears of many landowners.  Our farms have traditionally been open to people who wandered in and were welcomed. Perhaps that was taken too much for granted because we are talking about private property, not an open common.  Farmers have welcomed people on to their lands and like to see them coming from the towns and villages to enjoy the countryside.  Until recently there was no question of the owner being liable.  A person who fell and was hurt went home and nursed the injury.  That has changed and farmers have become fearful.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago there was a tragic accident in the west which probably began the present trend.  The circumstances were rather bizarre &mdash; two people, one of whom had a gun, were out game shooting; the man carrying the gun tripped and accidentally shot his friend in the ankle.  The legal advice they got was to sue the farmer.  The action was successful and the farmer had to pay £75,000 in compensation.  In today's money that would probably be £250,000. What made headlines in the farming journals was the fact that the judge berated the farmer for being careless.  It seems the man carrying the gun had tripped on a piece of wire which was <Col N="1331" /> lying under flattened grass.  It is usual to allow the grass to grow over a broken fence until the farmer has time to mend it.  A countryman would understand that and take care; the people in question were from the town.</P>
    <P>The farmer had to sit for ten or 15 minutes listening to a judge tell him how he should run his farm; the same judge who may not know a cow from a bull, took it upon himself to tell the farmer how to manage his farm.</P>
    <P>The farmer had not invited the two men in question, had no knowledge that they were on his land, but was held responsible.  That is how the fear spread among landowners about leaving gates open and allowing people enter the land.  That is sad in many ways because people got great enjoyment from spending summer afternoons in the countryside, travelling along the banks of a river with a fishing rod, being welcomed by the local farmer and having a chat. Tourists found it strange that they had the freedom to walk unhindered through the countryside.  However, they quickly took this concession for granted.</P>
    <P>English fishermen are real gentlemen and never enter land without first calling at the house to ask permission, and offer thanks on leaving.  It is nice that people do that even though they know they are welcome &mdash; they realise that the property is not theirs.  One cannot open a door in a town, city or village and walk into a person's private house, make onself at home and watch television. One cannot go on to a person's private lawn and have a picnic.  The person who would do so would soon be told by the owners to get out.  Those same people expect to be allowed wander around the countryside to enjoy themselves. While they are welcome there must be standards and they must accept responsibility.  However, that is not the case, landowners are held responsible.  I am glad the Minister is qualifying this in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In passing, I wish to mention that all landowners are not farmers.  There are people who have a big business in the <Col N="1332" /> city and, as a sideline, they own land and a country residence.  Such people may not be as generous as the traditional farmer in allowing strangers pass through their land.</P>
    <P>Property owners are still liable in the case of minors.  Farmers fear young people wandering on their land in the summer time to play games, kick football, fish etc. or in the autumn to watch the chestnuts fall.   If one of them trips and falls, who is responsible?   Surely the landowner cannot be held responsible. Parents or guardians must be responsible for their children.  There can be no grey area.   The responsibility should not be shifted on to the farmer.  It is expected that this will be a boom year for tourism and tourists generally come as families with their children.  Farmers want to know where they stand.</P>
    <P>Historic monuments and places of interest have been mentioned.   It is lovely to see them and people are welcome to do so, but they are generally located on private property.  The question of who is responsible for people making their way to and from these monuments must be addressed.</P>
    <P>It is only right that I should say that farmers and landowners are, broadly speaking, the essence of decency and are glad to promote tourism in any way they can for the benefit of the country. While I do not wish to point the finger at any particular nationality, many foreigners buy up property adjacent to lakes, rivers and picturesque areas and, no sooner have they acquired their cottage and five or six acres than they erect four rows of barbed wire around it, often cutting off a right of way to a river bank.  Are they entitled to do that? Under law is there a right of way along every river and lake or are people allowed to fence them off?   There is a belief that people can make their way along a river bank unhindered, that it is public property.  It is wrong that property owners can erect a fence with barbed wire up to the edge of a river. Are they allowed to do this?   Who will be held liable if someone is hurt trying to cross such a fence?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1333" /> Under this Bill where a local authority and a community group come together to provide an amenity such as a play area, including swings, or a pitch and putt course, will the trustees continue to be held liable?  It is well high impossible to obtain public liability insurance.  I hope that farmers or their spouses will not lie awake at night worrying about a claim for compensation when someone is involved in an accident on their farm.  We should not entertain this.  Can the Minister give a guarantee that they will not be held liable?   Is it possible, legally, to give such a guarantee?</P>
    <P>No matter what Bill is introduced there will be a court challenge, given that solicitors offer their services on a no win no fee basis.  Will farmers and landowners continue to be taken to court when there is no risk for the person taking the case?   There are many property owners who lead quiet and peaceful lives, who have never seen the inside of a courtroom who are fearful that a claim will be made against them and they will be dragged through the courts.   They should not have to live with this fear because they have been generous in providing an amenity or facility for people to enjoy.  They can live and farm better without them.  They do not wish to stop them using the amenity but they fear that they may be sued.  Will they be able to recoup their costs?  If a person is seriously injured and has to give up his job he should receive compensation but I fail to see why a landowner should have to sell his property to meet a huge award.</P>
    <P>The Minister should address this issue and put the minds of those living in rural Ireland at ease.  They are only too glad to see people like the Minister and others from this large city visit the countryside.  He will be welcome on many a farm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is now a compensation culture and the cost of public liability insurance is soaring.  Farmers and <Col N="1334" /> landowners in particular are encountering difficulties in this respect.  It is the desire of each Member that the law should be changed and measures taken not only to indemnify those involved but also to reduce insurance costs.</P>
      <P>It is crucial that we address the issues involved to reduce the cost of insurance to farmers, landowners, businesses and local communities.  It is important that we offer our thanks to farmers and landowners for being so generous to people living both in and outside the local community. They have never been slow in allowing them access to their lands to enjoy forests, rivers, lakes, mountains and our natural heritage, including national monuments, such as Mass rocks, Celtic crosses, and other areas of interest. They have been more than willing to cooperate and in many instances were the instigators in the development of agri-tourism which continues to flourish. Because of the threat of litigation they are asking whether they are being foolish in allowing people easy access to places of interest on their land.  This Bill therefore is timely and relevant.</P>
      <P>Apart from landowners and farmers, there are others covered by the Bill who are looking forward to its enactment.  I am referring to the question of access to community centres, parks and playgrounds. In recent times the humble householder has also been affected as a result of the inadequacies of the current legislation.  Some have been subject to claims for compensation by trespassers who were injured while engaged in illegal activity.   These matters are dealt with in the Bill and for that reason it is worthy of support.</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann, mindful of the severe economic deprivation being <Col N="1335" /> caused, the unacceptable hardship caused to many families and the damage being done to local agriculture, tourism and manufacturing industries by the rapid disintegration of our county roads infrastructure, condemns the Government for the reduction in funding for non-national roads and calls on the Government to recognise the crisis and increase the level of funding for these roads.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>When I received word about the notification last week of the allocation of moneys to non-national roads, I was absolutely astounded. Although the Budget Statement had indicated that only an additional £8 million was being provided for this I could not believe that the Government had become so far removed from the people in such a short space of time that it would actually reduce the amount of moneys to be spent on non-national roads this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My incredulity turned to anger when I realised the reality of the allocations announced last week.  Despite what the Government's amendment might say, there is a 4 per cent reduction, from £107 million to £103 million, in the overall total of the 1995 figure.  When I examined the figure more closely I discovered that the INTERREG funding was also being raided, not to provide the additionality it is supposed to provide but to replace Exchequer funding of £8 million.  Therefore, the total being provided by the Government this year is not £103 million but just over £95 million, a reduction of 11 per cent on last year's allocation.   The fact that the Border counties are being cheated of additional funding, which the Minister for Finance referred to in the House last week as being additional, is a point I will leave to my colleagues from the Border <Col N="1336" /> constituencies to develop but it is one worth noting.</P>
    <P>I mentioned my anger at the realisation that the Government had actually cut the allocation for non-national roads for this year but I am angry for a number of reasons.  I am angry principally because this particular announcement signifies the end of a seven-year period during which the problems of non-national and county roads were being treated seriously.  During those seven years serious efforts were being made to address what was always admitted to be a major problem for many areas but particularly rural areas.  The cut in this allocation signifies also a total abandonment of the commitments made by successive Ministers during those seven years to solve this problem.</P>
    <P>I do not believe in overnight solutions to major problems.  In fact, I do not believe in overnight solutions to many of our minor problems because such approaches do not work.   In this instance I do not believe any Minister can resolve such a major problem with one year's allocation of funds.  The most recent estimate of funding that would be required to address this problem is a little over £1 billion.  I did not expect the Minister to wave a magic wand and solve all our problems this year but the policy pursued by successive Ministers since 1987 was having some effect and was at least containing the problem.  The public, many of whom were impatient and angry, accepted that some progress was being made and had some hope that the problem would be tackled over a period.</P>
    <P>Last week's announcement of the allocation dashed any hopes the public might have had of a continued commitment by the Government to improve non-national roads.  It sent a signal to communities around the country that there was no policy to try to bring non-national roads up to reasonable standards. By its actions the Government has sent a clear signal that it is abandoning the planned programme initiated by the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, <Col N="1337" /> last year.  He told local authorities that funding would remain at the higher level for three years in order to tackle the deteriorating condition of our roads. At various local authority meetings he spelled out what was required of those bodies.  He engaged in a good deal of straight talking as to whether what they were doing was right or wrong.  In giving a commitment that the level of funding would remain the same for three years I assume he took inflation into account.</P>
    <P>The Government is insulting the intelligence of the people when it talks about the exceptional once-off allocation in 1994 and the fact that the 1995 figure represents a record level of funding. That should not be included in any proposed amendment.  A total of £107 million was allocated last year, £103 million is being allocated this year and if one takes the INTERREG figure out of the calculation, the total is £95 million.</P>
    <P>The commitment made last year has now been abandoned.  What will make people even more angry is the fact that this was done at a time when the outgoing Government left the incoming one a balanced budget but this Government did not want to accept it and borrowed £300 million for day-to-day spending.  It was not willing to allow even 1 per cent of that borrowing to go towards the funding of our county roads.</P>
    <P>It is even more annoying that the cut in funding for our non-national roads is equivalent to the amount of money this Government spent on programme managers, advisers, personal assistants and the creation of two additional Ministers of State.  I spoke in this House when those additional positions were being debated and I referred, in particular, to the Government's new-found concern for the west.  I note Minister of State Carey did not have much of an effect on these road allocations in that the counties in the west, for which he has a special and direct responsibility and where roads have been flooded for several months, are actually £2 million less well off than they were last year.  Perhaps, by reducing the roads allocation, <Col N="1338" /> the Government is trying to make up for the Minister's salary and those of his advisers and programme managers.</P>
    <P>What we are seeing is a return to the policies of the 1982-87 Coalition Government &mdash; the syndrome of borrowing money for non-productive purposes and not investing in long term development.  The cut in expenditure is even more inexplicable when one considers the weather conditions of the past four months.  Rainfall has been double the average in that period on top of what Deputy Avril Doyle referred to last year as &ldquo;the wettest 12 months on record&rdquo;.  At that time she was denouncing the Minister for increasing by £30 million the allocation for non-national roads.</P>
    <P>Many of our roads have been under water for months and there has been a rapid disintegration of the infrastructure of county roads because of the weather. This has had a serious effect on industry, tourism and the day-to-day existence of rural families.  While I am angry about the reduction in the allocation, there are many families in Meath and other parts of the country who are even more angry.  I do not live at the end of a class 3 road; I live on the edge of a regional road and, therefore, this measure does not affect me directly.</P>
    <P>A firm in Meath is in danger of losing business because of the state of the roads in the vicinity of the industry.  This light engineering firm produces goods for the German market and for the last six months the owner of the firm has been making excuses on why the purchasers of his equipment in Germany should not come to Ireland to see his facility &mdash; he does not want them to see the state of the road leading to his firm. Several industries not only in Meath but throughout the country have been affected by bad road conditions.  Local economies are affected because lorries cannot travel some routes to collect milk.  Tourism, a key sector for employment creation, is also affected because many of our tourist sites are at the end of county roads, or class 3 roads.  Some beauty spots and places of interest are <Col N="1339" /> virtually closed to tourists because of the bad state of our county roads.</P>
    <P>Like Deputies from all sides of the House, I know many families whose lives are seriously disrupted because roads, which are the lifeline of rural and urban communities, are impassable. Deputies have received many representations in their clinics about the hardship caused by this problem.  I know of several instances in Meath where children have to wear wellingtons to walk from their houses to the end of the lane to get the school bus.  They then leave their wellingtons in a neighbour's house from where they collect them in the evening.  People are unable to cycle on these roads and one person confined to a wheelchair is virtually a prisoner in his home because of the bad state of the roads.   Hundreds of elderly people are afraid to venture on these roads, particularly at night, for fear of falling.</P>
    <P>Last year in this House Deputy Enda Kenny said that citizens who pay high insurance and taxes are entitled to decent roadways.  Since Deputy Kenny is now Minister for Tourism and Trade one would have expected he would have pushed for an increase in the road allocation, considering he was so concerned last year.  Why has he not used his new found influence to do something about this problem?</P>
    <P>This reduction in funding comes after seven years of consistent investment in non-national roads by previous Governments. Between 1983 and 1987 when Fine Gael and Labour were in Government not one penny was paid by the State for maintenance work on county roads.  In the five years 1989-93 grants paid to county councils for non-national road maintenance and improvement totalled £336 million.  Taking account of the contributions from local resources, total expenditure on non-national roads in the past five years was in excess of £600 million.  In 1994 £107 million was allocated for non-national roads, £30 million more than in 1993.  That was an all-time record level of expenditure for <Col N="1340" /> maintenance and improvement of non-national roads.  It is absolute nonsense for the Government, in its amendment, to state that its allocation is a record.</P>
    <P>Between 1986 and 1994 State grants for non-national roads, including urban roads, increased from £40.48 million to £107 million, an increase of more than 160 per cent.  In view of the recent bad weather one would expect the Government to build on the work of the last Administration, but instead it cut the allocation by 4 per cent.  Account was not even taken of inflation.  The least that should have been done was that last year's level of expenditure should have been increased by the rate of inflation. If that had been the case the figure allocated would have been about £110 million. Government Deputies are busily trying to shore up the damage throughout the country by telling their local authorities and newspapers that the full amount has not been allocated, that the £8 million provided for in the budget is not included in this figure, but I have checked this matter with officials in the Department of the Environment who have made it clear that the £103 million is the total amount available this year for non-national roads.</P>
    <P>Failure to take account of inflation and the use of INTERREG funds means the Government's spending on non-national roads is down by £15 million. This contrasts sharply with the 8 per cent increase in other areas of Government expenditure.  While funding for non-national roads in Dublin has increased, and that is very welcome, it must be asked why that was not done for rural Ireland.  Does the Government plan to treat the people of rural Ireland, where there are third class roads, as third class citizens?  I call on the Minister to restore last year's level of funding, taking into account 2.7 per cent inflation.  That is the minimum that should be done.  I reject the Government's amendment to this motion.  It is an insult to people's intelligence to state that &ldquo;when exceptional once-off provisions made in 1994 are excluded, the 1995 grant provided for non-national <Col N="1341" /> roads is at a record level&rdquo;.  It was at a record level of £107 million last year; £103 million is not a record level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanSmith" hpid="Mr. B. Smith Mr. B. Smith">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Smith</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to support the motion in the name of Deputy Dempsey.  The decision by the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party to table it demonstrates our anger at the news contained in the announcement of the Minister for the Environment last week on road allocations.  The allocation to County Cavan has been reduced substantially, from the 1994 figure of £4.641 million to £4.085 million for 1995.  This allocation is totally unacceptable.  The provision is even worse when one considers that within the £4.085 million there is an INTERREG element of £1.3 million.  Thus the real reduction in the 1995 allocation amounts to almost £1.9 million, or 40 per cent of the allocation received from the Department of the Environment in 1994.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All along we were given assurances that the INTERREG funding would be additional to the normal allocation from the national Exchequer.  It is totally unacceptable that the Minister should dramatically slash allocations to the Border counties and then restore in part some of those cuts with INTERREG funding, which was intended in the first place as additional funding for the Border counties.  The allocations show a total unwillingness by this Government to address the serious roads problem in counties such as Cavan and Monaghan and also its lack of commitment to build up the economy of the Border counties. During the past few months we received assurances from members of the Government, Departments and State agencies that funding designated for development in the Border counties would be additional to the normal Exchequer contribution.  Since the cessation of violence in Northern Ireland a new urgency has been attached to remedying the serious infrastructural deficiencies in the Border region.  We believed that the INTERREG II programmer and the Delors package would <Col N="1342" /> be additional to normal national funding. On 28 February the Minister for Finance during Question Time said, &ldquo;It is my intention to ensure that the moneys will be additional&rdquo;.  To our extreme disappointment we learned last week that at the first opportunity presented to the Government to honour its commitment, it has substantially reduced the allocation for regional and county roads to local authorities in Cavan and Monaghan and used the new funding from INTERREG II as a partial substitution for the inexcusable cutback in the national Exchequer contribution.</P>
    <P>The road allocation announcement was very disheartening news to many people who had fervently believed that the promised additional funding for the Border region would bring about a rapid improvement in my county's road network.  The people had every reason to expect a substantial increase on the 1994 allocation in view of the very healthy state of the public finances, the increase in public expenditure, the public commitments made by the Government and the European Union to a regeneration of the Border economy, the additional mileage of road needing substantial repairs as a result of the reopening of formerly closed Border roads and the continuing bad weather, with its adverse effect on the condition of roads.  The news was even more disheartening when the Minister talked about making the necessary improvements in road conditions during the next ten years.  He stated also that the Government had decided a report was necessary.  Cavan County Council has drawn up a very substantial report on the existing condition of regional and county roads and the funding needed to bring them up to an acceptable standard. I am sure the necessary data is readily available to the Minister and his Ministers of State in the Custom House. Talk about the need to draw up a report is only an effort to buy time.</P>
    <P>When this Government published its programme, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> the first item I sought in the document <Col N="1343" /> was the reference to the infrastructural and road network.  To my utter amazement, the only reference I could find to it in that document was on page 26.  The total interest of the parties who contributed to and signed that document, namely the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Democratic Left Party was summed up in one line &mdash;&ldquo;We will provide additional resources to upgrade and adequately maintain county roads&rdquo;. I suspended judgment at that time on the Government's likely attitude and financial contribution to the elimination of the road problems.  Unfortunately my worst fears came true last week when the allocations reflected the cursory mention of roads in that document.  The lack of commitment shown in <i>A Government of Renewal</i> to the much needed improvement in the non-national road network is a continuation of the policy of Fine Gael and Labour in Government in 1985 when it produced the paper, <i>Building on Reality,</i> where there was not even a mention of the importance of the non-national road network.</P>
    <P>Every public representative welcomed the fact that Fianna Fáil in Government ensured that provision was made in the National Development Plan for the partial funding of the non-national road network from Structural Funds.  Previous Ministers for the Environment accepted that the Border counties experienced particular problems and that counties such as Cavan and Monaghan had a special case for funding. With increases during recent years progress was made on the strengthening and improvement of the non-national road network and it was expected that further substantial progress would be made.</P>
    <P>A number of factors contribute to the road network problem in counties such as Cavan, the weak saturated drumlin soil covering approximately 77 per cent of the total area of the county, the increased allowable axle loadings under European Union legislation, intensive agricultural activity, with in excess of 15 <Col N="1344" /> million tonnes of material being transported along the regional and county roads network annually, the large volume of cross-Border heavy commercial traffic and the lack of a railway system which has led to increased heavy axle loadings.  There is an unanswerable case for increased investment in regional and county roads.  Such investment is absolutely necessary to reduce costs for industry, agriculture, tourism and general road users.  Unfortunately we have had continuous heavy rainfall this winter which has contributed substantially to further deterioration in most road conditions.</P>
    <P>It has been accepted in the country and in the European Union that the Border areas suffered immeasurably over the past 25 years because of the political difficulties on its doorstep.  It was particularly difficult to attract inward investment, to encourage tourism to provide employment locally.  It was promised that the cessation of violence would give the six northern and the six southern Border counties a real economic peace dividend.  With the rescinding of the orders in connection with closed cross-Border roads Cavan County Council has received only £121,000 towards the reinstatement of the first six roads to be reopened.  This allocation is totally inadequate.  Minimal work has been undertaken at each Border crossing.  The access roads have become derelict and will remain impassable through lack of funding.  It is totally hypocritical of Ministers to speak about the reopening of closed cross-Border roads and the benefits to local communities on both sides of the Border when the funding to make those roads passable is not made available to the relevant local authorities.</P>
    <P>Co-operation in the tourism industry on an all-Ireland basis has been accepted as necessary to ensure we develop the industry to its optimum. The very roads that tourists become most familiar with are those minor roads and laneways giving access to the waterways of the area.  Those involved in the tourism industry know that the <Col N="1345" /> totally unacceptable condition of some access roads is the principal complaint of many tourists and this is causing serious damage to local tourism.   I ask the Minister for Finance to direct Government Departments to honour the commitments that he and other members of the Government have made.  I refer in particular to his reply to my parliamentary question on the structures he had put in place to ensure that the Delors package and INTERREG funding would be additional.  He answered that an additionality requirement would apply to all those initiatives.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Government to reconsider the total allocation made in respect of regional and county roads and give the people of rural Ireland the roadways to which they are entitled.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In the year following one in which the Minister for Finance balanced the books for the first time in 27 years, hopes were high that extra moneys would be made available to county councils to rebuild, repair and maintain county and regional roads.  Virtually every council had made a strong case to successive Ministers to do this and every public representative drew attention to the need to address <Col N="1346" /> the problem.  This view was strengthened by the knowledge that extra Structural, Cohesion and INTERREG funding would come on stream to bolster national finances.  Instead there is less money in the kitty for 1995, substantially less when INTERREG funding and the rate of inflation are taken into account.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of surprise that the Minister for the Environment was not able to obtain more funding for roads from his party colleague.  It seems to confirm the view that the Labour Party is merely interested in Dublin and constituencies in bigger cities and have decided to let rural people look after themselves.  It is even more surprising in a year in which Government spending increased by 8 per cent that no extra allocation was made for roads.  The figure for last year was not even matched.</P>
    <P>The 1995 allocation for roads will lead to serious hardship for rural families and communities.  I studied total road grant payments to County Clare over a ten year period.  The 1995 allocation is by far the worst in real terms since the mid-eighties.  It shows a drop of £1.3 million on the 1994 figure for non-national roads.  National road grants have been slashed from £6.620 million in 1994 to £3.017 million this year, less than 50 per cent of the allocation last year.  This spells disaster for the roads programme in County Clare in 1995 where substantial increased funding is required after the worst flooding in living memory.</P>
    <P>The Minister cannot say he is unaware of the problems.  Even if members of his own party or of the Government have not drawn his attention to them, this is the fourth occasion in over a month that I have drawn attention in the Chamber to the problems.  I have raised them by way of parliamentary question and drawn attention to the need for extra funding.</P>
    <P>The effects will be serious for county councils.  It will lead to short-time working and other serious problems.  It will give rise to extreme difficulty for rural communities and families going about <Col N="1347" /> their daily business, getting children to school, bringing milk to the creamery, going to work etc.  Most rural roads in County Clare and the surrounding area have been very badly damaged as a result of the recent flooding.  Unless funding is provided urgently, county councils will be forced to abandon large stretches of roads and tourism will be badly affected.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to introduce a supplementary budget.  The Clare county engineer prepared a report in which he pointed out the need for £1.5 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>By the very nature of the debate, speakers will deal with incontrovertible figures and statistics.  We know <Col N="1348" /> the exact road mileage in our constituencies and the amount of money provided. I cannot understand the Government amendment to Deputy Dempsey's motion which states that when one deducts the proceeds from the amnesty the figures this year are at a record level.  I can only speak for my constituency in Mayo.  A sum of £3.8 million was allocated to Mayo in 1994 and £3.062 million was given this year.  That is a reduction of £800,000 if we take out the amnesty proceeds which were welcomed by local authorities in 1994.  If we add back the amnesty proceeds we are down 14 per cent on the moneys allocated this year.  Those are incontrovertible facts and figures.  If we ignore the amnesty money, the funding is reduced by 20 per cent.</P>
      <P>The Minister should investigate why bitumen prices, ex works, rose from £134 per tonne in 1994 to £174 per tonne in 1995.  Bitumen figures are tendered to the Department of the Environment in dollars and the dollar has been fairly stable.  I cannot understand why local authorities are to be penalised to the extent of paying £174 per tonne this year.  That will increase the surface dressing cost per mile by 10 per cent.</P>
      <P>The allocation for 1995 has been reduced by 40 per cent and bitumen costs have risen.  The cost of chippings, an essential ingredient, has risen by 7 per cent to 8 per cent this year.  This will affect the amount of work carried out. In County Mayo, despite the fact that we had a former Minister for the Environment, 92.5 per cent of the roads comprise county and regional roads and 66 per cent of the traffic is carried on them. I join my collegues in asking the Minister to do whatever is possible between now and the passage of the Finance Bill to ensure that the full allocation is restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want the Minister, his Department and the Government not to follow the suggestion of the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Jim Higgins, to introduce a carbon tax or, let us call a spade a spade, an increase in the price of petrol.  The same Minister <Col N="1349" /> of State said recently in County Mayo the Government was considering an increase of ten pence per gallon to supplement the shortfall in funding.  The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Carey, will be aware that such an increase would further marginalise industries operating on the west coast who already incur additional transport costs approximately 7 to 15 per cent <i>vis-à-vis</i> other European countries.  We must get our goods to those markets.</P>

For <Col N="1352" /> example, Fianna Fáil in Government cut the State grant provision for non-national roads from £82.5 million in 1990 to £79.3 million in 1991 and reduced it by a further £4 million in 1993.  The last figure I gave included £2.4 million in INTERREG payments.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;particularly in its central contention that funding for non-national roads has been reduced by this Government in 1995.  The reality is that, when certain exceptional, non-recurring elements are removed from the 1994 grants package, the 1995 grants will be seen to be greater not only than the underlying 1994 level but also greater than in any previous year.  It is disingenuous for the motion to suggest otherwise.</P>
      <P>It is premature, given the experience of funding in 1994, to draw any definitive conclusions on how expenditure in the current year will compare with that in 1994.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The motion, by implication, suggests that responsibility for non-national roads rests with the Government, whereas in fact, as the Fianna Fáil Party is aware, the legal and financial responsibility vests in the local authorities.  The Government is well aware of the problems affecting our non-national roads and has already made two significant responses to deal with these problems.  It has provided additional funding in the budget and asked for a comprehensive report on the state of the network so that a proper plan can be in place and implemented over a reasonable period.  I suggest these are not the actions of a Government avoiding reality or turning its face in the opposite direction when confronted with a difficult problem &mdash; quite the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before getting down to the substance of the motion.  I would like to stand back from the detail and place the present <Col N="1354" /> debate in a broader context.  The non-national road network is of particular economic importance because industrial development is widely dispersed throughout the country.  Tourism, which accounts for 7 per cent of GNP, is dispersed by its very nature.  Agriculture is of much greater importance than in the rest of the European Union, accounting for 22 per cent of exports.  To put it very bluntly, if we are to develop urban and rural communities and provide alternative sources of income for our rural population, we must improve our non-national roads.</P>
    <P>However, this places a particularly heavy financial burden on our society as, by European standards we have a very extensive system of public roads. For example, for every 1,000 people we have over three times as many kilometres of road as Italy, the Netherlands and Spain.  This, combined with the low density of our population and our relatively low level of urbanisation, inevitably means that maintaining our public roads system in general, and the non-national element in particular, creates very significant demands on our resources.  As a society we must face up to this and take whatever action is appropriate to upgrade the network to an acceptable standard over a reasonable period.</P>
    <P>There has been a huge increase in recent years in the volume and nature of the traffic using our non-national roads, many carrying traffic loads greatly exceeding their limited structural capacity.  These loads arise, for example, from bulk milk tankers, oil delivery vehicles, timber extraction operations; heavy agricultural machinery, lorries carrying agricultural produce such as beet and grain as well as traffic serving industry.</P>
    <P>Very little of the regional and county road system was &ldquo;designed&rdquo; or purpose-built. Most of the network has water-bound macadam, broken stone or gravel bases, over which one or more surface dressings have been provided to seal the surface and prevent water penetration. Many county roads have received one <Col N="1355" /> surface dressing only.  The width of much of the network is inadequate to accommodate a heavy goods vehicle and an opposing vehicle, with the result that large vehicles over-run the payement causing severe damage to its support.</P>
    <P>Weather and ground conditions both affect road condition.  Freezing and thawing cycles can break up perished or cracked road surfaces and cause total foundation failure if reaching the subsoil beneath the road.  Many rural roads have no satisfactory drainage and water penetration through cracked surfaces which are not drained leads quickly and progressively to potholing and major road damage.  The large reduction in essential maintenance operations, such as surface dressing and clearing of drainage outlets, as a result of cutbacks over the years in local funding and reductions in maintenance operatives has made all of these problems even worse and accelerated the decline in the condition of regional and county roads.</P>
    <P>There has also been a steady increase in the size and weight of the heavy goods vehicle fleet.  The situation has been aggravated by EU directives which provided for increased vehicle axle weights and dimensions and by increases in the number of such vehicles on our roads; goods vehicles over eight tonnes have increased four-fold over the past 30 years and are believed to account for more than 90 per cent of road payement damage.  The consequences of increasing vehicle weights and axle loadings, therefore, accelerate the process of damaging road surfaces and bridges, particularly on roads having little structural capacity to withstand such loadings.</P>
    <P>A further element which has to be taken into account and to which I will return later, is that there had been a general pattern of decline in the overall funds raised by local authorities for the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads.  In fact, the contribution from local authorities' resources as a percentage of total expenditure on these <Col N="1356" /> roads declined from over 70 per cent to just 36 per cent in the past ten years. This reduction led to the lengthening of the period between surface dressing applications and other essential maintenance operations.</P>
    <P>Due to these factors, the Government sought a report as a matter of urgency on the overall state of our county roads, including changed traffic patterns, methods used for repair, future planning, etc.  The aim will be to put before the Government an up to date review of the state of the network, the extent and nature of the problems and the cost implications of bringing the network up to an acceptable standard over the next ten years.  When this report is available to the Government &mdash; I expect this to be in about two months &mdash; the question of funding will be considered further. The Government is fully committed to improving our county roads system and when it has had an opportunity to consider the overall situation, a realistic plan will be put in place to achieve this. The financial implications of implementing the plan will be an integral part of the exercise and the Government will play its part in ensuring that the plan can be properly implemented.</P>
    <P>The 1995 grants to local authorities for non-national roads amount to almost £103 million, over £1,900 for every mile of network.  This level of funding represents a very significant contribution on the part of the State.  It would be useful to outline briefly for the information of the House the main features of the grants package so that Deputies will be aware of the nature, importance and extent of the assistance being provided by the Government in this area.  In so far as the grants package is concerned: county councils will receive a total of £91.8 million for non-national roads, including discretionary grants of almost £51 million; urban roads will get a total of £8 million in block grants, in the case of some urban authorities this will be supplemented by receipts under the EU co-financed scheme of specific grants; £8 million is being provided in grants under the new <Col N="1357" /> EU INTERREG II programme which will benefit Border counties and certain maritime areas; £1.13 million will be provided to substantially complete in 1995 the re-opening of cross-Border roads on this side of the Border and £34.33 million will be available under the EU co-financed scheme of specific grants for road improvements on non-national roads.</P>
    <P>The overall funding for non-national roads in 1995 at £102.898 million may appear to compare unfavourably with expenditure in 1994, but the overall 1994 allocation of £107 million included a provision of an exceptional, once-off nature, namely, an additional £15 million provided in the 1994 budget from tax amnesty receipts.  The source of this funding, the tax amnesty, was accepted to be a once-off benefit to the Exchequer and categorical assurances were given that this windfall for the Exchequer would not affect the underlying pattern of spending.  In this connection, the financial statement of the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Ahern, on the 1994 budget spelled out that; &ldquo;certain large once-off benefits in 1994 must not be allowed to cause a mis-match in the longer term balance of the public finances.&rdquo;  He also stated that, &ldquo;as already mentioned, I have applied the proceeds of the tax amnesty &mdash; to some once-off items of expenditure.&rdquo; Deputy Ahern added that &ldquo;further, given their once-off nature, it would be quite inappropriate to apply such receipts either to underpin continuing Government expenditure or to tax reliefs that would affect future revenues.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The special, once-off, nature of the 1994 grants was further recognised by the fact that they were allocated as separate and distinct categories of grants to county councils, rather than being absorbed in the general pool of discretionary grant moneys.  Besides making these separate allocations, local authorities were required to apply these moneys to certain categories of work and/or types of roads thereby further <Col N="1358" /> distinguishing these moneys from the normal discretionary grants.</P>
    <P>If one excludes the additional £15 million provided in 1994, a very different picture emerges in so far as overall expenditure on non-national roads is concerned.  For comparison purposes I will include the three years 1993, 1994 and 1995 and the relevant moneys in these years amounted to £75.3 million, £92 million and £102.898 million respectively.  This means that the 1995 allocations are up by nearly £11 million or almost 12 per cent on the underlying 1994 expenditure figure and up by nearly £28 million or over 36 per cent on the 1993 expenditure level.</P>
    <P>On the issue of overall resources, it is premature for the House to make any definitive judgment about how the 1995 finances for non-national roads compare with the 1994 position.  The motion before the House does not compare like with like but, instead, compares the final expenditure figure for 1994 with the provision for 1995 as it stands in March. As the experience of 1994 shows, any judgment at this stage as to the year's final expenditure figure would be purely speculative.</P>
    <P>I would like to explain how the non-national road grants are allocated to individual local authorities, as this matter has been the subject of comment, with the implied suggestion that the methods used are somehow unreasonable or unfair to certain local authority areas or parts of the country.</P>
    <P>As I said when replying to a number of matters raised on the Adjournment last week, grants for non-national roads are provided as either discretionary block grants for maintenance and improvement works or EU co-financed grants for specific improvement projects. The major portion of the provision available in 1995 for allocation to county councils as discretionary grants has been allocated on a <i>pro rata</i> mileage basis with the exception of the three Dublin county councils which received somewhat higher allocations because of traffic volumes, wear and tear, management needs etc., in their areas.  This <Col N="1359" /> approach is consistent with the method used to determine road grant allocations in previous years.</P>
    <P>The balance of the discretionary grants provision for county councils. that is £5 million in 1995, was reserved for the purpose of making supplementary allocations to councils in counties in which the condition of roads is particularly poor.  The amount of the grant allocation to these councils was determined by the Minister having regard to the situation in each county.  This is fully in line with previous practice.  The £8 million allocated in block grants to urban authorities in 1995 was distributed on the basis of size, within population bands.</P>
    <P>A sum of £34.33 million is available in 1995 for the EU co-financed scheme of specific grants for improvement works on non-national roads which are important for employment and economic activity.  Allocations in respect of individual projects put forward by local authorities are decided by the Minister following an assessment of their individual merits and their compliance with European Commission criteria relating to the grants scheme.  This is fully in line with how the scheme operated in 1994. It is in the nature of this scheme that allocations to individual local authorities will tend to fluctuate from year to year, depending on the size and scale of individual projects.  This is inevitable but such &ldquo;swings and roundabouts&rdquo; tend to even out over a period of years.</P>
    <P>A further £8 million is available this year under the INTERREG II Community initiative which I outlined in the House last week.  I hope the House will agree, therefore, that the methods used to distribute the non-national road grants to local authorities are both fair and reasonable and fully in line with previous practice.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that local authorities maintain their commitment to investment in the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads and that the very substantial contribution from the <Col N="1360" /> State is not used by them as an excuse to reduce funding from their own resources.  State grants are provided to supplement the resources of local authorities, not to replace them.  In this connection, road authorities are spending from their own resources at the same general level, in money terms, as in the early 1980s but of course the real value of this expenditure has been reduced by inflation in the interim.</P>
    <P>We have also seen a dramatic shift in the balance of funding for non-national roads since 1986.  In that year, grants accounted for one-third of total expenditure on the maintenance and improvement of these roads.</P>
    <P>I appeal to local authorities, therefore, to provide realistically for the maintenance and upkeep of county roads in particular, and to ensure that the priority being accorded to these roads by the Government and local communities is reflected in the financial commitment at local level where responsibility for these roads is vested.</P>

Any fairminded Member would be forced to the conclusion that the Government is acting reasonably and responsibly and that the motion put down by the main Opposition party should be rejected for what it is &mdash; an opportunistic attack on the Government that is without real foundation and which, unfortunately for Fianna Fáil, smacks of the same mindset which permeated their thinking on another important issue recently before this House.</P>

      <P>Dear Mr. Boylan, The milk tanker is being threatened to be taken off our road.  We are asked to bring the milk out to the public road.  As we have a static milk tank this is not possible.  Even after representations to the county manager and the Minister for the Environment the road is still not repaired.</P>
      <P>Another letter reads:</P>
      <P>Dear Mr. Boylan,</P>
      <P>My mother is an aged person.  Once a week she travels to the community care centre.  The driver of the minibus who collects her has told me he will no longer be able to come in to collect my mother.  Can you ensure that the road will be repaired.</P>

      <P>I was surprised to hear Deputy Boylan defend the indefensible and suggest that we did not speak when we sat over there.  I was glad to praise the 33 per cent allocation to both Cavan and Monaghan.  In 1992 I was glad to be able to provide a 25 per cent increase to County Cavan.  The Minister of State devoted most of his speech to problems of which we were already aware. However, he made one or two very interesting points.  Having recognised that £107 million was provided last year and that less than £103 million has been provided this year, a decrease of £4 million, he went on to state: &ldquo;This means that the 1995 allocation is up by approximately £11 million&rdquo;.  He would not go into an infants' class in a national school and claim that a reduction of £4 million was an increase of £11 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The problems of the Border areas have been recognised by the European Union, those who distribute money from the International Fund for Ireland and the United States which has provided $20 million to be spent over the next two years and set up the Washington Conference which is specifically aimed at encouraging industry to establish in Border areas.  I was alarmed when I realised that the allocation for my constituency was £800,000 less than the amount provided in 1994. Equally serious is the way the Government has robbed INTERREG instead of providing money from the Exchequer for roads in the Border region.  The European Union provides money through INTERREG to ensure that additional money will be available to correct the infrastructural deficiencies whch exist in the Border counties.  Our allocation, which was reduced from £8.37 million to £7.58 million, has been further reduced to £5 million, while the <Col N="1367" /> money robbed from INTERREG should have been additional.</P>
      <P>Why is the national allocation down by 4 per cent, given that the Government inherited a healthy financial position with a surplus of £15 million?  Why is the Cavan-Monaghan allocation down by one-third when the national allocation is down by only 4 per cent?  Why did we not get the additional money to which we were entitled?  The Minister said that £8 million has been provided in grants under the new European Union INTERREG II programme which will benefit Border counties and certain maritime areas.  I would like a member of the Government to tell me how INTERREG II will benefit Border areas.  Why is the funding not additional?  The Government has replaced £3.5 million from normal sources with £2.5 million from INTERREG which should have been additional.</P>
      <P>This is the first year of the INTERREG II programme and a number of Ministers promised us that substantial funding would be allocated to improve the infrastructure in Border areas.  The need for this funding has been recognised by many Ministers, including the Minister for the Environment and, in particular, the Minister for Finance.  In reply to a parliamentary question from me about the initiatives he intends to take to improve Border areas, the Minister for Finance stated:</P>
      <P>It is my intention to ensure that the moneys will be additional but it would be rash to give a guarantee that the percentage will be 100 per cent.  The vast bulk of the money under the INTERREG programme will be used to rectify the infrastructural deficiencies to make the Border counties an attractive investment location.  The fact that they are no longer close to a zone of violence, the position for the past 25 years, but to a market of 1.5 million people will enhance their attractiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> Even though the Minister for Finance recognised the infrastructural deficiencies in Border areas and stated that the money for these areas should be additional so as to cure those deficiencies, the Minister for the Environment stated that the INTERREG money is to be part of the normal allocation to which we are entitled.  I would like to know why there has been a 33.3 per cent reduction for Cavan-Monaghan when the reduction nationally is 4 per cent.</P>
    <P>Last week in reply to a parliamentary question from me the Minister for the Environment stated that additional benefits were set to accrue to the Border regions on foot of INTERREG II and a further European Union initiative intended to support the peace process.  I would like someone to tell me where these additional benefits.  As Deputies Boylan and Crawford know, in the past, INTERREG money was additional and was used to open the canal between the Shannon and Lough Erne.  I am glad this money was provided as we have no railways&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The Minister of State should remember that in his Budget Statement the Minister for Finance stated that corporation tax was being reduced from 40 per cent to 38 per cent and that the banks were being given an extra £12 million.  This money would have gone a long way to improving the road network. If the £8 million under INTERREG had not been put into the ordinary allocation we would have got the additional money to which we were entitled.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ellis</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious that this is a repeat of what happened from 1983 to 1987 when the then Fine Gael-Labour Coalition Government abandoned the county roads and the legacy has been inherited by every Government since.  I am glad the present coalition realises it caused the problem in regard to our county roads by its lack of funding in those years.  Not long ago a number of Members opposite made wild statements about the condition of our county roads when additional funding was being provided.  This year the Minister <Col N="1372" /> admitted he has cut the amount of funding for county roads.  In County Leitrim the allocation for county roads has been reduced by £330,000.  At the same time we expect rural areas to develop at the same pace as urban areas.</P>
      <P>I am not surprised the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, has left the House. He is the Minister with responsibility for rejuvenating the west.  He has abandoned it already because he does not have money to do anything.  If we do not have a proper infrastructure there will be no development in rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is obvious the Fine Gael members of the Government were unable to exert the power, in terms of allocations, the rural electorate expected of them.  It is obvious the Minister, Deputy Howlin, who handed the Minister of State, Deputy Allen, the poisoned chalice of coming into the House tonight to defend the indefensible, has decided that rural Ireland is to be abandoned and our county roads structure is to be allowed deteriorate.</P>

      <P>It is deplorable that EU money is being used to supplement funding from the national Exchequer. How can we justify seeking additional EU funding for developing Border regions when the money we are receiving is hijacked to substitute for money that should be provided by the Exchequer?  That is unacceptable.  The allocation for EU co-financed schemes in County Leitrim has been reduced by £280,000.  How can anybody make a case to Europe for money in the future if that money is a substitute for what should be provided by the Exchequer? The people in rural Ireland know the good work done in improving county roads in recent years will be undone. Last year County Leitrim received an increase of 45 per cent, this year there will be a decrease of approximately 11 per cent.  No Government should stand over that.</P>

    <P>I am surprised to hear Deputy Boylan trying to defend the indefensible.  Some <Col N="1373" /> 12 months ago I recall him, from this side of the House pillorying the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Michael Smith, for not providing enough money for county roads, despite the fact that he provided more money for that purpose than any of his predecessors.</P>

    <P>The Minister referred to funding for forestry roads, but he forgot to say he did not provide any, despite the fact that the Government wishes to develop the forestry industry.  The good work that was done last year in improving the roads in County Leitrim has been turned on its head by the Minister's inaction.  I concur with the sentiments of Deputy Molloy that local authorities are not in a position to provide additional funding.  They have been starved of finance under a number of headings this year.  The Minister would get a shock if he examined the Leitrim rate base <Col N="1374" /> where out of a total of only 700 rate-payers, the average amount paid is less than £700.</P>

We always endeavoured to properly manage our expenditure. We did not advocate spending in non-productive areas such as programme managers, additional Ministers and staff for them, particularly when we do not know what those Ministers are doing.  That is wastage.  Funding that should be spent on our roads is being used to keep the three party Government together.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>The steep rise in home loan interest costs is just one symptom of a growing crisis in this Government's economic policy.  For many householders, the so-called tax-cutting budget has already been completely wiped out.  For many, the budget only promised marginal improvements, and now disposable income is being squeezed again.  It is not clear what the effect of the latest rises in interest rates on the Exchequer will be, but it may already mean that the Government's predictions are being blown off course.</P>
      <P>This makes it all the more imperative that the Minister for Finance spell out exactly what Ireland's interest rate and exchange rate policies are.  We cannot accept glib assurances that our fundamentals are sound.</P>
      <P>At the end of 1992, the IR£-DM exchange rate was 2.67.  Now it is 2.22. The IR£ has devalued significantly relative to the deutschemark and the yen. Our policy of tracking the DM is losing its grip.  The IR£ is at the bottom of the ERM grid.  Our currency has weakened as against the French franc and the Danish Kroner.  In relative terms, our most stable relativity has been with sterling with which we have no formal policy linkage.</P>
      <P>While it may be argued that the policy of tracking the DM imposed a useful discipline on Irish fiscal policy in the past, we are now lagging so far behind the DM that, in athletics parlance, we only catch sight of the DM's heels on the straights.  We are simply losing touch with the four fast-track currencies of the ERM.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should now face up to the facts of our situation.  We need a credible and <Col N="1377" /> sensible policy on interest rates and exchange rates.</P>
    <P>We need a Government that is committed to fiscal responsibility.  We need tight control on public spending; we cannot afford to throw more money onto the bonfires of badly managed semi-State companies.  We need control on public pay and emphasis instead on increasing real take home pay by reforming tax.  We need less borrowing. The large-scale transfers from the EU should not deflect us from a tight and disciplined approach to public finances.</P>
    <P>Now is the time for the Government to re-establish the credibility of its economic policies.  The markets and the voters want the Government to spell out a new rationale which can be understood. Now is the time for the Government to demonstrate that Ireland has sound money, that Irish policy is committed to controlling public spending, that we are not simply being carried along in the slipstream of the DM.</P>
    <P>We cannot afford a Government that is content to muddle through.  All the danger signs are there for the IR£: lax controls on public spending; no clear exchange rate policy; no readily understood interest rate policy; no clear targets for growth in public spending: no multi-annual budgeting and an all-pervading sense of laxity and drift.  Added to this lethal cocktail is a Government which appears to be suffering from an internal ideological paralysis and the result is potentially disastrous.</P>
    <P>Every home owner, worker, enterprise and employer is crying out for leadership on economic matters, but there is no leadership available in the present Government.  From the people who are bringing us privatisation to fund equality payments, we are now getting complacency and muddle.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the home owner and the taxpayer Irish economic policy, interest rate policy and exchange rate policy are rapidly becoming a nightmare. I call on the Government to re-establish public confidence in the capacity of this Government to manage the economy, control interest rates, have a reasonably well understood <Col N="1378" /> exchange rate policy which commands international and national respect and give to taxpayers what was promised in the budget, that is, a real increase in disposable income.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinCullen" hpid="Mr. Cullen Mr. Cullen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cullen</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy McDowell for giving me a minute of his time.  It is much appreciated.</P>
      <P>When the Minister for Finance outlined his fiscal strategy in the budget he used the best case scenario as a marker of economic growth, job creation, interest rates and inflation.  Now that the wheels have started to come off the wagon, he has no room to manoeuvre. It is clear that in regard to the exchange rate policy we are trying to look in two different directions to take.  The Government likes to talk about tracking the DM but we are lagging far behind as the second lowest currency in the ERM &mdash; only the Spanish peseta, which has recently been devalued, is below us.  Our need to be close to sterling is understandable because of our trade relationship with that country.  However, it is not possible to sustain the policy as enunciated by the Government: there is none.  The Central Bank is making some effort to defend the IR£ but its efforts seem half-hearted in some respects.  The Department of Finance is not giving the required leadership.</P>
      <P>In bringing back a current budget deficit in 1995 the Government has sent the wrong signals.  There is still time, in the forthcoming Finance Bill, for the Minister to take action and not have a current budget deficit this year as one contributing step towards stabilishing the situation for householders and taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimHiggins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins) Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to rebut the allegation made by Deputies McDowell and Cullen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me begin with interest rates.  It is the Central Bank which has the statutory responsibility for monetary and interest rate policy.  It is the body entrusted with the task of operating monetary policy in such a way as to <Col N="1379" /> maintain a low level of inflation.  Maintaining a low level of inflation of course is a vital part of protecting workers' living standards and the value of their take-home pay.</P>
    <P>The Central Bank raised its short-term facility twice recently, by half of one per cent in each case.  Before these two rises, the short-term facility was at the historically low level of 6.25 per cent.  These rate rises had the objectives of maintaining price stability and supporting the relative position of the Irish pound within the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM).</P>
    <P>These decisions by the Central Bank were in line with those taken by other central banks whose currencies are encompassed within the ERM.  It is worth remembering that even after these rates rises, the Central Bank's short term facility is close to historically low levels.  Irish interest rates were not affected when the UK raised its base rate three times, by half of 1 per cent each time, over the period from August 1994 to February 1995.</P>
    <P>As to the effect of these changes in Irish interest rates on mortgage rates, it is not true to state that they will eliminate all the budget improvements in take-home pay.  I am surprised at the Deputies making such a claim because it is demonstrably untrue in a number of respects.</P>
    <P>To begin with, the bulk of workers do not have mortgages.  The Revenue Commissioners estimate that only 320,000 tax paying units, out of a total of 900,000 tax paying units, claim mortgage interest relief.  Thus nearly 600,000 taxpayers are not affected by the rise in mortgage rates.</P>
    <P>Second, so far only a small number of institutions have raised their mortgage interest rates, mostly by only half of 1 per cent, although the Irish Permanent Building Society has raised its rates by 1 per cent.  The reality is that mortgage lending rates are determined by the cost of funds to the institutions and by competition between the institutions themselves. The Central Bank has statutory responsibility for monetary policy, including official interest rates, but has <Col N="1380" /> no statutory power to determine the retail rates, including mortgage rates, charged by individual financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Third, not all mortgages are contracted at variable rates.  Workers who have fixed-rate mortgages will not be affected by recent rate increases.  Since 1992 fixed interest rate mortgages have become much more widely available.  In 1993, fixed rate mortgages accounted for some 65 per cent of all mortgages advanced by building societies that year. While activity in the fixed rate market declined in 1994, because of the higher costs associated with longer-term money, a significant proportion of mortgages is still advanced at fixed rates. This means that a sizeable proportion of borrowers, particularly the new and generally younger homeowners, are afforded a significant measure of protection from increases in the cost of their mortgages.</P>
    <P>It is also important to keep in perspective the impact of a mortgage rate increase.  The average mortgage outstanding is about £20,000 and a 1 per cent rise in the mortgage rate would add about £150 a year to the repayments on such a mortgage.  If Deputies look at the tables in the Principal Features of the Budget they will see that the bulk of income levels show gains from the budget tax and PRSI changes well in excess of those levels.  The budget changes are not the only matters affecting pay this year: the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i>, must also be taken into account.</P>
    <P>Taken together, the pay increases under the second phase of the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and the reductions in taxation and PRSI in the 1995 budget will result in substantial increases in take-home pay for workers this year.  For example, those earning the average manufacturing wage can expect increases in their take-home pay in the range of 4.5 per cent to 5 per cent: about £500.  Given the expected inflation rate of 2.5 per cent, these increases will allow further gains in real take-home pay.  These gains will be bigger for those with children, because of the increase in child benefit <Col N="1381" /> of up to 35 per cent this year.  Even with an increase of 1 per cent in mortgage interest rates, workers with mortgages will enjoy real gains in living standards this year.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of income tax relief on mortgage interest.  In 1993, the ceilings for the level of interest that can be taken into account for mortgage interest tax relief were increased from £2,000 for a single person and £4,000 for a married couple to £2,500 and £5,000 respectively.  In addition, a further measure was introduced to assist first time house purchasers, the priority group for any mortgage relief assistance. The percentage of interest allowable to such persons for the first five years in which they claim mortgage interest is now 100 per cent, subject to the normal ceilings, without any <i>de minimis</i> threshold applying.</P>
    <P>The existing interest ceiling of £5,000 for a married couple, will mean that, even after allowing for a one percentage point increase on the average mortgage interest rate, a married couple will still have the full interest on an outstanding mortgage of in excess of £60,000 taken into account for tax relief purposes.  This position, coupled with the specially favourable tax relief arrangements for first time buyers I have outlined above, means that for the vast bulk of mortgage holders the impact of the mortgage rate increase will be cushioned by the income tax system.</P>
    <P>In short, the Deputies are wrong in their claim about the impact of mortgage rate increases.  They do not affect the large numbers of workers who are not mortgage holders; a significant proportion of new mortgages are at fixed rates, and moreover, mortgage interest tax relief will absorb some of the impact of a mortgage interest rate rise: this is especially true of first time buyers in the first five years of their mortgages.  The budget tax and PRSI changes, and the child benefit improvement, where relevant, significantly exceed the impact of even a 1 per cent rise in mortgage rates at most income levels.  Adding the increases in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> will improve the position of workers still further.  In the <Col N="1382" /> light of all this, I am sure Deputies will agree that their motion is not justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Upton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State, Deputy O'Shea, for coming to respond.</P>
      <P>I am raising this matter in response to representations I received from a 17 year old on a waiting list in a London hospital for a heart and lung transplant. She is an exceptionally talented and gifted student academically.  She is also gifted in the arts and drama but is currently unable to attend school, take part in sports, socialise with her friends or do anything which requires physical effort as she needs a constant supply of oxygen. Last year she spent seven months in hospital, two of them in intensive care.</P>
      <P>She set out all the difficulties she has experienced in a letter she wrote to me shortly after Christmas.  She informed me that the average waiting time for a heart and lung transplant is 14 months. In deperation she asked me to raise this matter to see what can be done to secure more organs so that people who find themselves in this terrible predicament can be treated.</P>
      <P>She asked me to raise two points in particular, first that all members of the public should be considered as donors unless they state specifically that they wish to opt out.  I understand that the level of organ donation in this country is exceptionally high by international standards and that the number of organs available is adequate to meet our needs. The difficulty relates to the provision of finance to carry out heart and lung transplants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second point that she asked me to raise relates to a study in which she was involved which found that members of the public who have a knowledge of diseases which are effectively incurable and can only be treated successfully by way of organ transplantation have a greater tendency to carry donor cards. It seems to follow, therefore, that there are extra benefits to be gained in making the public more aware of the necessity for organs to be donated.  I ask the <Col N="1383" /> Minister of State to consider this point in the context of information campaigns. Although I accept that the campaigns conducted here are good and that those who conduct them are to be commended there is always room for improvement.  I hope something can be done to help this individual and others like her who find themselves in difficult circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Mr. O'Shea)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank my colleague for raising this important matter in response to correspondence he received from a young person in need. His correspondent asked him to raise two points in particular, the first of which is that all members of the public should be regarded as organ donors unless they state specifically that they wish to opt out.  While I see difficulties this suggestion will be fully considered. The second point relates to the study in which the young lady was involved which shows that members of the public who have a knowledge of disease are more likely to carry donor cards.</P>
      <P>Transplantation in Ireland has a particularly high public profile.  Credit for the favourable public perception regarding transplantation is particularly due to the success of national donor card campaigns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These campaigns have been promoted by the Irish Kidney Association, a voluntary support organisation for patients with renal disease and their families and funding for the national donor campaigns is met from the health allocation of the national lottery.  Since it was founded in 1978 the Irish Kidney Association has grown to be one of the most successful patient support organisations with a high national profile and with 25 branches in existence throughout the country.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the association for the invaluable help it has given to newly diagnosed renal disease patients as well as continuing help to those already being treated.  I am very conscious of the need to further develop services for kidney patients and I am glad to make an additional £600,000 available this year <Col N="1384" /> for improving kidney dialysis units and services for transplant patients.</P>
    <P>Initially only cards relating to kidney donation were produced; however, in recent years, the Irish Kidney Association has developed multi-organ donor cards.  The use of multi-organ donor cards, as well as the inclusion of a similar provision on driving licences, has motivated the public to multi-organ donation and Ireland is practically unique among European countries in that it is essentially self-sufficient in availability of organs.  The total number of organ transplants carried out in 1994 was as follows:</P>

    <P>I understand the transplant community in this country would be reluctant to change the present voluntary and altruistic character of organ donation as this contributes to existing high rates of organ donation.  There have been occasional calls for computerised databases to be maintained of people wishing to make organ donations.  However, the cost of maintenance of such systems and their likely marginal net effect would suggest that the present system is adequate for current requirements.</P>
    <P>I should also mention that the present code of practice concerning organ transplantation is based on the principle of informed consent of donors and/or their next of kin.  It is, therefore, considered highly desirable that the relatives of deceased persons whose organs would be suitable for transplantation should be fully involved in the donation process.</P>

      <Col N="1385" /> We are all well aware of the trauma, depression and sense of loss experienced by women who miscarry.  My understanding is that the trauma is exacerbated when the woman is placed in a bed beside a woman who has experienced the great joy of giving birth to a healthy child.  In that situation the joy being felt by the exultant mother is tempered while the sense of loss experienced by the woman who has miscarried or who has experienced a stillbirth is heightened.  To my knowledge these procedures are not in use in any other health board area.  It is vitally important that we address this problem as soon as possible.  At a public health board meeting recently, the programme manager stated that he cannot do this under the existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that the Southern Health Board has submitted a proposal to the Department of Health for the provision of an integrated obstetrics unit.  That proposal awaits clarification from the Department of Health on the next stage of planning for this unit at the Cork University Hospital.  This has been approved by the board for some considerable time.</P>
    <P>The absolute necessity for this unit is becoming apparent.  There are glaring gaps in obstetric services in the Cork area and it is well known that there is widespread dissatisfaction among the consultants working there.  Inadequate staffing levels, particularly at registrar level, and the fragmentation of the service is placing both mothers and their babies at risk.  There have been repeated warnings from consultants about the danger of having one paediatric registrar providing cross cover during on-call periods to four units scattered across the city.</P>
    <P>The risks involved are disturbing in the extreme.  For instance, if a mother presents with a prolapsed ubilical cord, it is unlikely that there will be an experienced anaesthetist or obstetrical registrar on site to perform the essential emergency caesarean section that would protect the baby's life and prevent brain damage.  When a baby needs expert <Col N="1386" /> resuscitation following birth, a few minutes without such support can mean the difference between life and death or the difference between being developmentally normal or severely brain damaged.</P>
    <P>Approximately one-third of all mothers who present at these units require the presence of an anaesthetist. This service is accepted as an important factor in the continuing decrease in both maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity.  New arrangements must be put in place immediately to rectify what is an intolerable situation for mothers who miscarry and to establish an obstetrics unit in Cork University Hospital.</P>
    <P>Medical insurance costs for consultants have quadrupled and a medical insurance company has advised one consultant to pass his file on the inadequacies of the service to the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board; the file is on the Minister's desk. By taking such action the health board is saying that it is not accepting responsibility for an inadequate service or for claims resulting from that service.</P>
    <P>Faculty examiners no longer accept these theatres as suitable for the training of obstetricians.  How can women feel confident about having babies in hospitals that have been deemed to be unsafe by the very people who are delivering the service?  The Minister has a heavy responsibility and must act immediately to provide a service that is acceptable to everybody.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Noonan, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.  Both the Minister and I fully support the view that separate accommodation should be provided in maternity hospitals for women who have had miscarriages.  The Department has raised this issue with maternity hospitals and I understand that whenever women have miscarriages or stillbirths, every effort is made to ensure that separate accommodation is provided for them for the duration of their stay in hospital.  The options available to hospitals include the designation <Col N="1387" /> of a specific ward for this purpose or the placing of patients in gynaecology or ante-natal wards.  These wards are, of course, separate from post-natal wards and this helps avoid unnecessary stress and trauma to women.  Single hospital room accommodation may also be provided, where possible.  The Minister has also asked me to mention that counselling is generally made available to assist patients who have undergone the distressing experience of miscarriage.</P>
      <P>With regard to the accommodation provided in the maternity units in Cork for women who miscarry, the Minister has been informed by the authorities at the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital that women who miscarry are not accommodated in the same room as women who are about to have their babies or who have already given birth. The Minister has also had inquiries made of the Southern Health Board and understands from the board that at Erinville Hospital, a four-bed ward is allocated for miscarriage patients.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianOShea" hpid="Mr. O'Shea Mr. O'Shea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Shea</NameTxt>
      <P>This ward is solely for their use except during periods of increased demand for beds.  The board has explained that this four bed ward is part of the ante-natal-post-natal corridor and that as all facilities are shared, contact with mothers and babies is unavoidable for miscarriage patients and their families.  The board has indicated that there is a follow-up pregnancy loss clinic at Erinville Hospital which women who have miscarried are encouraged to attend to discuss their concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to St. Finbarr's Hospital, the board has explained that because of practical difficulties associated with the layout of the hospital, miscarriage <Col N="1388" /> patients must be accommodated at ground floor level along with other maternity patients.  The board has stated that while every effort is made to meet the concerns of these women, it is generally not always possible to segregate women who have had miscarriages from expectant mothers.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to say a few words regarding the development of maternity services in the Southern Health Board area generally.  The Deputy will be aware that the Department has received a number of submissions in this regard from various agencies in the Cork area &mdash; he alluded to that in his contribution.  Officials from the Department met management and medical representatives from the Southern Health Board last week to discuss proposals they have made on their maternity services and facilities.  The Southern Health Board has indicated that this matter is now a top priority for it.  Additional information has been sought from the board on a number of aspects of its proposal and the Minister is looking forward to receiving this as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to assure the Deputy that any future developments in this regard will take full account of the need to ensure the optimum level of service for women in the Cork area.  The question of appropriate accommodation for women who miscarry will be considered in the context of any such developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment and I thank the Minister of State.  Deputy Barrett, for attending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Army School of Music was established in 1923.  Its objectives were the production of first-class military bands; the training of bandsmen for these bands; the training of Irish bandsmasters and the development of Irish music. It was hoped at the time that the scheme would contribute to music literacy and <Col N="1389" /> promote a revival of interest in music throughout the country.  The formation of the bands had begun, and since 1936 each of the four commands has had its own band.  The bands have been a great source of pride for many years.  How often have we all seen and heard the Army Band perform at a State or military occasion, a concert, a visit to a school or an appearance at a local festival or field day?  The bands provided a wonderful service to communities throughout Ireland.  We must not underestimate the enormous contribution the Army School of Music has made to the development of music.  It is vital that development continues because it is as important today as it was 70 years ago.</P>
    <P>An efficiency audit group was established in 1988 to examine the workings and practices of each Government Department with a view to recommending improved or alternative methods which would reduce costs and improve efficiency.  We had a debate in this House last week on the EAG report and there was widespread agreement that change is necessary within the Defence Forces &mdash; anybody who is in contact with members of the Defence Forces knows that they agree change is necessary.  It was insinuated some time ago that members of the Defence Forces were reluctant to change, but nothing could be further from the truth. It is obvious that when the efficiency audit group studied the Defence Forces, in many cases it simply scratched the surface; it took the easy option.</P>
    <P>The strength of the Army School of Music is 193 and Price Waterhouse recommends that the number be reduced to 45, the School of Music be retained and that there be only one band.  The efficiency audit group had no idea of the difficulties implementation of these proposals would create.  It knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing.</P>
    <P>Let us look back to the time the present members of our Army bands started their careers.  The majority of <Col N="1390" /> these people signed up when they were 14, 15 or 16 years of age and the only training they received was musical. Therefore, there is no point talking about redeployment.  These people have been involved in music all their lives. They are professional musicians and have no other qualifications.  When these men and women joined the Army School of Music major contractual restrictions were placed on them. Courses and opportunities available to other soldiers were not available to band members.  These people now feel cheated.  They accepted the major contractual restrictions at the time because they were in for the long haul.</P>
    <P>Leaks about this matter appear week after week and this has had a negative effect on the morale of the members of the Army School of Music.  They feel uncertain about their future and their families feel let down.  They now realise the Minister is seriously considering the abolition of the Army School of Music. This is poor reward for people who have given so much pleasure to so many people.  The Minister refused to accept the proposals put forward in regard to the Equitation School and I compliment him on that.  He is obviously in touch with the Equitation School and is aware of the opportunities there.</P>
    <P>The Minister should recognise the great service the Army School of Music has provided by refusing to accept the proposal.  He should consult with these people before making a decision about their future.  It is the least they deserve. While I recognise the necessity for change within the Defence Forces, members of that Army School of Music provide a very important service, very much appreciated by Irish people, and they should be allowed continue in their chosen careers.</P>
    <P>If the proposal put forward is implemented members of the Army bands will have great difficulty in getting employment elsewhere.  Since they are trained specifically for music, there are few opportunities for them outside the Army.  The Minister must change his tune on this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Power for the opportunity to clarify the position regarding the future of the Army School of Music in the context of the Efficiency Audit Group review of the Defence Forces. Last week, in the course of a debate in Private Members' time, it was made clear that no decisions of any kind have been taken regarding the reform of any unit of the Defence Forces, including the Army School of Music.  There has been no change in that position.</P>
      <P>Since the leaking of the report prepared by Price Waterhouse for the Efficiency Audit Group, there has been an endless succession of rumours regarding various aspects of the Defence Forces.  Having exhausted imaginary barrack closures as a source of mischief, this week, the rumour machine is, apparently, taking an interest in military music.  Almost all of these rumours are inaccurate.  Many of them are complete nonsense.  Some of the speculation causes needless annoyance to members of the Defence Forces. Is this really the best way of promoting a balanced and informed debate on the future of the Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat that the Government's overall objective for the Defence Forces is to develop a modern, efficient, organisation, staffed and equipped to fulfil the roles assigned to them by Government. This objective is in the national interest; it is in the interest of the Defence Forces themselves and is an objective which is supported on all sides of the House. The Government is mindful that there are important human, social and economic dimensions to the process of reform.  It has been made clear, both by the Minister for Defence and by me, that in moving towards this objective there will be an extensive process of consultation.  This process is already well under way.  It goes without saying <Col N="1392" /> that there will be no compulsory redundancies. This guarantee applies to military bandsmen on the same basis as it applies to all personnel of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Given that no decisions have been taken, there is little point in engaging in speculation about the possible implications of change for each individual unit of the Defence Forces.  However, I can assure the House that the lurid tales of cutbacks and closures which have circulated in recent times are completely wide of the mark.  The rumours and speculation about the Army School of Music are as ill-informed as all the rest.</P>
    <P>For many years, the Army School of Music, and the generations of military musicians who have received their training there, has made an invaluable contribution to the life of the Defence Forces. Army bands play an important role on many State ceremonial occasions. They are also in constant demand to give public performances at major events throughout the country.  This coming Friday is St. Patrick's Day.  The Army bands have been booked for months in advance and will be centre stage for the celebration of our national day.  For many years, Army musicians have maintained an admirable standard of excellence.  The presence of Army bands has contributed a unique lustre to important national events.  They play an important role in maintaining the <i>esprit de corps</i> of the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>When the Government is planning for the future of the Defence Forces, its focus will be on building on the many positive attributes of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.  I can assure the House that in reaching decisions about the future organisation of the Defence Forces, the Government will take full account of the illustrious tradition of military music associated with the Army School of Music.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.15 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 15 March 1995.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 16 and 19 together.</P>
      <P>There are major differences in interpretation between member states of the European Union over the meaning of Article 8A of the Single European Act &mdash; or, as it has now become, Article 7A of the Treaty on European Union.  This difference of opinion is founded on the general declarations made at the time of signature.  These are as follows:</P>
      <P>Nothing in these provisions shall affect the right of the member states to take such measures as they consider necessary for the purpose of controlling immigration from third countries, and to combat terrorism, crime, the traffic in drugs and illicit trading in works of art and antiques.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1172" /> In order to promote the free movement of persons the member states shall co-operate, without prejudice to the powers of the Community, in particular as regards the entry, movement and residence of nationals of third countries.  They shall also co-operate in the combating of terrorism, crime, the traffic in drugs and illicit trading in works of art and antiques.</P>
    <P>Most member states interpret Article 7A as requiring the abolition of internal border controls at the union's internal frontiers for all persons legally resident in the Union.  Ireland shares this view. Britain, however, interprets Article 7A as implying free movement for Union nationals only and not for non-EU citizens. Accordingly, Britain favours the retention of systematic passport checks. The precise interpretation of Article 7A is likely to be decided by the European Court of Justice &mdash; to which a case against the European Commission has been taken by the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>Ireland fully supports the object of free movement of persons within the European Union.  The member states agreed that the achievement of that objective will require a number of compensatory measures aimed, in particular, at combating serious crime, drug-trafficking and illegal immigration.  The measures required have been set out in a report to the European Council which was prepared by the co-ordinators group on the free movement of persons in 1989.  This report &mdash; which is known as the PALMA document &mdash; lists a whole series of measures to be implemented, including action at external frontiers, internal frontiers, measures to combat drug trafficking and terrorism, co-operation in the areas of visa policy and asylum together with other forms of legal co-operation in criminal law matters.  Included in this list of measures is a requirement to conclude a convention on the crossing of the external frontiers of member states. The failure to conclude this convention has been one of the main reasons for the <Col N="1173" /> delay in achieving the objective of free movement.  The text of this convention was agreed in June 1991 but it has not been signed because of a dispute between Britain and Spain concerning the status of Gibraltar.</P>
    <P>In 1985 France, Germany and the Benelux countries entered into an agreement &mdash; the Schengen Agreement &mdash; on the gradual abolition of checks on persons and goods at their common borders. In June 1990 the same countries entered into a further Schengen Convention to implement the intentions expressed in the earlier agreement.  The convention applying the Schengen Agreement contains extensive compensatory provisions in the areas of immigration controls at the external borders of the States party to the convention and increased police and judicial co-operation.  Since June 1990 Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece have become party to the convention.  Austria has observer status and Denmark has applied for such status.  The Schengen Implementation Convention is scheduled to become operational between the Schengen member states, with the exception of Italy and Greece, on 26 March 1995.</P>
    <P>Ireland is not party to the Schengen Implementation Convention and has no plans at present to become a party.  The question of Ireland seeking to join the Schengen arrangements has been revised from time to time; the conclusion so far, being that it is not in Ireland's overall interest to do so.  It would not be in the interest of Ireland to have a situation where the common travel area with Britain would be ended and Ireland would impose both exit and entry controls on persons travelling between here and Britain and, in addition, on the land frontier.</P>

This would be in place of the existing common law power of arrest without warrant which applies only to felonies and not to misdemeanours, no matter how serious they might be.  I believe that a statutory power of arrest without warrant for serious offences would be a positive and worthwhile development in the criminal law.</P>
      <P>I know that there exists a long-standing draft of a Bill to put in place the concept of the arrestable offence and I am now examining this, in consultation with the Attorney General, with a view to bringing proposals to Government for legislative change as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>The existing regulations have been in force since 1990 and they replaced an original prescribed uniform fee of £100.

      <P>In approaching a serious issue such as crime, we must be very careful to set out, correctly and precisely, the extent of the problem.  We can never hope to reduce crime if we do not start out from the correct base.  I fully understand that people are very concerned about the extent of crime but I have to say to the Deputy that the figures do not back his <Col N="1177" /> contention that there is a &ldquo;serious crime wave&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The provisional figures for 1994 show a 2 per cent increase in indictable crime for the Dublin Metropolitan Area as a whole; crime is down 3 per cent in the Garda's Dublin South Division, down 1 per cent in the Dublin North Division and only very marginally up in the Dublin South Central Division.</P>

The report of the Lord Mayor's Commission on Crime points out that crime figures for Dublin are below those of urban areas in England and Wales which, in turn, are below the Western European average.  That same report shows that the level of crime in Dublin has not increased greatly since 1983.  As I pointed out in an earlier answer, Dublin is a relatively safe city to visit, live and work in and it is very important that we retain a sense of balance and not fall into alarmist statements when discussing this often very emotive topic.</P>
      <P>This is not to imply that I am, in any way, complacent about the crime problem. On the contrary, I have no illusions about the scale and extent of the problem and the deep underlying causes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to strengthen the law on crime.  We are providing 210 extra prison spaces to reduce the level of early releases and a total of £413 million is being provided for the Garda Síochána this year &mdash; the highest amount ever &mdash; to allow the force to effectively tackle crime.  This will enable the gardaí to take the following measures: the recruitment of 1,050 gardaí during the next three years; recruitment of an additional 200 civilian clerical/administrative staff to release an equivalent number of gardaí for operational duties; recruitment of civilians for certain specialist/managerial posts in the force; replacement of the Garda Fleet on a five year basis; implementation of an information technology plan for the Garda Síochána; upgrading of the <Col N="1178" /> Garda communications network; installation of closed circuit television cameras to combat crime in certain areas; further development of community based measures in areas of disadvantage, and measures to combat serious fraud, including the implementation of certain non-legal proposals of the Government's advisory committee on fraud.</P>
    <P>This will ensure that the strength of the force is maintained at about 11,000 and it will also ensure that the Garda authorities have sufficient funding to purchase whatever equipment they require to tackle crime.  In addition, I am most anxious, as is everybody else in the House to see gardaí reassigned from Border duty at the earliest opportunity. Assuming that the security situation remains as positive as it is at this time &mdash; I would expect worthwhile redeployment of Garda manpower and resources to take place during 1995.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that over 400 gardaí were recruited last year and a further 1,050 gardaí will be recruited between now and the end of 1997 at the rate of 350 per year.  I know that the Commissioner's policy is to deploy new gardaí to urban areas like Dublin where crime is most prevalent.  For instance nearly three quarters of the most recent Garda graduates have been assigned to Dublin stations.  The ratio of police to population in the Dublin Metropolitan Area has been and will be maintained at 1 to 260 which compares favourably with the national average of 1 to 320.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are approximately 700 clerical civilian staff employed in the Garda Síochána at present. Additional funding is being provided between now and 1997 to employ a further 200 civilian staff in the Garda Síochána.  All of these civilians will replace gardaí on a one for one basis, releasing them from administrative duties to perform the outdoor police work for which they were specially selected and trained.  This will lead to a substantial increase in the operational strength of the Force.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1179" /> A major information technology plan for the Force is now being finalised for implementation at a cost in excess of £26 million over the period 1994-1998. Implementation of the plan will also serve to release a significant number of gardaí for operational duties.  The implementation of this IT plan will improve the efficiency of data processing in order to reduce Garda time spent on paper work and increase crime detection rates by improving access to information and provide an improved management information system.</P>
    <P>A number of steps is also being taken to minimise the amount of Garda time spent in court.  There are three Garda Inspectors attached to the Bridewell who have responsibility for co-ordinating Garda appearances in the Four Courts.</P>
    <P>Additional funding is being provided this year towards the implementation of special measures to prevent and detect crime.  One such measure is the installation of closed circuit TV cameras in areas of Dublin City centre as an aid to policing.  The installation of a system in the Temple Bar area is the first such project to be undertaken on a priority basis.  It is being funded jointly by the Department of Justice and Temple Bar Properties Limited in a spirit of partnership and co-operation.</P>
    <P>The gardaí tell me that the international experience has been that the installation of these systems as an aid to policing reduces the level of crime in the area by at least 33 per cent and in some instances more.  The international experience also shows that this leads to a genuine reduction in the level of crime &mdash; not just a displacement to another area.</P>
    <P>I see projects such as this one as part of the answer to restoring safety to our city streets and to restoring public trust in the forces of law and order.  Funding has been provided for the coming years to extend this scheme to other locations, such as O'Connell Street.  Grafton Street, Henry Street in Dublin City and to other city centre areas and outlying <Col N="1180" /> areas as well.  Fixed CCTV cameras will also be installed in chosen locations to detect and produce conclusive evidence for subsequent court proceedings of traffic offences, such as speeding.</P>

The criminal law is there to protect all members of society, including school children.  I can assure the Deputy that all complaints with regard to breaches of the criminal law will be vigorously investigated by the Garda and appropriate action taken.</P>

The refurbishment of Clonmel courthouse is ongoing and will be completed in 1996 and work on a new courthouse in Carrick-on-Shannon is scheduled to commence later this year.  There are also major ongoing refurbishment works being carried out by the Office of Public Works in the Four Courts complex.

      <P>Whether on the domestic level or the European level, the computer is an indispendable tool for the exchange and analysis of information and intelligence in relation to crime.</P>
      <P>It will be helpful by way of background if I outline the present position in relation to the establishment of the European Police Office, Europol.  Member states of the European Union are in the process of drawing up a convention on the establishment of Europol.  In accordance with the conclusions of the European Council of 9 and 10 December 1994, the aim is to have the text of the convention finalised by June next.  When the text is finalised, member states will proceed to ratify the convention in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.  The convention will, <i>inter alia</i>, set out how the computerised information system is to be structured and include detailed provisions to ensure that the rights of the individual in relation to personal data are fully protected.  I do not anticipate any difficulties, on the basis of the actual proposals under discussion, about our agreeing the terms of this convention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In advance of the drawing up of the Europol convention and the establishment of Europol itself, a unit called the Europol Drugs Unit, EDU, was established in The Hague in January 1994 in <Col N="1184" /> view of the urgent need to deal with the problems posed by international illicit drug trafficking and associated money laundering.  The EDU was established on the basis of a Ministerial Agreement of June 1993.  The European Council decided at its meeting on 9 and 10 December 1994 to extend the mandate of the EDU to the fight against illegal trade in radioactive and nuclear materials, crimes involving illegal immigration networks, vehicle trafficking and associated money-laundering operations. This decision was implemented at a Council meeting of Ministers of Justice and Home Affairs last week, which I attended, by the adoption of an instrument entitled &ldquo;Council decision on Joint Action concerning the Europol Drugs Unit&rdquo;.  This instrument replaces the previous Ministerial Agreement. Each member state has at least one liaison officer stationed in the EDU and this arrangement will continue when Europol itself is set up.  No personal information is stored centrally by the EDU.</P>

      <P>I am not quite clear what the Deputy has in mind when he refers to the processing of criminal prosecutions.  However, I take it that what he means is that there should be separate legal representation for victims in criminal trials.</P>
      <P>It is perfectly permissible for a person who has been the victim of a crime to bring a lawyer with him or her to a court during the hearing of a criminal trial.  In particular, I might mention that the scheme of civil legal aid and advice contains provisions whereby legal advice, and legal aid in certain circumstances, may be granted to persons who have been the victims of crime and who fulfil the eligibility and other criteria of the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that proposals have been made by various parties which would allow a victim to be separately represented by a barrister or solicitor who would be entitled to intervene in trial proceedings.  This is an issue which is frequently raised in the context of sexual offences and it was considered by the Law Reform Commission in its Report on Rape.  LRC 24&mdash;1988.  In that report, the commission indicated that constitutional difficulties could arise in that regard and it went on to state &ldquo;... there must also be serious uncertainty as to the effect it would have on the trial of such cases.  In some cases, far from <Col N="1186" /> assisting in the conviction of guilty rapists, it might so complicate the hearing and alienate the jury as to result in unjustified acquittals&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the light of the problems highlighted by the Law Reform Commission, and other difficulties that would have to be resolved, I have no proposals at present to provide for separate legal representation for victims in criminal trials.  I will, of course, keep the matter under review.</P>

      <P>The report of the Lord Mayor's Commission on Crime is a very valuable contribution to the serious debate about crime.  It provides a considered, balanced and detailed overview of the crime problem and addresses the issue in a broad context. The conclusions reached are similar in many respects to those reached by the inter-departmental group on urban crime and disorder which reported in 1992.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Lord Mayor's Commission report which, contrary to alarmist claims, found that crime levels have not increased greatly in the capital since 1983 stresses the need to tackle the fundamental causes of crime.  This is something I fully endorse as it is my view that it is only by dealing with the causes of crime that we can ever hope for a meaningful and sustained reduction in the level of crime.  Time and time again, it has been noted that criminals seem to come from depressingly similar backgrounds. The causal relationship between crime and the range of factors identified in the report cannot be disputed. Unemployment, educational failure and substance abuse are core issues which cannot be overlooked in any serious approach to crime.  This, of course, is not to offer these factors as an <Col N="1187" /> excuse for crime.  Rather, it is to seek to explain the underlying and deep-rooted nature of the problem.</P>
    <P>As regards deficient urban planning. I was especially interested to note the emphasis placed in the report on practical measures that could be taken by the local authorities to deal with the conditions that generate crime.  Overall, the report has made an important and valuable contribution to our understanding of crime.  I can assure the Deputy that, in framing my Department's response to the crime situation, the findings of the Lord Mayor's Commission on Crime will be among the material to be seriously considered.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 33 and 46 together.</P>
      <P>I am proceeding with plans to provide two new prisons &mdash; one located on the site of St. Patrick's Hospital, Castlerea, County Roscommon, to accommodate 150 adult male offenders and the other on the Cowley Place site, adjoining Mountjoy Prison, to accommodate 60 female offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of Castlerea Prison, construction of the perimeter wall and associated works is underway and is due for completion by the mildle of the year. Construction of the main prison complex is due to commence later this year and is expected to be completed in a period of about 18 months.  Planning of the new women's prison is at an <Col N="1188" /> advanced stage.  It is proposed to commence construction later this year with completion likely early in 1997.</P>
    <P>In addition to the provision of two new prisons, I am proceeding with a major programme for the refurbishment and upgrading of the existing stock of prison buildings.  It is estimated that about £55 million will be expended on improvement works in these prisons over the period 1995 to 1999 inclusive &mdash; £10 million has been provided for this work in the current year.  In my view, this refurbishment programme deserves the same priority as the provision of new prison spaces.</P>
    <P>In regard to accommodation for young offenders my responsibility extends to those between the ages of 16 and 21 years.  Responsibility for the offenders under 16 years of age rests with my colleague the Minister for Education. The appointment of Deputy Austin Currie as Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Health and Education is a recognition by the Government of the need to co-ordinate services for young offenders between these three Departments.</P>
    <P>The priority for those between 16 and 21 is to make better use of the prison accommodation already available for them and to implement the positive sentence management strategy set out in the Department's policy document &ldquo;The Management of Offenders &mdash; A Five Year Plan&rdquo; published last June.  I am satisfied that a determined implementation of these measures such as intensive probation supervision in the community and other interventions of this type by the Probation Service will be more effective than providing more prison spaces for young offenders. Experience right across Europe tends to support this view.</P>

In view of the sensitive and complex issues that arise in the context of the investigation of child sexual abuse I am not satisfied that the answer to these difficulties necessarily lies in legislative change.  Furthermore, I should mention that any change in the law in this area could give rise to constitutional issues which would require very careful examination.</P>

      <P>The fight against drug trafficking and other forms of serious crime has been broadened with the introduction of severe penalties for a new offence of money laundering under the Criminal Justice Act, 1994.  These provisions are intended to target the proceeds of serious crime, particularly the illegal proceeds of &ldquo;drug barons&rdquo;.</P>

      <Col N="1190" /> I am aware of the need to ensure that the arrangements for investigations in relation to drug trafficking proceeds should be as effective as possible.  In this connection my Department has prepared a report designed to identify the best arrangements for achieving a cohesive and co-ordinated response to the drug trafficking problem by the existing law enforcement agencies.  This report recommends certain action to be taken against drug dealers to ensure that they are deprived of the proceeds of their criminal activity.  It is my intention that this report will be submitted to the Government as soon as possible.</P>

      <Quest>the policy the Government has with regard to prison rioters; the investigations which have been instituted to establish the origins of such incidents; the analysis, if any, of recent events in Portlaoise prison which has been carried out; the independent examination, if any, which has taken place; and the consequences for the prisoners who are involved in such riots.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen) Nora Owen">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy's question is prompted by the recent relatively minor disturbances which occurred in a small section of Portlaoise Prison on Friday, 24 February, 1995.  Incidents of this kind, thankfully, are rare.  More serious disturbances or actual riots are extremely rare.  The incident on 24 February certainly could not be classed as a <Col N="1194" /> riot in the normal sense in which that term is used.</P>
      <P>Policy in relation to disturbances and riots in the prisons is no different now than it has been under previous Governments. The first priority is to avoid as far as possible, creating circumstances likely to lead to difficulties of this kind. This is achieved by ensuring that genuine grievances and frustrations on the part of prisoners are dealt with and not allowed to fester.  It is also achieved through the professionalism of both prison management and staff who constantly use their abilities and experience to anticipate and head off trouble.  If a disturbance does break out, prompt intervention by management and staff to contain the disturbance, quell it and prevent it from spreading is a key strategic requirement.  Each prison has in place a strategy for managing disturbances which is reviewed from time to time to ensure that the correct response is applied in any given situation.  Finally, special staff training, which has been on-going for some time to assist staff in managing disturbances and riots in a professional manner, is continuing.</P>
      <P>Anybody who has served as Minister for Justice in this country or indeed in a similar position in any other country will of course acknowledge that, despite the best practices in the management of offenders and prevention strategies, disturbances and riots can occur from time to time.  I am, however, as satisfied as any Minister for Justice can be that all reasonable arrangements are in place to deal with such an eventuality.</P>
      <P>The disturbance in Portlaoise Prison on 24 February 1995 involved a total of five prisoners.  It was quelled promptly by staff in the vicinity and was prevented from spreading &mdash; containment is a critical requirement when a disturbance occurs and this was achieved with speed and efficiency on this occasion.  The management of the disturbance and of its immediate aftermath by senior staff in the prison was exemplary and I should like to place that on record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1195" /> It is a fact that a number of officers received injuries and one required overnight hospitalisation.  I sympathise with the officers concerned on their injuries and I know that Deputies generally will wish to join me in this.</P>
    <P>I also know, however, that in the best traditions of the Prison Service they will accept that this is one of the risks of the job and that they will continue to carry out their duties to the highest professional standards.</P>
    <P>The incident, as in the case of all such incidents, has been the subject of a thorough internal analysis and the lessons to be learned from it will be taken on board in reviewing local strategies.  The Garda Síochána are also carrying out an independent inquiry to determine if any criminal prosecutions may be appropriate. I am satisfied that there is no need for any further investigations in this instance.</P>
    <P>The prisoners who instigated and took part in the disturbance have been dealt with by the Prison Governor in accordance with the Prison Rules.  As a sanction for their misconduct they have forfeited privileges for two months. Three of the prisoners were transferred in accordance with normal practice to another prison at least for the duration of their forfeitures.</P>

Current instructions impose strict controls on the use of rubber bullets based on an understanding of the risks their use can entail.  These controls, which are kept under review, are consistent with <Col N="1196" /> the principle of minimum force in any given situation and have ensured maximum restraint in recourse to them. As a result, rubber bullets have not been used in this jurisdiction since the early 1970's when usage was confined to three occasions during which a total of four rounds were discharged without causing injury.</P>

In this regard, I am informed by the Garda that they are very alert to the dangers of this drug, which first appeared in Ireland in 1991, and that they are taking all appropriate measures to counter its use. These measures include the monitoring and surveillance of events which attract a teenage following and where substances of this kind may be available.</P>
      <P>I understand that these measures are proving effective and that they have resulted in a number of significant seizures being made.  In 1994, for instance, 12,000 tablets of the drug were seized by the Garda.  This compares with 2,014 tablets seized in 1993.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The VAT treatment of hospices is governed by EU VAT law with which Irish law must comply.  This provides that bodies like hospitals and hospices are exempt for VAT purposes.  Exempt status means that, while hospices do not charge VAT on the services that they provide, as a necessary corollary, they are unable to recover the VAT charged on the goods and services that they buy in the course of their activities.  As a general rule, VAT is only recoverable by VAT-registered persons.</P>
      <P>However, certain items of hospice equipment are already eligible for VAT relief under a special refund scheme which has been in existence for some years.  In order to qualify for relief the equipment must be brought by voluntary subscription, must cost at least £20,000 exclusive of VAT and must be certified by the Minister for Health as being in the interest of the health services. The scheme was introduced as a measure of recognition of the work being done by voluntary groups who purchase sophisticated and expensive items of medical equipment which could not be accommodated within the normal Exchequer funding for the health services.  I regret to have to advise the Deputies that I am not disposed to undertake any further expansion of this special scheme, in particular having regard to the provisions of EU VAT law which clearly specifies the tax status of these bodies and because of the wider implications, including cost, which a VAT concession would involve.</P>
      <P>Finally, on a more positive note, I should add that it is open to hospices to seek funding from their local health boards in respect of day-to-day running costs.  Furthermore, I understand that funding from the National Lottery may be granted in certain circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>In general the tax regime applying to funded occupational pension schemes in Ireland provides for (i) tax deductibility of pension contributions at both employer and employee level, (ii) no charge to tax on the investment income or capital gains of pensions funds, and (ii) a charge to tax on pension benefits paid.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that these tax arrangements have strongly influenced the development of occupational pension schemes over the years.</P>
      <P>The objectives of these tax arrangements are threefold: first, they promote arrangements for the provision of income to employees in their retirement and protect their dependents in the event of their death, second, by encouraging the development of funded occupational pension schemes, they reduce the pressure on the Exchequer to provide retirement incomes, and thirdly, they encourage savings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards consultations with the pension funds, the most recent series of consultations took place in the context of the initiative launched by my predecessor in the 1993 budget and now coming to fruition, to encourage pension funds to invest a small part of the resources under their control in venture <Col N="1205" /> and development capital.  I have been informed that the previous Minister met with the pension funds' representative body, the Irish Association of Pension Funds, in the context of his initiative and that this was followed by a number of meetings between the Association and officials of my Department as the initiative was developed.</P>
    <P>As regards the issue of further consultations or changes, more recently, preliminary consultations have taken place between officials of my Department and the Irish Association of Pension Funds on the matter of increasing the level of pension fund investment generally in the Irish economy.  In this regard, I would say to the Deputy that while I welcome the success of the initiative on venture capital, I would like to see the pension fund sector develop its views on how this small start can be built upon so as to promote a greater level of investment here.  It is my intention to pursue this matter with the pension funds over the next twelve months.</P>

To bring such structures within the meaning of <Col N="1208" /> section 255 would constitute an extension of the system of capital allowances to a new area.  This would narrow the tax base and would involve extra cost for the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>It should be noted, however, that fishfarming activities are eligible for the reduced 10 per cent rate of corporation tax.  Also, capital allowances are available in respect of the plant and machinery used in the course of such a trade at the rate of 15 per cent per annum.  Thus, it can be seen that very generous tax incentives already exist for fishfarming activities in the State.</P>

      <P>While there is no refurbishment currently under way in my Department, various works are planned and they include the following: a kitchen and <Col N="1209" /> dining room to be provided for use by management and myself.  This was originally requested by the former Minister for Finance; a cafeteria for staff is to be located on the third floor; ground floor refurbishments will include upgrading the Department's conference facility and improving ladies and gents toilets; in accordance with safety standards, fire doors are to be provided on each floor.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of the aforementioned works is not yet finalised but may be in the region of £400,000.  The staff cafeteria, conference room refurbishment and provision of fire doors accounts for a large proportion of this estimate.</P>

      <P>As indicated by my predecessor, Deputy Phil Hogan, in his written reply to the Deputy's question on 31 January 1995 (Question No. 59, columns 624, 625 and 626), the Health, County Laois, is owned by the Minister for Finance and has been managed on his behalf since 1943 by the Commissioners of Public Works. The Commissioners, accordingly, are not in a position to furnish comprehensive and accurate information regarding all expired or surrendered agreements affecting the Health property since 1922.

It would not be possible to say at this stage how the numbers serving in particular categories in the Civil Service will change in the course of 1995.  This would depend upon a range of factors such as retirements, resignations, career breaks, changing workloads, etc. and the extent to which recruitment will be needed to offset such changes.</P>

      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy in my reply on 23 February last, the Eastern Health Board has been involved with the young person in question and his family for some time. The board, recently paid to have him flown back from London to Dublin.  He was then placed in temporary accommodation until a more suitable long term placement could be organised.  I understand that these arrangements were made with the prior knowledge of the child's parents.  A few days after his arrival, however, he returned independently to London.  I understand that he is currently in emergency accommodation arranged by Westminster Social services.</P>
      <P>The Eastern Health Board have advised me that they are at present involved in intensive contact with Westminster social services.  They are also keeping in touch with the boy's parents. I understand that the young person has expressed a strong desire to remain in London.  I understand also that the parents, through their solicitor, recently raised a number of legal queries about the case with the Eastern Health Board, including the question of the young person's legal status, and that the board will be responding to these shortly.  I am satisfied that the Eastern Health Board has made considerable attempts to assist this young person and his family and that it will continue its efforts in this regard.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> There are two voluntary hospice groups operating in the North-Western Health Board area.  The north-west hospice which covers Sligo, Leitrim and south Donegal and Donegal hospice which caters for the remainder of County Donegal.  The responsibility for providing hospice facilities in the Sligo area is a matter for the North-Western Health Board in the first instance.  The North-Western Health Board, in addition to its own provision of hospice beds and support facilities at the board's hospitals, has also been part funding the provision of home care services by the north west hospice.</P>
      <P>I understand that ongoing discussions are taking place between the board and the north-west hospice regarding the provision of a hospice facility on the campus of Sligo General Hospital.</P>
      <P>I have provided £100,000 in the current year for the development of oncology services in the North-Western Health Board area.  Future funding arrangements will have to be considered in the context of the many competing demands for resources throughout the health services and also in the North-Western Health Board's own area.</P>
      <P>Since becoming Minister for Health I have asked my Department to prepare a policy statement on the whole area of cancer services.  This statement will underline the importance of underpinning collaborative effort in this area by voluntary and statutory services.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 78 and 79 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the valuable service provided by the MS care centre in Rathgar which offers respite care to people with multiple sclerosis and other severe physical disabilities.  Established in 1988, the centre has been receiving funding from the health boards through capitation payments and a section 65 grant from the Eastern Health Board. This grant was increased by £40,000 in 1993 and 1994 from additional funds made available for the development of <Col N="1223" /> services for people with physical disabilities. In addition, my Department allocated a once-off grant of £60,000 last December to the centre to help meet its deficit.</P>
    <P>The level of subvention payable to the centre is primarily a matter for decision between the MS care centre and the relevant health boards.  Accordingly, the Department recommended that the centre hold meetings with the different health boards to discuss the provision of revenue funding and I understand that this is being followed up.</P>
    <P>I am allocating an additional £2 million revenue and £2.5 million capital funding for the physical disability sector this year.  The proposals for capital funding submitted by the Eastern Health Board include the expansion of the MS care centre accommodation from eight to 12 beds.  This proposal will be carefully examined by my Department taking account of other competing priorities for capital assistance.</P>

      <P>As I explained to the House on 7 March last in reply to Questions Nos. 76 and 77, I have been aware for some time that there is concern in certain quarters <Col N="1226" /> regarding the designation of natural heritage areas, NHAs.  I have now directed the National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, to withdraw the NHA designations which it had previously made in regard to Counties Carlow, Cavan, Clare, Kildare, Kilkenny, Laois, Offaly, Louth, Longford, Meath, Wexford and Wicklow, and to initiate the process of considering whether certain areas of Counties Cork, Donegal, Kerry and Monaghan should be designated as NHAs.</P>
      <P>Proposals have been published by the NPWS in regard to the possible designation of NHAs in the remaining ten counties.</P>
      <P>I am determined to ensure that adequate prior consultation will take place with land owners and occupiers and with other interested parties.  All such parties will have an opportunity to make their views known regarding any proposed designations and to object to such designations.  All views expressed will be taken into account prior to final decisions being taken in regard to designation.</P>
      <P>Formal designation of sites as NHAs will only take place after this consultation procedure has been completed and after the Wildlife Act, 1976, is amended and a formal system for hearing objections is established.</P>

      <P>Funding for in-career training is supported by the European Social Fund under the 1994-99 Community Support Framework.  It includes an increased provision from the 1989-93 Community Support Framework in support of the expansion and development of third-level activity and a new allocation in support for in-career training programmes encompassing first and second levels.  The 1995 Estimates provision for third-level activity under the CSF is £1.7 million.</P>
      <P>For programmes encompassing first and second levels the 1995 Estimates provision is £6.6 million.  This allocation is programme driven in accordance with the objectives agreed with the European Commission under the Human Resources Operational Programme.  It is not allocated on a sectoral basis.

      <P>The educational needs of primary pupils with a reading disability are generally capable of being met within the ordinary school system, with the assistance, where appropriate, of a remedial teacher.  Fully qualified primary school teachers are trained to deal with a variety of reading problems, including those which are accompanied by perceptual difficulties.  In addition the special training programme for remedial teachers includes a module on specific learning disability.  Where more serious cases of difficulty arise, provision is made in one of the four special schools dedicated to this area.  Three of these schools are located in Dublin and one in Cork.</P>
      <P>Over the past two years I have implemented a range of measures to further improve educational provision for children with special needs.  I have allocated an additional 186 remedial teachers to ordinary primary schools. This brought the number of such teachers in place at primary level to 1,133.  I have also sanctioned the appointment of an additional ten psychologists to the primary school psychological service.  I propose to maintain this momentum in the current year with the appointment of 55 additional remedial teachers and ten psychologists to the primary sector.</P>
      <P>Figures are not available on the number of pupils in the current academic year who have a reading disability. However, a survey aimed at identifying the extent of disability in ordinary national schools, including difficulties associated with reading, was undertaken by the Special Education Review Committee in 1992.  This survey indicated that an estimated 1,744 children with specific learning disability, including reading disability, were attending ordinary national schools.</P>

      <P>The child in question was eligible for free transport to her nearest school while under the age of ten.  As there was no service to the nearest school, under the terms of the scheme she was entitled to travel as a concessionary fare-payer on a special service to her next nearest school.  As her parents are medical card holders, the fare was waived while the child was eligible for free transport.  However, as the child is now over ten years of age and less than three miles from the school, she is no longer eligible for free transport. In the circumstances, the most that can be offered her is fare-paying transport. As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the other children to whom he refers were granted free transport as an exceptional measure because of specific family circumstances.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the school transport post-primary scheme it is not possible to extend the service in question.  The school transport scheme is intended to provide a basic level of service for pupils who would otherwise experience difficulty in attending school regularly.  Pupils living off the main route of a service are generally expected to make their own way to a convenient pick-up point.  Home pick-ups are not a feature of the scheme as the cost of providing such services on a countryside basis would be prohibitive.  The service being provided to these pupils is regarded as adequate and is the most that can be offered to the pupils in this instance.</P>

      <P>Day to day operational issues of this type fall within the ambit of the board of management as the body charged with the direct governance of the school.  My attention has not been drawn to any particular difficulty in relation to how boards of management determine school closures.  Clearly, where the board takes a decision to close a school in advance of the commencement of the school day, the issue of reporting for duty or roll-call does not arise.</P>
      <P>There are other circumstances, such as the failure of the heating system, which cannot be predicted and may result in the closure of the school after the school day has commenced.  The roll may or may not have been taken at that stage.  Again the decision to close rests with the school authority based on its assessment of the problem presented and my Department does not impose any requirement in relation to taking the roll.  However, where closure for health reasons arises, the rules require the board to consult the medical officer of health before a decision is reached.</P>
      <P>Ultimately, schools are required to be in operation for a minimum of 183 days in the school year.  The rules provide me as Minister with power to abate this requirement should a school fail to reach that minimum owing to some exceptional cause.

      <P>I understand the Deputy is referring to prohibition orders under the Censorship of Publications Acts, 1929 to 1967.  As the Deputy may be aware, section 8 of the Censorship of Publications Act, 1946 provides several avenues of appeal for the revocation of a prohibition order: an appeal can be made by the author of a banned book; an appeal can <Col N="1247" /> be made by the editor of a banned periodical; an appeal can be made by the publisher of the banned book or periodical; an appeal can be made by any five Members of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann, acting jointly.</P>
      <P>Any such appeal is made to the Censorship of Publications Appeal Board who may, as they think proper, affirm or revoke the prohibition order.  The board may also vary the order so as to exclude from the application any particular edition of the prohibited book published before, on or after the date of the prohibition order.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that there are sufficient avenues open to enable interested parties to appeal for the revocation of a prohibition order and I have no proposals to make any amendments to this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Video Recordings Act, 1989 was enacted with the twin aims of prohibiting trade in so-called video nasties and of introducing regulatory controls on the video business for the purpose of regulating the types of videos which would be available to children and young persons under 18 years.</P>
      <P>Basically the Act aims at three levels of control.  First, it provides for the licensing of wholesale and retail video outlets.  Second, it provides that the film censor may, on grounds specified in the Act, prohibit the supply of video films which he considers unsuitable for viewing. Third, it provides for the classification of video films in terms of their suitability for viewing by different age groups.</P>
      <P>The licensing provisions of the Video Recording Act, 1989 require all wholesalers and retailers, including video rental outlets, to be registered with the film censor's office and to display appropriate licences on their premises. A very important element of this licensing control is the fact that licences may be forfeited by order of the courts in the event of the holder being convicted of certain offences under the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1249" /> The film censor has power under the Video Recordings Act to prohibit, by order, any video which comes, or is brought to his attention, and which he considers, by reference to criteria set out in the Act, to be unfit for viewing. The grounds on which the film censor may declare a video as unfit for viewing are contained in section 3 (i) of the Act which states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the work is unfit for viewing because,</P>
    <P> (a)  the viewing of it</P>
    <P> (i)  would be likely to cause persons to commit crimes, whether by inciting or encouraging them to do so, or by indicating or suggesting ways of doing so, or of avoiding detection, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  would be likely to stir up hatred against a group of persons in the State or elsewhere on account of their race, colour, nationality, religion, ethnic or national origins, membership of the travelling community or sexual orientation, or</P>
    <P>(iii)  would tend, by reasons of the inclusion in it of obscene or indecent matter, to deprave or corrupt persons who might view it, or, </P>
    <P>(b)  it depicts acts of gross violence or cruelty (including mutilation or torture) towards humans or animals.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To date, the censor has made orders prohibiting 1,572 videos.  The majority of these videos were submitted to the film censor by the Garda and Customs officials.</P>
    <P>The Act also covers &ldquo;video recording&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;any disc or magnetic tape containing information by the use of which the whole or part of a video work may be produced&rdquo; and &ldquo;video work&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;any series of visual images... produced... by the use of information contained on any disc or magnetic tape and shown as a <Col N="1250" /> moving picture&rdquo;.  Therefore, any video game which falls within the viewing criteria mentioned in section 3 (i) of the Act comes under the scope of the Act.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 September, 1994, all new video releases coming on the market must first have been submitted to the film censor for certification as to their fitness for viewing and for classification by reference to their suitability for viewing by children and young persons of various ages.</P>
    <P>Given that all sections of the 1989 Act have been fully operational since 1 September, 1994, only it is as yet too early to say that further legislation is needed in this regard.  I will, however, be looking at the whole question of the effectiveness of the Video Recordings Act and if it emerges that further measures are required at a statutory level, I will ensure they are introduced.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy or any person is aware of any apparent breach of the law as regards the circulation of obscene videos or computer discs, I would invite them to report the matter to the Garda Síochána or the film censors office for appropriate action.  Any alleged contravention of the Video Recordings Act, 1989 will be fully investigated by the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>There are no statutory limits on the numbers that can be held in custodial institutions in this country.  There are however, practical considerations such as cell space, ability to provide reasonably tolerable facilities for prisoners and so on, which, in practice, means that there are limits to the numbers that can be held at a particular time.  The latter figure varies, depending for example on refurbishment works that may be ongoing at institutions and other factors.  The numbers held on 13 March are set out in the following table.</P>
      <P>It should be explained that overcrowding has been a feature of prisons in this country for some time and that the numbers in custody on 13 March and indeed day-in-day-out for many years now, have exceeded what could be regarded as ideal, given the size and quality of facilities available at many of the institutions concerned.</P>

      <P>Under the Explosives Act, 1875 a licence is required to be issued by my Department for the importation of fireworks. It is long-standing policy that such licences are only issued for organised public displays conducted by professional operators.</P>
      <P>Despite this restriction, it is clear that supplies of fireworks continue to be imported illegally into the country, particularly around Hallowe'en each year.  The Garda authorities are aware of the problems posed by this illegal trade and take appropriate measures to counteract these problems.</P>
      <P>Moreover, the Garda authorities monitor the supply and storage of fireworks. Significant seizures are made each year as a result of their vigilance. In 1993 and 1994 illegally imported fireworks valued at approximately £116,000 and £120,000 respectively, were confiscated by the Garda over the Hallowe'en period and subsequently destroyed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the existing legislation is adequate and that the policy of restricting the issuing of licences to professional operators is the correct one. The strict measures taken by the Garda <Col N="1259" /> authorities to enforce the law is the best way to ensure that the public are protected from the inherent dangers of fireworks.</P>

      <P>Community policing in urban areas was first introduced in 1987 and has been extended throughout the Dublin Metropolitan Area and to Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway.  The Garda Authorities have plans to extend the Scheme further to Dundalk, Mullingar, Athlone, Clonmel and Sligo.  The main aim of the community policing scheme in urban areas is to forge closer links between the Garda and the community they serve.  Community gardaí are assigned to particular areas, usually housing estates where they liaise with the community on a continuous basis on all policing matters, including those referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>A community policing scheme in rural areas was launched in September, 1991 in 100 stations in 14 districts throughout the country.  This scheme maximises the amount of time spent by gardaí among the community giving them an opportunity to meet regularly with the local gardaí and discuss any concerns they might have.</P>
      <P>Of course, members of the public may report a crime to any Garda station or inquire into the progress of Garda investigations at any stage in relation to any offences such as those listed by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 154, 155 and 156 together.</P>
      <P>The Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council was established to carry out the most fundamental and wide-ranging review of science, technology and innovation ever undertaken in this country.  The report is, therefore, a complex and comprehensive one.  The Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology received the report on 12 January 1995 and has been engaged in an initial examination of it, including consideration of an appropriate mechanism for examining its 150 or so recommendations.  He has consulted other Government Departments and is in the process of bringing the report to Government.  After its consideration by the Government, he expects to publish the report, probably within the next three weeks.  At the same time, copies will be supplied to the Oireachtas Library.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the view that there is confusion between the Office of Science and Technology (OST) and Forbairt regarding responsibility for science and technologymatters.  The OST is clearly responsible for science and technology <Col N="1264" /> policy matters both generally and relating to the science and technology programmes it funds.  Forbairt is responsible for the management and implementation of these programmes. In some cases committee structures are in place, including representatives of the OST and Forbairt, to ensure that the translation of policy into implementation avoids any such confusion.  In that context, and as stated above, the Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology does not accept that there is any delay in the production of the STIAC report or that its pending publication detracts from the ongoing policy formulation or implementation of science and technology programmes.  In so far as the STIAC makes any recommendations which impact on this question these will have to be considered by the Government in the follow-up to the report, taking account of the views of Forbairt and the Office of Science and Technology.</P>
    <P>As regards moneys, the Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology, expects, on publication of the report, to announce a mechanism through which the STIAC recommendations will be considered and decided upon by Government.  The question of the additionality of such funds as may be necessary to implement recommendations adopted by the Government, and indeed the source of such funds, will obviously be a major factor in the deliberations on the recommendations in any event, and I do not propose to anticipate those deliberations.</P>

      <P>Policy in relation to industrial property is to ensure the availability of land and buildings to facilitate industrial development, and, particularly, the attraction of mobile investment.  In implementing this policy the aim is to maximise private sector involvement in the provision of factory space, thus minimising the cost to the taxpayer.  Funding is provided by my Department to Forfás and to Shannon Development to support the provision of industrial space in those instances where private sector involvement is not feasible.</P>
      <P>The provision of manufacturing units is one element only in the industrial property activities of the agencies.

      <P>Generally speaking there are no undue delays in processing cases which come before the Labour Court.  Any delays which arise are usually due to factors outside the control of the court.  The average period from the receipt of a case to the issue of findings by the Labour Court is six to <Col N="1268" /> eight weeks approximately which, given the complexity of many of the cases, is not unreasonable.  Current procedures, which are continuously kept under review by the court, seek to ensure that cases are progressed to a conclusion as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>With regard to the specific case referred to in Dublin 22, the employee concerned is one of a number referred to in a complaint made by a trade union of employers, of a breach of a register agreement by a company.  The complaint was referred to the court under section 10 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1969.</P>
      <P>The court in accordance with the provisions of this section, before making a decision which is enforceable in law, is required to satisfy itself as to whether or not the complaint is well found.</P>
      <P>To assist it in investigating this complaint the court requested the Labour Inspectorate of my Department to carry out an inspection and provide a report. From the evidence given to the court at the hearing and the Labour Inspectorate report, the court was not in a position to make a decision on the complaint.</P>
      <P>The court had to initiate additional inquiries to decide whether or not the agreement had been breached.  Further protracted discussions with the parties to the complaint have taken place and this has led to a delay in the case being finalised.</P>
      <P>However, I have been informed that the court has now completed all inquiries, considered the evidence and will issue a decision at an early date.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 164, 168 and 177 together.</P>
      <P>The Irish Government made submissions to the EU Commission on the extension of the disadvantaged areas and reclassification of certain areas from less severely to more severely handicapped area status in November 1993 and October 1994 respectively. The Commission is currently examining these submissions.  At a meeting with the Irish Farming Organisations on 8 March 1995, I stated that I had met Commissioner Fischler to stress the urgency of a decision on these submissions. He assured me that he will attempt to secure a decision on both extension and reclassification during the first half of 1995.</P>
      <P>When these proposals have been finalised, it will be possible to move to the designation of a third category of disadvantaged area &mdash; extremely severely handicapped.  However, although some background work on this has been carried out within my Department, it is not possible at this stage to be precise as to the areas under consideration, the specific criteria which such areas will have to meet, or to say when a submission will be ready for transmission.</P>

Under the EU regulations governing the scheme, this resulted in a penalty reduction of 0.40 hectares, thereby reducing the area of eligible set-aside to 2.16 hectares.

      <P>It is my aim to ensure adequate staff resources for the development of the food and forestry sectors.  As regards the Forestry Inspectorate, two vacancies occurred in the first half of 1994.  These vacancies were filled in the last quarter of 1994 from a Civil Service Commission recruitment competition.</P>
      <P>Two further vacancies occurred in August, 1993 and in February, 1995 at Inspectorate level with the forest service as a result of the retirement of lands inspectors.  These inspectors were on long term secondment to the forest service. However, since October 1994, three lands inspectors are being retrained on all aspects of forestry at University College, Dublin.  When this training is completed, they will be assigned on a full-time basis as forestry inspectors in my Department's forest service.</P>
      <P>Arrangements are currently in hand within my Department to fill, at the appropriate level, the vacancy created by the recent retirement of the chief inspector, forest service.</P>

      <P>The timber trade in the EU has long been liberalised and the three countries which recently joined the EU were consequently in a position to trade freely in that unrestricted market prior to their EU entry. Accordingly, the recent expansion of <Col N="1275" /> the EU does not change the pattern of trade within the EU.</P>
      <P>The current afforestation programme which covers the period up to 1997 is strongly supported by the Irish timber industry.  It underpins the further development of the industry and the Government remains committed to the achievement of its ambitious afforestation targets.  Afforestation policy in the longer term requires careful consideration of many factors, including developments in the EU.  Issues affecting the competitiveness and efficiency of the Irish timber industry will be addressed in the strategic plan for the development of the Irish forest sector, which I will be publishing later this year.</P>

      <P>The rate of aid payable under the scheme of investment aid for upgrading of on-farm dairying facilities is related to the quota size of participants and priority under the scheme is given to smaller producers. For farmers with quotas up to 15,000 gallons the rate of aid is 60 per cent, for those in the 15,001 to 30,000 gallon bracket and for those in the 30,001 to 40,000 gallon range it is 40 per cent and 25 per cent respectively.  Farmers with quotas of more than 40,000 gallons are not eligible.</P>
      <P>Inevitably, there will be producers who, under such a mechanism, marginally fall outside a particular category.</P>
      <P>The producer to whom the Deputy refers is in a category to which the 40 per cent grant rate applies.  Having regard to the size of this quota and to the general need to ensure that adequate funding is available to smaller producers, this level of grant is considered reasonable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport, Energy and Communications (Mr. Lowry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to taken Questions Nos. 182 and 187 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> The basic light rail network recommended by the Dublin Transportation Initiative is for lines to Tallaght, Cabinteely via the Harcourt Street line and Ballymun.</P>
    <P>Under the DTI it is envisaged that these lines will join together to form a single light rail network permitting cross-city operations and will serve both north and south sides of the city centre with a route along O'Connell Street.  A fourth line to Finglas via the old Broadstone railway line and an extension of the Ballymun line to Dublin Airport and Swords also form part of the full DTI recommended light rail network.</P>
    <P>The basic network cannot be fully constructed within the EU and other resources totalling £200 million set out in the National Development Plan. Moreover, a longer time frame than that of the National Development Plan and the Operational Programme for Transport, which covers the period from 1994 to 1999, will be needed to complete the basic network.</P>
    <P>The objective is to have two priority phases of the basic three line light rail network constructed in the period up to 1999.  In this context my Department in conjunction with a high level project team in CIE have for some time been engaged in detailed planning and preparatory work to advise on the optimum combination of light rail links recommended by the DTI to be constructed by 1999 on the basis of a number of criteria, including financial performance, congestion alleviation, ease of construction and environmental impact.  All of the bodies involved in the planning and provision of transportation in the Dublin area are co-operating in this work which embraces all aspects of the light rail network.  The provisional finding arising from this work, which is subject to more detailed examination in a number of respects including detailed route alignment, is that links to Tallaght and Dundrum should be constructed by 1999 and this position was noted and approved by the Government in October 1994.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1278" /> The decision in relation to the two priority phases to be constructed by 1999 does not imply any abandonment of the remaining phases of the basic network.</P>
