      <P>Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 30 dealing with two different topics.  I propose to deal with the topics separately and will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.  In regard to the first topic I received notice from Deputy Tom Kitt and now call on him to state the matter of which he has given notice.</P>

      <P>I join in congratulating the Government on being able to reach agreement on the joint communiqué with the British Government.  It is an achievement and if people want to be pessimistic or to carp, they could find flaws but if they want to be optimistic, it restores the momentum that was lost for some time.  I hope the protagonists in Northern Ireland will show courage and will approach the communiqué in a spirit of openness and generosity.  If they do we can move the process forward and have a political settlement sooner rather than later.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their all party support for the efforts of the Taoiseach and the Government as revealed in London last evening.  It is important that we launch the twin track process.  It was made clear last night that we want to have all party talks by the end of February.  The meeting was particularly important in restoring momentum to the peace process and I am glad of Deputies' support.  We are all attached to the peace process and what is necessary is all party support both in Northern Ireland and in the Republic.  With everyone's best endeavours we will have all party talks by the <Col N="5" /> end of February to underpin the peace process which is vital to everyone on this island.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, on its introduction. It will do for the courts system what the Ethics in Public Office Act will do for the Legislature.  It will remove from the Judiciary, whose perceived independence and credibility has been undermined, the whiff of a cosy cartel, a term in popular usage in recent months, sometimes undeservedly.  It will ensure that litigants, defendants, witnesses and the community at large are not forced to wait for months or years before cases come before the courts.  It will further ensure that the distance between citizens and the Judiciary which in the past has been maintained by pomp, circumstance and the old boys' club is minimised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has two central planks &mdash; a radical overhaul of the way judges are appointed and a series of procedural changes designed to reduce delays in the system.  The establishment of a judicial appointments advisory board is long <Col N="7" /> overdue.  The necessity for such a board was highlighted last year during the bizarre events surrounding the appointment and subsequent resignation of the former Attorney General, Mr. Harry Whelehan, as President of the High Court.  Everyone realises that that episode could have been handled much better.  If there had been a proper system in place to advise the Government and Opposition on how to handle such matters events could have turned out differently.</P>
    <P>The majority of judges perform what are often arduous duties fairly and honestly and with due regard to the wider implications of their judgments.  On the question of facilities, many judges carry out their duties under atrocious conditions. I hope that this matter is being addressed.</P>
    <P>There is growing public disquiet regarding the operation of the legal system. This is based more on the perception than the reality, but it must be allayed nevertheless.  Overwhelmingly male, elderly judges have been perceived as handing down widely differing sentences.  I have never been in the business of criticising judges or sentences handed down by them as it is grossly unfair to do so.  In the main they are dealing with problems of which they have no life experience.  How can we, therefore, criticise them for dealing with social behaviour that has only come to light in the past five to ten years in a manner which we find unacceptable? We should be very careful of what we say.</P>
    <P>The logjam in the courts system has given meaning to the old adage &ldquo;justice delayed is justice denied&rdquo;.  The Whelehan fiasco was the icing on an already crumbling cake.  As a proper system had not been put in place to allow us deal with such matters in a more reasonable and cohesive fashion, this was an event waiting to happen.  It was a matter of timing, it could have happened to any Government.</P>
    <P>The judicial appointments advisory board will ensure that in future judges <Col N="8" /> will be appointed on the basis of their qualifications and track record.  I have no doubt that that was the position in the past, but the fact that they had political affiliations was also a factor.  In addition, as solicitors and barristers will be eligible for appointment the judicial base will be broadened.  This should ensure that those with experience of the day-to-day operation of the legal system are eligible for appointment to the Bench.  It will be refreshing to see a family law solicitor or a solicitor who has distinguished himself or herself in the legal aid field sitting on the Bench as increasingly that is the area of law we will be dealing with.</P>
    <P>Last week's referendum should tell us this more than anything else.  While I welcome the establishment of the judiciial appointments advisory board, I am concerned about two omissions.  I would like clarification on the qualifications needed by the three members of the board to be appointed by the Minister and I would like a provision constraining the Government to accept the board's advice on appointments except in clearly exceptional cases.  It is difficult to set up an advisory board and not be obliged to accept its advice.  The advisory board is a major step forward.  I urge the Minister to go an extra step and close any loopholes.</P>
    <P>The proposed retirement ages for judges are 70 and 72 years.  I do not subscribe to the view that anyone over 60 years of age is automatically past it.  I will be 60 years old in the near future and I would like to think that I would be treated in a considerate way.  I am concerned that there appears to be no limit regarding the type of individual which can serve on the Bench and this disturbs me far more.  Rather than imposing a mandatory retirement age, thereby excluding people who may bring a wealth of life's experience to the Bench, we should consider imposing a five or ten year service limit.  I would not be rigid on this time span but this would be a better way of dealing with the issue, depending on when a person is appointed.  This would ensure a regular <Col N="9" /> infusion of new blood to the Judiciary and would also increase the chance of achieving a gender balance.  The turnover would ensure this because there are far more women becoming solicitors and about to come up through the ranks.</P>
    <P>The Judiciary has often in the past appeared remote to ordinary citizens and this was largely due to some of the archaic traditions regarding costume, wigs, form of address and the like.  I welcome section 49 which eliminated some of the paraphernalia which has in the past placed a distance between the person in the dock, and indeed ordinary witnesses, and members of the Judiciary.</P>
    <P>One of the central planks of the Bill is an increase in the numbers appointed to the lower courts.  The increase in the volume of cases coming before the courts has led to an unacceptable backlog whereby an individual may wait for months or years before their case comes to trial.  This is unacceptable and has caused hardship to those involved in those cases as well as to the community at large.  There will be widespread public welcome for measures designed to reduce delays.</P>
    <P>The right of appeal is central to our concept of justice and I must admit to some disquiet at the decision not to establish a court of appeal which has been mooted for some years.  The powers of the court of criminal appeal will, under this Bill, be vested in the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the Minister's reservations as to the efficiency of the court of appeal and her efforts to ensure that the Supreme Court can cope with the increased workload.  However, I urge that the changed arrangements for sittings of the Supreme Court and the numbers of judges hearing particular cases should be closely monitored so that the impact of the changes can be fully assessed.  If this does not work we should not be afraid to say something extra is needed or to change what is not working.  In the past there has been a reluctance to say publicly that mistakes <Col N="10" /> were made or that something did not work.  This created a system which we all knew was inefficient and ineffective but we continued on, despite the fact that intelligent men and women could see it was not working.  New legislation and processes should be monitored and if they do not work they should be changed.  This is a simple concept which works in other areas.</P>
    <P>When the provisions of this Bill are implemented they will have a profound and far reaching impact on the way justice is administered.  The Minister has succeeded in what was nearly an impossible task.  She has designed legislation which will bring the Judiciary, possibly kicking and screaming, into the tail end of the 20th century without forfeiting any of the safeguards which protect defendants and society in general.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill's predecessor made its appearance about this time last year.  We are now past the first anniversary of the date we first debated the Courts and Courts Officers Bill, 1994.  I have examined the 1995 Bill and while it contains a number of changes from its predecessor, the extent of the changes does not justify a year's delay in reintroducing the legislation.  The House will recall that this time last year the introduction of legislation of this type was deemed to be of urgent necessity by the Labour Party and the future of the then Government depended on it.  However, with the formation of the new Government the urgency seems to have evaporated.</P>
      <P>The 12-month delay has not been wasted.  It has been used by the Government to appoint their supporters to every conceivable vacancy on the Bench.  Nobody can gainsay this.  I ask the Minister for an assurance that the proposed judicial appointments board &mdash; I have serious doubts as to its value &mdash; will be appointed immediately on the passing of the Bill and that no further judicial appointments will take place until the board is in place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our legal system is a central part of our democracy and impacts profoundly <Col N="11" /> on the lives of citizens.  It has not kept pace with social and economic changes. This has led to unconscionable delays, blatant inefficiencies and spiralling costs which have caused widespread disillusionment throughout society.  As I said in another context recently, it is not just people who come directly in contact with the legal system who are disillusioned but all those who make contact with them.  This disillusionment with the courts and legal system has spread throughout society like the Black Death in the 14th century.</P>
    <P>While this Bill has a number of improvements on its predecessor, it also contains a number of disimprovements. Like its predecessor it has two central purposes.  These is a substantial reduction in political patronage in judicial appointments and the introduction of a speedier, cheaper and more efficient system of administration of justice. This Bill, in my view, fails lamentably. While I welcome the improvements it contains, they are for the most part tokenist and involve the merest tinkering at the edges.  Nobody can argue that the Bill is revolutionary.  It contains no radical reforms and will not shake the State to its foundations.  When the Bill is implemented, the system will trundle on as before with perhaps a slight reduction in costs, although we should not underestimate the ingenuity of the legal profession in this regard. There may be more efficiency due to some of the changes but the system will not change to any dramatic extent.</P>
    <P>One of the central stated objectives of the Bill is substantially to reduce political patronage in judicial appointments. The original Bill also had this as its central objective but it went about it in a different manner.  Under the original proposals the appointments board would submit a short list to the Minister for consideration.  The list was not to exceed five names but the board could submit as few as three names.  Under the proposal before us, the board has to submit not fewer than ten names.  There <Col N="12" /> is no maximum number; the board can submit as many names as it likes.</P>
    <P>The proposals with regard to the membership of the judicial appointments board have changed dramatically.  Everybody knows its membership under the 1994 Bill.  Under the new provisions the President of the Law Reform Commission is judged no longer to be worthy of membership of the board.  He is being replaced by four new appointees, one of whom is the Attorney General.  The other three are to be nominated by the Minister and there are no guidelines as to the qualifications they are to have.  What possible reason can be advanced for these changes?  It is inappropriate that the Attorney General should be a member. In future the Attorney General will advise the Government on judicial appointments in his two capacities, as a member of the board and as chief law officer of the State and legal adviser to the Government.  That is inappropriate and it would be better if the Attorney General was not appointed to the board.</P>
    <P>There is a second consideration in this regard.  Very often an Attorney General of an outgoing Government will tell the Taoiseach he is available for appointment as a superior court judge, and he is subsequently appointed.  If the Attorney General is a member of the Judicial Appointments Board which considers every other appointment made, it would be very difficult to turn him down.  The Bill provides that the Attorney General must step aside when the board is considering his appointment, but he is still a member of the board.  If the board turns down an application by the Attorney General for a vacancy in the High Court or Supreme Court will he return to the board to consider future appointments or will he permanently exclude himself from the board in view of the fact that his name is down for all future appointments? In reality that will not happen. The Attorney General will have the inside track on the basis that he is a member of the board.  The legislative <Col N="13" /> requirement that he step aside from the meeting of the board which will consider his application is only a fig leaf and would mean nothing in practice.</P>
    <P>The Bill gives power to the Minister to appoint three people to the board, but there is no mention of their qualifications. Anybody could be appointed.  A Minister could appoint three party hacks simply because of their service to the party in power.  To allow a Minister to appoint such people to a board that is supposed to filter appointments to judicial office is an abuse.</P>
    <P>During debate on the earlier legislation concern was expressed that the previous board was over-laden with members of the Judiciary, the Judiciary would effectively recommend people for appointment as future judges and the whole system would become a self-perpetuating élite.  It was suggested that membership of the board should be extended but what people had in mind &mdash; I have discussed this matter with them &mdash; was that national organisations such as IBEC, the trade unions and people working with victims of violence should be entitled to membership of the board and that those organisations would nominate their appointees.  It was not intended that the Attorney General and three Government appointees be included on a board of ten people.  That provision ensures that 40 per cent of the board consists of a bloc directly representing and controlled by the Government. As Deputies are aware, 40 per cent is sufficient representation to control any major public company.  I could mention one or two public companies floated on the stock market, the major players of which have less than 40 per cent of the shareholding in the company. In this case the Government will have 40 per cent control over the Judicial Appointments Board.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other radical changes from the original proposal.  In the original Bill under the filtering system not fewer than three and not more than five people whom the board considered suitable for appointment would go forward to the Government.  Under <Col N="14" /> this legislation every time a judicial vacancy arises all the names of people who indicate their intention to apply will go forward to the Minister and not fewer than ten will be recommended as suitable for appointment &mdash; there is no maximum figure.  The Minister said last night that she has pages of names and addresses of potential applicants for judicial positions, who no doubt came to her attention through political representation, or perhaps they wrote to her directly.  Under this legislation the Judicial Appointments Board will have even more pages of potential applicants, and that number will increase when word gets around that there is a vacancy because all those names must go to the Minister.</P>
    <P>The second list, that of people considered suitable for the vacancy, will consist of not fewer than ten people, but there is no maximum number.  The Government bloc may insist on including as many names as it wishes &mdash; the legislation is designed to encourage as many names as possible to be put forward. It will be like a karaoke session, everybody will have a chance to become involved.  When the board has considered a number of names which it deems suitable, one member may suggest another person whom he believes is suitable and his name will go on the list. In many cases the second list will be as long as the first, so why bother making out a second list?  As the second list increases, the incentive to have a second list will decrease.</P>
    <P>The Judicial Appointments Board will be like a post box.  The position will be similar to that of local authorities in filtering applications for national lottery grants.  They simply acted as a post box in that if a form was filled in properly it was referred to the Department of the Environment.  That is precisely what will happen with the new Judicial Appointments Board.  If the Government wishes to appoint a particular person &mdash; I am sure membership of the Government bloc will be well aware of whom the Minister wishes to be appointed &mdash; the <Col N="15" /> Government bloc may virtually insist the name is put forward.</P>
    <P>If that procedure does not effectively bypass the so-called filtering system, there is one remaining loophole which will ensure the Government has total control.  If the Government wishes to appoint a person who has not indicated to the Judicial Appointments Board that they wish to be considered, section 14 (2) (d) provides that the person may be invited to apply for the vacancy.  The system is, therefore, foolproof from the Government's point of view.  As if that was not sufficient to bypass any filtering system available to the Judicial Appointments Board, the Minister is not bound to accept any one of the ten plus names recommended.</P>
    <P>There is an argument that it is not constitutional to insist that the Government confines itself to recommending one of the names put forward by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. I have studied the matter and taken advice on it.  I do not agree it is unconstitutional and the Minister will probably say it is not unconstitutional I would like to hear the Attorney General's advice on this matter and to know the basis for that advice.  I will accept his advice despite the fact that he has got it wrong so many times in the past.</P>
    <P>At present, a committee is considering changes in the Constitution.  The Taoiseach said in this House and I agree with him, that the brief of that committee is to design a Constitution fit for a modern Ireland of the 1990s.  If the Attorney General's advice is that there is a constitutional prohibition on removing the patronage leading to judicial appointments from politicians, that is one of the first things to which the constitutional review committee should turn its attention.</P>
    <P>There are other oddities in the section relating to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  For example, in section 14 (2) (c) the board can &ldquo;consult persons concerning the suitability of applicants to the Board&rdquo;.  When one tries to cover up what one is doing by <Col N="16" /> pretending to introduce some transparency into judicial appointments, one is bound to make mistakes.  This is part of the illusion that the board will have widespread consultation powers and that leads to mistakes.  Section 14 (2) (c) is open to abuse.  It will allow the Government to block the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board from investigating people who, perhaps, the Minister does not want.</P>
    <P>Section 14 (2) allows the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to initiate an application.  There is an injunction in newspaper advertisements for air hostesses that canvassing will disqualify. Yet not only will canvassing not disqualify in this case, but the board is empowered to canvass potential applicants. That is bizarre.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision to abolish the wearing of wigs, but it should be extended to other court apparel.  Last year when we produced legislation to abolish wigs, the Bar Council took a vote on the matter.  It is appalling that a senior branch of the legal profession should vote to see if it will obey legislation proposed by the Government and passed by this House.  It is not within its right to disobey legislation passed in this House.  The proposal in the Bill should be more radical and we should look at other court apparel.  As Deputy O'Donoghue said, a black gown similar to that worn in the European Court of Justice would be sufficient.  If we get rid of wigs, the other paraphernalia will probably remain.</P>
    <P>This provision should also extend to judges.  If barristers have to work naked from the neck up, I do not understand why judges should not do likewise. What is the position if a barrister, who must now leave aside the horsehair, is subsequently appointed to the Bench? Must he dust it off and put it on again? As Deputy O'Donoghue asked, what sanction will be imposed if someone comes into court wearing a wig?  I presume he is in contempt of court.  He will rely on someone wearing a wig to hold him in contempt.  We will have fun with that section on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="17" /> The section which deals with extra powers to superior courts committees does not go far enough, although I welcome its extension to the Circuit Court. It pales into insignificance beside the radical reforms proposed in the United Kingdom.  Court procedures must be reformed; this Bill only represents a tinkering at the edges.  I also deplore the fact that the right to make the rules is confined to the legal establishment, which will not be too hard on itself.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Although this Bill is progressive it will not resolve all the problems in our court system.  I want to discuss delays in the administration of justice and the judicial system, the lack of court facilities and the excessive costs and waste in the court system.</P>
      <P>I hope this Bill will go a long way towards resolving the problem of delays in our system.  I am sure the old saying, justice delayed is justice denied, will be quoted during this debate.  There is no doubt that has been the case for a number of years and perehaps recent Governments have a case to answer in that regard.  Some 17 extra judges are being appointed and this will bring the total number of judges to over 100.</P>
      <P>There is a developing trend among the people to be more litigious but I hope delays will be eliminated once judges are available to deal with cases.</P>
      <P>I accept that in recent years there has been more personal injury litigation.  In 1960 there were 250,000 cars on the road; there are now over one million cars.  This is a contributory factor to an increased number of accidents.  The family law business has also mushroomed as a result of increased marriage breakdown about which we have heard much in recent weeks.  Unfortunately, the increase in crime has meant there are more criminal cases.  This has led to more pressure on the court system and, therefore, more delays.  I hope the appointment of extra judges will improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know a person bringing a claim to the High Court who wishes to have it <Col N="18" /> heard in Cork.  Usually it takes approximately one year to prepare a case for trial and then notice of trial is served. However, as of now, that case will probably not be heard for three years from the time the notice of trial is served. That is an outrageous denial of justice to the claimant in that case.</P>
    <P>A similar situation arises in the Circuit Court in Cork.  Fortunately, the situation is not too bad in the rural areas, but in the city there could be a delay of two or three years in the hearing of a claim because of the pressure of business. Last week I checked the number of cases where civil bills have been issued this year and I discovered that 3,500 civil bills have already been issued in the Cork Circuit Court district.  This is separate from criminal cases.  That is a fair indication of the extent and volume of the business to be dealt with. The number of judges is insufficient in this regard.</P>
    <P>In relation to delays in the court system, someone will take a case under the Constitution which states that justice will be administered in our courts.  If a person's case is delayed for such a long period that he or she is denied justice, there is a constitutional imperative that his or her case must be heard.  A person with a serious personal injury claim, who subsequently discovered he or she has a serious illness which might be life-threatening, would be entitled, under the Constitution, to bring the case to court.  Hopefully the problem of delays will be removed from the system.</P>
    <P>In many ways our judicial system is a lottery.  There used to be many complaints about juries in civil actions.  In most civil actions juries have been replaced by judges who decide the law and the award to be granted.  That change has resulted in the introduction of a great degree of unpredictability in the system, which is not helpful.  A number of High Court judges are considered progressive or liberal in the sense that they are generous in granting awards for damages, a number are considered conservative and considerably less generous <Col N="19" /> in granting awards for damages and another group fall in between.</P>
    <P>If a case where the estimated award for damages is £75,000 is assigned to a judge considered to be conservative, the person may be awarded £50,000, but if the case is assigned to a judge considered to be liberal, the person may be awarded £100,000.  Major discrepancies arise in terms of possible awards and difficulties arise on the part of legal advisers who, in many instances in the Four Courts, wait to hear which judge is assigned to a case before they give final advices on whether a claim should be settled.  That degree of unpredictability is unfortunate and arises from a range of attitudes which are understandable as judges are human.  However, some effort should be made to remove such unpredictability.  I appreciate I am treading dangerous constitutional waters as judges must be independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.  If a problem is raised, it should be addressed.  Because of the degree of unpredictability in granting awards, there is more pressure on the system and delays in settlement.</P>
    <P>I recommend to the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court that some thought should be given to dealing with this problem, which is not improving the administration of our justice system. I note that the Chief Justice is setting up a judicial studies institute and perhaps this problem might be discussed and addressed by it.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to another aspect relating to judges, their retirement age. There are many views on the proper retirement age for judges.  Under this Bill all new appointees to the Supreme and High and Circuit Courts will be required to retire at the age of 70.  At present District Judges retire at 65, but are entitled to annual extensions of their retirement age up to the age of 70.  Ultimately this will ensure a standard retirement age of 70 for judges.  Two aspects of this matter need to be addressed.  It is unfair that District Judges should be <Col N="20" /> placed in a different retirement age category from that of other judges.  When they reach the age of 65 why is their retirement age subject to annual review?  I think it probably relates to the time District Court Justices were regarded as civil servants and that there was some anachronism in the past which gives rise to this position.  It is degrading that they should be singled out to make an annual pilgrimage to determine if they are fully <i>compos mentis</i> or otherwise able to continue on as judges up to the age of 70.  If there is a rule for one judge it should apply to all judges, we should not make fish of one and flesh of another.  Is it not more important that judges of the superior courts should be fully <i>compos mentis</i> than judges of the District Court, if that is the reason for this requirement?  There is a case for the abolition of the provision requiring District Justices who are 65 to make an annual pilgrimage to extend their retirement age to 70.</P>
    <P>The Minister has, rightly, aimed at setting a standard retirement age for judges, but 70 is too high and thought should be given to progressively reducing the retirement age in the years ahead.  I compliment the Minister on establishing a standard uniform age, but when making appointments she should make provision under the Bill to progressively lower the retirement age over a period of five to 15 years.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, Deputy O'Donoghue in his usual trenchant style talked about the danger of appointing party hacks and similar references were made by Deputy O'Dea.  People in glasshouses should not throw stones, but that may be somewhat facetious.  I do not want a <i>Sunday Independent</i> hack like John Drennan writing that my speech is in defence of party hacks.  If somebody is involved in a political party, at a minimum that should not be a negative factor in appointments.  Not enough people are involved in party politics and that applies to all parties.  I encourage people in the Bar Library or lawyers throughout the country to become <Col N="21" /> involved in the political system.  As a politician, I object to a superficial approach that denigrates people who have been involved in politics by referring to them as party hacks.  Politicians should be the last people to denigrate those who give their time to political parties.</P>
    <P>Court facilities are not directly referred to in the Bill, but will arise as a result of the passage of the Bill.  If more judges are appointed, we will need more court facilities and we must consider the standard of those in place at present.  In some cases basic facilities are not available and in others there is not sufficient room, toilet facilities or telephones, basic requirements for this modern age. Another important provision, consultation facilities, are sadly lacking in many courthouses.  I know from my experience of practising in the courts that poor consultation facilities may have been acceptable in the past when a case may have been settled for £15,000 or £18,000 in the corner of a court or in the outer hall, but when dealing with sensitive matters in the family law area lack of such facilities is unacceptable. We will need to pay greater attention to the whole question of court facilities in future.  In some cases where there are consultation rooms not even a chair is provided.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>There is a need to examine the excessive cost, waste and expense built into the system.  The kind of examination I have in mind is a hard-nosed examination by independent persons who would have experience of management, designed to find a more cost effective approach to running our courts system.  I say this particularly because I do not want to take from the committee set up under the chairmanship of Mrs. Justice Susan Denham.  As I understand it, the role of that committee is to consider having the courts system under an executive agency and how that might best be done in view of the administrative difficulties associated with it.  I am thinking of an indepth examination of areas where there is waste and excessive cost in the courts system.  I do not think <Col N="22" /> the great and the good in the judicial system should be involved in this investigation. To a degree &mdash; I am a lawyer myself &mdash; there is a certain club atmosphere involved.  I am not sure that members of the club are the best to root out waste and excessive costs.  Some changes have been ill-advised.</P>
    <P>There was a great cry when in insurance cases the system of having two senior counsel and one junior counsel was changed.  This was particularly applicable in personal injury actions in the High Court.  The abolition of that rule was expected to reduce expenses and insurance costs.  What happened?  It has turned out to be a barristers bonanza. The costs &mdash; barristers fees &mdash; have, in many instances, doubled as a result of this change.  I should like to give an example.  In the past in a claim for, say, £95,000 or £100,000 it was necessary to have two senior counsel at a fee of £1,000 each and one junior counsel at two-thirds of that cost.  The costs for one day would be in excess of £2,500.  If the trial continued over two days the costs could be £4,000.  What will happen now with one senior counsel? His fee will be a minimum of about £3,000 on the first day, the fee for the junior counsel will be two-thirds, amounting to £5,000 for the first day and 50 per cent extra if it runs into a second day.  The result is that there will be fees of between £7,500 and £8,000 to barristers instead.</P>
    <P>There is an old saying: for every complex problem there is a simple solution that does not work.  It did not work in this case.  I do not blame the barristers. The barristers did not claim that this change should be made, rather it was forced on them.  Obviously, they reacted in their own way and were not going to be at a loss.  They have not been at a loss, quite the contrary.  That type of issue needs to be examined.</P>
    <P>Similarly, in relation to attendance by professional witnesses, there is a rip-off of the courts system by many of those involved in producing reports, some at £120 a time.  Often these reports are requested so the professional witnesses <Col N="23" /> cannot be blamed.  For first reports a charge of that kind is justified but for follow up reports on a six months or a yearly basis where only a few lines are involved, a fee of that order is excessive. The amount involved for professional witnesses attending the court is excessive.</P>
    <P>Section 45, which requires the exchange of medical and other reports, must be fully developed so that the necessity for professional witnesses attending court will be eliminated as far as possible.  The exchange of reports should be sufficient for the opposing lawyers and also for the judges.  Only where there is a need to cross-examine a witness will there be a requirement for court attendance.  That will shorten the time of the trial and it will reduce considerably the expense involved.</P>
    <P>The commission or a committee should be established to examine in detail the workings of the system to try to eliminate exccessive costs and waste in the system.  I am convinced there is waste and if tracked down, steps should be taken to eliminate it.</P>
    <P>This is a good Bill and I look forward to a good Committee Stage debate.</P>

      <P>Some of my colleagues on this side of the House will be aware that since I became a Member more than 20 years ago I have been in the habit of keeping a fairly detailed diary of developments while in Government and out of Government.  Certainly, the period of gestation for this legislation will have a very proud place in that diary whenever &mdash; maybe in another 20 years time &mdash; it is printed.</P>
      <P>The debate which took place here on 2 November 1994 makes very interesting reading.  I wish to quote a few paragraphs for which I will give the references later</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="24" /> This Bill is the product of the most closed Department of State led by a Minister who has many skills but who puts no value on accountability and transparency.  Why do we allow ourselves to be bullied?  Surely it is time the Dáil had the courage to assert itself.  What happened to the great Labour tradition under Brendan Corish and Frank Cluskey.  This latest legislative chicanery will add fuel to the fire.  There is a burning desire in the hearts of the people for greater accountability.  It is time that became a fire in the hearts of Members of this House.</P>
    <P>Judges themselves cannot escape criticism.  There is no Lord Mackay in the Four Courts.  The opposite appears to be the case&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>We have more High Court judges than Cabinet Ministers, and they have a difficult job to do.  However, do they, and their colleagues in the lower courts, sit for long enough per day and on enough days per year to justify an endless creation of more judges?  I will put it in blunt terms that both the judges and the public will understand. Some judges and administrators have the system over a barrel; there will continue to be a backlog of cases until we appoint more judges.  That is the way they operate and this is the main reason for the creation of more judges.</P>
    <P>Those are not my words; they are taken from the Official Report of 2 November 1994, volume 446, No. 6, columns 1404 and 1405, and were uttered by the Sunday night soundbite man, the Minister of State, Deputy Gay Mitchell.  I miss the Sunday night soundbite man who has been very quiet recently.  Only that we see him for divisions here one would think he had passed on to a better place.</P>
    <P>I would reject the comments &mdash; I did not have an opportunity to do so this time last year &mdash; that the Department of Justice could ever be described as the most closed Department.  I express my appreciation for the tremendous work <Col N="25" /> done at high speed on the 1994 Bill by the same members of the law division of that Department who have worked on the Bill before the House today. Another comment made at that time is as follows:</P>
    <P>This is the treaty of Tinakilly...</P>
    <P>This is shotgun legislation &mdash; the progeny of the one-night-stand at Baldonnel.  Its early appearance on the Order Paper owes more to politics than to legislative consideration.  So any consideration of this Bill, has to examine not just its legislative content, but its political context as well.</P>
    <P>Again, those are not my words; they are taken from the Official Report of 2 November 1994, columns 1420-21 and were uttered by Deputy Gilmore who is now Minister of State.  It is interesting to read what people said and to ask where when they are in a different position a little over a year later, the wonderful ideas they had have gone.</P>
    <P>This is my first contribution to any Justice debate since I left that Department almost 12 months ago.  I have been tempted on a number of occasions to intervene but I always held back on the basis that it would be unfair to my successor to comment on issues of which I had an intimate knowledge.  However, I break my silence to speak on this Bill because of the special background to the 1994 Bill.  Particular sections of that Bill were the product of the deal worked out between Fianna Fáil and Labour after the famous Baldonnel summit to facilitate the Labour Party in exchange for Harry Whelehan's appointment.</P>
    <P>My colleagues, Deputies Cowen and Dempsey, worked long and hard to agree additional proposals for inclusion in the Bill.  At Labour's insistence, the then Bill provided for a series of statutory procedures which had to be followed before a person could be appointed to the Bench.  In the main, these procedures involved the Presidents of each of the courts having a significant say in who could be nominated to their courts.  The 1994 Bill also <Col N="26" /> included the establishment of a new court of appeal which would greatly free up the Supreme Court and enable it to concentrate on giving quality and well researched judgments on significant issues before it.</P>
    <P>I am greatly concerned about the statement the Minister made yesterday evening that section 8 which allows the Chief Justice to allocate the business of the court will help to promote &ldquo;consistent decisions&rdquo; in the vitally important areas of the law bearing on the Constitution. Will the Minister tell the House what she understands &ldquo;consistent decisions&rdquo; to mean.  Does she mean she would prefer a different decision from the latest decision on the McKenna case, for example?  As we all know, it is dangerous to talk about interference in any way with the courts of the land.  If the Government is looking for consistent decisions, in what way will it insist that judges give it those kinds of decisions?</P>
    <P>What do we have now from the Minister and the Government?  We have a charter for political patronage on a scale hitherto unknown in appointments to the courts.  Worse than that, it has taken a year to produce this appalling piece of work to enable this discredited Government fix up its friends.  Imagine the howls of the Labour Party in protest and derision if Fianna Fáil in Government had produced this Bill.  Labour, of course, perpetuates the fiction that it is somehow above fixing up its pals when the record shows it has no equal in looking after its diminishing band of friends and supporters.</P>
    <P>Why has it taken the Minister so long to produce this document and to give it a cloak of respectability as this Government's contribution to judicial and courts reform?  Twelve months ago I left a perfectly sensible Bill which could have been amended during its passage through the House.  Debate on that Bill commenced on 2 November last.  I suspect we would never have seen the Bill before us had my party agreed to a Government proposition some two weeks ago to take one particular section <Col N="27" /> of this Bill in isolation and pass all Stages of it in both Houses of the Oireachtas within a week.  When the Government was reminded that the full courts Bill was ready, it was then and only then that the Government agreed to publish it.</P>
    <P>I have to wonder aloud whose pal was being fixed up under the particular section involved.  I can picture the scene in the Minister's modest office in Stephen's Green.  The Minister, the programme manager and the civil servants are present.  The Bill is completed and the staff, rightly so, are elated when suddenly a tall, bespectacled gentleman appears as if by magic, shaking his finger at the Minister and warning, &ldquo;No, no, this will not be published until I say so&rdquo;.  A helpless Minister, a rather confused and deeply upset programme manager and shell shocked, tired civil servants are rendered powerless.  Yes, I remember it well.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to specific elements of the Bill.  Why should the retirement age, for example, be any different from that which applies generally across the public and private sector?  I said that over a year ago and I still believe it.  I had a preference at that time for 65 but I asked here on 2 November last for Deputies' views.  I agree with what Deputy Jim O'Keeffe said in relation to moving towards a common retirement age.  That might be the better option to take at this stage but at column 1407, volume 446 of the Official Report, Deputy Gay Mitchell stated: &ldquo;However, whatever age is allowed &mdash; and I certainly would not support going beyond 67 years &mdash; there should not be an extension unless for exceptional reasons ...&rdquo;.  At column 1431 of the same volume of the Official Report, Deputy Gilmore stated:</P>
    <P>The way to make a distinction is to appoint judges for a fixed term.  The problem with judicial appointments is not the age at which judges retire, but rather the length of time they sit on the Bench.  The principle of seven <Col N="28" /> year terms which is now acceptable for senior appointments in the public service needs to be looked at as it would have the additional advantage of providing for a turnover of judges, allow younger people to sit on the Bench and given that the question of gender balance has been introduced to the debate, might also allow a greater proportion of women to sit on the Bench.</P>
    <P>What happened to all those wonderful propositions made by two Deputies who are now in influential positions in the Government, one working in the Taoiseach's Department and the other working particularly closely to his party Leader who has a significant influence on Government policy?</P>
    <P>I regret that all the Minister has done with this Bill in 12 months is to remove the independent element from the appointments procedures to replace it with three of her own appointments.  I presume &mdash; and I am sure the Minister will clarify this when responding to the debate &mdash; that &ldquo;three&rdquo; means one Fine Gael, one Labour and one Democratic Left appointment.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that in due course these appointments will be trumpeted as the very essence of independence and now the Attorney General is also to be a member of the board.  Will the Minister, when responding, explain to the House how the Attorney General can give impartial advice to Cabinet subsequently as to the suitability or otherwise of a particular candidate being recommended by the Minister for Justice for appointment when the same Attorney General will have been party of the selection-rejection process from day one?  That is not openness, transparency or accountability.  That particular pane of glass which was heralded so much a year ago is either terribly fogged up or we were talking about stained glass, not a clear pane.  Perhaps former Fine Gael Deputies or Senators, not to speak of friends of Labour or Democratic Left, will be fixed up.  Perhaps there is a former Attorney General on <Col N="29" /> the sideline or is he being lined up for something much bigger to reflect his undoubted experience in advocacy?</P>
    <P>It is appropriate that the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, is present in the Chamber because I want to cite a contribution he made on 2 November 1994. The Minister of State is an expert in quoting what people said in the past and I am delighted he is in the Chamber to hear this.  At column 1587, volume 446 of the Official Report, Deputy Durkan stated:</P>
    <P>I worry about what will happen in the future.  Will people be nominated on the basis of whether they are of the political left, right or centre?  If so it will lend itself to endless complications in the future.  No matter what happens in the future there will always be the possibility of somebody pointing the finger, in the aftermath of a particular appointment, and suggesting that those who sat on the Bench at a particular time were on one or other side of the political divide. I do not recall that happening before.  The Government has set the scene and the agenda for this and it will have to live with it.  The Government should apologise to the Judiciary for the damage it has done.</P>
    <P>One could read the very same comment today and it would be far more true in these circumstances than it ever was on 2 November 1994.  Paper does not refuse ink and the Official Report tells only the truth.</P>
    <P>This Government's interpretation of openness, transparency and accountability is that the judicial appointments board will be required to submit to Cabinet all the names of those it has considered and to recommend no fewer than ten as suitable for appointment.  In the event of two vacancies arising in the same court, the Minister can ask for any number of recommendations.  Therefore, if there were two vacancies in the same court the Minister could, hypothetically, ask them to nominate, say, 100, 200 or 300 people.  I am sure that among all the Fine Gaelers involved in <Col N="30" /> the legal profession around the country there might be several hundred quite suitable for appointment and there would be a never ending list of people who could benefit from political patronage.</P>
    <P>Whom does the Government think it is fooling?  A cynic might say the Minister's hand is not being exactly stayed. The Minister wants to have her cake and eat it while pretending she is lifting the veils of secrecy and mystery surrounding a vital area of Irish society.  To make matters worse, there are those in the so-called liberal media whom she counts among her friends who will gravely not acquiescence in her direction. I am thinking of the paragons and guarantors of everything that is good for society.</P>
    <P>The Minister had the barefaced cheek to state in the press statement that her proposals were more transparent.  Perhaps she would be good enough to tell the House about the Government's appointments to the Bench since it took office.  She might also mention the names of the successful candidates.  Is my memory failing me or did I read somewhere that a couple of former high profile Fine Gael Party activists are now on the Bench?  I wish them well and I am sure they are admirably qualified for the difficult and hazardous work they have undertaken.  However, one can only imagine the shouts of &ldquo;cronyism&rdquo; or &ldquo;cosy cartel&rdquo; the Labour Party would embark upon if it was in Opposition and these appointments were made by either of the two major political parties. The party of high standards my eyeball, it is more like the party of expediency and manipulation.  Those two virtues will reap a very large whirlwind.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Durkan, is looking forward as much as I am to the reaping of that whirlwind.  Thank God for the innate sense of the electorate who do not suffer the myopia of some of the Government's friends in positions of influence.  The justice of democracy is that a vote in Dublin 4 is worth no more than a vote in Carraroe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="31" /> During Second Stage debates on such Bills one obviously has to make a general statement and, with the exception of the provisions on the retirement age, the appointments boards and other particular concerns, there is very little opportunity to refer to individual aspects.  Nevertheless there is a number of provisions worth referring to.</P>
    <P>I have great concerns about the proposal to make the Attorney General a member of the selection board as it will not be possible when the appointment comes to Government for him to be judge and jury on the candidates.  In the case of appointments to local authorities the county manager or county secretary who makes the ultimate recommendation on the appointment will not have been a member of the original selection board; a member of another local authority will be on it.  I laughed when I read the Minister's statement that: &ldquo;Requiring the appointments board to recommend only three to five names as proposed in the 1994 Bill would restrict unduly the Government's discretion in the matter of judicial appointments&rdquo;.  I presume this refers to political discretion and that she and the Government felt there was a great political restriction on them in that they were not allowed to have more than five nominees recommended to them.</P>
    <P>We should acknowledge that the present system for selecting persons for appointment to judicial office has served us well.  We have been very fortunate to have a Judiciary which is respected for its integrity, independence and fairness.  However, this does not mean that the system for appointing judges is immune from criticism.  It may be inevitable that the system is open to criticism as up to now the procedure has been reserved exclusively for Government and there have been no clear accompanying statutory or other guidelines on how the system should operate.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill which I am delighted to say my party forced out of the Government when it refused to take the selective provision which it wanted <Col N="32" /> to take very quickly.  I look forward to seeing the amendments put down by Fianna Fáil.  I am interested in seeing how those Deputies in positions of importance on the other side of the House who recommended such amendments in Opposition will vote on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeymourCrawford" hpid="Mr. Crawford Mr. Crawford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Crawford</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on its introduction. Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn's contribution was reasonably amusing in that she referred to remarks made by certain individuals.  She has more experience than me in the House and I have no intention of digging through the numerous tomes to find remarks made by certain people.  However, I remember some of the remarks made by Deputies on all sides of the House both before and since I became Deputy.  I am referring to remarks made during the beef tribunal and other sagas.</P>
      <P>I have an interest in how the courts work, how the information is given to them and how the costs arise.  It is very important from the point of view of victims in personal injuries cases and others that justice is seen to be done.  In cases where there are long delays victims can get very depressed and they can develop a bad attitude to the courts. The Minister and her predecessor endeavoured to improve the operation of the courts and to ensure that cases are taken at the earliest possible date. If, say, personal injury cases are not ready to be taken in court on a certain day they are automatically put back for six months.  This is very annoying for the victims and is one of the reasons claims for personal injuries are so high &mdash; the victims get frustrated, dig in their heels and demand the highest possible compensation which is usually paid three or four years after the accident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many reasons we need to improve court procedures.  People who have been beaten up in their homes and elsewhere want the criminals to be brought to justice as quickly as possible. Members on all sides of the House must work towards improving the system.  I <Col N="33" /> know the Minister is doing her best in this regard and it is only correct that Opposition Deputies should put down proper and well constructed amendments to the Bill.  We should not play politics with the victims of crime who have suffered severely.</P>
    <P>Judges must adopt a commonsense approach to cases and in this regard I welcome the proposal on judicial training. It is difficult to understand why one judge may impose a severe penalty for the non-payment of car tax while another judge may impose a less severe penalty for the same offence.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the retirement age of those involved in the administration of justice.  It is difficult to understand why the retirement age for judges is not similar to that for people in business or civil servants.  Once people reach a certain age they may not be able to fully understand the complexities of certain cases or the problems associated with them.  The Minister must tackle this issue, the delays in taking cases and the level of justice meted out.  Justice delayed is justice denied.  This applies not only to cases involving personal injury but also to those involving people in business.  In many cases business people are slow to go to court because they know it will take years to have their case resolved.  Some people get away with less than honest dealings because they know there is little likelihood they will be brought to court.  This is why the Minister's proposals to tackle the problem of delays by appointing 17 more judges, initiating changes in court administration and developing a long-term approach to improving the system are very important.  The elimination of delays will enhance the efficiency of the court service.  The Minister has set out very important principles in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have seen the effects of long delays in hearing a case.  In one case the family bread winner was put out of business as a result of an accident and he had to wait three-and-a-half years for his case <Col N="34" /> to be resolved due to all sorts of technicalities. In another case involving farmers' rights, the case has been put back for years and farmers do not know if they will ever get their entitlement.  The then Minister Mr. John Wilson said some eight years ago that it was a complete injustice to farmers that they were not paid at that time, yet for technical reasons that case has not come to court.</P>
    <P>The cost of the beef tribunal brought the high cost of court hearings to everybody's notice.  Possibly that case should have never gone to court and should have been sorted out in this House, but it did go to court and everybody is paying ever since.  Nobody seems to know whether it cost £25 million or £35 million but taxpayers have to pay this colossal sum.  As a result the European Commission will ensure that we will pay fines for breaches of beef processing regulations.</P>
    <P>The administration of the courts is very relevant to taxpayers.  The Minister has appointed a working group under the chairmanship of Mrs. Justice Susan Denham and this is extremely important.  I am against the setting up of committees for the sake of it but we need to take a completely new look at how the court system works.  I hope this group will come forward with proposals and realistic suggestions on how to streamline the system and make it easier for people to have access to the courts. Delays in court hearings and the high costs of going to court are interlinked. Those who are well off can afford to go to court and employ a senior and junior counsel as well as a solicitor but many people are slow to seek justice because of the high cost and extraordinary delays involved.  When a case goes to the High Court, two senior counsel, one junior counsel as well as the solicitor are involved, together with all sorts of advisers and the cost of one or two days in court can be enormous.</P>
    <P>The Minister has appointed a body that will decide on the appointment of judges.  That issue was discussed already in the 1994 Act but the Minister has taken a major step forward.  For <Col N="35" /> Members to suggest that previous Governments were innocent of political appointments in every area would be an injustice.  Down through the years political appointments have been made and I agree with the previous speaker that it is not wrong that some of those involved in politics should be appointed to boards and committees.  People who avoid becoming involved in party politics would find it very difficult to understand how the system works and what is required of a judge.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has set up a board to decide on who should become a judge and that only those of the highest calibre will be chosen.</P>
    <P>The courts will have to deal with the consequences of drugs.  If we are to apprehend and bring drug barons to justice we need to speed up the court system. Families are afraid to allow their teenage children go to discos or out in the evening in case they get involved in drug related activities.  When their offspring are out they anxiously wait up until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. to see they return home safely.  This problem has not happened over night but results from the lack of legal mechanisms to put drug barons in jail.  I want to ensure that their case cannot be transferred from one court to another or from one area to another as a way of avoiding the arm of the law.  The only way that parents can be sure their offspring are safe is when the drug barons are caught and are quickly brought to justice as this serves as an example to others who might get involved in drug related activities.</P>
    <P>The distinguished journalists will be glad I am not talking about silage or effluent today but about the state of courthouses.  It is important that courthouse buildings are up to a certain standard. In Monaghan the courthouse is in very good condition because as Members may realise the old courthouse was blown up and was not in use for many years.</P>
    <P>As a result of that tragedy, the courthouse was reconstructed and is now one of the finest in the country.  The <Col N="36" /> Government has allocated funding for the repair of the Carrickmacross Courthouse but the courthouse in Castleblayney, where the District and Circuit Court sits, is in a deplorable condition. As the Minister proposes to increase the number of judges who will sit in these buildings, she should ensure they are kept in proper repair.  The courthouses in Clones and Ballybay are also in need of urgent repair.  As the Border region suffered a great deal due to the Northern troubles, a case can be made for the provision of additional funding for the repair of courthouses in the area.</P>
    <P>Courthouses should be used more than one day per month.  I urge the Minister to encourage people to use them for community activities when courts are not sitting.  If that were the case appearing before a court would not be a traumatic experience for people who are often scared by the grandeur of the buildings and the wigs worn by judges.</P>
    <P>Seven farmers in my constituency were brought before a local court for pollution offences.  As two of their farms were included on one deed map the solicitor involved was able to use the same details for both farmers, but the farmers incurred astronomical costs.  Will the Minister examine the position whereby extraordinary costs are added to nominal fines?  This happens in many cases, not all of which involve farmers.  It is unacceptable that in a case where seven farmers pleaded guilty to offences the solicitor concerned should have received approximately £600 for each five minute case.  I make that plea as a farmer representative.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's proposal to increase the number of judges and the realistic measures proposed to cut the costs involved in court cases.  As a result, I hope that justice is done in a more proper and expedient manner.</P>

      <P>As a rural Deputy I am reassured by Deputy Crawford's expertise and thorough knowledge of silage effluent and so on.  We need many more Members like him, particularly when <Col N="37" /> approximately 10,000 farmers marched outside the House yesterday to highlight concerns about their livelihoods.  The increasing crime level is a major concern for most people in the city.  To date judicial appointments were political, made by the incumbent Government, and that system served us well.  While the majority of those appointed had political leanings, excellent judges have been appointed with expert knowledge and experience who have gained respect in the profession.  The public has more confidence in the present judicial system than in the system of appointing directors to semi-State boards, a system that has been the subject of adverse comment for many years, and not merely because of recent events.  It, rather than the judicial system which has served us well, should be thoroughly examined.  I do not believe the manner in which our judges have carried out their duties under the existing system can be criticised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill was conceived in Baldonnel. The gestation period was considerably longer than nine months and we have been presented with a different version of the 1994 Bill.  The present proposals try to convey an impression of the removal of political patronage from the judicial appointments system.  While all judges must be appointed by the President on the advice of the Government, the present proposals are an exercise in smoke and mirrors in that they will be heralded as an attempt by the Government to restore the much vaunted aspiration of openness and transparency in the appointments system.  The spin doctors will spew out media and press releases trying to convey that the proposals are an attempt to depoliticise the appointments system.  This anti-cosy cartel tripartite arrangement by the clever use of an appointments board will no doubt attempt once again to regain the high moral ground of political propriety by suggesting that the provisions dealing with judicial appointments and the other provisions of the Bill will have a radical effect on the administration of <Col N="38" /> justice, increase its efficiency and reduce legal costs and delays.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil proposals of 1994 were more sound and transparent than the present proposals which require all applicants who respond to advertisements, or who have been invited to apply, to have notice of their applications submitted to the Minister for Justice and the board shall recommend at least ten names for appointment to judicial office.  The Government is obliged to consider only the recommended names but there is no statutory prohibition, nor could there be, which would prevent the Government advising the President of its intention to appoint a person whose name might or might not be on the list.  Members on this side asked why a list with a minimum of ten names should have to be submitted.  If members of the public read the Official Report of this debate they will not be impressed by the suggestions that there will be more independence attached to the appointment of judges and that they will be further removed from the political system than heretofore.</P>
    <P>Sections 29 and 30 provide for the appointment of solicitors of ten years standing or more as judges in the Circuit Court.  Appointment of solicitors to the High or Supreme Courts is not permissible under this Bill.  The Minister, who through the Government has unfettered power of appointment, should not limit the appointment of solicitors only to the Circuit Court.  I appreciate that the appointment of a solicitor to the Circuit Court will be heralded as a legal first, whenever that happens.  With increased specialisation in the law many solicitors, particularly in large practices in this city, are divided into distinct legal departments. They have tremendous specialised legal knowledge and should not be excluded from consideration as to their suitability for appointment to the High Court.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge the expert knowledge of Deputy Shatter in family law.  He was one of the first people in Ireland &mdash; over 20 years ago in 1974 &mdash; to produce a leading practitioner's book on family <Col N="39" /> law.  Equally, people with expert knowledge in construction, arbitration and commercial law should be considered, as well as barristers from the Law Library, for appointment to the High Court.</P>
    <P>The provision of appointments to the Circuit Court does not go far enough and the Minister should consider widening it to include the High Court because she may not have the opportunity to do so again for many years.</P>
    <P>I agree with the general principle and thrust of the Bill's provisions if political temptation can be controlled and the bona fides of section 16 can be implemented.  The public should be assured that briefless barristers and &ldquo;down on their luck&rdquo; solicitors &mdash; perhaps because of their time-consuming political activity &mdash; will in future find it more difficult to be assured of a sinecure because of their strenuous efforts in supporting a political party before appointment.</P>
    <P>The section leaves a lot to be desired. As Deputy O'Donnell stated, it could be interpreted simply as a post-box in which to leave your application, rather than applying to the Department of Justice as heretofore.  There is nothing in the section which indicates that the board will prioritise the suitability of candidates in any particular order.  The political antenna is retained by the Minister in ensuring that three persons appointed by her are members of the board.  Nothing in section 16 suggests a list of nominating bodies who could put forward the names of suitable persons who subsequently could be narrowed down to three for appointment by the Minister.  This provision, which has been commented on by all speakers on this side of the House, will have to be looked at seriously by the Minister if she wants this Bill to go through with the degree of credibility necessary for us to support her in ensuring that the idea behind this appointments board is achieved.</P>
    <P>The provision which requires persons to undertake training or education <Col N="40" /> courses on appointment as judges is sound in principle.  Despite the fact that judges at all levels operate at the coal face, on many occasions there has been a lack of consistency in sentencing policy. Furthermore, district justices and Circuit Court judges require every possible resource to ensure that consistent principles are applied, particularly to family law cases.  The administration of justice is brought into disrepute when a huge variation in sentencing or otherwise is apparent in decisions handed down by various courts.</P>
    <P>We are all aware that some judges are described as being more generous than others in dealing with personal injury claims or other types of action.  Defendants can fare poorly before a certain judge if they appear on speeding or drink-driving offences.  The decisions of a certain senior High Court judge have even been described as practically unappealable due to their soundness, but what does that mean for other High Court judges?  Do their decisions &mdash; depending on whether they are reversed on appeal to the Supreme Court &mdash; allow barristers to advise clients that one judge is soft or another judge is hard?</P>

      <P>The section is long on aspiration but short on specifics.  Where are the resources to provide these courses?  Sending 50 district justices off to Tinakilly House for an induction or training session will not be small beer. May be this is more smoke and mirrors, especially if the Minister and her Department fail to give staff and resources to the presidents of the various courts to implement this important provision which I fully support.  It is a well established system in England and in other common law jurisdictions and it must be attempted here in a serious fashion if public confidence in the administration of justice is to be maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="41" /> I referred to family law cases and the appointment of extra judges will help in expediting the huge delays now apparent at all levels of our courts system. This, with what appears to be an extensive list of orders that can be made by a county registrar, is a move in the right direction.  There are long delays in the Circuit Court civil list which can be exacerbated by solicitors or barristers wishing to delay further the moment of justice for their clients.  Frivolous procedural points can often throw a case back by months, sometimes even years, with serious consequences for the individual or company seeking justice.</P>
    <P>The granting of these additional powers to county registrars is welcome and I am sure that the Bar Council and the Law Society may comment on the adequacy of the list.  The Minister should have an open mind on further orders that could be made by a county registrar if they are submitted for consideration on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The list, primarily of procedural type motions, should in practice result in reducing legal costs as quite a number of them can now be applied for within the competency of any solicitor.  That will save barristers' costs in appearing before a Circuit Court judge.  More importantly it would have the effect of ensuring that the list of cases indicated as ready for hearing would proceed the day on which they are listed.  Having plaintiffs, defendants, their witnesses and experts hanging around courthouses is not an exercise for the fainthearted. Many people return home without having had their day in court because of procedural wrangling between opposing legal teams on a day that, generally speaking, runs only from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m.  Anything that ensures cases are heard expeditiously is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Granting these extra powers to county registrars must be matched with a recognition of the conditions under which some county registrars and their staff have to work.  Some of the orders referred to will require the appearance of teams of solicitors, and barristers if <Col N="42" /> necessary, and their clients before county registrars.  Unlike the taxation of costs which county registrars do, without the necessity of most of the above to make an appearance before them, their offices in nearly all cases are totally unsuitable if all or some of the above have to appear before the registrar.</P>
    <P>On the technological front the housekeeping of most county registrars' offices has improved with the provision of fax machines, computers and photocopiers. However, the physical space occupied by county registrars and their staff is totally inadequate.  Some courthouses have been renovated and excellent work has recently been done to substantially improve Galway courthouse.  I pay tribute to the previous Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who committed substantial moneys towards improving the Galway complex which has been much admired.  It is very necessary for such a busy place and is the venue for decisions of the High Court.</P>
    <P>I wish to be parochial for a moment in referring to the situation in Castlebar which is abominable and intolerable, to say the least.  It must be improved if the staff of the Circuit Court office is to provide the public with a service as well as giving back-up to the administration so necessary for justice.  If the situation is bad in Castlebar, words could not describe the facilities available to the staff of the District and Circuit Court offices using Swinford and Westport courthouses.</P>
    <P>Our county manager is in the course of preparing a substantial plan &mdash; which will be submitted shortly to the Department of Justice &mdash; for the renovation of County Mayo's main courthouse in Castlebar.  Throughout the country and in particular in my own county, the Department of Justice has provided the capital funding necessary to improve some of our courthouses &mdash; not to the standard that they require to be brought up to but it is certainly a big improvement on what they were like.  The plan for Castlebar will be costly but it should be responded to because it is badly needed if the county registrar's office is <Col N="43" /> to give effect to the additional new powers granted to it under this Bill.  It will also ensure that the public will be comfortable in that courthouse.  I hope the plan will not gather dust in some file in the Department of Justice for years to come.  We must provide the necessary facilities to ensure the trauma experienced by those involved in such cases is lessened and that the stress experienced by litigants is not added to by the State failing to provide a suitably sized hearing room, waiting room, consultation rooms and basic sanitary facilities.  In most rural courthouses there is only one room which is used by litigants of both sexes.  That is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>The responsibility of a Government does not cease with the establishment of one courthouse in each county.  Article 34 of the Constitution provides, <i>inter alia,</i> that the courts of first instance shall also include local and limited jurisdiction. It has been interpreted as referring not only to District Courts but to Circuit Courts.  Some time ago the Circuit Court review working group considered drastically reducing the number of Circuit Court venues.  I am not sure of the up to date position but the proposals will be strenuously opposed.  The issue was reported extensively in the media less than 12 months ago and perhaps the Minister will advert to it when replying.</P>
    <P>The proposal that a barrister shall not wear a wig deserves comment.  It has been suggested that such archaic head dress is intimidatory, places barristers on a different level from solicitors and interferes with the relationship of persons in the court in an unquantifiable way which affects the public's ease in using the courts.  Barristers frequently appear at tribunals, planning appeals and inquiries dressed in business suits. Our judicial system is adversarial by nature.  A barrister has a job to do on behalf of his client subject to the rules of conduct of the court and Bar Council. If they can operate effectively outside <Col N="44" /> the court in other venues without wearing ceremonial garb, why does the Minister not also prohibit the wearing of a gown?  I presume the Minister is responding to a perceived public demand by prohibiting the wearing of a wig and, if there was an opnion poll, I am sure the public would be consistent and demand the removal of the gown.  I have no objection to the wearing of wigs or gowns but the prohibition will be a puff of smoke unless the Minister is consistent and prohibits the wearing of gowns.  I can imagine a barrister, for example, Deputy McDowell, chasing into court laden down with legal tomes and billowing gown would have the same perceived effect on the defendant or plaintiff as the wearing of a wig.</P>
    <P>On balance this Bill is tinkering with a system long overdue for overhaul.  The administration of justice and the separation of the executive and judicial arms of the State has not evolved to the stage necessary to cope with the demands placed on the system.  Unless the public are assured that criminals will be dealt with expeditiously and severely the Bill will be seen as window dressing.  They are up in arms about the alarming increase in crime and the near absolute certainty that an increasingly larger proportion of criminals carry on their activities undetected.  The public demand action, an increase in available prison accommodation and that a stop be put to the revolving door prison policy.</P>
    <P>The Bill will reduce court delays but where is the corresponding commitment to ensure that those who are apprehended and convicted will serve the sentence imposed on them?  The Minister failed to assure the public on the issue and this Bill does not lessen the palpable fear in the community.  The message must go out from the House that we are serious in dealing with crime.  Lip service is no longer sufficient and will not be tolerated by taxpayers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesFlanagan" hpid="Mr. Flanagan Mr. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to Deputy Hughes' contribution with interest and agree with most of what he said.  I did <Col N="45" /> not hear him declare his interest under the Ethics in Public Office Bill.  I declare my interest, being a member of the legal profession.  It gives me no joy to say that in 1987 I went from the most unpopular profession to the second most unpopular one &mdash; from the legal to the political. I hope this Bill will redress the balance. As legislators we must facilitate the proper and efficient administration of justice by making appropriate amendments to legislation and ensuring proper resources are made available.</P>
      <P>I will defer much of my comment until Committee Stage.  I am pleased the Bill will come before the Select Committee on Legislation and Security and look forward to the debate and the presence of the Minister at that forum.</P>
      <P>Almost every speaker commented on the unsatisfactory delays in the courts system.  The old adage that justice delayed is justice denied is an unfortunate reality of the administration of justice as we approach the end of the century. I am pleased the programme for Government includes reference to a fundamental review of the courts system. This legislation will go no small way towards ensuring that review will pay dividends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the long overdue appointment of 17 new judges.  Two are being appointed to the High Court, two to the Supreme Court, seven to the Circuit Court and five to the District Court.  I congratulate the Minister on the appointments, particularly the seven to the Circuit Court.  That is where most administrative difficulties and delays occur.  There has been an increase in business in that court in the last ten years.  The Circuit Court hears much about the criminal workload, family law cases and civil cases.  I regret that the delay in getting a case to a court hearing is approximately three years.  That is unjustifiable in a modern western democracy.  We should set a time limit within which delays should be reduced. I will give details of figures I received from the County Registrar in County Laois &mdash; a county no different from any <Col N="46" /> other rural area.  In 1983, 620 applications were brought before the Circuit Court covering crime, civil bills, equity, matrimonial matters, District Court appeals, motions and miscellaneous matters, licensing, landlord and tenant valuation appeals and applications under other headings.  By 1993 this figure had reached 2,000.  This indicates the huge workload which has to be borne by the Circuit Court.  As well as having far more and different types of cases to deal with, over a period of years its jurisdiction has been increased.  This, in no small way, has added to the burden. Following the passing of the divorce rederendum and the enactment of the consequent legislation it is plain to see that it will have to carry an even greater burden so far as the administration of family law is concerned.  The appointment of seven judges, although welcome, will only go some of the way towards ensuring that a proper and consumer friendly administration of justice scheme is put in place.</P>
    <P>The current system under which many Circuit Courts sit from 11 a.m. until 4.30 p.m. or 5 p.m., Tuesday to Friday is detrimental to the fair administration of justice.  The long vacation whereby the courts close down from the end of July or early August until early October is a relic of a bygone era, it is both outmoded and unjustifiable and contributes in large measure to delays in the administration of justice.  This practice cannot be allowed to continue. While I accept that some judges operate an efficient court which is consumer oriented, unfortunately, this is not true of other pillars of the judiciary.  It is time they stepped down from their ivory towers and entered the real world.</P>
    <P>The legal calendar and work diary of the courts can be sharply contrasted with that of this House.  During the past five years our work diary has been changed considerably with the introduction of longer sittings and the committee system.  We were forced to do this by the general public who felt that the House was not sitting often enough and <Col N="47" /> we were not congratulated or complimented for so doing although I presume it was never intended that we would. The legal diary has to be subjected to the same level of reform.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that as most judges live in Dublin they need Monday free to travel to the provinces.  This is, undoubtedly, a relic of the past when it took a considerable amount of time to travel from Dublin to the provinces by coach and four.  Regrettably, Monday is still regarded as a day off and a day on which Circuit Court judges do not sit on the Bench.  This, in many ways, contributes to delays.</P>
    <P>The report of the review body on civil jurisdiction in England published in 1988 comments on the question of delays far more succinctly than I could. It states:</P>
    <P>Delay undermines justice, it reduces the availability of evidence and erodes the reliability of that which is available.  It denies compensation to those who are entitled to it until long after it is most needed.  It causes continuing personal stress, anxiety and financial hardship to ordinary people and their families.  It may induce economically weaker parties to accept unfair settlements and it also frustrates the efficient conduct of commerce and industry.</P>
    <P>One could add that it also increases the costs involved.  It is because of this that we should, through this legislation and the working party which the Minister has established, tackle the question of the extraordinary and unacceptable delays in the courts system.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 48 which deals with the question of education and training of new judges.  This is extremely important.  Prior to taking up their positions appointees should not feel embarrassed about being asked to undergo training.  The comment was made among legal sources that if there was a statutory obligation to undergo training only the mediocre would accept appointments.  That, to say the least, is <Col N="48" /> an arrogant statement.  It is common sense to provide for an element of induction training for someone working behind a desk one day and, without any great notice, catapulted to the Bench the next.  In such circumstances training is absolutely essential.  Most of the likely candidates, and those whose names are appearing on the list to which Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn referred, would not find this repugnant.</P>
    <P>It is a pity there is no reference to the redrawing of the circuits.  This is essential given that the Circuit Court only sits one week per quarter in the provinces. The figures I have given highlight the great need for improvement.  The redrawing of the circuits should be considered to ensure equity.  This would help to reduce delays.</P>
    <P>It was argued in the House some years ago that juries were responsible for the high level of awards in civil actions which, in turn, gave rise to high insurance costs.  After much debate it was decided to abolish juries in personal injury actions, but this has not made any difference, insurance costs and the level of awards have not been reduced.  This is an indication of how we, as legislators, and the Department of Justice can, not so much get it wrong, as fail to get it right.  We made this a priority and committed ourselves to achieving results which, unfortunately, have been most disappointing.</P>
    <P>There is reference to the role of the county registrar in section 33 which is an interesting one.  The county registrar is one of the most under-utilised assets in the justice system.  The twelfth interim report of the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure recommended changes in legislation to allow county registrars deal with non-contentious applications, the signing of cheques, pre-trial applications and some motions and, in short, that the county registrar should be on a par with the Master of the High Court.  This is envisaged in section 33.  I would go further, however, and suggest that the county registrar could, in effect, play a role as a deputy judge.  I will pursue this matter <Col N="49" /> further with the Minister on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The under-utilisation of the county registrar is underlined by the fact that that official cannot sign a cheque, he either has to send it to the judge's home or else ask the judge to call in the next time he is passing.  This is extraordinary. I know the Minister will change this.  It is a small reform which is long overdue.</P>
    <P>Deputies asked for a uniform retirement age of 65 for judges.  I do not agree with this.  The Minister has achieved the right balance in changing the retirement ages of High Court and Supreme Court judges from 72 to 70.  Many judges are not appointed until they are in their late 50s or early 60s and many sound landmark court decisions have been made by expert judges in their early to mid 60s.</P>
    <P>The working group on the courts commission, under Mrs. Justice Denham, is welcome.  The Minister should have set a time scale within which the commission should report, but regardless of the report it produces, more legislation is needed.  I do not see this as a comprehensive Bill but an interim measure to be followed up after the publication of the report of the working group which I expect to report within the lifetime of the Government and hope will report before the end of next year.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the system which the commission will have to examine is the separation of criminal work from civil work.  The former is given priority in the Circuit Court and this is right and proper but this ensures that civil work is left behind. Included in the civil list is the area of family law.  It is not good enough that Fridays are designated to deal with family law, at the end of a busy week when criminal cases and, if the time allows, some civil cases are dealt with.  Friday is not a suitable day for family law cases. There should be a separate family law court structure with family law sittings separate from civil and criminal work.  I am awaiting the final report of the Law Reform Commission on this issue which <Col N="50" /> I expect will be published sometime in 1996.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to speak about the huge costs with regard to expert witnesses and the need to change the law of evidence.  While people have been critical of legal costs in court proceedings &mdash; maybe rightly so &mdash; we often forget the huge costs with regard to medical and engineering witnesses and evidence required to adjudicate on cases such as striaghtforward tragic road accidents.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with fitness to practise. I fail to see why solicitors are unfit to practise in the High Court when barristers, as mere advocates, can gain automatic and exclusive right to that court. This is unfair and I see no reason for it.</P>
    <P>A television programme in the lead up to the divorce referendum dealt with inadequacies in the legal system.  It showed a courthouse, which I recognised as the one in Trim, in which a family law consultation was being held in a dungeon, on the door of which was nailed a notice which read &ldquo;male prisoners only&rdquo;.  This, in a nutshell, underlines the problems in the physical layout of courthouses.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I was glad of the opportunity to contribute to the debate on it.  I eagerly look forward to Committee Stage and I congratulate the Minister for taking the first step in the radical and fundamental reform promised in the Programme for Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanKenneally" hpid="Mr. Kenneally Mr. Kenneally">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenneally</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted this Bill has again come before the House, although I wonder about the delay.  I pay tribute to Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, who initiated this measure last year, for the work she put into it.  With the benefit of the Second Stage debate which she led last year and comprehensive discussions with interested bodies in the meantime, one would have expected that the Government could have done better but, alas, this is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Benjamin Disraeli once said that justice is truth in action.  If this is so, all citizens are entitled to their share of <Col N="51" /> truth.  On the other hand, James Matthew said that justice in England was open to all, like the Ritz Hotel.  That is not the kind of justice I want to see but a court which is accessible to everyone, free, independent and with impeccable integrity.</P>
    <P>I would like us to return in the near future to the court of appeal provisions which have been dropped from these new proposals and which were a large part of the 1994 Bill.  However, for the moment at least we should concentrate on the measure before us today.</P>
    <P>The proposal which will most capture the imagination of the public and fill the column inches of the newspapers is the setting up of a Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to advise the Government on appointments to the Judiciary. This is a necessary and overdue step, but I am disappointed the Minister has watered down the proposal to the point where the original intent is almost negated.</P>
    <P>Our 1994 proposal envisaged the board short-listing three to five names which would be communicated to the Government and from which it would make the final nomination.  This gained mixed reaction at the time and eliminated much of the party political element but maybe the common sense of it did not appeal to the Minister.  We now have a proposal to short-list ten names, which is too wide a choice.  The Minister seemed to be prepared to accept the principle that the previous method of selection was, at best, unwise and, at worst, open to abuse but she is now unwilling to grasp the nettle and limit the choice to a realistic number of nominees which does not immediately guarantee the inclusion of a nominee of the correct political persuasion.</P>
    <P>With regard to the retiring age for the Judiciary, judges are no different from the rest of the working population and should have the option of retiring from the age of 65.  The reduction of the mandatory retiring age to 70 goes part of the way to meet this and will help the career prospects of those up and coming <Col N="52" /> members of the legal profession who aspire to the Bench.</P>
    <P>The proposal to open up the Circuit Court Bench to solicitors is a welcome elimination of an unnecessary restriction and those solicitors who are able and qualified will be a welcome asset in a higher court.  However, as so often happens with this Government, it only goes so far and will not walk the final mile.  I cannot see why this concession is not also extended to the High Court and the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the proposal to make training courses mandatory for new judges.  This has been advocated for a long time by those who are close to the legal system and the operation of our courts.</P>
    <P>Correctly or not, the claim is often made that judges are out of touch with the real world.  In some respects this is not only true but is nurtured and encouraged by the system.  We expect the Judiciary to be independent and almost free of contact with the outside world but in order to achieve this judges seem to retreat from mainstream society, safe in their own legal world of work and social contact.</P>
    <P>Some will have come from modest backgrounds but 30 years in a relatively well paid profession, even at the level of solicitor, will have cushioned them against most of the economic hardships which many people experience.  As judges, they are daily cocooned from the normal everyday hardships average people encounter, down to even having a garda guide them into reserved parking spaces as they arrive for work.  I realise there are sound security reasons for this but it is symptomatic of how sheltered a life they live and how remote they are from the normal contacts of everyday life.  Many judges will never have known or will scarcely remember what it was like to be broke on a Thursday night, while most of their clients, at district level at least, will often not know the security and stability of a regular job and a steady income. Proper instruction and guidance by <Col N="53" /> sociologists among others, with a comprehensive range of education in the application of the law and a programme of sentencing guidelines, would not only result in a more effective Judiciary but would also make life much easier for judges.  It would eliminate much of the criticism levelled at the Bench of what are perceived as too lenient sentences. This is not a rebuke or a criticism but merely a comment on that matter.</P>
    <P>Judges should receive not only a comprehensive course of training but regular refresher courses.  Failure to recognise that is failure to acknowledge the pivotal role played by the Judiciary in society.  In the machinery of the law they are not only another cog in the wheel but the very axle on which the whole process turns.  Almost without exception the Judiciary have served this country in an exemplary manner, but there is always room for improvement.  The court system in any country is a very formal process, and a certain formality is not only welcome but necessary to maintain proper decorum and respect for and from those who pass through the system.</P>
    <P>The trappings of office, most notably visible in the wig and gown, were not only impressive but were, and were meant to be, stressful and intimidatory, mainly to defendants, which was unacceptable.  I welcome the abolition of wearing the wig but I am prepared to accept the gown as it is not so intimidating and underscores the formality of the proceedings.  Most people will have witnessed the wearing of a gown by teachers in schools and every courtroom seen on American TV shows a gowned judge who is capable of conducting business in a normal manner.  It would be foolish of us not to take every opportunity to update the manner in which our courts conduct their business.  While business and commerce make the best use of new technology for communication, office procedure, word processing and retrieval, so too must we bring the administration of justice not only into the 20th century but into the 21st century.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="54" /> We learned a very costly lesson in recent years in the Office of the Attorney General where not only thinking and attitudes were outmoded but also the procedures and systems.  We do not need a rerun of that elsewhere in our administration.  It is long past time when the effect of the introduction of new technology to our courts should have been assessed.  I realise we are making strides in that direction but much more needs to be done.  If the old legal maxim &ldquo;justice delayed is justice denied&rdquo; is true and I believe it is, we daily deny justice to those who have to wait years to have their cases heard. There is no reason that the operation of the courts should be so slow except that the service has been consistently denied proper funding and resources.</P>
    <P>The operation of the Planning and Development Acts is a case in point where people must be dealt with within a specified period of time.  In comparison to the courts that is a relatively stress-free system and the outcome will not be a jail term.  Courts should be required to be equally speedy, and with sufficient personnel and resources there is no reason they should not be.  For many people attending court it is probably their first and only time going through a very nerve-racking and stressful process.  They may be there to seek the discharge of a duty or defend an action from an innocent stance, but whatever the circumstances each person is entitled to a dignified hearing in dignified surroundings without the feeling that the system is pitted against them or that they will get less than their due.</P>
    <P>Often court surroundings are little testament that we cherish all the children of this national equally.  It must be very demeaning for people, often at the lower end of the economic scale, who find themselves trapped in successive court proceedings, with regular interviews with probation officers, to have to conduct their business in draughty corridors, hallways or even on the footpath, very often within the hearing of other litigants, legal representatives, gardaí and the general public.  Those people, <Col N="55" /> regardless of their wrongdoing, are entitled to their dignity as they go through the court system.  We must also improve the position for court officers who work daily in what are often trying conditions.</P>
    <P>Our legal system must be improved to the stage where people would be glad, particularly in civil cases, to go to court to have a dispute adjudicated upon. Instead of carrying what may be a particularly Irish stigma, &ldquo;he took me to court&rdquo;, our courts should be regarded as places of consultation and friendly resolution of problems in much the same way as a doctor's surgery provides solutions for those with medical problems. I suppose that is too much to hope for, but it is something to which we should aspire.  It happens in other countries with people's courts and so on.</P>
    <P>Many of the decisions made in the passage of this Bill will affect the ability of the courts to do their work and dispense justice during the next couple of decades.  We must be conscious that we have a duty to facilitate the dispensation of justice to the best of our ability, with the ordinary people in mind.  As Cicero said: &ldquo;the good of the people is the first law of all&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the increase in the number of judges available to the courts, but that goes only part of the way to solving the problem.  In the District Court there will be five extra judges, but without courthouses the increase is of little benefit.  Most District Courts share premises with the Circuit Court and when the two courts clash the District Court naturally loses out.  I am glad that in those circumstances in the Dungarvan district the judge seeks an alternative venue and holds his full schedule of sittings, and the local authority facilitates him in that regard.  That practice should be imitated countrywide, with sittings held on every occasion scheduled.  Likewise, when a lengthy criminal trial takes up the time of a Circuit Court judge his list of civil cases will inevitably fall behind, not only by a matter of weeks but sometimes a <Col N="56" /> year or more.  That is not good enough. There should be a number of judges available to pick up the slack and keep the wheels of justice in motion.</P>
    <P>The proposal to increase the number of Circuit Court judges from 17 to 24 is welcome but falls short of what is required.  That will improve but will not solve the problem.  The workload will still be too great, there will still be a queue for hearings and justice will still be delayed and denied.  Two extra judges are to be allocated to Dublin and one extra judge to Cork.  It would be logical to appoint a second judge to the four Circuit Court districts with large urban populations &mdash; the eastern district which takes the Dublin overflow, the south-eastern district, including the large urban area of Waterford, which serves the same population as the Cork district, the south-western district, including the city of Limerick, and the western circuit, including Galway.  The position in the other Circuit Court districts could be improved by providing the necessary floating judges.  If the Minister is to improve the system she should provide the extra personnel required to do a proper job.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of judges in the High Court and Supreme Court is also welcome, particularly as the additional judges allow for two sittings of the Supreme Court in most cases. That will have the effect of doubling the capacity of that court.  I urge the Minister to improve the position <i>pro rata</i> throughout the various courts.</P>
    <P>A feature of this Bill which is long overdue is the provision which will allow for some of the purely administrative functions of the Circuit Court to be discharged by county registrars.  That will be a major benefit for litigants and will assist in bringing cases to court in a much shorter time.  On that basis I urge the Minister to be generous and provide the necessary extra staff, resources and buildings to eliminate the lengthy delays.  That can be done and, if we are to be a humane and caring society, it must be done.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> In conjunction with a review of the workings of our courts it is advisable to consider the system of law and order.  I regret that the vista is less than satisfactory, with crime increasing not only in numerical size but in seriousness.  The only brightness on an otherwise dark horizon is the obvious benefit we have gleaned from the peace process.  I congratulate everybody who has worked towards the achievements in that regard.  Because of the delicacy of the ongoing negotiations I am hesitant to say much about that matter.  However, it would be wrong of me not to acknowledge the part which the Fianna Fáil Party, and its leader, played in breaking the initial impasse.  This country gained immensely from the early courageous actions of all sides of the traditional divide. Without those initiatives, many people would not be alive today.  There has been a huge economic spin-off which will grow as the years of peace pass.  I look forward to a time when violence of a paramilitary and pseudo-political nature is only a dim and painful memory.</P>
    <P>A threat which lurks on our streets and is as real, as sinister and as potent as any paramilitary threat is drugs.  The activities of the dealers and godfathers are a threat to and a corrupting influence in society.  I wonder if this serious crisis will lead to the decline and fall of western society.  We may not be suffering the worst of it yet, but as surely as the plane in a spiral will become wreckage on the ground so too will society disintegrate if this threat is not met head on and eliminated from our midst.</P>
    <P>There are 2,700 addicts in this city alone, but that figure does not take into account the number in jail, unregistered or who do not yet know or admit they have a problem.  What is the real figure for drug addiction here and what is the cost in human lives and misery?  What is the monetary cost as the addicts plunder to feed a habit they cannot control?  We must not only treat this as a huge problem, but as a major crisis in our midst.</P>
    <P>If we value our young people, whom we continually refer to as our greatest <Col N="58" /> national asset, we must take whatever steps are necessary to provide the legal framework, resources and personnel to counter this menace.  There are drugs of one description or another in every secondary school.  The appalling deaths on our streets in recent weeks indicate a different breed of criminal.  Such gun law and contempt for law and order must be met head on.  People must be protected from the godfathers and executioners in our midst.</P>
    <P>As we have seen from the successes of our gardaí and customs officials, whom I congratulate on their efforts to stem the tide, there are more drugs coming into this country than will be used here.  This is a European problem which must be fought through the combined efforts of EU and Irish officials and financed from EU resources.  We cannot hope to police the coastline with our complement of ships and aircraft. We must share this job with out European partners because it is as much in their interests as ours to eliminate or, at least, contain the drugs threat as much as possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister had the opportunity to put in place effective measures to deal with this horrendous problem but, unfortunately, she did not grasp it.  Her tenure has been a series of missed opportunities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelRing" hpid="Mr. Ring Mr. Ring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ring</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill as a further attempt to update the legal framework within which justice is administered.  The existing court structure was set up under the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, which was updated by the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Act, 1961.  However, Ireland today is different from that of 1961 and 1924.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If our democracy is to function, or the laws we enact are to have any meaning or EU regulations which are part of our legal system are to be given full effect and social change is to be effective then there must be a proper judicial framework within which the law is administered. However, the judicial framework <Col N="59" /> is grossly inadequate.  The public complain about long delays in hearing cases in courts, about out of date procedures and about a system which they do not understand.  People frequently blame the legal profession for these problems. However, credit is due to barristers and solicitors for putting up with such an inadequate system.  They work within a system which is the responsibility of this House.  They are not responsible for the delays, the out of date rules and procedures or the underfunding of the court system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the efforts of the Minister for Justice to overhaul the system by providing a new framework, additional personnel and more flexible rules.  This Bill is about the administration of justice, but it will not be successful unless the Government is prepared to fund the system which is underfunded.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to make funds available for the restoration and modernisation of all courthouses.  Procedures must be put in place to train judges and library research facilities and proper backup facilities for the legal profession must be provided in each county.  Staff must be properly trained to deal with the workload of the courts, particularly the increase in family law cases which will result from the divorce referendum.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in section 6 to increase the number of judges of the Supreme Court from five to eight.  I welcome section 7 which allows the Supreme Court to sit in two or more divisions.  The five judges assigned to the Supreme Court is the same number as that provided in the 1924 Act. However, the workload of the Supreme Court in 1995 is greater than that of the Supreme Court in 1924.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court is overburdened with civil appeals on High Court decisions, particularly in personal injury cases.  People must wait two or three years before their appeals are heard.  A system which puts such pressure on the Supreme Court and which causes such delays damages the courts' status and <Col N="60" /> brings its efficiency into disrepute.  Our courts should be able to operate without stress or strain.  People appearing before the courts should not have to tolerate such delays.  The court system is a service. However, it has been brought into disrepute due to the shortcomings in the legal system upon which it is based.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increase in the number of judges and the fact that the courts can now sit in a number of divisions.  This will greatly enhance its efficiency and enable it to organise its business more effectively.  I welcome the provisions in sections 9, 10 and 11 which increase the number of judges of the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court. Society is now less complacent and, therefore, the courts must carry an increasing workload.  This is evident in the area of family law.  At present, many judges deal with family law and other matters while under severe pressure.  A judge making a decision under pressure cannot administer justice properly.  I welcome these provisions which will take the pressure off our Judiciary and enable judges to give more time to individual cases.  That will benefit those who come before the courts and it will help the administration of justice.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider reorganising the workload of the courts. Simple road traffic offences should not be dealt with by the courts.  If a garda believes a person committed an offence, the person in question should be advised of it by way of summons and an automatic fine should be imposed unless the individual contests it and, if contested, the matter should be brought before the court.</P>
    <P>I do not understand why many family law matters for instance come before the Circuit Court when they could be more appropriately dealt with in the District Court.  Matters related to licensing laws could also be more appropriately dealt with in the District Court. <Col N="61" /> The Minister should examine the jurisdiction of the various courts, particularly that of the District Court which should be expanded.</P>
    <P>Many people have criticised the appointment of judges by the Government. Since 1922 successive Governments have appointed judges equipped for the job and made the right decisions. For years judges have done a good job on behalf of the State.  In our history as an independent State very few complaints have been made about the unsuitability or lack of capacity of judges.  Given that, I wonder why we should depart from the present system. I am aware that view will not be popular and people are calling for accountability and so on.</P>
    <P>On the condition of courthouses, particularly those in County Mayo, for years solicitors and barristers have complained about the scandalous condition of the courthouse in Castlebar in which the Circuit Court sits.  The sound system is very poor and people cannot be heard in court.  The facilities available to the legal profession and the public are appalling.  There is no facility for people to discuss their business privately with their solicitors or barristers.  There is a public toilet in the courthouse but it is not suitable for use.  If the Minister and the House are serious about providing law and order and concerned for those working in the courts, they must provide proper court facilities for the public, barristers and solicitors.</P>
    <P>I was once a witness in a case heard in Belmullet courthouse.  Pedestrians and passing traffic can see through the window.  That causes problems particularly in family law cases, when the people involved do not want their neighbours to know of their case.  If the House is serious about implemening this Bill, it must invest money in the system and spend money on the appointment of additional judges.</P>
    <P>It is wrong that people must wait for long periods before their cases are heard.  I am not a solicitor, but a constituent of mine has been waiting three <Col N="62" /> years for his case to come before the High Court in Dublin and he does not know if it will be heard in the next three to four years.  He is depending on the State to provide for him and money already provided will be given back if he wins his case.  The system should be reformed to eliminate delays.  New legislation, rules and regulations are introduced in this House regularly.  This gives rise to more legal work and proper facilities must be put in place for judges along with consultation rooms for clients and their barristers and solicitors.</P>
    <P>For years people have criticised the wearing of wigs by barristers.  I do not object to it and consider it a matter for the Law Society.  I compliment solicitors and barristers who have provided a good service for years although they have charged well for it.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister who promised to introduce this Bill.  I am not a member of the legal profession.  My job is to protect the rights of the ordinary punters, who have suffered due to delays in having their cases heard.  They pay the fees of their barristers and solicitors and their cases should be heard in a reasonable time.  A delay of three or four years is not reasonable.  It is time we updated our judicial system and provided a proper legal service for the people.  I welcome this Bill and hope further updating Bills will be introduced.</P>
    <P>The Bill will not be effective if adequate funding is not provided.  I hope the priority will be to provide proper facilities in courthouses, particularly the courthouses in Castlebar and Belmullet.  At county council level I put pressure on the county council and the Department of Justice to invest money in upgrading the courthouse in Westport. The courthouse in Achill has also been upgraded.  However, the conditions of other courthouses throughout County Mayo are scandalous.  If the legal profession is to conduct its business properly facilities must be provided.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="63" /> The introduction of this Bill illustrates foresight on the Minister's part.  I hope it will be implemented and additional judges will be appointed in the near future to reduce the backlog of cases to be heard.  As a public representative, I receive many complaints from constituents about delays in having their cases heard.  As the Chair is aware, people with a court case pending tend to be anxious and worried about it, whether it relates to a serious offence or a personal injuries case resulting from an accident.  It is only right that people should have an opportunity to have their cases heard in a reasonable time. This Bill provides for that and its provisions must be acted upon.  I hope it will result in a major improvement in the manner in which court business will be handled.</P>
    <P>I pay tribute to judges, barristers and solicitors for their good work.  They are somewhat like politicians in that it is easy to criticise them, but they have a difficult job and must decide on sensitive issues.  They have a proven record and have provided a good service since the 1920s.</P>
    <P>I would like our judges to be more lenient in sentencing people who have not committed serious offences.  Two constituents, one from Ballinrobe and another from Belmullet called to see me last week.  The constituent from Belmullet in receipt of social welfare benefit was severely fined for making an illegal substance which he told me was for his consumption, and I do not doubt him, but the justice did not believe him and fined him £1,500.  The husband of another constituent with ten children was caught for drunken driving and fined £1,200 by Justice Brennan, a former judge in Mayo.  The man involved will continue to drink, but his wife will have to make cut backs to pay that fine. The imposition of the fine will not change the man's lifestyle.  Judges should carefully examine cases to ensure justice is administered.  There is no point in crucifying a person in receipt of social welfare benefit.  Judges should <Col N="64" /> penalise criminals and send them to jail, but they should be more lenient in the sentences they hand down to the people to whom I referred.</P>

      <P>The President of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, Mr. Miguel Angel Martinez, earlier this year invited the Taoiseach to address the Parliamentary Assembly in January 1996.  The Taoiseach has accepted this invitation.  The Taoiseach is scheduled to address the Assembly on Thursday, 25 January 1996.  This will be the first address by a serving Taoiseach since Seán Lemass addressed the Assembly in 1966.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that at this juncture the Taoiseach is not in a position to state precisely the issues he intends to deal with in his address.  He does, however, envisage that his address will deal with the role and achievements of and the challenges facing the Council of Europe.  In this context he expects that he will have some comments to make on issues to be discussed at the Council's January Parliamentary session. He also anticipates that he will address some of the key issues currently facing Europe.  Finally the occasion may well be a suitable one to speak of issues <Col N="65" /> which relate more specifically to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach will be available to answer questions at the end of his address as is the normal procedure when Heads of Government address the Parliamentary Assembly.</P>

      <P>It is nonetheless clear that a wide range of items will be discussed at the Madrid European Council meeting. These items will include the report of the Reflection Group on the Intergovernmental Conference and the timetable and agenda for the conference, future enlargement of the Union, economic and monetary union and employment policy.  It can also be anticipated that the Council will address external issues notably former Yugoslavia and relations between the Union and the US.</P>

At the Madrid Council it is expected that there will be a single report on employment from the ECOFIN Council, the Social Affairs Council and the Commission which will form a focus for the Council's deliberations on employment.

I am currently chairing a task <Col N="69" /> force to disseminate as much information as we can.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. J. Higgins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Statistics Office has made considerable progress in recent years in the provision of statistical information relating to migration.  In May 1994 it introduced a new annual statistical series on population estimates and gross migration flow information covering the period 1986 to 1993.  Subsequent releases have updated this information to April 1995.  The annual series provides preliminary estimates of gross inward and outward migration flows classified by country of origin/destination, broad age groups and sex.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the absence of administrative controls on the movement of persons into and out of the State the Central Statistics Office makes full use of available alternative information sources when estimating the annual migration flow data.  These include the annual labour force surveys, the country of residence <Col N="70" /> inquiries conducted at sea and air ports, passengers statistics and adminstrative records such as the Register of Electors and the child benefit scheme.</P>
    <P>A check on the accuracy of the net migration figures is provided by comparing the results of successive Censuses of Population with due allowance being made for the effects of births and deaths.  This may result in revisions to the preliminary estimates of migration for inter-censal periods.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The question arises as to whether this should be included in the form for the 1996 Census of Population. I acknowledge we have received a number of submissions on this matter from the Irish Episcopal Commission for Emigrants, the Irish in Britain Representation Group and from the Emerald Isle Emigration Centre.  In reply to these requests the CSO stated it is not possible at this stage to include such a question in the census for the following reasons.  First, the Government has already decided on the content of the 1996 census form and printing arrangements are now nearing finalisation.  The Government's decision was taken following consultation with Government Departments and outside agencies. Second, a comprehensive question on emigration does not appear to us to be a practical proposition.  Difficulties would arise under a number of headings.  How should complete households which may have emigrated be accounted for?  Who should answer for a person who may have emigrated many years ago and whose parents may now be deceased? The possibility of double counting or omission would arise if a sibling or a more distant relative were to answer. Problems with recall would also be likely to seriously affect the quality of the replies.</P>

      <P>In relation to the accuracy of the figures, it is generally acknowledged that the cross-checking of patterns is carried out by way of a whole range of questionnaires, surveys, etc.  These include the labour force surveys, the country of residence inquiries conducted at sea and air ports, passenger statistics and administrative records such as the Register of Electors and the child benefit scheme.  On this basis it is generally assumed that our records are reasonably accurate.  In relation to the actual figures, they have been checked and cross-checked over the years and I can give the Deputy the figures if he so wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1988 the outward migration figure was 61,100, inward migration was 19,200 giving a net migration figure of minus 41,900.  In 1989 the outward migration figure was 70,600, inward migration was 26,700 giving a net migration figure of minus 43,900.  In 1990 the outward migration figure was 56,300, inward migration was 33,300 giving a net migration figure of minus 22,900.  In 1991 the outward migration figure was 35,300, inward migration was 33,300 giving a net migration figure of minus 2,000.  In 1992 the outward migration figure was 38,900, inward migration was 40,900 giving a net migration figure of plus 2,000.  In 1993 the outward migration figure was 41,000, inward migration was 35,000 giving a net migration figure of minus 6,000.  In 1994 the outward migration figure was 41,500, inward migration was 31,500 giving a net migration figure of minus <Col N="72" /> 10,000.

      <P>I would be the last person to recommend more impositions on travellers or any imposition on people's civil rights but I must confess that before and since my time in Government I have not been impressed by the level of statistical information emanating from the Central Statistics Office.  I am not saying that everyone in that office does not work as hard as possible but the reply from the Minister of State raises the question as to why information cannot be available for the following year.  With the availability of computerisation and technology I do not accept these types of answers.  It should be possible to include the questions referred to by Deputy Kitt on the census form.  When the labour force survey and the live register figures are published, a Minister has to stand up in the House and say that the answer may be something to do with emigration, etc. There is no reason a little common sense on the part of Departments cannot be used &mdash; at least by the use of the RSI number &mdash; to tie up all those figures.</P>
      <P>For years and particularly in recent years, the statistical information on the national accounts has had to be revised. During these days of increased use of computers and technology, I am not impressed with the level of information being given&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>How can we include a question on a census form to ascertain precise information where an entire family emigrates or where one member of a family lives in Dundalk, another in <Col N="73" /> Drogheda and another in Belmullet.  It is desirable to have precise information but further consideration would have to be given to the inclusion of a question which would obtain accurate information in this regard.  There is already a question on where people were born. The same applies in regard to the census of population in other countries.  For example, in 1991 Irish born persons classified by country of usual residence was as follows: Northern Ireland, 35,000; Great Britain, 592,000; Australia, 52,000; Canada, 17,000; the United States, 170,000 and other countries, 34,000.

      <P>We are open to suggestions on how we can improve the methodology and accuracy.  Deputy McCreevy referred to the use of PRSI numbers etc. but I cannot think of any system which is completely accurate. Nevertheless I would like his proposal to be examined in detail to see if it would give a precise measurement.  An RSI number applies to taxpayers, people who pay PRSI etc. and it is important to look at how it would give an accurate measurement of the number of people who have emigrated.  There is no obligation on a person signing on at an unemployment exchange to indicate his intention to emigrate next week.  I will ask the CSO to look again at this issue.  Such a question is not included in the census of population envisaged for next April.  As regards the accuracy of the figures, as Deputy Dempsey who was in this position last year knows, we defend our figures which are based on a cross section of a range of different measurements.  That is the best we can do in the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Area-based partnerships were established under the pilot area-based initiative to tackle long-term unemployment introduced under the <i>Programme for Economic and Social Progress.</i> The pilot initiative was very satisfactory and an area-based approach to tackling disadvantage is now a formal part of the Community Support Framework for Ireland through the Operational Programme for Local Urban and <Col N="75" /> Rural Development, reflecting the provisions of the National Development Plan.</P>
      <P>Thirty-five designated areas will operate under the Operational Programme and partnership structures have now been established in most of these.  The potential for success of the partnership under the operational programme can be gauged from the experiences of the 12 pilot partnerships.  The evaluation of the pilot partnerships and other groups which has just been completed indicates that the achievements, in terms of the number of enterprises supported and people receiving education and training has far exceeded expectations.  One thousand eight-hundred enterprises were assisted, 1,600 people received training or education in enterprise related skills; and over 7,000 people, most of whom were unemployed or long-term unemployed received training or education relevant to enterprise creation and business or to help their chances of employment.</P>
      <P>Partnerships may support a range of actions which include enterprise creation benefiting the unemployed, education and training and services for the unemployed.  The actions are specifically geared to improving the potential of the unemployed and especially the long-term unemployed and socially excluded communities to gain employment in the economy generally but particularly in their own areas, to providing a structured programme of advice and support in career planning for those who are long-term unemployed, and to creating specific, training, education and work experience opportunities for the long-term unemployed which will promote their integration into the labour market.  I am satisfied with the impact made on long-term unemployment by the area based partnerships and with their potential to continue doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The partnership process has had a marked influence on policy relating to <Col N="76" /> the provision of services to the long-term unemployed.  For example, community employment is based very much on a programme piloted in the partnership areas.  Similarly, the local employment service is being developed by the Minister for Enterprise and Employment on the basis of the experiences of the partnerships' initial contact programme. The local employment service is being developed within the framework of the companies.  The partnership model is a highly effective way of channelling the expertise, resources and goodwill of the social partners, the statutory agencies and local communities in the interests of the unemployed.</P>

      <P>When I was a Minister I did not use the word &ldquo;satisfied&rdquo; in reply to parliamentary questions as one could not be satisfied with the long-term unemployment figures.  It is a Civil Service word which should be airbrushed out of replies because the day we are satisfied is the day we will have to leave this House.</P>
      <P>Like the Minister for Finance, I am an advocate of the importance of area based partnerships.  He and I had many outings on this issue.  The Minister of State referred to local employment services which are developed on the basis of successful partnerships, particularly through the contact groups.  Does he think a conflict will arise between those developments and the county enterprise boards, Forbairt and the back-to-work, social welfare and other schemes? People are becoming perplexed about what to do and they end up running from Leader to Forbairt, the IDA, the area based partnerships, local development schemes, the county enterprise boards and the county councils.

I accept that the funds have come from Europe and we should not reject them but I agree with my colleague that there are too many Ministers and too many agencies dealing with the unemployed.  In many cases there are up to 80 agencies and in some <Col N="78" /> counties there are 40 or 50 agencies dealing with the unemployed.  Surely the Minister of State is in a pivotal position in the Department of the Taoiseach to co-ordinate the work of Ministers and the agencies.  The Minister referred to the valuable education and training work pursuant to the area based partnerships but at the same time there have been cut backs in the VTOS scheme.

For example I set up 35 companies but the reason there are 35 companies is that they are geographic and are partnerships of the local people, the State agencies at local level and the local social partners.  The concept is local development, which has to be area based.  It is a matter for the community to examine its needs and submit its application to an overall company for the country, Area Development Management Limited.  There is a misunderstanding but I expect the reason for this misunderstanding is that this is very new.  My ambition is that over a period local development will become known for job creation and assisting the disadvantaged in the way the credit union movement is known for finance.  That will not happen overnight.</P>

      <P>It is unusual for Deputy McCreevy to misquote Members.  I did not say what he attributed to me.  I said the reason there is not one scheme but a series of schemes is that we have been able to justify these worthy and needy schemes to the European Commission.</P>
      <P>On the question of local development I have already asked the OECD to carry out an examination of how we deliver local development as a service, warts and all.  During Ireland's Presidency next year we intend to hold a conference on local development so that Ireland may lead the field in Europe. Far from the programme finishing in 1999, there might be a Europe-wide programme from 1999 onwards.</P>

My point is that the area partnerships, the enterprise boards and the various organisations are making a contribution but we do not know if they are maximising the value of the funds they are administering.  Has the Minister any intention of finding this out?  How will we know that all of the organisations are providing value for money?  The Minister of State has made no reference to the Minister for the Environment who supposedly has embarked upon a review of local government.  Does he not accept that this is central to local government and that the problem is that local government is being diminished by being by-passed by these schemes? More money is going to self-appointed organisations, who as far as I can see, are accountable to no one whereas the local authorities, the only organisation accountable to the people every few years, are being diminished.</P>

      <P>County strategy groups are established in each county under the terms of the Operational Programme for Local Urban and Rural Development.</P>
      <P>The role of the county strategy groups is to secure the cohesion, from a county perspective, of the various local development initiatives being undertaken by the State and voluntary sector. The membership comprises the chairs of county enterprise boards, area partnerships, Leader groups and county tourism committees, as well as the county manager.  A liaison team had been formed in my Department to facilitate the establishment of the groups in line with the commitment in the Operational Programme for Local Development.  Its role is to ensure effective co-ordination and exchange of information among groups and organisations involved in local development so as to avoid overlap, duplication or competition between the organisations and to ensure that any significant gaps are addressed.  In particular they are preparing co-ordination strategies which will indicate how participating organisations will co-operate, while recognising the need to avoid adding a bureaucratic layer to the local development effort.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>For that reason, the Government has proposed to the European Commission that the composition of the county strategy groups be amended to provide for the inclusion of local public representatives.  I am confident this will be agreed shortly.</P>
      <P>The Government's approach to local government reform was set out in the Government statement of 4 July 1995. The Devolution Commission has been established and has been asked to make recommendations so that the local authorities become the focus for working through local partnership involving local community based groupings, voluntary bodies, the private sector and public agencies, and the efforts of local authorities and those of existing groups such as county enterprise boards, Leader groups, and area partnerships are co-ordinated.</P>
      <P>The experience of the county strategy groups will be an important input to the work of the Devolution Commission. The involvement of public representatives will also be a step in the direction which the Government wish to support.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="NoelDempsey" hpid="Mr. Dempsey Mr. Dempsey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dempsey</NameTxt>
      <P>Was that recommendation made before or after I tabled the question?  The county strategy groups that have been set up include a range of non-elected people, such as chairmen of various groups and county managers rather than county council chairmen.  I want an assurance from the Minister <Col N="84" /> that irrespective of what Europe says the Government will respect local public representatives and ensure they are represented on the county strategy groups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has exercised my mind for some time and is not something we recommended after the Deputy tabled his question.  I share his concerns in this regard.  Anything that is funded by taxpayers, whether from Europe or Ireland, should have a direct accounting procedure to elected representatives. I can account for the overall policy in the Dáil but as many of the groups will be area based there should be county contact and I do not have a difficulty in that regard.  The main motivation for this has come from the Taoiseach and me.  However, there has been some resistance.  The structures I inherited are very rigid and we have given those involved in the structures the right to decide what we do.  It is time we stopped knocking each other.  I am fed up with questions being put down about the cost of this, that and the other.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State spoke about removing bureaucratic layers and bringing matters as close as possible to local people.  However, he referred to the establishment of county strategy groups and the liaison committee in the Department of the Taoiseach, two additional layers of bureaucracy.  Public representatives and Members of the Oireachtas are being ignored as a result of the establishment of all these groups, but I am glad the Minister of State assured us that will not continue.</P>

      <P>I cannot win on this question.  Deputy Kitt asked if I could appoint somebody from my Department to co-ordinate matters and when I made proposals in that regard Deputy Dempsey condemned me.  The committee is attempting to co-ordinate matters on a cross-departmental basis from the Department of the Taoiseach, which is the correct place for such co-ordination to be carried out.  I am examining the question of the involvement of public representatives at county level in the county strategy groups.  I am also examining the possibility of devolving as much work as possible under these programmes to county councils and local authorities under the Devolution Commission. I am sure all Members would agree that is the proper way to approach the matter.  I support the principle behind the Deputy's question.</P>

      <P>If we are to ensure that the programme objectives are implemented those paid to attend meetings must do so.  That is part of their job. When we do not understand the purpose of a programme we are inclined to adopt such an attitude.  I accept this is a new approach which will involve streamlining, but the programmes are exciting and important.  I anticipate that the local development programme will create in the region of 8,000 jobs in one to five person enterprises in areas of greatest need in a relatively short period of time.  It will also include environmental improvement, training, education and so on.  I requested partnership companies to prioritise estate management training for local authority tenants which is important if communities are to be properly run.</P>

      <P>We are all on the same wavelength as far as bureaucratic layers and duplication are concerned.  I understand that the ADM and the Combat Poverty Agency have been appointed to deal with some European funding.  My area has been divided into three and a new group has been appointed to administer a fund which was successfully administered previously by the Leader group.  There is no continuation. There is a breakdown in communication between what was achieved by the Leader funding and this new grouping set up to administer another fund.  Can there not be some continuation of the system?  Perhaps the Minister of State should arrange something as he has just suggested so that this could be co-ordinated.</P>

      <P>I will try to arrange such a seminar and I hope Members will find it possible to attend.  In relation to the point just raised by Deputy McDaid, my policy decision, which was offered to each of the Leader groups, was that where there was an existing Leader group they could take on the partnership activities themselves if they wished to do so by a minor adjustment in the boards.  A number of Leader groups around the country choose to do so but in other areas people decided they did not want to do it that way.</P>

The National Stadium would not be big enough so Croke Park is the only suitable venue to accommodate all these task forces which, I admit, my Government was not too bad in setting up either.</P>

      <P>I understand that the figure of 45,000 jobs mentioned by the Deputy refers to the numbers employed in the sectors of Irish manufacturing industry with the highest dependence on the UK market. I deny the Deputy's suggestion that such firms could be devastated if the UK stayed out of stage 3 of Economic and Monetary Union and Ireland joined. The future prospects of these firms will, of course, depend on a much wider range of factors.  These include, in addition to the UK decision on Economic and Monetary Union, the overall strength of the Irish economy including, in particular, our competitive position relative to the UK when stage 3 of Economic and Monetary Union comes into being, the level of interest rates here as compared with the UK, the performance of sterling in the meantime, the extent of diversification of these firms to other markets and the arrangements to be put in place at EU level to regulate the relationship between the single currency and the currencies of member states not participating in the <Col N="90" /> third stage of Economic and Monetary Union.</P>
      <P>I would also point out that the UK Government has never said it will not participate in Economic and Monetary Union.  Rather it has indicated that the UK will not join Economic and Monetary Union in 1997, but that if European Monetary Union commences at a later date, a decision on UK participation will be made closer to that time; 1 January 1999 is now the agreed commencement date for Economic and Monetary Union and the 1997 date has been abandoned. Ireland's position will not be advanced at this point by engaging in speculation about what the UK may decide when the time comes.</P>
      <P>As the Minister for Finance, I am determined to ensure that Ireland will be fit and ready to join Economic and Monetary Union when it is formed in 1999 and that our economy performs well when we are in Economic and Monetary Union.  We must, therefore, continue to meet the convergence criteria set down in the Maastricht Treaty. We must also improve our competitiveness, flexibility and efficiency at every level to ensure that we can continue to grow and maximise sustainable employment both before European Monetary Union is formed and when we are members of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also inform the Deputy that I have announced I am commissioning, on behalf of the Government, an in-depth study by consultants of the likely economic implications of Economic and Monetary Union.  The study will assist us to deepen our understanding of how the Irish economy interfaces with its trading partners.  By having more detailed information, we will be better prepared to plan our national policies with a view to Economic and Monetary Union &mdash; both in preparation for it and to participate successfully within it.  The study will have particular reference to employment and will extend to sectoral level.  It will cover both direct and indirect economic effects and address both short and longer term impacts.  The study will be completed by the end of <Col N="91" /> June 1996 and its findings will be made public.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned to ensure that work continues at EU level in particular, aimed at mapping out the relationship between member states moving to the single currency at the outset and those member states not in Economic and Monetary Union.  The importance of this relationship is recognised by Article 109 M of the Treaty which requires countries not participating in Economic and Monetary Union to treat their exchange rate policies as a matter of common interest.  I might add that the question of the relationship between the single currency and non-participating currencies is also a matter of concern to other member states and the importance of that work is fully recognised at EU level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that my question refers to the speech by the Governor of the Central Bank on 30 October 1995 to the European Parliament. The Governor warned that Irish firms employing approximately 45,000 could be devastated if Ireland joined the European Monetary Union and the United Kingdom stayed out.  If that happened, he said these industries would either have to be protected or compensated. What are the Minister's views on that warning?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It all depends on what is in the best interests of the UK economy. The British negotiated the option in the Maastrict Treaty not to participate in Economic and Monetary Union on the basis of the outturn of the 1997 budget figures even though they may possibly qualify.  At present they would not qualify and following yesterday's budget they still do not qualify because the EBR or GDP is over the 3 per cent threshold.  Assuming they qualify they could exercise the option not to participate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is highly speculative but the Deputy asked the question in a constructive manner and I am trying to <Col N="92" /> respond in a similar vein.  We must ask what is in the best interests of the British economy, the rate of sterling and its performance if they choose not to enter Economic and Monetary Union.  If it is in the best interests of the British economy that sterling maintains its value, does not depreciate and import inflation as a consequence, there will be no substantial change between the quoted exchange rate value of the Irish pound or the Euro currency on the one hand and that of sterling on the other.  Therefore, the present relative level of value between sterling and the Euro currency will remain static, if not converge.  In those circumstances it would have a positive effect on Irish firms.  If, on the other hand, the British Government under the mismanagement of the Tories &mdash; we have seen some spectacular mismanagement over the last number of years &mdash; so abuse the fundamentals of their economy that the value of sterling depreciates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the British decide on an irresponsible economic policy along the lines of the Tory policy and that results in a significant depreciation of the value of sterling relative to other EU currencies, it could have a damaging effect on some Irish firms but it would have a devastating effect on the British economy. As they are motivated by self interest, in common with other countries, including Ireland, I do not believe they will manage the economy in that <Col N="93" /> way.  When Gordon Browne becomes Chancellor that will not be the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the EU will have access to the Single Market but if some countries join the Economic and Monetary Union &mdash; Ireland will be one &mdash; and others do not there will be difficulties.  These will not just apply to Ireland but our position will be worse given our economic relationship with the UK.  Surely some mechanism must be put in place to prevent those who stay outside the club, as the Minister described it in a recent speech, using the major economic tool of their exchange rate to benefit them.  Surely that would devastate the Irish economy.  Does the Minister agree with the Governor of the Central Bank that some compensatory mechanisms would have to be put in place for those types of industry?</P>

      <P>We have exhausted half the time allocated to priority questions.  I wish to accommodate those Deputies who tabled the other four questions and I ask for the <Col N="94" /> co-operation of the House in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another question on this topic.  I hope my brevity in replying to this question is not taken as lack of an adequate response.  The behaviour of currencies inside the internal market but outside the Economic and Monetary Union is a matter of concern to all potential members of the Economic and Monetary Union &mdash; the French and German in particular.  The Commission has been requested to address the question of what is described as &ldquo;cohabitation&rdquo; and establish new rules of behaviour &mdash; a new kind of currency arrangement &mdash; to avoid the problems of competitive devaluation. Deputy McCreevy is correct to say we need to know the areas of vulnerability sector by sector, region by region because of our substantial relationship with the UK economy.  We have some information but it is not sufficiently detailed to enable us to construct targeted policies and that is the reason I undertook the study.</P>
      <P>The measures I introduced in this year's budget &mdash; employers' PRSI and others &mdash; were designed to give direct assistance to labour intensive, low profit type indigenous industries traditionally selling into the UK market where the bottom line and payroll cost for such industries was reduced by 3 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 7, 29, 43 and 55 together.  I wish to make clear at the outset that the Government remains firmly committed to the fiscal policy parameters set out in our policy programme.</P>
      <P>Firm management of the public finances is a necessary part of this Government's strategy for employment and social justice.  Maintaining annual borrowing at moderate levels is crucial to securing long-term sustainable growth and employment.  Within that context, this Government is committed to a fiscal policy that seeks to maintain low budgetary deficits to continue downward pressure on the debt burden and meet the fiscal criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty.  By reducing the debt burden, we will be able to free up significant resources which are at present pre-empted by debt service costs, and reduce our exposure to adverse interest and exchange rate movements.</P>
      <P>In the policy agreement, <i>A Government of Renewal,</i> this Government made a commitment that growth in current supply services spending will be held to an average annual rate of no more than 2 per cent in real terms over each of the forthcoming two budget years to release the fruits of economic growth more substantially for tax reduction and reform.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Indications are pointing to a satisfactory outturn for 1995 but tighter control of public spending in 1996 is absolutely necessary to secure continued adherence into the medium-term of the fiscal consolidation that has been a feature of <Col N="96" /> Irish economic achievement for almost a decade.  On the basis of present projections for 1996, adherence to the 2 per cent real growth is essential, not only to remain within the critical 3 per cent Masstricht limit but also to deliver on this Government's commitment to substantial measures for tax reform over the period of the programme.  I assure the House that we are fully committed to respecting the spending growth limit of 2 per cent in real terms in 1996.</P>
    <P>As I just mentioned, indications are pointing to a satisfactory outturn for 1995 and public spending is on target. While some additional spending pressures have emerged, such as the additional costs associated with higher than anticipated average numbers on the live register, I anticipate that sufficient savings will be available elsewhere to offset in substantial measure these extra costs in 1995.  The implications for 1996 expenditure of the increase in the numbers on the live register and other additional pressures which have emerged are being taken fully into account in settling the estimates for 1996.</P>
    <P>I remind the House that the decisions on public expenditure which were taken last July were aimed at containing the growth in gross current supply services expenditure in 1996.  The main impact of the decision which the Government took on restricting the numbers employed in the public sector will be felt on 1996 spending.  These decisions were prudent and timely measures to ensure that the 2 per cent spending target for 1996 will not be exceeded.</P>
    <P>The process of settling the 1996 departmental spending Estimates is nearing completion.  I have been engaged in detailed discussions with my Government colleagues to ensure that their Departments' Estimates for 1996 are finalised and agreed within the overall targets laid down by the Government. I expect to be in a position to bring these discussions to a satisfactory conclusion in the very near future.</P>
    <P>As soon as the Estimates are finalised, the details will be published in <Col N="97" /> the Abridged Estimates Volume and the Summary Public Capital Programme for 1996.  The Estimates for the Department of Social Welfare will, of course, be detailed with all the other departmental Estimates in these publications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that the Minister emphasised, today and on previous occasions, the desirability of adhering to the parameters laid down in the Programme for Government, with which I agree, why is it taking so long to publish the Estimates for 1996?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about a projected increase of 4.25 per cent in 1996.  Last year the figure was 6.9 per cent or 5.8 per cent depending on which way one wants to calculate it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and prior to that it was even higher again.  We are trying to slow down the momentum taking one year against another.  That is proving to be extremely difficult because even with no policy change implications there is pressure on Estimate demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Given that there will be carry over costs in the area of social welfare arising from the increases last July and that the live register outturn for 1995 is higher than the estimated figure of 266,000 at the start of the year &mdash; consequently, the figure for 1996 is likely to be higher than anticipated &mdash; does the Minister agree that if he continues to dilly-dally on the question of when the Estimates will be published the entire process will be brought into <Col N="98" /> disrepute?  It is now time to publish the Estimates for 1996 and get on with the job of preparing the budget.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Work on the budget is well advanced.  We know the parameters in a number of areas.  That work has not been stalled because the Estimates process has not been finalised.  I am happy with the progress made to date and I am confident we will be able to publish the Estimates within a reasonable time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 22 November, the European Monetary Institute published a report on progress towards convergence in member states of the European Union in accordance with Article 7 of its statute. The EMI gave a positive assessment of Ireland's performance on convergence. It acknowledged our good record on inflation, interest rates and the public finances, including the fact that Ireland is one of only three member states deemed in 1995 not to have an excessive deficit.  The report also notes that, in 1995, Ireland's forecast general government deficit will once again be below the Treaty reference value of 3 per cent of GDP.  In fact, Ireland's deficit has been below 3 per cent of GDP every year since and including 1989.  The report also <Col N="99" /> acknowledges the continuing reduction in Ireland's debt-GDP ratio, which is forecast to fall to 86 per cent in 1995. This represents a decline of almost 32 percentage points since 1986.  Furthermore, Ireland is the only member state which will have a lower debt-GDP ratio this year than in 1991.</P>
    <P>Overall, the report concludes that a majority of member states do not currently satisfy all the criteria and that progress towards convergence is not sufficient. In particular, the report found the public finances in most member states to be far from satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The EMI also addressed, in respect of all members states, the risks affecting future progress towards convergence. On Ireland, it noted that the Irish pound's exchange rate remains below the ERM central parity against the strongest currencies.  The EMI also referred to a possible effect on inflation stemming from our continuing high economic growth and expressed concern about a recent deterioration in cyclically-adjusted budget balances.</P>
    <P>These remarks must be viewed in their proper context.  Ireland was not singled out for criticism.  For example the EMI also cautions Germany, the EU's strongest economy, on inflation and the budget deficit.  The EMI's comments on fluctuations in our exchange rate reflect the impact on a number of currencies, including the French franc and Danish krone as well as the Irish pound, of US dollar and associated sterling weakness and the appreciation of the Deutsche Mark.  The Irish pound continues to trade comfortably within the ERM and has actually appreciated modestly in trade-weighted terms this year.</P>
    <P>Regarding the comments on inflation, I remind Deputies of our excellent record on inflation in recent years, which has been maintained during a period of sustained economic growth.</P>
    <P>The EMI's assessment of our budget deficit is based on figures which include the full cash cost of equal treatment payments in 1995, amounting to £200 <Col N="100" /> million.  While the cyclically-adjusted deficit can be a useful indicator of the conduct of fiscal policy, it is a somewhat controversial measure of fiscal performance and, therefore, its importance should not be over emphasised.  In this context, we have some reservations about the Commission estimates of Ireland's cyclically-adjusted deficit, on which the EMI assessment is based.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Somebody asked me the other day &mdash; as a child of the 1960's &mdash; if I agreed that at one stage EMI was a record label and Economic and Monetary Union was a glove puppet on Roy Hudd's knee and that life had changed when these terms were supposed to be on everyone's lips.  Does the Minister agree that the EMI's view of Ireland was somewhat sceptical, that the most obvious point of scepticism related to our debt-GDP ratio and that, although it is moving in the right direction, there is no confident assertion or assumption that we will arrive at a satisfactory debt-GDP ratio by the time Economic and Monetary Union is put before us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We should recognise the EMI for what it is &mdash; it is not a defunct record label &mdash; it is the embryonic central bank for the European Union currency. Therefore, its pronouncements will be in line with what one would expect to hear from a central bank.  It will make the cautionary comments with regard to expenditure control that one would expect to hear from our Central Bank and frequently from the Bank of England which is not independent, or the Federal Reserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One has to consider the report in its entirety.  It deals with the issue of progress towards convergence in member states.  This was part and parcel of the Maastricht Treaty which gives legal expression to the Economic and Monetary Union project.  I would be the first to admit that our performance could be <Col N="101" /> better and would like to see our debt-GDP ratio fall faster.  I do not think anyone in the House would necessarily disagree with that; no one is arguing that it should move in the other direction, but one has to consider what the report states about all the European economies and see where Ireland is located on the league table in terms of its performance by comparison with that of Germany. On balance, the assessment is reasonably positive, but not one about which anyone could be complacent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelMcDowellPD" hpid="Mr. M. McDowell Mr. M. McDowell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. McDowell</NameTxt>
      <P>Earlier the Minister made party political broadcasts on behalf of the British Labour Party.  In this context was his fellow member of Socialist International, Mr. Neil Kinnock, close to the mark when he suggested that the target date of 1999 for Economic and Monetary Union was not attainable?  The EMI is operating on the assumption that we are moving towards the first phase of Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.  Does the Minister agree that this target will not be achieved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I attended the ECOFIN Council meeting on Monday of this week at which 15 Ministers for Finance participated, ranging from the European socialist to the conservative group, not one of whom gave any indication, both in their formal presentations at the meeting or in the informal discussions over lunch, that the target date of 1 January 1999 was neither realistic nor achievable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a question about whether the French will be in a position to join.  This has been expressed by Chancellor Kohl and a number of other senior European statesmen.  The French have made it clear, however, that they are determined to meet the criteria laid down in the Maastricht Treaty and in the report to be submitted to the Madrid Council. I have no reason to doubt their commitment and, on that basis Mr. Neil Kinnock was wrong and the ECOFIN <Col N="102" /> Council was correct, that we are on target to move towards Economic and Monetary Union on 1 January 1999.</P>

      <P>I thank the House for the sos that was agreed to allow me to get ready to make my presentation.  The script of my speech is not available for circulation immediately, but as I will cover the text of the document which is already in the public domain Members probably will be familiar with the main points.</P>
      <P>Before I refer to the text I would like to avail of this opportunity to pay particular tribute to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs for his advice and very active participation in this entire process.  I also pay tribute to the officials of his Department, the Department of Justice and my Department who worked at all hours of the day and night, including weekends, to bring about the agreement we have now achieved.  The Minister for Social Welfare has been involved on a daily basis in recent weeks in reaching the present stage.  The Minister for Justice has also played a vital role at critical junctures in the process leading to last night's agreement.</P>
      <P>I wish to convey my thanks to the House, particularly to Deputies Ahern and Harney for the general support they have given the Government in this process, which they acknowledged was a difficult process at all times.</P>
      <P>I express my appreciation that I was not pressed for answers to questions which Members knew I might be able to answer, but which would not necessarily be prudent for me to answer in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The agreement would have been impossible without the concentrated engagement, mastery of detail and willingness to set time aside at short notice shown by the British Prime Minister, <Col N="190" /> Mr. John Major.  What the British and Irish Governments launched yesterday evening by way of a comminiqué was a twin track process, a means of bringing the two Governments and the Northern Ireland parties together for constructive negotiations at the earliest possible date and in the best possible atmosphere. Both Governments have the firm aim of launching these all-party negotiations by the end of February 1996.</P>
    <P>If our timetable is to be achieved, we must have the fullest and the earliest co-operation from all parties.  Some parties will need time to study the communiqué. It is not a simple document, although it is comparatively short.  The two Governments have been working on it and the concepts in it for many months.  It is not unreasonable to give the Northern Ireland parties the time necessary to analyse it and to reflect on its contents.  Representatives of both Governments will be available to provide the parties with any elaboration or explanation of the detail of the document which may be required.  I ask parties considering their definitive responses at this point to accept our offer or the offer of the British Government of more detailed briefing if they feel that would help them.</P>
    <P>Time is not on our side.  Events will not and do not stand still.  We are either moving forward or running the risk of going backwards.  Yesterday evening the two Governments gave the peace process a renewed momentum, but everyone must stand ready to make the compromises necessary to take advantage of that.  A willingness to compromise is a sign of strength; an unwillingness to do so is often a sign of weakness or uncertainty.</P>
    <P>I want to discuss the text of the communiqué which sets out the agreement between the two Governments on the twin track process.  The tracks will work in parallel and simultaneously.  I emphasise that progress in one track will facilitate progress in the other.  For this twin track approach to work, the work in both tracks must be mutually reinforcing.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="191" /> The first track will be an intensive series of discussions, which we intend to begin almost immediately, involving all the political parties in Northern Ireland which are working on an equal basis with the Governments to lay the ground work and to build up the trust necessary to ensure that all-party negotiations, to which we are committed, will be a success. In this political track, the two Governments will have intensive preparatory talks with the Northern Ireland political parties with the remit to reach widespread agreement on the basis for participation, structure, format and agenda necessary to bring all the parties together for substantive negotiations aimed at a political settlement based on consent.  These talks will have an open agenda allowing any party in the political track to raise any relevant matter. As the communiqué states:</P>
    <P>These matters could include how best the structure and format of all-party negotiations, involving in appropriate strands both governments and all the relevant Northern Ireland parties, directed to addressing in a comprehensive manner all the relevant relationships in an interlocking three stranded process can properly take account of democratic mandates and principles, including whether and how an elected body could play a part.</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>In managing the process of preparatory talks, each government will build on existing exchanges and bilateral contacts, treating each party on an equal basis; they will encourage other formats for meetings with the parties and among the parties, including meetings between the two governments together with one or more parties, with their agreement, which might further the objective of the preparatory talks.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say much more at this stage about the political track.  We have set out a comprehensive and open <Col N="192" /> agenda for it and it is not the intention of this Government or the British Government to be prescriptive about the nature of the political talks track.</P>
    <P>It is important to make the point that this success is one where the Governments are giving the parties an opportunity to make a response.  The Governments are not laying down what the parties must do.  We are providing them with a channel or a means whereby they can be masters of their own future.  It is important to recognise that we are talking about giving people an opportunity to be masters of their own future.  Part of the problem in Northern Ireland for years has been a sense that someone else has responsibility for whatever is wrong and for finding the solution to it. What we are providing in this twin track process is an opportunity for the people of Northern Ireland and their political representatives to become that someone else; to become the ones who find the solutions, make the compromises and the deals necessary.</P>
    <P>I hope the British Prime Minister, his team and our team have shown in recent hours an example of how it is possible, if one wants to, to make an agreement.  I hope that example will be shown to be useful and will be followed in the more complex and wider process involved in the political track about which I have spoken.</P>
    <P>The Governments have set out their joint position in the communiqué, but we are only two of the parties in a negotiation which, I hope, will, if it is to work to full effect, involve both Governments and all political parties in Northern Ireland.  It is not for us to impose an agenda, a format, a location or anything else.  These things must emerge by agreement.  If we are to achieve the objective of all-party negotiations by the end of February 1996, all concerned must show flexibility and a willingness to take fully into account the concerns and difficulties of other parties.</P>
    <P>Obviously the work done by both Governments and by the Northern Ireland parties in recent times may facilitate progress as we move along the <Col N="193" /> political track.  For example, last February the two Governments jointly published <i>A New Framework for Agreement</i>, a shared understanding between London and Dublin to assist discussion and negotiation involving the Northern Ireland parties.  At about the same time a number of Northern Ireland parties published their proposals.  There is an opportunity now in the political track announced last night, for the first time, for all those participants to see how best they might interact with one another regarding the various proposals tabled jointly by the Governments and by the parties.</P>
    <P>In the nature of media presentation of issues, conflict rather than agreement is more the stuff of headlines.  Up to now the public focus has tended to be on the differences between the various proposals made, particularly those made earlier this year, the framework document and proposals made by others. These various documents have many common features.  I hope that in the work that will be done now in the political track the emphasis will be more on what is in common between the proposals of the various parties and less on the areas where undoubtedly there is disagreement as one would expect in a society riven by division in the matter of allegiance for the past 300 years.</P>
    <P>While the task ahead is daunting, the available documents, along with much other work done, including that done in the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, provide a fruitful ground for preparatory talks.</P>
    <P>I move to deal with the second of the two tracks, the decommissioning track. In parallel with the political track the two Governments have agreed to establish an international body to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue.  The background to this decision is well known.  One of the obstacles on the road to inclusive all-party talks is the lack of trust deriving from the fact that even though we have had 15 months of peace frightening quantities of explosives, arms and <Col N="194" /> ammunition are known to be held in both jurisdictions.  Given the events of the past 25 years, they are a threat to the peace and are clearly seen as such. For many people it is not enough that the arms have been silent for 15 months &mdash; important though that achievement is &mdash; and parties associated with their use have said they are committed to achieving their objectives through peaceful and democratic means.  While parties in this House may be prepared, as we are, to take the republican movement at its word, it is obvious that to date at least Unionists and the British Government are not.  That is a reality we must face.</P>
    <P>Against that background for some time the British Government has been of the view that all-party talks could not usefully commence until a start, at least, had been made on decommissioning.  The Irish Government has accepted, albeit reluctantly, that this will not happen before the commencement of such talks.  Our reluctance should not be taken in any way as a weakening of our resolve to rid this country, North and South, of all bombs, guns and bullets.  As Taoiseach, I find it abhorrent that weapons should be in the hands of anyone in this jurisdiction other than those of the lawfully constituted security forces or people licensed by lawfully constituted authorities.  The use or threatened use of violence in the achievement of political objectives has no place in a democratic society, nor is it sufficient in this day and age to refer to the precedent of pikes in the thatch or guns in the bog.</P>
    <P>Sadly, nowadays, we live in a much more complex and crime ridden society. Within a few miles of this House one day recently there were three murders involving the use of guns.  While there is no suggestion that those murders involved paramilitaries or weapons controlled by them, we cannot take the risk that guns originally brought into this country by paramilitaries may end up in the hands of criminals.  Total and verifiable removal of those arms at the earliest possible date is the only outcome that will ultimately be acceptable to the people of Ireland, North and South.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="195" /> The twin track process is an effort to overcome the disagreement that has existed between the British and Irish Governments regarding the timing of the commencement of decommissioning relative to the issue of the commencement of talks.  We have not attempted to hide our differences in this matter.  It is better to be open if there is a disagreement while, at the same time, emphasising the much larger area of ground in which there is agreement.</P>
    <P>In particular, both Governments have agreed to establish an international body to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue.  We invited the distinguished US Senator, George Mitchell, to chair the body and we are inviting two other eminent people, one Canadian and one Finnish, to serve as other members of the body. We expect to be in a position to announce their names within a matter of days.  I am delighted to be able to confirm to the House that Senator George Mitchell has accepted the invitation and is ready to start work almost immediately.  He will be arriving in Belfast tomorrow as a member of President Clinton's party and I look forward to seeing him here on Friday.  I wish to express my deepest gratitude to Senator Mitchell and I know I speak on behalf of all Members of this House and all people in this country in wishing him success in his endeavours.  He has already shown his extraordinary friendship and support for all the people of this island, North and South, Unionist and Nationalist, republican and loyalist in the work he has done as special adviser to the US President on economic initiatives in Ireland and through his role in the organisation of the White House conference on trade and investment in Ireland in Washington last May. He is about to tackle a problem which, in the long history of our country, has never before been successfully tackled. Despite the depth, complexity and known current difficulties Senator Mitchell unhesitatingly agreed to tackle it. <Col N="196" /> His knowledge, experience and his personal qualities uniquely fit him for the task.</P>
    <P>The Governments, in particular, have asked the body to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue.  I want to emphasise paragraph five of the communiqué.  It is broadly phrased and is the governing paragraph. The assessment to be carried out is of the decommissioning issue &mdash; that is not qualified in any way &mdash; and it is to be independent.  I emphasise those important words in that paragraph.</P>
    <P>In paragraph seven of the communiqué the Governments, in particular, have asked the body to identify and advise on suitable and acceptable methods for full and verifiable decommissioning and to report on whether there is clear commitment on the part of those in possession of such arms to work constructively to achieve that.  We have asked the body to submit its report to the two Governments by mid-January 1996.  Again, the time frame is an indication of the pace at which we expect the twin track mechanism to work.</P>
    <P>I hope the relevant parties will recognise that if the overall timetable we have set is to work, it is important that they complete their analysis of the communiqué as quickly as possible.  It is expected that the international body will consult widely, invite relevant parties to submit their analysis of matters relevant to the decommissioning issue and in reaching its conclusions within its remit to consider such evidence as it receives on its merits.  The body will be capable of operating in both jurisdictions and will have offices in Dublin and Belfast.  It will be for the body to decide who to meet.</P>
    <P>The Governments will place no restrictions on the body in regard to whom it may talk to in order to fulfil its mandate and it will be able to receive information about matters falling within its remit in confidence.  While we would expect details of the body's consultations with the two Governments and the parties to be confidential, it will be <Col N="197" /> a matter for the body itself to decide on a day to day basis how much publicity to give to its work.</P>
    <P>The Governments considered in detail the critical issue of what attitude the body and the Governments will take to the various submissions which both Governments expect will be made to the body.  We agreed a specific response which recognises the differences between the Governments in relation to the Washington 3 criterion.  This response crucially includes the following agreed text:</P>
    <P>But as the communiqué makes clear, the Governments are not setting limits to the scope of the submissions which may be made to the body or in the preparatory talks.  As paragraph 8 makes clear, it will be for the body in reaching conclusions within its remit to consider such evidence on its merits.  Both Governments will consider constructively any practicable suggestion that could bring all parties into negotiation on the basis of the Downing Street Declaration and would do so in the light of discussions in the political track.</P>
    <P>I believe the use of the terms &ldquo;consider constructively&rdquo; is particularly important here, but those making submissions to the body should also approach their part of the task in an equally constructive spirit and I wish to emphasise that.</P>
    <P>The costs of the body will be met by both Governments.  It will be serviced by a secretariat, the arrangements in regard to which will be a matter for discussion between the Governments and the body itself.  Obviously since the body is independent it will be free to choose its own staff.  As the communiqué makes clear the Governments are not setting limits to the scope of the submissions which may be made to the body and, as paragraph 8 makes clear, it will be for the body, in reaching conclusions within its remit, to consider such evidence on its merits.  Neither Government nor any other party cooperating with the work of the body is asked to abandon their well-known or <Col N="198" /> stated position nor are they bound in advance to accept the recommendations of the body.  These recommendations will be advisory.  What is important is that the two Governments have agreed that they will consider carefully any recommendation made by the body and give it due weight on its merits.  I have no doubt that both Governments will consider constructively any practicable suggestion that could help all parties into negotiations as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We have embarked, a Cheann Comhairle, on the twin track approach to clear obstacles to all party negotiations. It is important to recognise that it is all party negotiations that we are seeking. The two Governments, acting separately or jointly, cannot clear these obstacles on our own.  These obstacles can only be cleared by all of us, all the parties, working together in a spirit of trust, goodwill and harmony.</P>
    <P>Many parties have already taken major risks for peace.  I salute them for that.  They, we and others may have to show even greater courage as we move into the next critical phase of this process. The peace process, a Cheann Comhairle, has now become a political process.  That is why I look forward to the future with such optimism and confidence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Taoiseach for his introductory remarks.  I acknowledge the assistance of the Government last night, through the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Proinsias De Rossa, in providing an advance copy of the communiqué to the Fianna Fáil Party and his briefing on any questions we raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party welcomes the resumption of forward movement in the peace process, which is long overdue, on the eve of President Clinton's visit. Whatever reservations or queries we have about some of the outstanding difficulties and the detail, we believe that all parties should try to work and co-operate with what is there to achieve the results we all want.  These results are <Col N="199" /> consolidation of the peace, the commencement of all-party negotiations and confirmation in every sense that the gun has been taken out of Irish politics forever.</P>
    <P>As Deputy President de Klerk said last week, any peace process vitally needs pace and momentum.  The peace process has been in increasing difficulty for many months, since the launch of the Framework Document last February. Many of us were becoming seriously concerned about the future of the peace if the impasse continued and if confidence in the process were further eroded.  That is why the visit of President Clinton was seen by many as perhaps a last chance to secure the future of the peace process.</P>
    <P>The period of stagnation has, unfortunately, seen a hardening of positions all round.  There has in our view been an unjustified attempt by the British Government to impose a precondition prior to talks, which was not mentioned in the Downing Street Declaration, the British Government's formal clarification or the many appeals to Sinn Féin made by the British Prime Minister and Secretary of State prior to the ceasefire. Fianna Fáil has protested forcefully on that subject for a number of months and against Britain's upping of the ante.</P>
    <P>Continued British insistence on maintaining that precondition in September caused the collapse of the planned summit. When the Nationalist parties in Northern Ireland were not prepared to accept the proposed outcome, the Government rightly decided to cancel the summit rather than break the consensus which underpinned the peace. The Government has not succeeded in securing at this stage any obvious softening of the British position.  Perhaps it is better to have the disagreement out in the open rather than have a pretence of agreement which tries to paper over the cracks and quickly falls asunder.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate that the visit of President Clinton has served as a catalyst for agreement.  I have no doubt that <Col N="200" /> there have been intensive, official and political contacts with Washington on all sides in the past few weeks.  Once again we must be grateful to the US Administration for providing a pressing reason for both Governments to move forward now, on the basis of whatever level of agreement they could achieve, however incomplete that might be.  We cannot expect President Clinton to come to Ireland every time there is an impasse in the peace process.</P>
    <P>It was correct that the Government should not proceed until it had a reasonable expectation of widespread acceptance and co-operation with the summit outcome.  I accept that ultimately Governments have to evaluate and decide on their own responsibility as to when they have a good chance of making the process work.  It is not always realistic to expect explicit prior support or even formal acceptance at any stage. That was Fianna Fáil's experience in the lead up to and the aftermath of the Downing Street Declaration.  I am glad that in recent weeks the Taoiseach and the Government have tried to the best of their ability to maximise the prospect of Nationalist consensus behind the best agreement that could be reached at this time.  I equally acknowledge that in important negotiations it is sometimes necessary to proceed on a basis that may be far from ideal in the interests of the greater good.  In this regard, I am glad of the positive welcome by the SDLP and the measured response by Sinn Féin to last night's outcome.</P>
    <P>Because of the unresolved difficulties and open disagreement between the two Governments on the central issue, I do not believe that the summit communiqué falls into the same category of achievement as the Downing Street Declaration or the Framework Document, though it is nonetheless important.  We hope that it will be the basis for a major step forward and not just a moving of the road block ten yards up the road.  The active and constructive engagement and interaction of all parties and both Governments in the <Col N="201" /> preparatory talks and with the International Commission can move the peace process forward greatly.  There is much sense in <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial this morning, which quotes Churchill, who said in 1942 of a turning point in the Second World War: &ldquo;This is not the end.  It is not even the beginning of the end.  But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The communiqué launches the twin track approach.  The most positive feature of it is the firm aim of launching all-party talks by the end of February, and the establishment of the international commission to find a way round the arms decommissioning problem. &ldquo;Firm aim&rdquo; is not quite the same as a fixed date, particularly as it is heavily conditional on the progress in the preparatory talks.  To get all-party talks started on time will be a formidable achievement and we hope that no one will attempt the tactic of endless delay.</P>
    <P>With regard to the launch of all-party talks, the two Governments are right to ask for co-operation from all parties and we welcome what is, on the face of it, a renewed commitment by the British and Irish Governments to achieving it.  It must seem extraordinary to the outside world, and especially to the American President's party, that after 15 months' cessation of violence the parties are still not sitting round the table.  That is quite an extraordinary situation.</P>
    <P>I am glad there is a clear confirmation by both Governments that they remain committed to the three strand process. The Ulster Unionist Party has sought in recent days to expunge Strand II in a manner that is unacceptable and in clear conflict with the position of both Governments.  A substantial section of the Northern business community are very interested in the concept of the single island economy, where it can be of advantage.  It would be absurd, for instance, to place tourism promotion in a so-called British Isles context which would do nothing for Northern Ireland tourism.  We have tried to adopt a pragmatic approach to North-South co-operation based on mutual benefit.  Others <Col N="202" /> should not allow ideological blinkers to interfere with economic logic.</P>
    <P>I am not entirely happy with the inclusion of a reference to an elected body in the communiqué in a way that does not refer, even implicitly, to long standing Nationalist objections to it.  I do not see the public debating Assembly, with all its acrimonious division, as a suitable body for discreet and sensitive negotiations, and I do not think we should be diverted from the challenge of organising all-party talks, for three reasons.  First, meetings of Belfast City Council, where in the past the DUP has hurdled insults at Sinn Féin, will do nothing to advance the cause of peace.  Second, there is no evidence that the parties on their own, without the active involvement of the two Governments, are capable of reaching agreement.  The whole point of the Framework Document was that the two Governments would help to set the agenda and continue driving it forward. Third, there is no reason to question the electoral mandate of the parties involved or to believe there has been any drastic change in the level of support of any of them.</P>
    <P>I am disturbed that the Irish Government should have agreed to the last sentence of paragraph 3 which reads: &ldquo;These preparatory talks may also extend to all steps required to establish the necessary circumstances to bring the parties together at the negotiating table, in accordance with paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 10 of the Downing Street Declaration originally referred to conditions for participation in the forum, but in the early December 1993 summit in Dublin Castle, the British Government suggested that it should apply more generally to full participation in democratic politics and freedom to join in dialogue in due course between the Governments and the political parties on the way forward.  This was for democratically mandated parties which establish a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods and which have shown that they abide by the democratic process. <Col N="203" /> The view taken by the two Irish Governments since the IRA ceasefire is that Sinn Féin fulfils the requirement of paragraph 10, as otherwise it could not be a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.</P>
    <P>I am a little surprised to see the Government apparently subscribing to a sentence which appears to call this into doubt and which provides backing for the extremely tendentious interpretation by the British Government and the Ulster Unionist Party of paragraph 10.</P>
    <P>I support paragraph 4 which says that each Government will treat the parties on an equal basis and encourage meetings among the parties but I was a little disconcerted that at the press conference immediately afterwards, John Major ruled out for the present a meeting with Gerry Adams.  How is that treating all parties equally?  That attitude also makes it more difficult for the British Government to encourage Unionists to engage in bilateral dialogue with Sinn Féin, which the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i> has been consistently urging them to do.</P>
    <P>We are happy that an international commission has been set up under the chairmanship of Senator George Mitchell to find a solution to the contentious arms decommissioning issue.  I agree with everything the Taoiseach said about Senator Mitchell.  The work he did with the Tánaiste in May this year on the economic conference demonstrated his commitment and the effort he was prepared to put into this process. I have no doubt that Senator Mitchell will do all he possibly can to make this work and we wish him well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We thank him warmly for his willingness to take on this task so quickly.  On the basis that he apparently has only until mid January, every day will count but the Senator is a good negotiator from times past.  This is essentially international arbitration under American chairmanship and <Col N="204" /> another example of the US Administration, under President Clinton, being willing to take on, in certain instances at least, the role of the ultimate guarantor of fair play.  I hope the commission will receive full co-operation from both republicans and loyalists so that when the commission reports, people will see a clear prospect of full scale arms decommissioning when negotiations are complete, or on a phased basis while they are in progress if that can be agreed.</P>
      <P>There seems to be differences between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister as to whether the international commission can provide a way around the Washington 3 condition. Last night, John Major said: &ldquo;We won't be asking the international body to question our position on the Washington 3 criteria&rdquo;, whereas the Taoiseach said that the aim of the process is problem-solving, that the international body is independent and that people will be able to make submissions on absolutely any matter that is relevant. We have to hope that the international commission will provide a clear way forward on all aspects of the issue, including a way around the road block of Washington 3.</P>
      <P>In Cannes last June, John Major suggested the international commission should look at &ldquo;the how, the when and the who&rdquo;.  I am sorry that he now appears to have excluded &ldquo;the when&rdquo; from the remit.  I regret also that the Irish Government, despite strenuous efforts which we acknowledge, did not succeed in getting Washington 3 explicitly included in the remit of the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The British Government seems to have hardened its position on the description of the arms to be removed, clearly identifying them as solely related to paramilitary weapons.  A separate paragraph speaks of the two Governments continuing to take responsive measures, advised by their respective security authorities, as the threat reduces.  It is ironic, and a great pity, that the British Government should not <Col N="205" /> take the advice of its security authorities that a gesture on decommissioning is irrelevant in security terms.</P>
    <P>We note the British Government has succeeded in introducing the whole decommissioning issue into the preparatory talks, partially shifting the onus for maintaining the Washington 3 demands towards the Unionists.  Both have not slammed the doors.  If peace is to progress, the way must be left open for confidence-building by means other than a demand for surrender and we support the Government's position on that.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, we support the advance that last night's communiqué represents.  Indeed, we hope it represents a substantial advance.  We believe it creates challenges and opportunities for all parties, including Sinn Féin.  I will thank President Clinton for his continuing valuable role, and for the help his visit will provide to this country, when he arrives here.  I would like to compliment the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and their respective civil servants for the work, commitment, time and effort they put in over the past number of weeks and for bringing the peace process forward and, more importantly, bringing it back from the brink of disaster.  I hope their efforts have proved successful. There will be a sense of relief everywhere that the peace process is back on the road, mingled with few illusions about the difficulties of the way ahead but we will watch that as it develops.  We congratulate the efforts of yesterday and will watch matters develop as the weeks move on.</P>

      <P>I warmly welcome the launch of the twin track initiative.  I believe it represents a genuine effort to revive and advance the peace process.  I congratulate the Taoiseach and commend his efforts, and those of the Tánaiste, and their respective officials for bringing us to this stage.  I also compliment the British Prime Minister and his officials.  Without them we could not have seen this initiative launched.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would be wrong not to single out for praise President Clinton, not just for <Col N="206" /> the catalyst role he played in the run up to last night's communiqué, but for the consistent and thorough interest he has taken in the peace process.  On St. Patrick's Day last year he said that Ireland had a true friend in the White House; I certainly think we have.</P>
    <P>If one wanted to be sceptical or cynical about the twin track initiative, one could be.  Many will ask what has changed since last September.  Already today, several Unionist and Sinn Féin politicians have described it as a fudge.  If one wanted to be pessimistic, carp and adopt a begrudging attitude one could certainly find flaws.  I want to pose a challenge to the sceptics and the cynics. Do they want to see a complete breakdown in the peace process?  Do they want to see troops back on the street in Northern Ireland?  Do they want to see a renewal of the violence we had for 25 of the past 26 years?  There is no doubt in my mind that violence will ensue if there is not an all-inclusive political settlement.</P>
    <P>In all the circumstances, the twin track initiative launched last night is the best available option.  At a minimum it keeps the peace process going, it maintains it.  It revives the process at many levels and adds a new momentum and dynamic to it, which was essential.  It does not resolve the deadlock in relation to illegal arms and it does not allow for the commencement of all-inclusive talks but it provides a mechanism which can, with a little courage and sacrifice, provide us with a formula, a way out of the current stalemate.  If there is goodwill, courage and sacrifice &mdash; I emphasise those words &mdash; then it will not be impossible to resolve the current deadlock.</P>
    <P>I emphasise the words &ldquo;courage&rdquo; and &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo; because the politicians from both communities in Northern Ireland in particular will need these qualities in abundance over the next few weeks. They can choose to remain in their respective political bunkers, reassuring each other of the integrity of their position, hurling political abuse at each <Col N="207" /> other and telling the Governments to get lost.  However, they know that this will be a recipe for a disaster.  Instead they can look at what has happened in South Africa, the Middle East and the Balkans and ask, why not us too?  Why can we not build peace?  Why can we not move away from our entrenched positions?  Why can we not create in Northern Ireland a partnership, a genuinely shared society where Unionist and Nationalist may not have to love each other but can respect each other and feel at home there?</P>
    <P>Unionism and Nationalism are incompatible but we have to find in Northern Ireland, as in so many conflicts throughout the world, a structure which can accommodate the different identities and aspirations of both communities. The twin track initiative throws down that challenge to the protagonists on each side.  If they show courage and vision they can rise to that challenge.</P>
    <P>Many would say that Senator Mitchell's commission will need the wisdom of Solomon if it is to chart its way out of the arms logjam.  I do not intend today, nor do I believe it is correct, to be prescriptive or dismissive about its role. Senator Mitchell and his colleagues will bring an experience to the commission and if they can summon up the expertise used in the resolution of so many other conflicts throughout the world then they will have the capacity to succeed.  The commission will acquire its own dynamic and while neither the Government nor anyone else is saying it will be bound by its recommendations &mdash; it is merely an advisory commission &mdash; we would be foolish not to take them very seriously.</P>
    <P>There is a strange paradox surrounding the impasse in the peace process. The immediate protagonists are very wary, suspicious, ungenerous and unyielding of each other.  On the other hand, there is extraordinary commitment and goodwill from people far beyond our shores who want to genuinely help us to resolve the problem <Col N="208" /> which has bedevilled this island and Anglo-Irish relations for many years. The central task of constitutional politics is to create in Northern Ireland a workable foundation of trust which will be sufficient to support all-inclusive dialogue aimed at bringing about a political settlement.  There is no point in calling talks if everyone will not be present.  In the talks about talks process it is important for everything to be on the agenda.  We cannot rule out anybody's preferred option.  This is not desirable, generous or workable in the present circumstances.</P>
    <P>What we need in Northern Ireland is some level of trust.  We will not achieve total trust in a matter of weeks or months nor do we need to.  The problem at the moment is the absence of any trust in some of the key relationships. The arms issue is a key for building trust at one level.  Those who want to be treated equally and who want their electoral mandates to be respected must know that their association with paramilitary organisations places them in a self-imposed handicap.  Total disarmament is not necessary to create trust.  In the first instance it would not be possible to verify it and, second, it is always possible to manufacture more explosives and to get more arms.  Those who are committed to democratic politics must show a willingness to travel down the road of disarmament.  Many ordinary people wonder why those who are committed to peace want to hold on to every ounce of semtex and every weapon. What we need is a willingness to travel down the road of making a gesture, which they alone can make.</P>
    <P>Equally on the Unionist side, the &ldquo;no surrender&rdquo;, &ldquo;not an inch&rdquo; and other remarks we heard today are no longer acceptable in the context of the problem that is Northern Ireland.  The Deputy President of South Africa said majoritarianism had to be ruled out if they wanted to resolve the problem in South Africa.  There is no room for majoritarism in Northern Ireland either.  People have to be generous and agree to share Northern Ireland on an equal basis, <Col N="209" /> respecting each other's identify and aspirations.  The late President Rabin said. &ldquo;You make peace with your enemies, not your friends.&rdquo; The Unionist politicians in particular should remember that as they have much to gain from a political settlement in Northern Ireland.  Their community has suffered enormously.  They showed great fortitude during the 25 years of violence and I hope they bring that same fortitude to the political process which is now required.</P>
    <P>What is needed in Northern Ireland is a new, normal society where everybody can feel at home.  The three sets of relationships must be appreciated and respected.  Regardless of how the geography or numbers change, there will always be a role for North-South and British-Irish relations.  Even if the numbers go the other way the then minority are entitled to maintain a link with Britain.  In the context of Northern Ireland the three sets of relationships are the key and contact and respect between those relationships has to be the order of the day.</P>
    <P>We need a new political order, not a Unionist or a provisional veto.  We need to ensure that everybody is treated equally and that the courage and vision shown in the Balkans, South Africa and the Middle East becomes the norm in Ireland.  Shakespeare and Henry VIII spoke about the tender leaves of hope blossoming.  I hope Senator Mitchell's commission and the talks about talks which offer tender leaves of hope will blossom and that people will give it a chance.  As we approach the second Christmas of peace in Northern Ireland in almost a quarter of a century the onus is on us all to play our part and to be generous.  Many of us who participated in the forum did not find it easy to work with those whose <i>raison d'être</i>, methods and pure existence we had questioned over many years.  Yet that presented us with a challenge.  Many of us have found the experience to be extremely beneficial and as we have spoken to people <Col N="210" /> and got to know them we have discovered we have much more in common than that which divides us.</P>
    <P>The politicians in Northern Ireland are the only ones who can solve their problems.  No matter how much the two Governments do, at the end of the day it will be John Alderdice, John Hume, Gerry Adams, David Trimble and hopefully, Ian Paisley who will decide the future of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Regardless of what we or the Governments do, any deal agreed by them will be unbeatable.  I wish the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the others involved in this delicate process well.  I hope for all our sakes that it succeeds.</P>

      <P>I join the other party Leaders in warmly welcoming the communiqué agreed by the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister last night.  It is a very significant breakthrough, the importance of which should not be underestimated.  In many respects the communiqué is on a par with the Downing Street Declaration and the Framework Document.  The Downing Street Declaration was a truly mould-breaking set of political principles which set out a new approach to the problems of Northern Ireland.  The Framework Document provided a framework for the good governance of Northern Ireland and the relationship between Northern Ireland and the Republic.  The communiqué provides a mechanism which will facilitate the continuing journey from the aspirations of the Downing Street Declaration to the proposals of the Framework Document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The communiqué ends an impasse in the process which had gone on for far too long.  The whole nature of this process from the very beginning has been that it has almost always taken us longer than anyone envisaged to get from points A to B.  There have been other difficulties that have taken great time and effort to overcome, but it is fair to say that the impasse over the past few months had gone on so long and seemed <Col N="211" /> so intractable that some of the protagonists began to seriously wonder if the whole process was running into a dead end.</P>
    <P>It was not a prospect that the Government was prepared to contemplate and the Taoiseach, the Government in general and a wide range of officials have put enormous time and effort into finding a way out of the deadlock.  As a result of last night's agreement we can now all face the future with renewed hope and new optimism.</P>
    <P>The agreement has secured a number of the Government's key political objectives in regard to moving the process forward.  The two Governments have publicly stated their commitment to the early launch of all-party negotiations with the firm aim of achieving this by the end of February.  The two Governments have agreed to invite the parties to intensive preparatory talks which will have an open agenda, allowing any party to raise a relevant matter.  The two Governments are committed to treating each party on an equal basis.</P>
    <P>The decommissioning issue clearly has not been solved, but the agreement to establish the international body means that the problem can be examined and progress made on it, without the continued political gridlock of the past few months.  This agreement provides a challenge for everyone.  For Sinn Féin it clearly offers the prospect of involvement in early all party talks, but it provides for them also the challenge of seriously addressing the weapons issue.  For the Unionist parties and the Alliance party it provides the opportunity to bring forward proposals for a new elected body, but presents them with the challenge of entering into serious dialogue with those who have different aspirations and proposals.</P>
    <P>There should be no rush to judgment on the communiqué and I am glad there has been none.  Apart from the negative reaction of the Democratic Unionist Party, the reactions of Sinn Féin, the Ulster Unionist Party and the loyalist <Col N="212" /> parties have been cautious, but generally positive.  In many respects this mirrors the reaction to the Downing Street Declaration in December 1993.</P>
    <P>Let us see what the communiqué offers.  All parties, North and South, are committed to talks, although some set preconditions.  All parties, North and South, are committed to removing the gun from Irish politics, although some differ from others as to how and when this can be achieved.  Last night's agreement provides a mechanism for progress on these issues.</P>
    <P>Some people are describing it as a fudge but that is too easy and does no credit to those who may seek to opt out on that basis.  However, I do not accept that anything that breaks the long running impasse and moves us from the crisis of which people have been warning for months, deserves to be dismissed as a fudge.  The agreement should be considered on its merits.  It warrants the most serious consideration by all parties and by some more than others.  The issues in question are too serious for knee-jerk reaction.  This is not a time for flag waving or camp following.  It is a time to consider the future, to consolidate the peace and to lay the foundations for political progress in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Before any party is tempted to rush to judgment and dismiss the agreement out of hand, let them contemplate the alternative.  Institutionalised stalemate will simply reinforce existing divisions, making political progress impossible. Inflexibility masquerading as principle will yield the same result.  Before any party rejects this agreement, let us hear their proposals for the inclusive political progress and civilianisation of Northern Ireland society, which are capable of winning the same broad political support that the communiqué has already received.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that in the past 24 hours this agreement has received the full backing of the democratically elected Governments of this State and of the United Kingdom.  It has <Col N="213" /> been warmly welcomed by the government of the United States.  The reaction of the SDLP has been most positive and the Opposition parties in this House and in Westminister have been generous in their response.  There are no proposals for moving the process on being put forward by any individual party in Northern Ireland which on their own have the potential of winning the same widespread support.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, last night's communiqué does not attempt to provide a political solution to the problems of Northern Ireland, but rather provides a mechanism for moving the process forward. It provides a structure to enable people to get into discussions and to start building the trust that is essential if a political solution is to be found but it will work only if it is used and particularly if it is used by the parties in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The two Governments can provide the framework, but only the parties within Northern Ireland can deliver the solution because the problem of Northern Ireland is not a conflict between Britain and Ireland, it is rather a conflict between two communities in Northern Ireland with conflicting national allegiances.  I hope that all parties in Northern Ireland will seize the opportunity to achieve political progress and copperfasten the peace.</P>
    <P>I hope, in particular, that the agreement that so many people have worked so hard to achieve will bring an end to dangerous and foolish talk by those who should know better that the peace process is in crisis or at an end.  The peace will end only if those who put down their guns and put away their explosives last year, decide to take them out again. These comments not only cause unnecessary worry and concern to those who last year breathed a collective sigh of relief at the ending of the 25 year campaign of violence, but are also music to the ears of those who want to believe that the IRA ceasefire is simply a tactic and that a return to violence is inevitable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="214" /> While not underestimating the problems that still remain to be addressed, we must not lose sight of what has been achieved as a result of the cessation of violence by the paramilitary organisations. Without doubt the single most important achievement is that scores &mdash; perhaps hundreds &mdash; of people who might otherwise have died violently are still alive.</P>
    <P>This period of peace has allowed the two Governments to respond in a number of ways.  The State of Emergency has been lifted in the Republic and around half of IRA prisoners have benefited from the Government's policy of early release.  Sinn Féin has regular access to Government at the highest level.  In Northern Ireland security measures have been scaled down; broadcasting restrictions have been ended; there is now no British Army presence on the streets of most areas of Northern Ireland; 50 per cent remission has been restored and almost 100 prisoners released.  Most significantly of all, Sinn Féin leaders are now able to meet British ministers at the highest level.</P>
    <P>People who lived for years behind barricaded doors are once again able to leave their front doors open.  The towns and cities of Northern Ireland, many of which for so long looked like a cross between a bomb site and a prison camp, have come alive again and are buzzing with excitement.  We cannot afford to jeopardise what has been achieved.</P>
    <P>As a result of the ceasefires and what has been achieved since, it is now possible to conceive of a purely political settlement.  This will take time &mdash; not only to copperfasten peace but also to address the legacy of 25 years of violence and generations of discrimination. Emotions are still extremely raw, as was evident in the ugly confrontations and spate of church and hall burnings that were a feature of this summer.  The people of Northern Ireland require a period of recovery from 25 years of sectarian savagery.  Time is needed to build <Col N="215" /> trust.  Time will also provide the opportunity to develop and devise a new political culture in Northern Ireland, a political culture that is accommodating and inclusive, not just of the different national allegiances and moral viewpoints, but which also advances the equality of men and women, which is committed to sustainable economic development and to a participative democracy in place of the rigid and sectarian thinking that has held sway for so long.</P>
    <P>This has been a good week for this country.  Last Friday the people showed compassion for those families affected by marital breakdown and indicated their preference for continued movement towards a more tolerant and inclusive society.  Last night the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister dispelled the gloom surrounding the Northern Ireland situation and provided grounds for new hope and optimism.  In his opening remarks the Taoiseach acknowledged the critical role played by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Justice, the officials and myself but I would like to pay a tribute to the Taoiseach's handling of the very difficult situation during the past few weeks.  It is without doubt his drive, energy, vision, determination and commitment and his refusal to throw in the towel that made last night's agreement possible.  It is that kind of commitment, drive and refusal to accept defeat that will eventually bring a settlement to the troubled people of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring) Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)">
      <NameTxt>Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Government I express appreciation for the words of welcome from the Opposition parties for last night's agreement. We appreciate their support.  In the early days of the peace process none of us expected that the path ahead would be easy.  We did not imagine that agreement would be smoothly and quickly achieved.  When I spoke in this House <Col N="216" /> after the publication of the Joint Declaration, I foresaw lengthy and careful negotiations involving both Governments and all those in Northern Ireland committed to the democratic process. Inevitably, progress has been uneven, sometimes unexpectedly rapid and sometimes frustratingly slow, but the key point is that there must be a momentum, an impulse towards the achievement of a lasting and comprehensive settlement founded on the principle of consent.  Hope is the essential motor of the process.</P>
      <P>The fundamental objective of the communiqué which the Irish and British Governments issued last night, and of the twin-track approach we have launched, is to restore momentum to the peace process and to set in motion a fresh dynamic.  As President Clinton said in his most welcome statement of support this morning, it gives us &ldquo;an opportunity to begin a dialogue in which all views are represented and all voices can be heard.</P>
      <P>Since 1980, the consistent assessment of successive Irish Governments has been that the close co-operation of the two sovereign authorities is an essential enabling factor for progress.  This strategic analysis underlay our approach to the negotiation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement, the Joint Declaration and the Framework Document.  As in all such relationships, there can be disagreements and phases of hard and difficult discussion, but it is necessary constantly to bear in mind the fundamental necessity of our partnershp.  That in turn derives from the reality of the Northern situation.  The two communities there define themselves in terms which transcend Northern Ireland, which thus imply, and require, the involvement of the two Governments.  There can be no internal settlement, and it is therefore for the Governments to shape the framework where a settlement becomes possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cessation of violence is an unprecedented opportunity which we must seize.  For too long we have had a dangerous stand-off.  This involved the <Col N="217" /> deeply held position of the British Government, as set out by Sir Patrick Mayhew in Washington, that a start of actual decommissioning was a necessary precondition for Sinn Féin participation in negotiations and an equally firm conviction in the republican movement that any attempt to meet such a precondition would precipitate a reaction which would be deeply destabilising in terms of the really crucial goal, namely, maintenance of the ceasefires.  We worked long and hard with the British Government from June onwards, and with particular intensity from the start of this month, to reach agreement on a way to move forward to all-party talks.</P>
    <P>It is easy to misunderstand &mdash; or misrepresent &mdash; the position of the Irish Government.  We want decommissioning as soon as possible.  All the weapons must be got rid of.  Talks must be based on a genuine commitment to peaceful and democratic values.  There can be no &ldquo;try it and see&rdquo; approach to the democratic process or to political negotiations.  None of this means that decommissioning must necessarily be a precondition for negotiations.  It means rather that it should be a vital goal in negotiations.  If we really want to achieve that goal, it makes sense to situate it in a context where it is realistically attainble, rather than one where the symbolism and history weight strongly against it.</P>
    <P>Inevitably, what has emerged from a period of particularly arduous negotiation is a compromise.  Neither Government would claim that everything in the communiqué is exactly as it would have wished.  Likewise, some of the Northern parties will no doubt find elements of the approach now agreed not immediatley to their taste.  Some doubts have already been expressed. Nevertheless, the essence of negotiation is compromise.  In a situation such as exists in Northern Ireland, where the divisions are so deep and have been exacerbated by the experience of many years of conflict, compromise is bound to be painful.  It will be painful when we come to discuss fundamental issues of <Col N="218" /> substance.  Inevitably, that is also the case even at this preliminary stage.</P>
    <P>To all those who may cavil about one aspect or another of the twin-track approach, there are two simple questions to be asked.  Would an alternative genuinely have a better chance of advancing the situation?  Are the objections so powerful as to justify standing aloof from this stage of the peace process and increasing the risk that, unimaginably, it could fail, with all the terrible consequences that would entail? The answer to both questions must surely be no.</P>
    <P>Moreover, as a careful reading of this communiqué makes abundantly clear, it does not involve any sacrifice of fundamental principles.  What is involved is a pragmatic and reasonable attempt to find a way of advancing matters to a point where we are able to talk seriously on an agreed basis about the key substantive issues.  I cannot see how this could be represented as a threat to cherished values or as an invitation to surrender.</P>
    <P>The communiqué makes clear that the two Governments are firmly committed to the early launch of all-party negotiations.  It puts in operational terms the position set out in the joint framework document and repeated on many occasions since then.  Peace has lasted for well over a year.  It has already transformed the daily lives of many people in Northern Ireland and has opened up new vistas for social and economic progress on the island as a whole.  It is vital that it is now underpinned by a political settlement addressing all the relationships involved.</P>
    <P>That settlement, which must ultimately be democratically ratified by the people, North and South, has to be negotiated by the two Governments and by the parties in Northern Ireland.  As I have already said, comprehensive negotiations on matters of substance will inevitably be lengthy and complex.  That is why it is important that they get started as soon as possible.  The basic questions which will have to be addressed are well-known.  They will not <Col N="219" /> change with the passage of time, nor will the essential character of the identities and aspirations which must be accommodated. There is no point in hoping that if matters are put off long enough Unionists will have turned into Nationalists, or <i>vice versa.</i> On the contrary, delaying the start of serious all-party talks would simply allow for the build-up of resentments and frustrations, calling into question the seriousness and good faith of those responsible.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, we have indicated that it is our firm aim that all-party negotiations be launched by the end of February next year.  Some will claim this date is unrealistically close, that we will never succeed in reaching agreement on the numerous procedural and other questions by that time.  I would merely point to the experience of the last few days, and say that where there is a will, there is a way.  The end of February is a firm objective.  It is the considered view of the two Governments that the objective should prove achievable.</P>
    <P>Our resolve not to let it slip reflected in the commitment by the two Governments to meet to review progress before that date.  We hope and expect a similar level of commitment from the political parties.</P>
    <P>As the communiqué says, the preparatory talks will be intensive.  Their remit will be to reach widespread agreement on the basis, participation, structure, format and agenda to bring all parties together for substantive negotiations aimed at a political settlement based on consent.  Of course, we are not starting from scratch.  The 1991-92 Talks were based on a very carefully prepared and agreed formula.  It is our belief and expectation that the principles and methodology set out in the former Secretary of State's statement of 26 March 1991 to the House of Commons offer a solid basis for discussion on this occasion too.  In particular, it is essential that all the relevant relationships be addressed comprehensively and <Col N="220" /> in an interlocking three-stranded process &mdash; as yesterday's communiqué made very clear.  We could not envisage a process whereby one set of relationships, or one dimension of the situation, was given priority over the others, whether explicitly or implicitly.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, new participants &mdash; Sinn Féin and the two loyalist parties &mdash; are now in the equation.  There has been a change of leader in the largest Northern party, the Ulster Unionist Party. Those who were involved in the 1991-92 talks will in the light of experience perhaps have views on possible changes to, or improvements in, the procedures which were followed then.  We stated that the preparatory talks will have an open agenda, allowing any party to raise relevant matters.  One issue which we have mentioned as a possible topic for consideration is the question of some form of elected body, variants of which have been suggested by the UUP, DUP, Alliance Party and the PUP.</P>
    <P>The two Governments have placed this possibility firmly within the context of all-party negotiations, involving in appropriate strands both Governments and all the relevant Northern Ireland parties and directed to addressing in a comprehensive manner the relevant relationships in an interlocking three-stranded process.  In other words, what might be discussed is whether and how an elected body could be incorporated into or could contribute to that wider framework.  Within those parameters, we owe it to those who wish to propose some form of body a fair hearing, as we do to all serious proposals.</P>
    <P>By the same token, they will have to listen carefully to the answers they receive, and will have to be prepared to respond in their turn.  Dialogue and trust go hand-in-hand.  But those who insist on the need for trust must open themselves to its creation.  This must be a two-way street.</P>
    <P>The two Governments will in the next day or two write to the relevant Northern parties inviting them to initial meetings with the two Governments jointly. It is an explicit principle of our <Col N="221" /> approach that each Government will in the course of preparatory talks treat each party on an equal basis.  Each will rely on the persuasiveness of its arguments and on its democratic mandate. We are also open to approaches from any other democratically mandated parties or individuals.  As we have said in the communiqué, we will encourage formats for meetings with and among the parties which might further the objective of the preparatory talks.  As both Governments manage the process of political talks, we will of course be building on existing exchanges and bilateral contacts.  In general, we intend to be flexible and creative in our approach.  However, the Government's view is that the more we manage to meet multilaterally, the better, and this is the approach we will be adopting. This will make it easier to reach agreement on knotty points.  Moreover, it would allow parties which wish to put forward their own distinctive proposals &mdash; for example an elected assembly &mdash; to argue their case directly and to reply directly to counter-arguments.</P>
    <P>As I have made clear, it is the unswerving ambition of the Irish Government, as of the British Government, to see all arms removed from the Irish political equation for once and for all.  Moreover, we share the desire that this should occur as rapidly as possible. What, however, we have disagreed about is our assessment of when the decommissioning process might realistically be expected to begin.  Our analysis, as the Taoiseach and I have repeatedly said, is that this is regrettably not attainable in advance of substantive all-party talks.  We wish it were otherwise.  We have stated that no threat or hint of coercion, however remote, would be acceptable in a talks process.  And we have said, disarmament, though not a pre-condition for entry into dialogue, would be a reasonable pre-condition for the achievement of a settlement.  As is common knowledge, the British Government does not share this view, despite our best efforts, and those of the parties with the best insight into the <Col N="222" /> mindset of the republican movement, to convince it.  This disagreement, which of course also extends to the political parties, has paralysed the peace process for several months.  Accordingly it was vital to find a way out of the stalemate in which we all found ourselves.  We had to find a way of throwing new light on the issue, of looking at it afresh.</P>
    <P>Parallel with the political track of preparatory talks, the two Governments have agreed to establish an international body to provide an independent assessment of the decommissioning issue.  It is to be chaired by a most eminent American, Senator George Mitchell, whose commitment to Ireland and to the cause of peace is already evident to us all through his work as an adviser to the President on economic issues.  He will be assisted by two other figures of international standing, whose names will be announced very shortly, when the necessary formalities and courtesies are completed.</P>
    <P>I stress that that is an independent and, by virtue of its membership, a most authoritative body.  Specific requirements for its report have been set down in the communiqué.  It is concerned in particular with illegal arms, between which arms and the arms of the legitimately-constituted security forces we seen no equivalence.</P>
    <P>But, as is made clear, the Governments are not setting limits to the scope of the submissions which may be made to the body.  It has a wide remit.  It is envisaged that it will consult widely, and that parties will submit their analysis on matters relevant to decommissioning.  It will be for the body, in reaching conclusions within its remit, to consider such evidence on its merits.  Thus it will be open to all of the political parties in the North to submit their own analyses of matters relevant to the decommissioning issue, including all aspects of the so-called Washington conditions.  No artificial constraints will be imposed on any party as it seeks to put forward the views of its supporters or the community it represents.</P>

      <Col N="223" /> The body is to submit its report to the two Governments by mid-January next. Neither Government, nor indeed any other party co-operating with the work of the body, is bound in advance to accept its recommendations.  But we and the British are committed to considering carefully any recommendations it makes, and to give them due weight on their merits.  Both Governments are committed to consider constructively any practicable suggestions that could help bring all parties into negotiations.</P>
    <P>There is no point in denying that there is continued disagreement on the relationship between decommissioning and political negotiations.  I am hopeful that, by virtue of its independence and its authority, the body's analysis of the situation will compel the serious consideration of all involved, and that by standing back and looking anew at the issue it will be possible for a fresh perspective to emerge.  The body will be working in parallel with the political track.  Its findings will not be looked at in isolation: all of us will have to take into account developments on both fronts.  We hope there will be a positive interaction between the two tracks, and it is our expectation that, taken together, they will help to build the confidence which is required for early movement into all-party talks, which all of us on this island wish so feverently to see in progress.</P>
    <P>As President Clinton said in London this morning, the twin-track process is a framework where a solution can be found.  The capital point is that there is now a fresh dynamic, a new opportunity for discussion and dialogue.  The prospect of all-party negotiations is now closer than before.  The way forward to such negotiations has been charted and over the coming weeks it will be possible for the parties to engage in intensive discussion on how they should be organised.  The two Governments are firmly committed to moving ahead by the end of February.  Not to grasp this chance would be a tragic error, and the potential benefits of participating in the <Col N="224" /> twin-track approach greatly outweigh any possible risks to any party.</P>
    <P>I would like to express my gratitude for the expressions of support and encouragement which we have already received from our friends abroad.  My Department and our embassies are today engaged in comprehensively briefing foreign governments and their embassies here.  I should of course place on record our particularly deep appreciation for the support and encouragement of President Clinton and his administration, whose committed and even-handed involvement has been an important factor for progress and has helped the two Governments.  We all look forward to making this clear to him in person during his imminent and very welcome visit to this island.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay particular thanks to the Taoiseach for his enormous effort and energy in recent weeks during difficult negotiations, and to other members of the Government.  Without that support and strength I do not believe we would have arrived at the stage we are now.</P>
    <P>I would also like to thank the Opposition parties for the constructive approach they have taken in relation to Northern Ireland.  At a difficult and sensitive time it is important that, while not surrendering the right to offer sincere criticism, we do not play politics with the situation.  I hope that the bipartisan spirit which has been so important at other crucial moments will continue to dominate our efforts in relation to Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Title>Courts and Court Officers Bill, 1995: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill.  Because of the extremely serious background to the introduction of this Bill, and the fact that one of the most effective Governments in the history of this State went out of office on account of a related issue, I would like <Col N="225" /> to initially comment on the origins of it. Towards the end of last year the appointment of the President of the High Court became a matter of serious controversy between the two partners in Government, and, in particular, between the Taoiseach and Tánaiste. The Tánaiste was particularly concerned about the appointment of the Attorney General to the Presidency of the High Court.  The main cause of his concern seemed to be that the suggested appointee was too conservative and without experience as an ordinary judge of the High or Supreme Court.</P>
      <P>In order to narrow any possibility of serious controversy in the future regarding senior appointments to the Judiciary, it was agreed between Fianna Fáil and Labour that a more formal legal framework should be provided for use in the future management of such appointments.  Such a move was strongly supported by both parties and drafting of the appropriate legislation was virtually complete at the time of the change of Government.</P>
      <P>The question therefore immediately arises now as to why there has been a delay of 12 months in bringing the rainbow coalition version of the Bill before this House.  Since the Labour Party was fully involved in bringing the previous draft to near completion, why has it taken at least one-third of the life time of this Government to bring the Bill before us?  To put it mildly, it is extremely difficult to reconcile the headlong haste of late 1994 with the leisurely pace adopted in dealing with this legislation in 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first question to be addressed when examining the 51 sections, many sub-sections and the schedules of the Bill, is has the delay been worthwhile and has it resulted in any refinement of excellent legislation?  The answer unfortunately seems to be no on both counts. While some aspects of the proposed legislation are good it is extremely disappointing in general.  It is particularly weak in dealing with senior appointments of the type which caused such serious controversy and damage last <Col N="226" /> year.  Taking the various provisions of Part IV as a whole, can anyone argue with conviction that some value-added component has been added to the process?</P>
    <P>Part I of the Bill involves transferring the responsibilities of the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Courts-Martial Appeal Court to the Supreme Court.  At first glance this seems to be a sensible proposal and may result in the more efficient operation of these courts. Similarly, Part II seems to be largely without controversy.  The increase in the number of ordinary members of the Supreme Court is welcome and signifies an acknowledgement of the massive overload of these systems at the present. The decision to allow the division of sittings of the Supreme Court is also a practical acceptance of the implications of increased throughput and workload.</P>
    <P>The increases in the number of judges of the High, Circuit and District Courts are also welcome as the credibility of our court system is continually undermined by understaffing.</P>
    <P>Part IV deals with judicial appointments and is without doubt the kernel of the legislation.  If the happenings of last year are to mean anything, then this element of the Bill should provide a clear example of openness, transparency and accountability in senior State appointments.  Is this the case?</P>
    <P>The answer is unfortunately a very definite no.  The proposed structure seems as likely to cause controversy and confusion and result in a new standard. Despite the various provisions of sections 12 to 23, the new advisory board seems to have little teeth in the final analysis.  I am surprised it is proposed that the Government, through the Minister for Justice, may directly appoint as many as three of the ten person board as well as the Government appointed Attorney General as an <i>ex officio</i> member.  In the context of last year's controversy, this simple initial proposal could easily be interpreted as cynical and almost unbelievable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="227" /> Similarly, the manner in which the proposed list of candidates is drawn up raises a number of questions.  I am surprised to note the general nature of the board's procedures.  Other than employing a number of routine techniques for recruiting staff, for example advertising, head-hunting to a certain degree and interviewing candidates, what precise value-added qualities does the Bill bring to the process?  For example is there any attempt to specify minimum professional qualifications? Other than refer to minimal experience requirements, the Bill does not set precise minimal standards in the appointment of new judges.</P>
    <P>In terms of fair play and justice I have serious reservations regarding the provision which allows the board to consult persons concerning the suitability of applicants.  Since the board is to operate with total confidentiality, what safeguard has an applicant to ensure that his or her candidacy is not seriously undermined by unknown parties?</P>
    <P>The ultimate task of the board seems to be simply to provide a crude shortlist to the Minister which he, or she, may or may not decide to use.  The provision in section 16 (6) that &ldquo;the Government shall firstly consider for appointment those persons whose names have been recommended&rdquo; does not seem to offer much in terms of real power to the Advisory Board which has laboured to produce the shortlist of ten applicants. Presumably the board cannot express its order of preference for the individuals on the shortlist.</P>
    <P>Another matter that concerns me is the extremely vague guidelines given to the board by which it must presumably assess all applicants that come before it. For example, it must ensure the applicant has a degree of competency appropriate to the position of judge.  In what manner and at what cost in terms of time is this task to be carried out?</P>
    <P>Since the proposed Advisory Board is to include the most senior figures in our judicial system, will the requirements of section 16 (7) place a major further <Col N="228" /> workload on the shoulders of the already hard pressed individuals involved?  How is the group to fully and fairly assess the character and temperament of each applicant?  It seems in reality such tasks will of necessity be delegated to the administrative support staff of the Advisory Board which would not be consistent with the objectives of placing the overall process in the hands of the most senior figures in our judicial system.</P>
    <P>While I can understand the purpose of section 17 which removes sitting judges from the consideration of the board, it further dilutes the relevance of the work and recommendations of the Advisory Board.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals in section 19 which oblige newly appointed judges to undertake, where considered necessary, further courses of education and training subsequent to their appointment.  If our Judiciary is to maintain the necessary mastery of both domestic and European Union legal developments, it is critical that the necessary resources are allocated and provisions are made to ensure the maximum possible degree of participation in continuing education.</P>
    <P>Anyone who followed the dramatic events of November and December last year, will be surprised when they read section 23 which deals with the appointment of the Chief Justice, President of the High Court, President of the Circuit Court and President of the District Court.  It simply states that the Government must have &ldquo;regard first to the qualifications and suitability of persons who are serving at that time as judges&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In general, I welcome a number of provisions which deal with the Master and Taxing Master of the High Court, the Circuit and District Courts.  As a layman I am somewhat surprised at the provision in Part X, section 68 (3) which involves both the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court in determining the number of judges sitting on a High Court circuit.  I welcome the specific provision of resources for further training in section 80.</P>
    <P>I support specific elements of the Bill <Col N="229" /> while I am extremely disappointed with the provisions on the appointment of new members of our Judiciary.  Despite the best intentions of those who drafted this legislation, the net effect is likely to be either trivial or act as a source of confusion and controversy.  Any pretence at serving the cause of openness and transparency seems to have little substance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrancesFitzgerald" hpid="Ms F. Fitzgerald Ms F. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Ms F. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to the debate and congratulate the Minister for Justice on introducing this important legislation. It is interesting, given the changes in Irish law, the increased volume of legislation passed in the House, the increased access to the courts which the people have and our tendency to use the law, the increasing amount of EC legislation which is interpreted in the courts, the general change in social attitudes and the increasing number of family law cases which come before the courts, that the court system has been unreformed for so long.  The Minister for Justice has inherited a system which badly needs to be overhauled and modernised and is in need of a new framework as well as additional personnel and resources.</P>
      <P>It is understandable that Fianna Fáil would ruminate over this legislation given the role of the original version in the events surrounding the change of Government, but its ambivalence is not justified.  The Bill has been streamlined. The suggestion that there should be an extra tier, a court of appeal, has not been incorporated in this Bill as there is no necessity for it.  The issue is being dealt with in a different way.</P>
      <P>The Bill covers a range of issues, including the appointment of judges and the establishment of a new body to play a part in that process as well as administrative matters which remained to be dealt with for many years.  The many Fianna Fáil Ministers for Justice failed to do the work that needed to be done in the courts system.  The public is very much aware of its inadequacies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years I have listened to <Col N="230" /> women speaking about the barriers to be overcome in gaining access to the courts, the formalised rituals they find off-putting and the delays.  Frequently, cases are adjourned which, in turn, can lead to others much further down the list, unexpectedly having to attend court.  This caused problems for the public and, unfortunately, brought the law into disrepute as there is a perception that justice is not being done.  I welcome the Bill for all these reasons.</P>
    <P>Various changes have been made since 1927, but this is the first time legislation as strong as this has been introduced. It is strange that we have had to wait so long for it.  Legal matters were a major part of the debate prior to the divorce referendum.  This illustrates the central role of the legal system in introducing social change.  There is a necessity to ensure that the justice system is strong, well administered, organised and speedy.</P>
    <P>The passing of the divorce referendum will generate an extra volume of cases.  There are already long delays in bringing civil and criminal cases to court due to the shortage of judges.  For example, in the Dublin Circuit Court there are delays of up to two years between the date a case is listed for trial and the hearing date.  When one considers what this means for people on matters central to their lives, one begins to understand the extreme stress this causes.</P>
    <P>It is not easy for the judges, barristers or solicitors working within such a system either.  They have had to tolerate bad working conditions and extraordinary pressure.  There has been much criticism of the legal system, but this is the other side of the coin which also has to be considered.</P>
    <P>Delays in criminal cases are particularly damaging.  Offences can be committed while an accused is on bail, witnesses can be compromised and the recollection of events can diminish.  The administration of justice requires that the courts operate efficiently.  The old maxim &ldquo;justice delayed is justice <Col N="231" /> denied&rdquo; is apt in the unacceptable circumstances which have prevailed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the decision to appoint more judges in the High Court, Circuit Court &mdash; where there are long delays in hearing civil and family law cases &mdash; and District Court.  A number of groups have inidicated to me that they believe the appointment of seven extra judges to the Circuit Court will do little to eliminate the backlog if the available facilities are not improved.  Particular problems have been encountered in the area of family law.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a welcome increase in the number of judges in the Supreme Court from five to eight, including the Chief Justice.  It further provides for the division of the court into groups of three and five to enable two appeals to be heard at the one time. This is necessary given the extra demands on the court at present.  It is overburdened with civil appeals from the High Court, particularly with regard to personal injury actions.  This often results in a two to three year delay for appellants.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the advice of the independent commission, I hope the Minister will ensure that more women judges are appointed as the judicial system is overwhelmingly male dominated. This needs to change.  As more and more women are entering the profession and the barriers and glass ceilings have, thankfully, been removed, it is important that more women are appointed.</P>
    <P>There was an extremely interesting discussion on UTV last night on the question of whether the justice system in the United Kingdom is race blind.  It proceeded along the lines of whether juries should be comprised of people of different races to ensure justice, so that where an Indian comes before the courts his peers will play a role in reaching a judgment on the question of guilt. There has been a judicial review in many states in America of the ways in which their courts have been gender <Col N="232" /> blind.  Such an analysis should be carried out here.</P>
    <P>In this context the question of training of judges is relevant.  Thankfully, the system is beginning to change, but we should not become too complacent.  It took a long time, for example for us, to take seriously crimes against women. Only in recent years have we seen legislation tackling issues such as marital rape and domestic violence.  We have to keep the lens on the justice system as we do on many other areas.</P>
    <P>This Bill for the first time provides legislative support for the concept of ongoing training and education of judges.  This is a realistic recognition of the need.  I have taken part in discussions in which it was argued that judges did not need training.  It is an extraordinary assumption that, unlike others, judges are immune to the need for training.  I welcome the fact that the Bill finally lays that assumption to rest and that resources will be provided.</P>
    <P>The new regulations which allow expert witnesses' reports to be dealt with more speedily are important.  They involve streamlining the use of expert witnesses in courts.  The use of such witnesses has got out of hand and will have to be evaluated and monitored. This should mean that costs will be reduced and that the process will be speeded up for individual claimants.</P>
    <P>The increased powers of county registrars, and more strict criteria on decisions which go to court, will, I hope, deal with the most unsatisfactory situation which frequently means that people do not know if their cases will be reached on a particular day.  The increased powers involve a steamlining of procedures which hopefully will mean that when people go to court it will be a more predictable experience for them.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that solicitors can now be appointed judges of the Circuit Court.  Solicitors would strongly argue that the Minister should not stop at this point and that they should also be appointed to other courts.  They would <Col N="233" /> argue that appointees should be well versed in and have a good sense of the law, should be of good judgment and should have good managerial ability. Solicitors are no less qualified on these scores than barristers and they might score more heavily on matters of managerial and administrative experience.</P>
    <P>If a person is not a solicitor or a barrister &mdash; Deputy O'Donoghue has the advantage here &mdash; it is hard to grasp the complexities between the two professions on this.  The issue is worthy of teasing out and discussion.  I am not sure that any group should have an absolute monopoly and the Bill changes the approach to appointments by providing that solicitors can be appointed to particular courts.  This is an important change and will be welcomed by many.</P>
    <P>The issue of the wearing of wigs generates extraordinary emotion.  What is important is not whether barristers wear wigs but that we make the law more accessible and that people develop confidence in the speedy administration of justice.  One would have to be an insider to grasp the high emotion generated by this issue.  There is a feeling that this matter should not be prescribed in law but should be left to the Bar Council or the legal profession itself to regulate. The Bar Council has already changed its ruling on this and it is left to individual barristers to decide how to tackle it.  The issue is to do with formality and accessibility. For those outside the legal profession wigs are probably off-putting, formalised and unusual whereas they are taken for granted by members of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of the proposed judicial appointments advisory board.  People appointed to the board, particularly the three Government nominees, should have expertise in areas like consumer, equality and human rights.  There is concern, given that the Minister is being given flexibility, that the system of appointments could be abused.  It is important that people from outside the legal area should be appointed to the board because this would help people to see <Col N="234" /> the law as transparent and the appointments system within it as open, not closed.</P>
    <P>In many ways the legal profession has probably been perceived as being closed, like other professional groups, but this has been changing over the years.  The same applies to medicine. We are seeing a move to a more democratic situation where a greater balance is being achieved between professional groups and their clients.  The board will ensure that this move continues within the legal system and I hope the Minister will carefully consider the people who are to be appointed to it.</P>
    <P>The provision of resources is a major issue with regard to the courts system.  I know there is a programme to improve court facilities; this is important and it affects resources.  It seems as if the maintenance of the courts has fallen between two stools, that is local authorities and the Department.  The end result has been a huge deterioration in the courts and it is good that this situation is being changed and that there is a programme to deal with it.</P>
    <P>People have expressed concerns about some aspects of the Bill.  The AIM group for family law reform is concerned about the transfer of nullity cases from the High Court to the Circuit Court and it feels this could create long delays in the court system.  The Minister should consider this.  An independent working party is examining the idea of a courts commission and I await with interest the conclusions it will draw on how issues should be handled.  The provision of additional judges and courtrooms in Dublin and perhaps outside the capital raises the question of extra support staff.  The Minister will have to consider the question of resources.</P>
    <P>The judicial appointments advisory board is precluded from advising on the promotion of judges from one court to another and on the appointment of presidents of courts.  It is interesting that the concept is considered good for some appointments and not for others.  I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="235" /> During the months of August and September offices of the High Court are open to the public only from 10.30 a.m. to 1 p.m. each day.  The Minister should look at this issue, which I presume involves resources and facilities.  This created enormous problems last summer. During court vacations the offices are open only from 10.30 a.m. to 2 p.m. The urgency of family law cases arises in this regard and I ask the Minister to consider before next summer whether there is any way of dealing with some of the urgent cases which cannot be handled because of the limited resources which are available at present.</P>
    <P>Courts and courts officers are important and have been neglected over a long period.  They are in need of reform and additional resources.  I welcome the Bill and I am sure the debate on Committee Stage will be interesting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianCowen" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>My only interest in this Bill, apart from the wide ranging contributions made by our spokesperson and others, is to put on record the origin of sections 12 to 23, which relate to the judicial appointments advisory board.  I wish to point out the basis for the charade which forms part of these sections. I was one of the authors of the principle if not the detail of the Bill.  The Bill has been put forward as a proper aspect of judicial reform but it has nothing to do with such reform.  I am disappointed that the Minister has become entangled in even greater complexity with the Labour Party proposal, born out of desperation when it was seeking a way out of an impasse which has nothing to do with judicial reform.  It had nothing to do with the Courts and Court Officers Bill but was incorporated in that Bill in an attempt to save face on behalf of the Tánaiste.  There is much evidence to suggest that this Government is spending a lot of time trying to save face on a range of issues.  I wish to take this opportunity to outline the thinking behind this part of the Bill, which should not be included in the legislation. Any provisional agreement reached on <Col N="236" /> this matter when I was a member of Government has nothing to do with judicial reform or efficacy of the courts system.</P>
      <P>A committee was set up to investigate the events leading to the downfall of the last Government and the Tánaiste misled that committee on a number of points, particularly that the setting up of the Judicial Appointments Board was part of a programme of judicial reform. That was not the case.  The famous sub-committee consisting of the four wise men &mdash; obviously we were not as wise as was believed &mdash; was set up for the purposes of incorporating measures of judicial reform that were matters of high principle to the Labour Party.  That is in direct contravention to the Government statement of 5 October 1994 which reads:</P>
      <P>The Cabinet decided today to appoint a sub-committee consisting of Ministers Quinn, Cowen, Howlin and Dempsey to examine the present impasse in relation to filling the position of President of the High Court.</P>
      <P>The Ministers were requested to look for a resolution which they would present to the Taoiseach and Tánaiste as early as possible.</P>
      <P>That was the <i>raison d'être</i> for setting up that sub-committee.  It had nothing to do with judicial reform but simply to try to break the impasse on filling the position of presidency of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting that subsequently, as people sought to justify what had happened at that committee, it was suggested by the Tánaiste in his direct evidence that this was part of a programme of judicial reform.  The purpose of the committee, the deliberations of which were confidential at the time, was to get the Tánaiste off the hook since he had agreed on a number of occasions with the then Taoiseach that Mr. Whelehan would be appointed President of the High Court.  Deputies will recall the &ldquo;News at One&rdquo; radio programme on which practically all the parliamentary Labour Party confirmed they did not <Col N="237" /> give a damn who was appointed President of the High Court as long as a general election was not called.  We recall how miffed the Tánaiste was at the subsequent parliamentary party meeting when he berated his backbenchers for having taken the ground from under him.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister for Justice to delete sections 12 to 23, inclusive, of this Bill because they were incorporated in response to an impasse which has since been broken &mdash; we heard much today about the need for compromise to break the impasse in the peace process. Sections 12 to 23, inclusive, were a political response to a temporary political problem which had nothing to do with the proper administration of the courts. As a practitioner in the courts I anticipate many problems in the event that those sections are agreed.  They should be deleted because they were never part of the thinking of the Department of Justice, I can confirm they were never part of the thinking of the Fianna Fáil Party and I am sure they were never part of the thinking of the Labour Ministers on the sub-committee.  I can confirm without privilege that they were the invention of the bureaucratic think tank that seeks to save face for the Tánaiste whenever he is in difficulty.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to delete, as soon as possible, sections 12 to 23 of the Bill. I was the author of that measure and was involved in three days of intense negotiations in a Cabinet sub-committee whose sole purpose was to get the Tánaiste off the hook &mdash; I and my Labour Party colleagues thought we had got him off the hook.  When we put forward this complex solution and I explained to the Government how we overcame the problem, the Government issued a statement on 11 October 1994.  I am sure the Minister and her Labour Party colleagues in Government will confirm that they were overjoyed at the fact that we had found a solution and broke the impasse.</P>
    <P>Subsequent to a meeting held on 11 October the Government issued a statement:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="238" /> The Government considered the progress made by the Cabinet Sub-Committee in relation to the question of judicial appointments.</P>
    <P>The Sub-Committee has recommended changes in procedures which will require legislative change.  The Government has indicated its agreement to these proposals.  It is proposed to incorporate these changes in the Courts and Court Officers Bill which will be brought forward as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>I am glad this Government fulfilled its priorities with such speed and competence.</P>
    <P>The final sentence in that Government statement reads: &ldquo;When the legislative changes are approved by Government an appointment to the Presidency of the High Court will be made&rdquo;.  The following week the legislative changes proposed by the sub-committee were put to the Government and, from my recollection, were agreed by the Government at a meeting on 15 October 1994.  The agreement of 11 October was that the appointment to the Presidency would be made immediately after the changes were approved. History has shown that it took a further month for the Tánaiste to extricate himself not only from an agreed Government statement but from two Government decisions.  Anyone who is aware of the procedures of Government will know that if one wishes to overturn a Government decision it is necessary to put a formal motion to Government.  I invite the Minister for Justice, when writing her memoirs, to examine the minutes of the Government meetings of November 1994 to see whether the Tánaiste put a formal motion seeking to withdraw the agreements he made on 5 October 1994 and 11 October 1994.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a pity because I am sure they would be very interesting. I am giving the facts of what happened <Col N="239" /> in regard to this part of the Courts and Court Officers Bill, which has no place in a programme of judicial reform.  As I said, the committee was set up to get people off the hook, as confirmed by the Government statement of 5 October; the Government statement of 11 October confirms the conditions under which that agreement was reached.  The record shows that those who dishonoured that agreement are not on this side of the House; they are now in Government on the basis that they are honourable people who have standards of integrity to which I should aspire on a daily basis.  I have heard so much political cant, certainly in my ministerial life, that I wish to outline the facts when I have that opportunity.  I am not doing this out of vindictiveness because I am not a bitter person, but for the record of the House to ensure that the facts are known and that people do not get the wrong impression.</P>
      <P>When the Cabinet meeting was held on 5 October 1994 at the suggestion of the Tánaiste, the then Taoiseach put the proposal to it that the sub-committee should be set up to try to find a solution to the impasse which had been reached. A Government statement of 5 October confirms that fact.  It was stated by the Tánaiste in his direct evidence to that committee that the sub-committee was set up to agree judicial reforms.  That is incorrect because the sub-committee was formed to see if we could come up with any proposals which might resolve the impasse as regards the appointment of the President of the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposals regarding judicial appointment procedures only emerged in the context of how to fill the vacancy in the presidency of the High Court. The sub-committee met on a few occasions that week and suggestions were made by the Labour members to broaden the context in which this appointment had to be filled by looking at the system of judicial appointments. Deputy Dempsey and I were prepared to discuss the matter with them without prejudice.  I made it clear there would <Col N="240" /> be no question of Fianna Fáil agreeing to such a new system of judicial appointments without the vacancy in the presidency of the High Court being filled and that the new system would not apply in relation to the filling of that vacancy.</P>
    <P>When our discussions were coming to an end on Friday, 7 October 1994 Labour Party Ministers suggested that we should put out a statement which would report progress.  I disagreed and said that no such report could be given to the press as no progress had been made on filling the vacancy.  Labour Party Ministers suggested that they did not have the authority to decide on the matter.  I told them that if that was the case, there was no point in continuing the discussions. We had agreed that once the sub-committee was set up no one on the committee would speak to the press. That was honoured by all four members throughout the discussions.</P>
    <P>On the Sunday radio programme, <i>News At One,</i> Labour Party Deputies were adamant that this was not an election issue and that it should be resolved. They did not seem to mind who was made President of the High Court.  On that Sunday evening the Tánaiste and the then Taoiseach met at Baldonnel. Deputy Dempsey had reported the up-to-date position to the Taoiseach and had checked the position with the then Minister for Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Quinn, who confirmed that no progress had been made. Deputy Dempsey gave specific and detailed evidence on that point to the committee and I agreed with him.  The Tánaiste asked the Taoiseach if the matter could be resolved.  The Taoiseach told him he had spoken to Deputy Dempsey and asked if he had spoken to Deputy Quinn.  The Tánaiste confirmed that he had spoken to him and the then Taoiseach indicated that the approach which had been taken by the sub-committee and discussed between Deputy Quinn and Deputy Dempsey could solve the problem.  The Tánaiste replied that the Labour Party could &ldquo;do business on that basis&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Monday, the then Minister for <Col N="241" /> Health, Deputy Howlin, and I met. Both of us were aware of the Baldonnel meeting, but our meeting was more relaxed.  When we worked out the details of the proposals, which are now sections 12 to 23 of this Bill with some amendments, we discussed what had happened on the previous Thursday and Friday.  We were both relieved that the immediate problem was being resolved at last with new procedures being put in place for the future.  I provided an account of the agreement which we had reached at the sub-committee to the Cabinet the following day, 11 October. The new system of judicial appointments was being put forward on the basis that the High Court vacancy would be filled.</P>
    <P>When the then Minister for Justice, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn, prepared and brought the extra provisions for the Courts and Court Officers Bill before the Cabinet the following week they were approved.  The mistake we made was that we did not put the memo to the Government to fill the presidency of the High Court in line with the honourable compromise we had reached.  We assumed honour on all sides.  We delivered our part of the proposals to settle the matter and we always felt honour and integrity demanded that the agreement would be carried out.  As I said, no formal proposal to the contrary was ever put to the Cabinet up to the time the Labour Party walked out of Government.</P>
    <P>We took the Tánaiste at his word &mdash; I warn the Minister not to do so &mdash; when he sought a deferral of the decision, but there was never any question that the appointment would not be made.  The then Taoiseach agreed to a number of deferrals to accommodate the Tánaiste. The Tánaiste eventually agreed with the Taoiseach to take the decision in the week in which it was to be taken.  The existence of the Smyth case was already in the public domain at that stage.  The Smyth case, when it emerged, was being used as an <i>ex post facto</i> justification for the non-appointment of Mr. Whelehan as President of the High Court, which <Col N="242" /> was consequent on an agreement reached in Cabinet.  Fianna Fáil had delivered its part by incorporating these foolish provisions in the Courts and Court Officers Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Cabinet is allowed to make a decision on judicial appointments.  That has always been the case.  This Bill is setting up quangos to create an aura of objectivity and we know this by the number of nominations put to the Minister for her appointment, which is her constitutional duty.  This is a smoke screen as regards the judicial appointments advisory board which is not relevant to judicial reform.  It was a political response to a political problem. Whenever one seeks to incorporate 11 sections of the Bill on that basis, it is a flawed Bill.  I encourage the Minister to delete these sections at the next Cabinet meeting as they are not relevant to judicial reform.</P>
    <P>Can anyone suggest a judicial appointment which was made by the Cabinet and which has proven controversial to the extent that this House has undertaken its constitutional option of seeking to impeach such an appointee? Has anyone ever suggested that under the system that has served us well for 70 years people have failed to uphold the constitutional oath they took to administer justice equitably in the pursuit of their duty?  This is a failed attempt to politicise the Judiciary and to attack a basic fundamental principle of our Constitution which involves a separation of powers.  The Judiciary is not accountable to Parliament which has no say over the appointment of people to judicial office, apart from the appointments made by the Cabinet.  That is how our Constitution works.</P>
    <P>I listened to discussions during the sub-committee's deliberations at that time and people sought to bring in an American-style judicial appointments system where people in this House would seek, without any legal expertise, to run someone through the mill regarding their competence to serve independently under the courts.  However, this is not the American system but the Irish <Col N="243" /> system which has served us well.  I ask the Minister to delete these sections because the idea is to politicise the judicial system.  We saw what happened during the controversy 12 months ago when the Labour Party politicised the office of the President of the High Court.  The attempt to suggest that a person should be of a particular liberal or conservative disposition which would determine how they would act <i>in situ</i> as a judge is an insult to the judicial system and to anyone who has ever sat in a court in this country since independence. It is an insult to everyone who has taken an oath to administer justice equitably, regardless of their personal position or disposition.  That is a fundamental in our system which has been attacked under the guise of political correctness. I encourage the Minister to delete the sections as they represent a simple effort to circumvent democratic accountability in this House by seeking to impose people into positions who have a particular disposition with which Deputies opposite may find favour at any given time, in what is supposed to be an independent arm under our Constitution. That is a grave disservice.  It is a misnomer in terms of judicial reform and must be quelled immediately. Those sections should be deleted as they have no place in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hesitation in welcoming the Bill.  If anything, it may be too restrictive and perhaps not enough judges are being appointed. Those of us who have to deal with people involved in court cases are aware that there is an enormous backlog, particularly in the Circuit and High Courts.  I ask the Minister to keep the position under constant review to determine if the additional number of judges she proposes to appoint under the measures in this Bill are sufficient to deal with the problems that have arisen in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has come to my notice in recent times that a committee was set up several years ago to examine the question <Col N="244" /> of rationalisation of the Circuit Court system.  I understand the committee produced findings which recommended the number of venues for Circuit Court sittings should be reduced, that many provincial towns which at present have Circuit Court sittings should no longer have that facility and that the Circuit Court hearings should be more centralised in locations like Dublin, Cork, Waterford, Limerick and Galway.  That was an idiotic finding as the Circuit Court sittings in the major centres of population I mentioned have not been able to cope with the position which has pertained for a number of years.  To suggest that towns like Dungarvan and Youghal should no longer have Circuit Court sittings and that the cases should be heard in centres like Waterford and Cork, where there is a major log jam in dealing with cases, is unrealistic.  I ask the Minister to clearly indicate that the findings of that committee will not be acted upon.  It would be crazy to overcrowd an already crowded position.  Solicitors in my constituency and an adjoining one were appalled at the prospect that venues, some of which I named, would be eliminated from the Circuit Court list.  It is important we are reassured on this issue.</P>
    <P>The necessity for appointing a number of new judges to various courts is so serious that it was brought to my notice by members of the legal profession that some judges, particularly those in the Circuit Court, are on a go slow in an effort to bring attention to their predicament and that of people who must attend the Circuit or High Courts six or seven times before their cases are heard. Is the Minister aware of that?  I have no doubt it is an unofficial go slow, a means by which the judges in question wish to highlight existing problems.  That is why I am doubtful that the appointment of 17 new judges to the various courts will be sufficient to deal with the problem. Five additional judges will be appointed to the District Court, seven to the Circuit Court, two to the High Court and four to the Supreme Court.  It seems a <Col N="245" /> sizeable percentage increase, but it may not be sufficient.</P>
    <P>The training and suitability of judges is often called into question.  The Minister stated that training courses for judges would be provided.  How are judges assessed?  Have judges been reprimanded? Can they be removed from the Bench or when appointed do they remain there until they reach retirement age?  It is difficult to understand how judges can remain in office until a retirement age of 70 or 72 in the case of Circuit and High Court judges, but that retirement age will now be reduced to 70.  A retirement age of 70 is quite old. Are judges subject to medical checks to determine if they are capable of performing their duties?  That is particularly relevant today when Alzheimer's appears to be more commonplace with people in their 50s suffering from it.</P>

      <P>While an appointee may have been a competent solicitor or barrister, he or she may not be a good judge.  Are there instruments by which a judge, if considered unsuitable, could be removed from the Bench?  I have never heard of such a case, but such things happen in every job.  Can such a measure be exercised in the case of judges?  Some judges are tough, some are lenient, sometimes people may get away with blue murder, more times judges seem unduly harsh, but I would never blame one for being so in our society.  In my area there is a district judge who is notorious for his sentences, but fair dues to him.  He is presumed to be a friend of a member of the Opposition and that is how he got his position, but that is only hearsay.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate if judges are subject to assessment and medical checks as it is important they should be?  The Minister has taken a <Col N="247" /> positive step to allow solicitors to be directly appointed to the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>The overburdening of the courts is due to a variety of reasons, one of which is the compensation culture.  Some people are making bogus claims and professional gangs are organising others to make bogus claims.  The Garda has been active in curtailing the activities of some of these gangs and has got some positive results.  Certainly, the number of bogus claims has been very significant. Also, the courts are overburdened by the number of drugs abuse cases coming before them.  I noticed in Waterford District Court recently that on one day there were 11 separate cases relating to drugs abuse.  It is easy to understand the reason courts have a difficulty in dealing with the number of cases coming before them.</P>
      <P>When replying will the Minister refer to the result of the divorce referendum and how it will affect family law courts? Obviously, we must expand the family law courts to deal with divorce cases. Will she give us specific details of the type of court and the number of additional judges she will appoint to deal with divorce cases?  This is a real, topical and immediate problem.</P>
      <P>I welcome the establishment of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to appoint judges.  Up to recently the Cabinet appointed judges on their political affiliations.  Now a list of people will be submitted to the advisory board from which the most suitable persons can be appointed.  I do not see any reason to criticise that.  The late Deputy John Kelly, as Attorney General, set up such a board to appoint State solicitors. He was criticised for doing so but it was the right thing to do.  It is improper of the Opposition parties to suggest there will be political patronage.  The board will be independent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government could help by adopting a tougher line where legislation is concerned.  When the Minister attempted to stiffen the bail laws some months ago, she met a chorus of dissent from people who are generally called <Col N="248" />&ldquo;do-gooders&rdquo;.  One can overdo the civil rights issue.  The victim of crime is often the last person to be cared for.  We can be far too sympathetic to the criminal. A wise old sage in my locality said, when we were talking about crime recently that the law in this country only applies to law-abiding people.  That is a bit cynical but there is much truth in it. The habitual hardened criminal seems to be able to circumvent the law while the ordinary decent person cannot.  I ask the Minister not to be put off by people who pretend to act in the public interest. She should think of the ordinary defenceless citizen who is assaulted, intimidated and insulted on almost a daily basis and direct her attention towards the criminal and give the Garda and the courts every possible assistance to do their jobs properly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mrs. Owen)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the many Deputies who contributed to the debate.  The proposals generally have been well received both inside and outside the House.  The Bill generated a great deal of interest, but this did not surprise me, because as Deputy Frances Fitzgerald said, this is the first major overhaul of the courts system since the 1920s.  I have listened carefully and noted many of the points made during the debate.  The Bill contains many reforming measures which will affect many parts of the judicial system. It is right to keep the structure and form of the court systems under constant review.  The Courts and Court Officers Bill is major reforming legislation to change our courts system.  I am confident the reforms will provide us with a greatly enhanced judicial system.</P>
      <P>I stress the independence of and the respect with which we hold the Judiciary.  Many Members have alluded to the perception that the appointment of judges from time to time may have been seen or interpreted as being political. I am not aware of any decision made by members of the Judiciary which was seen to be of a political nature. It is important for us to recognise that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="249" /> Deputy Deasy made some comments which might give the impression that some of our judges were operating when they were incapacitated in some way. The Judiciary is independent of me, as Minister for Justice, and of this House but, as far as I am aware, without checking on it, there is one mechanism by which judges can be removed and that is through a motion in this House.  To the best of my knowledge, judges are not subject to regular medical checks that would decide whether they can continue to be judges.  Nobody has asked me to do a medical to see whether I can continue being a TD or stand again at the next election.</P>
    <P>I reiterate the independence of and the respect with which the Judiciary is held.  From time to time people who are distressed will make comments about different judgments and sentences etc.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Indeed, they do.  We have an independent Judiciary of which we can be proud.  I may not be able to deal comprehensively with all the issues raised now but we will have a Committee Stage debate next week during which we can tease out the details.</P>
      <P>Many Members raised the issue of delays in the courts.  The extent of the delays in appeals to courts is unacceptable and I do not wish to minimise them.  Tackling these delays was one of my priorities in reviewing the 1994 Bill.  The changes I have made to the 1995 Bill will be more effective in ending delays in the courts system.  I accept it will take some time to reduce those delays but the provision for an increase of 17 judges indicates a real commitment on my part.  In the 1994 Bill the number of additional judges to be appointed was not specified, but the former Minister indicated she would bring in amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowen raised a number of points in respect of the 1994 Bill.  It is fair to say that that Bill came into the <Col N="250" /> House after a short gestation period.  I am satisfied that had that Bill continued on and there had not been a change of Government, the then Minister would have had reflected carefully on and made a number of changes to that legislation.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies criticised the fact that it has taken until now to bring this Bill forward.  I do not accept that it represents little advance on the Courts and Court Officers Bill of 1994.  That Bill contained only one major measure, namely, the setting up of a court of appeal to tackle the delays in the court system.  When I took office I initiated a detailed review of the Bill and took soundings from the Judiciary.  There was not time, because of the speed involved in the preparation of the 1994 Bill, to take those soundings but the process of review and consultation I carried out led me to believe that a court of appeal was not the right way to proceed but to extend the Supreme Court.  I am satisfied the Bill is better for that reason.  It is a more comprehensive measure.  The Bill also contains a number of measures such as new powers for county registrars, rationalisation of the criminal jurisdiction of the District Court, new arrangements for the transfer of criminal cases in the Circuit Court and so on.</P>
    <P>Much of the debate concentrated on the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  Speaker after speaker from Deputy Cowen's side of the House copperfastened their commitment to the board in so far as each of them suggested how it could be improved. Deputy Cowen wanted me to remove what were described as these foolish proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Many Deputies referred to the inclusion of three persons who are not members of the Judiciary and were not lawyers, solicitors or barristers. I believe that strengthens the advisory board in the sense that we can appoint to it people with wide-ranging administrative and consumer interests.  That will be added value for the board because these people use our court services.  I would like to see representatives of victims of crime, women's groups and commercial interests having an opportunity to participate on the advisory board.  I make no apologies, therefore, for widening the remit of the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I equally make no apologies for including the Attorney General on the board.  The Attorney General, in his or her role, is the adviser to the Government on all matters relating to law and he or she is the defender of the Constitution. It is appropriate that he or she would be available to advise the <Col N="252" /> Government on the soundings of the advisory board.  I believe the Attorney General was not included for appointment to the board, as outlined in the 1994 Bill, for expediency reasons due to the tension that existed with regard to the Attorney General and his relationship with the then Government.  Such an amendment would have been made eventually to the Bill.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies raised the question of the number of names submitted.  The 1994 Bill referred to three to five but I believe three was too restrictive.  It would restrict the Government in advising the President as to who should be appointed as a judge.  The Government should have a reasonable choice of names to enable it make good judicial decisions on who should be appointed to the Government.  It impinges on the Government's role that it must, under the Constitution, make the name known to the President.  That is the Government's responsibility and it cannot assign that responsibility to anybody else.  It must bear the responsibility for deciding who will be appointed to the Bench.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea raised the question of the Government being required to accept a recommendation.  The Deputy knows that the Constitution requires the Government to make that appointment. That was part and parcel of the 1994 Bill.</P>

It is not appropriate, having appointed somebody to the Bench, to then say we do not have confidence in them and we will subject them to making an application for appointment to a higher office. There is no automatic right to appointment to a higher court but if judges want to go forward for promotion to the higher courts, we should have confidence in them and consider them on their merits.  It is appropriate that we do not include them among those who must go to the advisory board.</P>

      <P>In regard to the working group on a courts commission.  Deputy O'Donoghue, and others, asked why was this not part of the Bill.  When I set up a working group on a courts commission I do not have to put that into legislation. The 1994 Bill adopted a minor and unstudied approach to the question of a courts commission and it was only an advisory courts commission that was proposed in that legislation.  If this working group advises the setting up of a proper, statutory, stand alone courts commission, that will be set up under legislation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Crawford, O'Donnell, O'Keeffe, Hughes, Ring and Fitzgerald raised the issue of accommodation which is important for the proper running of our courts.  In 1995, a sum of £6 million was provided for capital works and a sum of £1.59 million for maintenance work on the courts.  There is a commitment in the Department of Justice to continue this refurbishment programme and to include in all refurbished courts a family law suite where people can have <Col N="255" /> their cases heard with humanity and privacy, recognising the trauma that is often attached to family law cases.  A number of areas have provided such accommodation &mdash; Letterkenny, Athlone, Galway and Cork have fine facilities.  I will continue to make improvements.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies raised the issue of the retirement age of judges. The retirement age has been reduced from 72 to 70 years for newly appointed judges to the High Court.  I do not accept the arguments that it is necessary for judges to retire at the age of 65.</P>

For example, in Belgium, Spain, Portugal, the Netherlands, Greece, England and Wales the retirement age is 70.  Until last March the retirement age in England and Wales was 75.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The arguments put forward by the Government for not accepting this Bill are insulting to the victims of crime.  It said that the Bill was not comprehensive enough and there were technical flaws in it.  Those reasons ring very hollow given that no Bill will solve every problem.  It is a case of doing one's best when the opportunity presents itself, while in some instances it is a matter of addressing the weakest link in the chain.  It is not good enough for the Government to say that this Bill is well intentioned but not comprehensive enough.  We would have to wait a long time for a Bill which addressed every problem.  That is something that will never happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not good enough for the Government to say that it accepts the principle of the Bill but it will not run with it. During the referendum campaign reference was made to civic and minority rights and the need for compassion.  Do people not have the right to walk the streets in peace and to feel safe in their houses at night?  An increasing minority of people are affected by crime.  Many <Col N="257" /> of them are old while others live in specific parts of the city and county.  Politicians who live in cosy middle class areas may not understand the effects of crime on people.  The Government's decision to reject this Bill sends a wrong signal to these people.  This Bill would give some consolation to those people who do not feel safe in their homes at night, yet the Government will not accept it.  It has said it is working on its own Bill which will be brought forward in the future.  I am horrified at the Government's approach to this issue.</P>
    <P>The crime problem has got out of hand in many areas.  I will not refer to the recent murders, one of which took place in my constituency.  Horrific crimes like these and large robberies grab the headlines but it is petty crimes such as muggings which create more fear in the community.  The Bill is mainly geared towards people affected by muggings and burglaries in their homes.  It is not possible to quantify the trauma caused by these types of crimes. Many people live in fear, whether or not it is real.  It is very real to many of them. This is a good Bill which proposes to give victims a statutory right to counselling and to be kept informed.  I am horrified that the Minister has not taken these proposals on board.  The perception outside the House is that the justice system protects the wrongdoer rather than the victim.  We must deal with this problem and try to eliminate this perception.</P>
    <P>A woman living in a local authority area in my constituency where the crime problem is very serious agreed to give evidence in court about a minor robbery. Over the past eight or nine months she has been targeted by scumbags and it is fairly common for the windows of her house to be broken at weekends. This woman identified the people involved in this crime but she is now living in fear.  The procedure whereby witnesses must put their hand on a suspect in an identification parade must be changed.  It would be more appropriate to use two-way mirrors.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="258" /> I am horrified at the Government's decision not to accept this Bill as it sends the wrong signal to those people who live in fear of crime.  This uncompassionate action totally ignores the rights of minorities.  Given some of the statements the Government made over the past few weeks this decision rings very hollow.</P>

      <P>We appreciate the efforts made by Deputy O'Dea in bringing this Bill before the House.  The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, spelt out in considerable detail the reasons it is not acceptable to the Government in its present form.  In view of the major problems we have with crime I would expect the Government to bring forward legislation to help deal with this very important matter.  All credit is due to Deputy O'Dea for initiating this Bill as it gives us an opportunity to debate the issues.  No one party is the custodian of law and order.  As a previous Minister of State in the Department of Justice, I am sure Deputy O'Dea paid a great deal of attention to this matter and perhaps if he were still in Government he would be moving the Bill from the Government benches.  That is history now.  I congratulate him for taking the time to present this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The impression is created in some newspaper reports that serious crime is restricted to Dublin city or one or two other areas.  Crime is not confined to Dublin or towns but is prevalent throughout the country.  It was unheard of a few years ago that serious crimes would be committed in rural areas but unfortunately that is no longer the case. I would not attempt to allow one of my family to go out alone at night in Drogheda, which one could do quite freely not so very long ago.  People are mugged and robbed and women are <Col N="259" /> subject to constant attack.  I welcome the main thrust of the Bill.  Many of its proposals will be enshrined in a Government Bill which I hope will be brought forward sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>Compensation is referred to fairly extensively in the Bill.  I do not think compensation will cure the problem although it will certainly help to ease the pain.  A member of my own family was compensated for a very serious attack in which he was nearly killed some years ago.  Although compensation is important prevention is more important.  We should put the emphasis on preventing or reducing the incidence of crime rather than on compensation. The criminal injuries compensation legislation deals with this subject very extensively.  I understand that £45 million has been paid out in compensation since its introduction but that there have been long delays.  It is bad enough to have a family member seriously injured in an attack but it prolongs the agony to have to struggle on and wait an outrageous length of time for payment. There should be an urgent review of the scheme of compensation for personal injuries.  I understand the scheme is currently under review by the Department of Justice.  This is part of the Government of Renewal programme and as far as I can remember it was part of the previous Government's programme.</P>
    <P>The expansion of services provided by the Irish Association for Victim Support is another important improvement. We should pay tribute to the work of this voluntary organisation.  The amount of money which the Government subscribes to it was increased substantially from £18,000 in 1993 to £130,000 this year.  This voluntary body receives no payment for its work.  Bodies which work quietly behind the scenes should have their work recognised and appreciated. The growing number of victims appreciate its work.</P>
    <P>The 1993 Criminal Justice Act ensures that the criminal justice system is oriented to the victim of crime in a number of ways.  I think that area should <Col N="260" /> be looked at but I understand that it also may be under review.  The 1993 Act extends the powers of criminal courts to award compensation in all cases where the victim is caused personal injury or loss.  It also empowers the courts to apply compensation rather than a fine.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of progress and further progress will be made by this Government whose commitment is enshrined in the Programme for Government.  It takes time and a great deal of money to come to grips with the types of criminals we have.  Criminals are sophisticated and well organised, in many cases organised thugs of the worst order.  The police have great difficulty in dealing with them because of their sophisticated methods of carrying out crime.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Dea for his efforts in introducing a Bill that is a step in the right direction.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EricJByrne" hpid="Mr. E. Byrne Mr. E. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Violent crime has become endemic not only in urban areas such as Dublin, Cork and Limerick but in rural areas, and those close to urban centres are bearing the brunt of the criminal overspill from cities.  The violent crimes with which we are now familiar were rare enough ten years ago to warrant a newspaper headline.  The brutal murder of three people in Dublin last week will be forgotten except by the families and friends of the deceased. Most of the victims of crime survive but they are often scarred mentally and physically.  The support available for victims is generally provided by voluntary organisations such as the Irish Association for Victim Support which is sadly under funded, under staffed and under resourced.  It has to cope with the explosion in demand for its services throughout the year and in the summer period it has to deal with very sad cases where tourists have been mugged and robbed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I welcome Deputy O'Dea's Bill, I do not agree with all its provisions. It provides an opportunity to focus on the needs and rights of victims who, unfortunately, to a large extent <Col N="261" /> have been ignored in the current debate on increasing crime levels.  There are two aspects to the treatment of crime victims, the court procedures they are forced to endure and the issue of compensation, not only for physical injuries but for the pain and suffering inflicted by the offender.  The programme negotiated between Democratic Left, Fine Gael and Labour committed the Government to introducing a charter of rights for victims of crime.  I look forward to the early publication and implementation of that charter.  Deputy O'Dea's Bill touches on many of the issues that need to be addressed in such a charter, but its provisions have not been properly thought through.</P>
    <P>The deficiencies in the Bill should not mean that the issue of victim support is put on the long finger and in this regard I hope the commitments in paragraph 119 of the Government's programme are implemented without delay.  The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, addressed some of the improvements in support services for crime victims, all of which are very welcome but do not go far enough.  The Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal, in particular, has proven to be a blunt and under-resourced instrument with which to address victims' needs.  In this regard it is appropriate to quote the proverb that &ldquo;justice delayed is justice denied&rdquo;.  Justice for the victims of crime is extremely slow.  Waiting times are excessive and compensation, when finally awarded, is often paltry.  Victims are put through a lengthy and bureaucratic procedure before receiving compensation under the scheme and even then they can expect to receive only out-of-pocket expenses.</P>
    <P>The removal some years ago of the so-called pain and suffering clause dealt a shattering blow to the rights of crime victims.  Every day innocent members of the public fall foul of criminals.  They are mugged, attacked, harassed or intimidated and the effects can be severe and long lasting.  Many people carry the physical scars of their ordeal for the remainder of their lives and others try <Col N="262" /> to come to terms with the emotional and psychological consequences.</P>
    <P>The time has come to introduce a comprehensive and unbureaucratic system of compensation which would ensure that all crime victims receive compensation not only for out-of-pocket expenses but also for the considerable trauma they suffer.  I hope the current review of the criminal injuries scheme will result in a restoration of the pain and suffering clause and that a restitution fund, as promised in the Government's programme, will be established without delay.  I will continue to press these matters until they are addressed by the House.</P>
    <P>While Deputy O'Dea's Bill is extremely well intentioned, it addresses many of the issues superficially and this is understandable in Bills proposed by Opposition parties.  Many of the issues have been already dealt with in legislation and this is particularly true in the case of victims of sexual offences whose rights and needs have been comprehensively addressed.</P>
    <P>The Bill focuses mainly on court procedure and related matters and I am concerned about the potential implications of some of its provisions.  Under section 2 (a) a victim of crime would have the right to be consulted by the prosecution regarding pre-trial procedures. If victims make a written request they would also have full access to the investigating member of the Garda Síochána.  In some respects this goes too far but in others it does not go far enough.  Without a written request there would not be a right of access but with such a request there would be unlimited rights that could place additional strains on the already over stretched Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the provision that states victims must be informed when the perpetrator has completed his or her sentence.  While I appreciate the intention behind such a proposal, it could have unforeseen consequences for both victims and offenders.  If the Government contemplates introducing similar proposals in <Col N="263" /> the future I hope they are thoroughly examined before being implemented and that appropriate safeguards are introduced.  At present the State prosecutes suspected perpetrators on behalf of society and it is its duty to ensure that the guilty are convicted and the innocent acquitted, while protecting individual citizens and vindicating the rights of victims.  The concept of the State as prosecutor is central to our criminal justice system.  If the proposals in Deputy O'Dea's Bill were accepted in their entirety, to some extent the victim would become the prosecuting agent. Unless carefully handled, such a shift in emphasis could prejudice the right of alleged offenders &mdash; a term I use advisedly &mdash; as we retain the concept of innocent until proven guilty.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Dea on raising this matter and presenting us with an opportunity to debate an issue that is often considered incidental to the broader crime problem.  While I disagree with many of the provisions in the Bill, it provides a valuable starting point for a discussion on the issue and I hope the Government will respond by introducing its proposals in the near future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PaulBradford" hpid="Mr. Bradford Mr. Bradford">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bradford</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, thank Deputy O'Dea for giving us an opportunity to debate this matter.  As crime has become a major social and indeed political problem in the past few weeks, this is an opportunite time to discuss the Deputy's proposal.  However, on almost a daily basis since the Dáil resumed following the summer recess the Opposition has put crime at the top of its political hit list.  People could be forgiven for believing that crime was almost nonexistent until the advent of the rainbow coalition Government in December 1994.  It must be recognised that while there has been an increase in the level of crime in the past few months, all political parties and Governments in the past decade or so have not given the problem as much attention as it deserved.  However, I am confident that under the leadership of the Minister, <Col N="264" /> Deputy Owen, the Department of Justice and all involved in the fight against crime will tackle the problem with renewed vigour.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea asked us to support this Bill which would afford certain rights and assistance to the victims of crime.  While that is laudable, it is important to note the Government's concerns about the legislation, as outlined by the Minister of State, Deputy Currie.  I am consoled by the fact that the Minister and the Government are totally committed to introducing a charter for victims of crime.  While it may be necessary because of technical difficulties to oppose this Bill, it is important to do something constructive and positive to deal with the problems faced by victims of crime.  I am confident that the introduction by the Government, hopefully in the very near future, of a charter to protect such victims will be a positive move in that direction.</P>
      <P>While attempting to deal with the problems faced by the ever increasing number of victims, from a political and security level we must also deal with the primary problem by attacking crime at its most basic level.  Deputy Eric Byrne, who represents an urban constituency, said the problem of rural crime should not be ignored.  Recent dramatic criminal incidents in our cities, which have received coverage on television and in other media, would lead one to believe that this is simply an urgen problem. However, as a representative for a rural constituency I have to say &mdash; and I am sure that my views are shared by most of my colleagues from rural areas &mdash; that there is literally no townland or parish which has not experienced a growing number of criminal activities against people and their property.  We are hearing more and more complaints about it from constituents who continually tell us that it is not being tackled sufficiently strongly by the Government. All rural representatives would make a heartfelt plea to the Minister for Justice and her Government colleagues to give urgent priority to tackling crime in rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> New attempts to tackle rural crime should include methods applied earlier this century such as gardaí on the beat who are in touch with people in parishes and villages.  That approach was much more effective than gardaí driving around at night in squad cars, passing people but not talking to them.  Future policy could perhaps be best addressed by taking on board some of the methods of the past.</P>
    <P>I would like to see not simply a strengthening of numbers of rural Garda stations but also a return to gardaí on the beat in smaller towns and villages.  Gardaí who dealt with the problem at local level knew the community and its people.  They got better information and were thus better equipped to deal with crime than we appear to be now.</P>

      <P>Law and order is a priority for this Government.  The Bill introduced by Deputy O'Dea gives us a valuable opportunity to debate the other side of the picture &mdash; victims of crime.  Deputy O'Dea deserves to be congratulated on introducing this Bill to the House and I respect his genuine concern and motives in doing so.  It should not matter whether a Bill on such an important issue is introduced by Government or Opposition.  If the Bill presented is such that its intent can be delivered, then it should be supported.</P>
      <P>I regret we cannot support the Bill, not because we disagree with its intent. From all the contributions there is a genuine swell of support for the motives and intent behind it.  Unfortunately, it has been pointed out that because of technicalities and the fact that there is too much space for broad interpretation, the intent of the Bill as it is now presented cannot be delivered.  I hope that Deputy O'Dea and his party will take our voting position not as opposing the Bill but rather ensuring that a Bill that will provide such support for victims can be delivered in reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must always have genuine sympathy and support for victims of crime. It is very distressing to read stories in <Col N="266" /> our weekly newspapers about elderly people living alone being broken into, tied up, gagged and left in a deplorable condition.  Two weeks ago a lovely old lady in Clonmel was walking home after doing her shopping when she was attacked by a gang of youths in a car. They knocked her to the ground and stole her handbag leaving her with many injuries.</P>
    <P>We must have sympathy for such victims of crime but, unfortunately, we are speaking not only about victims of crime but also people who see themselves as potential victims.  Many have had the awful experience of such torture but many more live in constant fear of being the next victim.</P>
    <P>Since many elderly people in our rural communities live alone in isolated areas, the intent of the local authorities now is to try to move them into centres of population.  Money provided for special small houses is giving the elderly great comfort and serenity in their final years.  They are living in a community where they know they are being cared for and where they can, at least, live with some degree of security knowing they have neighbours close by.</P>
    <P>However, no matter how close someone is to their neighbours they can still become victims of a break-in.  That is why it would be worthwhile and profitable to spend some of our resources to provide alarms or telephones connected to the Garda station as in times of stress or fear the elderly should have help at the press of a button.  Special houses for the elderly living alone should be equipped with such alarm systems.  I have raised this issue on a number of occasions and it is something that we should consider seriously.</P>
    <P>If elderly people have a son or daughter living with them their social welfare contributions are penalised. That prevents some elderly people from having a family member living with them.  It would be a great service to the community if such people could live with their elderly parents.  The elderly would feel more secure having a family member live with them.  We are proud <Col N="267" /> of the contribution made by voluntary groups, whether community alert or the neighbourhood watch scheme.  They receive valuable support from the gardaí.</P>
    <P>Last week I tabled a question to the Minister for Justice on the contribution made by such community groups and I was delighted to hear that 326,000 homes are in the scheme.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy O'Dea for raising such an important issue and allowing us to debate it.  It is a job well done because it will lead to a positive response from the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to share my time with Deputy O'Donnell.  This is important legislation brought forward by the Opposition.  I congratulate Deputy O'Dea on the time and effort he has put into this Bill and for recognising the importance of the issue.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides statutory rights for the victims of crime and nothing could be more important that that when so many people are affected by crime.  It provides a right to be consulted by the prosecution, free legal advice, counselling and victim impact reports, among other things.  It also provides that a victim of crime will be entitled to information. Victims want to know if their case is being pursued and Deputy O'Dea suggests that the victim should be told whether a person is charged following investigation of the crime.  He also suggests that victims of crime are told whether a person is in custody or on bail.  It is important to know because many offences are committed by those on bail.  The Bill states that the victim shall be informed of the impending release of the criminal.  That can be a serious issue for victims because there is a danger of bumping into the criminal again and being attacked or robbed.  I know of and deal with cases where the same perpetrator breaks into a house, shop, public house and so on over and over again.  The gardaí know the perpetrator from the style of operation but may not get evidence for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="268" /> People could take precautions if they know when a person is due for release.</P>
    <P>This is excellent legislation and the Deputy went to great lengths to deal with the rights of victims.  The Minister said she would not argue with the detail of the Bill as some of it could be altered. Essentially everyone agrees with the principle of the Bill.  Why not accept it, discuss the detail on Committee Stage and make adjustments where appropriate? The principle of the Bill is debated on Second Stage and one decides whether one agrees with it.  It is difficult to see how anyone could vote against the principle of this Bill but that will happen if one votes against it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bradford asked why Fianna Fáil puts crime at the top of the list.  The reality is crime is at the top of the list. There will be over 100,000 indictable crimes this year which amounts to almost 300 crimes per day.  At the beginning of this year I said that the huge increase in drug abuse at the end of last year would put this issue above party politics.  Most of the crime in Dublin and approximately 80 per cent of all crime is drug related.  Drug abuse is rampant and that is borne out by the large quantities of drugs seized.  That is why Deputy O'Donoghue called this the year of the criminal.  It is difficult to understand that the Government does not accept the provisions of the Bill.  It does not accept the right of victims to be consulted about the prosecution of an offence.  Although the Government accepts the principle of the Bill it will vote against it.  It will not allow free legal advice for the victims of crime or entitlement to free psychological counselling. The Government does not say it will allow it in certain circumstances or have special provision for it which can be controlled.  It will reject this legislation out of hand.</P>
    <P>Section 7 seeks to extend the time limit for an application under the Criminal Injuries Tribunal from three to six months.  Three months is too short.  Last week I met a man who opened his door at night and was hit with a hammer about the head and face.  His house was <Col N="269" /> robbed.  He was taken to hospital and the Garda were called.  He has been informed that because he failed to lodge his application within the time limit specified he is not entitled to compensation despite the fact that the dates and times are recorded both in the Garda station and hospital.  This is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea is suggesting in this Bill that the time limit should be extended to meet the needs of ordinary, decent people who are mugged while out shopping or whose homes are invaded.  If they fail to lodge their application within three months, no one on this or the other side of the House should say &ldquo;tough luck&rdquo;, that they are not prepared in principle to help them.</P>
    <P>The Government does not agree with Deputy O'Dea, however.  All the Minister for Justice is prepared to say is that the Department is reviewing the scheme of compensation for personal injuries criminally inflicted.  There is no sense of urgency in tackling the problems of victims. The reality is that compensation is only payable in respect of medical expenses and loss of earnings.  It is not payable in respect of pain and suffering. This matter will have to be reviewed. There are ways by which the costs involved can be contained.  Without such a provision the scheme is unsuitable. In rejecting the Bill the Government is compounding the sense of injury by excluding the victim from the proceedings and by denying access to the necessary psychological counselling.</P>
    <P>The crime problem, especially in the cities, is getting out of hand.  More and more ordinary law abiding citizens are affected by random violence, theft and muggings while much of the drug related crime is indiscriminate.  There are many unseen costs.  For example, people lose their no claims bonus when their car is stolen and damaged.  Losses are also incurred by the innocent victims of house break-ins and pedestrians who lose their handbag or wallet.  Under the scheme any medical expenses incurred in respect of severe physical injuries are covered, but what happens the person <Col N="270" /> who has to struggle around on crutches for weeks and months?  In such circumstances no compensation is payable.</P>
    <P>Women and the elderly in particular are afraid to walk the streets and the Government is unable to ensure their safety as crime fuelled by drug addiction continues to soar.  In circumstances where it cannot handle the crime wave it must at least support the innocent victims of crime and accord them the dignity and respect they deserve.  There is a price to be paid, but we must ensure that the innocent victims do not foot the bill.  The Government is being shortsighted in rejecting this important and valuable legislation.  That is a matter of regret.</P>
    <P>Those who have been resettled in County Clare under the rural resettlement scheme were surveyed recently. The findings show that they feel 100 per cent safer in the country.  This is not the case in the capital city, Limerick, Waterford, Cork, Galway and the other major centres of population.  We will provide the Government with every support in tackling this problem, but the victims of crime must also receive our support.  By refusing to accept the Bill the Government is rejecting this principle.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to express the support of the Progressive Democrats for the principle behind the Bill and I commend Deputy O'Dea on its introduction.  The victims of crime have been walked on by the State.  This Bill proposes a series of measures to enhance the status of the victim as he or she interfaces with the criminal justice system.  From the date allegations are made to the date of trial State procedures should be inclusive of the victim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recent cases have produced a steady procession of despairing victims of child abuse, for example, whom the justice system has failed because of the inexplicable and as yet unexplained decision of the Director of Public Prosecutions not to prosecute.  Many of these people have contacted my office because I have raised this issue in the Dáil and taken a <Col N="271" /> personal interest in maladministration in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the prosecution service in general and they have no one else to turn to.  For these people the wheels of justice have not yet begun to turn as no prosecution has been taken in respect of the crimes from which they have suffered.</P>
    <P>In the recent Drogheda hospital case, for example, the Garda to whom two separate complaints were made in March and June 1994 of sexual abuse by a hospital consultant failed to report the allegations to the health board, despite the fact that the consultant in question was still working within the hospital with full access to patients.  It was only when the complainant notified the health board a full year later, in March 1995, that the hospital took any action. The consultant was on voluntary leave pending an internal inquiry and eventually retired in October this year.  This has been confirmed in a letter to me from the Minister for Justice yesterday.</P>
    <P>In seeking to explain the failure of the Garda to report the allegations to the health board immediately as demanded by the guildelines the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Before deciding whether the health board should be notified of such a complaint the Garda took into account a variety of factors, in particular the reliability of the complainant and the need to ensure that the position and character of the subject of the complaint was not damaged unjustly.</P>
    <P>In that sentence there is a clear bias against the complainant in favour of the abuser.  This bias permeates the criminal justice system.  No prosecution has been taken in that case by the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>As the Acting Chairman is aware as a member of the Select Committee on Legislation and Security, we constantly find ourselves dealing with matters of great injustice rather than justice.  It has become clear that the State is not <Col N="272" /> adequately vindicating the constitutional rights of victims.  This Bill simply seeks to elevate the status of the victims of crime.  Measures are necessary to balance the rights of the accused and the equal rights of the victim in criminal prosecutions.</P>
    <P>There is nothing relevant to the position of victims of crime in the Constitution except, possibly.  Article 40.3.2 by which the State guarantees, by its laws, to protect, as best it may, from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name and property rights of every citizen. With a little imagination this could be construed as conferring an obligation on the State to assist the victims of crime.</P>
    <P>Irish law on the rights of accused persons is highly evolved.  The rights of victims are always ignored by the civil liberties lobby, which constantly champions the rights of the accused.  Courts have not been asked to consider the role of victims in the criminal process.  This is because victims are not parties to disputes before courts which are between the State, or the people, and defendants. The victim of the offence is relegated to the status of witness and is not officially recognised as having any interest in the outcome of the proceedings.  This ignores the reality that victims have more at stake in the outcome of a criminal trial than any other person with the exception of the accused.</P>
    <P>Prosecutions may be brought in the interests of the common good and in the name of the people but it is the victim who gives his or her time and emotional energy to the prosecuting authorities to help secure a conviction.  Often victims, having crossed the threshold of the court, are asked to place their reputations on the line.  They are expected to wait, often for months, for the trial to be heard.  The reasons for the delay will probably not be explained to them.  If prosecutions are dropped, they may not be informed of it.  When the trial is finally heard, victims are expected to open themselves to examination and cross-examination.  They are expected to <Col N="273" /> take the risk that their lives may be exposed in the press, often in the most intimate aspects, when sexual abuse is concerned.  They are expected to lay their experiences of crime before strangers who are more often than not indifferent to their subjective pain.  They are expected to go through this experience alone.</P>
    <P>The only social policy response to the victims of crime has been the efforts of a voluntary organisation, the Irish Association for Victim Support, which constantly seeks more funding and has to beg the Government for this on a yearly basis.</P>
    <P>Having gone through the trauma of court, victims go home without being paid any compensation apart from being given out-of-pocket expenses and they must pick up the pieces of their lives as best they can.  We have constantly and consistently called for the establishment of a criminal injuries compensation tribunal on a statutory basis and the reinstatement of compensation for pain and suffering.  This could be funded from the seized assets of criminals.</P>
    <P>Legislation provides for this but it is not being used.  What is the value of the assets seized by the State from criminals?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

      <NameTxt>Ms O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year we went through the big charade of enacting monumental legislation which would at last allow the State to seize assets garnered by criminals in the pursuit of crime but this has not happened.  Even if the offender receives a jail sentence, the victim will still be well advised to be careful.  The abuse of parole and temporary release is such that the offender may be back on the streets within months.  If he is, the victim will be the last person to hear about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1993, 3,564 orders were made for full temporary release.  Thousands of offenders are being released and victims are not being told about this.  There is a totally unaccountable procedure for <Col N="274" /> releasing convicted criminals.  When I recently asked the Minister how many of them had reoffended, I was told there were no figures for this and that it would take far too much time and would be much too troublesome for the Department to find out this information.</P>
    <P>The State recently compensated a woman who was raped by an offender on temporary release.  If the State was willing and felt obliged to pay compensation to this woman, surely this is a precedent and an acceptance of the principle of the Bill that victims of crime are entitled to compensation, to be given a higher status in the criminal justice system and to be consulted whether a prosecution is dropped, is not forthcoming or goes ahead.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at length about the maladministration in our prosecution service, which means that gardaí can tell people in the street that no prosecutions are forthcoming but cannot tell them the reasons for this.  Correspondence is not replied to by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions or, if it is replied to, it is only to the effect that the case cannot be discussed.</P>
    <P>The victim has no status but is, I believe, the most important person in the criminal justice system.  Victims are the unsung heroes of the criminal process. I would not deny the right of an accused person to be tried by due course of law but the time has come for victims to be given parity of esteem and it is a matter of justice that this happens. Without the evidence of victims, there could often not be prosecutions.</P>
    <P>Information is vital.  From the time a crime is reported, procedures must include the victim.  Every garda station should have leaflets setting out how a criminal prosecution is conducted and giving the names and addresses of support agencies and the DPP's office should have an information section.  I recently contacted the Crown Prosecution Service to see how its service <Col N="275" /> worked.  It issues an information pack, provides a freephone service and engages with the public.  This is accountability. It produces an annual report showing the level and type of prosecutions.</P>
    <P>After two years of pestering the Taoiseach, we were recently eventually told that a review of the DPP's office is taking place and this is not before time.  It is high time this office was scrutinised from top to bottom and fully accountable procedures are put in place.</P>
    <P>The justice system is loaded against victims.  It beggars belief and is morally curious that an accused child abuser can successfully challenge, by way of judicial review in the High Court, a decision of the DPP to prosecute while at the same time no such review is permitted to the victim.  How can this be fair and how can it be justified by the Taoiseach, and the Minister, who espouses support for a charter for victims of crime?</P>
    <P>There is also a need to review the procedures which apply in appeal hearings, such as we witnessed in the appeal of the man convicted in the X case, when, on appeal, the sentence was reduced from 14 to four years.  There was outrage about this but nothing has happened to change it.  It is essential that the DPP should have a role in defending original court sentences at appeal hearings.  There has been a procession of such cases over the past two years.</P>
    <P>Kelly Fitzgerald died a horrible death from criminal neglect at the hands of her parents.  Plea bargaining meant that her parents were charged with the lesser offence of wilful neglect rather than assault causing grievous bodily harm.  In this case the victim is dead and who will champion her cause?  Will it be the Minister for Health, the Minister for Justice or the North-Western Health Board?  I do not see any of them doing so.</P>
    <P>The health board was alerted that she <Col N="276" /> was at risk.  The Minister has not yet published the report of the group established to investigate the role of the health board in dealing with the family of Kelly Fitzgerald.  Could her parents be released from jail and united with their remaining children without that crucial report being published?  I think it is possible.  The House should know what happened in the context of the health board's handling of the case. Nobody else will speak up for Kelly Fitzgerald because she is dead.</P>
    <P>A spate of recent cases have had one common factor, which is the decision of the DPP not to prosecute.  Nearly every newspaper report of cases of clerical abuse has as a final line that a file was sent to the DPP and a decision was made not to prosecute.  A decision was taken not to prosecute the Cork GP who violated his women patients.  The same happened in the Drogheda hospital case.  There have been many cases where the DPP decided not to prosecute without giving any explanation and very lax procedures were put in place for the subsequent monitoring of these abusers.</P>
    <P>Some victims are famous and some are faceless.  Victims have fared badly in the justice system and there is a wholly unknown number whose cases were not prosecuted and for whom justice was not available.  I do not see how the Minister can oppose this Bill.  When she took up office, she committed herself to championing the victims of crime.  Soon after she became Minister she met the association which was advocating a charter for victims.  This is all window dressing if a Bill like this can be voted down.</P>
    <P>Victims are a silent lobby but they are finding their voices by having the courage to say it to the press or to TDs that they are not going to put up with their unequal status in the criminal justice system.  Perhaps the victims who have <Col N="277" /> been wholly dissatisfied with the criminal justice system should march to the Dáil like farmers, vintners and others.</P>
    <P>Last week the Government accepted a Private Members' Bill to enable child abusers who offend abroad to be brought to justice here.  It is ironic that it accepted a Bill to protect children outside this State while accepting the systems and procedures which militate against people being brought to justice for the abuse of children in the State.</P>

      <P>I join other Deputies who have congratulated Deputy O'Dea on introducing this Bill.  As Members will be aware, the Government accepts that the Deputy acted from the best of motives in bringing forward his proposals, but because of serious defects in the Bill I regret that we must oppose it.  When a Bill is not accepted the conclusion is drawn that the Minister lacks understanding of the motivation behind the Bill or lacks the will to take action.  I have an obligation as Minister for Justice to ensure that all legislation I accept or put on the Statute Book stands the test of time.  I am not infallible, however, and I cannot guarantee that some member of the public will not take legislation to court, but I strongly object to the inference that because I do not accept a Bill put down by the Opposition, I am lacking in compassion for the victims of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea, who for a number of years was Minister of State at the Department of Justice, knows well that because of the way Opposition Bills are prepared they are often fraught with difficulties and not always the best way to get the kind of action needed.  In his statement to the House last week the Minister of State, Deputy Currie, outlined in some detail the problems that arise in the context of this Bill.  A number of these were also referred to by the Minister of State, Deputy Burton, last night.  I do not propose to cover that ground again but I wish to make it clear <Col N="278" /> that the Government is satisfied that, even if the Bill were substantially amended, it could not be accepted.  That is because many of the provisions are unrealistic or unworkable in practical terms.  I accept they have been put forward with the best motivation given that Deputy O'Dea is a lawyer, but nonetheless it is my responsibility to point out the flaws.  However, I will take into account the points made when making my own proposals to deal with the issue.</P>
    <P>I know Deputies share the real concern about the need to improve the position of victims of crime.  We are all aware that this is an area which requires support.  It has received special attention from legislators and others in recent years, including Deputy O'Dea's colleague.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  I am sure I do not need to remind the House of the significant body of legislation that has been enacted in this area. The allocation of the Vote for my Department to the Irish Association for Victim Support has been increased from £18,000 in 1993 to £130,000 in 1995.  I will introduce a charter for victims of crime in accordance with the Government's policy which will have greater effect than would this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all the Deputies who contributed to the debate, particularly my colleagues on the Fianna Fáil benches.  I also thank Deputy O'Donnell and her party for their support.  The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, referred to a number of what he described as technical defects in the legislation.  His central objection seemed to be that no sanction is written into the legislation.  I gave considerable thought to the idea of whether sanction should be included.  I concluded that it would be better to leave this thorny issue unresolved and, in the event that the Government accepted the Bill in principle, the wisdom of the Select Committee on Security and Legislation and <Col N="279" /> Department of Justice officials could be brought to bear on that topic.</P>
      <P>I concluded that a criminal sanction for non-compliance with the terms of the legislation on the part of the Garda would be inappropriate.  I wrestled with the notion of whether a civil sanction would be appropriate and decided it would not.  I am fortified in that by legal opinion, the bulk of which is that it is sufficient to put on a statutory basis rights such as these, and there is much precedent for that.  In any event there are in-built sanctions in the legislation &mdash; for example, responsibilities to keep the victim informed devolve from the Garda and if the gardaí do not obey the law that would be a matter of internal Garda discipline.  There is also the consideration that if that fact became known to the trial judge it might prejudice the trial.  Consequently the Garda, who naturally wish to secure a conviction as a reward for the time and effort invested, would have a powerful incentive to obey such requirement.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, expressed concern about the use of the word &ldquo;consulted&rdquo; in section 2.  I still believe that is the best word to use but I would be disposed to replace it with &ldquo;informed&rdquo; if the parliamentary draftsman believes it would be better.  The Minister also referred to the word &ldquo;all&rdquo; in section 2.  On reflection, that may be a little inflexible and could be replaced with a word such as &ldquo;relevant&rdquo;.  These are not serious objections.</P>
      <P>The second central objection advanced by Deputy Currie relates to section 3.  He said that if the victim was away and the information could not be communicated to him, the prosecution might be prejudiced.  The gardaí would know where the victim is because they would have received a written request for the information, which would obviously contain an address.  The Garda, having received that request, could call to, `phone or fax the victim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> If he cannot be contacted in that way the Garda could post the information to the victim's address.  If the victim absents himself or does not look at the information, that is not a matter for the Garda; it would have fulfilled its obligation. Such an objection is pathetic. The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, asked last night if it would be realistic to expect a victim to write to the Garda enumerating all the things to which they are entitled under section 3.  The Garda could prepare a standard application form which would enumerate these matters and ask the victim to tick off whichever is relevant.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State, Deputy Currie, gave the game away when he said that under the Garda's code of practice a victim is contacted regularly in the course of an investigation to be reassured on progress and informed about key information.  That is a cynical, misleading statement which unmasks the Government's attitude of victims of crime.  I showed that statement to a number of crime victims, gardaí, some of whom are of senior rank, and journalists who write about crime &mdash; that is a matter about which the Minister will hear more in the future &mdash; and they genuinely believed it was a bad joke.  They could not believe that such a misleading statement could be advanced as an alibi for inaction on such a serious matter. Does the Minister or the Ministers of State expect us to believe that on every occasion a crime is committed the gardaí phone and write to the victim to keep them informed of progress?  If the Minister does not believe that, as she indicated, why did she send the Minister of State into the House to make such a statement?</P>
    <P>I am constantly approached by people who meet the perpetrators of crime, who have come out of prison after serving only a fraction of their sentence.  If there is a code of practice whereby these people are informed of progress, there is no need for that provision.  It must be <Col N="281" /> a figment of their imagination or they must be a figment of my imagination.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Currie, also expressed concern about the provision for free legal advice.  He said I did not spell out properly how it would apply. My intention was that it would apply through the law centres.  People could attend the law centres to get advice and that could be covered by a one line amendment to the Bill.  That is not a serious objection.</P>
    <P>He also objected to the provisions on counselling.  He said I did not spell them out and I did not give the Government an indication of how I wanted it done.  I wrote the Bill for the Government; I am hardly expected to write the regulations as well.  It is not a serious objection to the Bill that a member of the Opposition did not write the regulations.  The Government has an army of advisers, civil servants, parliamentary draftsmen and spin doctors to provide that sort of thing for them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government has failed to respond to my call to compensate the victims of crime for pain and suffering.  The only response was to point to <i>A Government of Renewal</i> which promised to &ldquo;review&rdquo; procedures for compensation of victims.  A year has passed since that commitment was made and more than 100,000 reported indictable offences have been committed in that period.  What about the victims of those crimes?  What about the 300 or 400 people who will be victims of indictable crime today, tomorrow and every other day?  The Government tells us the review is ongoing.  However, the hundreds of thousands of citizens, with whose protection the Government is charged, who become victims in the meantime are being abandoned to their fate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="282" /> The Government condemned my proposal for what they called &ldquo;open-ended counselling&rdquo; for the victims of crime.  I did not intend the counselling to be open-ended and that is not specified in the Bill.  It would be confined to the victims of crime involving violence or a threat of violence as a result of which the victim has suffered either mental or physical injury.</P>
    <P>I do not like to personalise debates in this House, but surely those who argue that ideology and &ldquo;isms&rdquo; have become irrelevant in politics are proved right when the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy Burton, who has posed and prospered as a member of the so-called left wing of the Labour Party, quibbles in the Dáil about spending the small amount of money required to help a victim of vicious crime to be rehabilitated, particularly when that victim is often someone who was abused as a child and whose life has been shattered and destroyed as a result.  It is equally ironic that this so-called woman of the left, <i>La Passionaria</i> of the Labour Party, could also refuse to accept a proposal to give these unfortunate victims of child sexual abuse the same, not extra, rights when seeking civil damages as someone who fell into a pothole or was involved in a traffic accident or an industrial accident several years ago.</P>

The Minister of State, Deputy Burton, was more definitive and forthright as befits a person with her ideology. She told us that such rights were being &ldquo;carefully considered&rdquo;.  She also told us that the compensation scheme for victims of crime was &ldquo;being reviewed&rdquo;.  The Minister, Deputy Currie, told us that the timescale to allow victims to claim compensation was &ldquo;being examined&rdquo;.  The Minister for Justice, Deputy Owen, in response to a <Col N="284" /> recent parliamentary question stated that this matter was receiving &ldquo;deep thought&rdquo;.</P>

We are, however, wiser in one respect as a result of this debate and I thank the Minister for clarifying this point.  The Government has confirmed that all it will be offering the victims of crime is a charter.</P>

      <P>All legal opinion is to the effect that victims' rights must be placed on a statutory basis in order to obtain proper effect.  When Marie Antoinette was informed of the plight of the starving peasants of France on the eve of the revolution, so immune was she to their condition that she uttered the immortal words, &ldquo;let them eat cake&rdquo;.  The Government is equally immune to the plight of crime victims.  Its attitude to crime victims is that they do not need or deserve statutory rights so we will not give them statutory rights.  Let them make do with a charter.</P>

During the recent divorce referendum the Government, including Deputy Eric Byrne's party, called on the people to <Col N="285" /> show sympathy for those whose marriages had broken down and rightly so. However, this debate has shown that the Government, which demanded sympathy from the people, is not prepared to show sympathy to those whose bones, bodies and lives are broken because they have become the innocent victims of the avalanche of crime which this Government has failed to contain.  For too long the victims of crime have been pushed to the margins and used, abused and then ignored.  They are now demanding some minimal basic rights.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you for the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the Neodata factories &mdash; two in County Limerick and one in County Kerry.  In the autumn of 1993 while in Government I responded to the then Opposition Deputy, Dick Spring, when the entire firm was threatened with closure.</P>
      <P>Neodata has had a chequered history, providing mainly female employment, for 25 years.  It has provided a valuable and viable service, otherwise the firm would not have restructured and continued after the earlier scare in 1993. That is a thumb nail sketch of the background history of Neodata.</P>
      <P>To judge from what Deputy Finucane said, the announcement of the closure came as a shock to him and to other people in the vicinity of Newcastle West and Kilmallock.  A month prior to Christmas the workers were told that the firm is to close.  This is very sad.  It is the same old story: Neodata has been here for many years employing a strong female workforce who for many years have been the bread-winners in their families due to vicissitudes and economic hardship in various families.  They have to provide for children, mortgages and all the weekly needs of a household. To be told in a peremptory fashion that their services are no longer required smacks of a feudal way of doing business and, in this case, it is a great affront to employees.</P>
      <P>The Minister set up a task force for industry adjustment, to which he gave a budget of £22 million, to identify manufacturing industries which could be in danger but which had potential and to plan renewal strategies for those firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="290" /> I cannot get to the bottom of this task force for industrial strategy renewal. Every time I ask a question about it I am told it is something else.  What is the task force doing?  What is it studying? On what is it spending its money?  What is its strategy?  What is its renewal process? What firms and people have been helped by the task force with its £22 million which was set up with a great fanfare?</P>
    <P>Neodata would be tailor made if its problems had been tackled on time.  I do not know whether Neodata can regroup, if its work can be revitalised and redirected and if the considerable skills of the female workforce, developed over a number of years, can be rechannelled into alternative industries or ways of earning money.  Surely the task force has the wherewithal in terms of finance and the remit from the Minister to investigate this.  Will the Minister tell us whether he can, at this late stage, save Neodata and, if not, will he encourage alternative suitable employment for the skilled female workforce who have worked for so long in this firm.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelFinucane" hpid="Mr. Finucane Mr. Finucane">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Finucane</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of speaking on this issue.  I am familiar with the problem because one of the plants involved is located in Newcastle West and the other in Kilmallock. I live in Newcastle West and know many of the workers there who were devastated by the recent news.  Not only did it come as a surprise to them, it was a great surprise to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the history of this company.  Neodata was set up in Newcastle West and Kilmallock over 20 years ago.  During that time the company has had a chequered history and there have been ups and downs with regard to employment.  The Kilmallock operation recently reduced its workforce to 35 while the Newcastle West plant has over 70 employees, yet the companies were regarded as stable and <Col N="291" /> part of the indigenous industrial workforce.</P>
    <P>Another favourable aspect of the companies was that their workforce was predominantly female.  Many of the employees came from the local secretarial schools and they were engaged in keyboard work, subscription fulfilment, etc., which suited them.  Many of the employees are married and, as Deputy O'Rourke said, they are the breadwinners in the family because their husbands are on social welfare.</P>
    <P>Those workers were as surprised as I was when news of the closures was announced.  The reason I expressed my annoyance so forcefully yesterday to the media was because this company experienced certain problems in November 1993 as a result of its decision to relocate to Boulder, Colorado.  The company stated at that time it would make up the deficiency by seeking alternative markets, particularly in Europe, to provide sufficient work for the residual workforce.  The company had regular consultations with the local public representatives in the area and asked us to respect the confidentiality of their actions and we adhered to that because we felt we were being fully briefed.</P>
    <P>I understand that in recent times the workforce increased to 850 as a result of securing a contract in the United States with the Philip Morris cigarette company, which runs a promotion called &ldquo;The Country Store&rdquo; in which coupons are given to people who buy cigarettes. The coupon processing was being carried out in Listowel and there was a spin-off business in Newcastle West also where people would reclaim gifts.  Much of that work was seasonal and the company secured other contracts.</P>
    <P>When the company expanded its workforce recently it was anticipated that when the seasonal work eased off, there would still be sufficient work for its residual workforce.  There seemed to be a period of co-operation with the <Col N="292" /> public representatives with regard to consultations but no warning signal was given to any of us that the company was experiencing difficulties.  Some of these workers will be let go on 8 December, others on 15 December.  That is a Christmas present none of them would have anticipated.  While Listowel can bask in the glory of expansion &mdash; and I wish them well &mdash; there is a sense of despondency in my county over what happened.  It is bad enough having one operation close down but to have two close down is a body blow.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Rourke about the early warning signals.  I recall Members being told that if Forfás and the powers that be felt companies were experiencing certain problems, early warning signals would be sent to allow the industrial promotion agencies to take remedial action to find alternative industries.  The company stated that the workers will be let go and that it will probably retain the buildings in Newcastle West and Kilmallock with a view to providing some seasonal employment to meet the American market.  That is of no long-term use to these employees.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister at this late stage to inform the industrial promotion agencies that this workforce has the necessary skills and that they should avail of the talent and obtain suitable alternative employment for these areas to make up for the current vacuum.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton) Richard Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for raising this issue.  This announcement and the way it was made came as a surprise.  I was only yesterday morning that my Department was advised of the serious problems.  The agencies were not alerted early to the impending difficulties. Neodata has now announced the closure of its Kilmallock operation with a loss of 36 jobs and the closure of its Newcastle West operation with a loss of 71 jobs with effect from 15 December 1995.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="293" /> Neodata has four operations in Ireland at Kilmallock, Newcastle West, Listowel and Limerick.  It will retain its Listowel operation where 93 people are employed and the Limerick operation which employes seven people.  The company's main reason for the closure is that a current major contract will only be retained at a lower level of business in 1996 and, therefore, fewer employees will be required.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, as the House is no doubt aware, this is not the first time Neodata has run into problems.  In November 1993, exactly two years ago, when the company employed 400 people between their four Irish locations, it announced that it was consolidating all its operations back to Boulder, Colorado, with the loss of all 400 jobs in Ireland.  In the event, collaboration between the company and the IDA prevented the loss of 260 jobs with two major contracts being secured.</P>
    <P>While the company has been particularly successful in identifying and securing new business for its offices in the mid-west, a drop in demand for the services provided at Kilmallock resulted in the introduction of a voluntary redundancy programme at that office earlier this year.  The programme, which involved 35 redundancies, was fully subscribed and was implemented between June and October of this year.</P>
    <P>Neodata also implemented a programme of temporary lay-offs last summer involving almost 20 permanent staff.  These lay-offs were necessary because of a delay in securing new contracts and to seasonal variations.</P>
    <P>The company has now concluded that it has approximately 100 people in excess of what its current order book justifies.  While it still has a major contract in the US, and has negotiated another contract for 1996, the work will be at a lower level and accordingly will require fewer people.</P>
    <P>In addition, the company's efforts to develop a European market have not, so far, proven successful.  Neodata is continuing its marketing efforts in Europe, with the support of IDA <Col N="294" /> Ireland, but this will take time.  In the meantime, the company considers that it cannot justify the present levels of staffing.  Accordingly, it plans to restructure the Irish operations to have a more cost effective base from which to move forward in the future.</P>
    <P>The net result is that the company proposes to close the Kilmallock and Newcastle West Offices.  Following this, Neodata would have 100 permanent staff as I indicated.  In addition, during 1996 Neodata expects to have up to 100 full time equivalents working as temporary and part-time employees between Listowel and Limerick.</P>
    <P>As regards the Task Force for Industry Adjustment, which was mentioned by Deputy O'Rourke, its primary purpose is to identify areas of business at risk from competitive forces and to propose competitive strategies.  The task force has approved a &ldquo;Change Management Programme&rdquo; which is targeted in particular at providing grant support to enable traditional industries, rather than companies such as Neodata, undertake certain initiatives.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke also mentioned a dedicated jobs task force for the Newcastle West and Kilmallock areas.  I do not see fruitful progress being made by setting up such task forces because, increasingly, there would be a demand for them in many areas of the country and this would only dissipate the efforts of the State agencies.  Nevertheless, I assure the House that I have directed IDA Ireland to redouble its efforts to find replacement industries in the region.  I have also asked IDA Ireland to continue to support the endeavours being made by Neodata to secure sustainable new business.</P>
    <P>I can also say to the House that the development agencies have been very active in the region in attracting new industries and assisting in the expansion of others.  Companies such as Analog Devices, Dell, Cabletron and AST continue to expand in the Limerick area. They have invested substantial capital <Col N="295" /> and this, coupled with their relationship with the University of Limerick, will ensure that they remain at the forefront of their technologies.  In addition, the arrival of new overseas companies such as Vistakon, which will employ 450 people by 1998, and APC, which will commence recruitment of 300 people next year, are positive developments for the area as a whole.</P>
    <P>I assure Deputies that every effort will continue to be made to ensure that Neodata has a future in Ireland.  Neodata first came to Limerick in 1969.  It did so without State assistance as the internationally traded service sector did not qualify for State aid at that time. However, it has been grant assisted in the meantime.  It has been a major employer in the mid-west for over 25 years and its ongoing contribution to the economy is very much appreciated.</P>
    <P>My immediate concern and that of IDA Ireland will be to see if anything can be done to secure new business and avert job losses, and what can be done about replacement opportunities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomKitt" hpid="Mr. T. Kitt Mr. T. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to intervene in the Dunnes Stores dispute. Earlier this year the Minister had an opportunity to grasp the nettle not only in regard to the problems at Dunnes Stores but also in regard to the ongoing problem of the exploitation of part-time workers.  The Government was very concerned about part-time workers when it cobbled together the Programme for Government last year. However, that concern by a supposedly left wing dominated Government has gone out the window along with many more of its promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Part-time workers in Dunne Stores and elsewhere have been left unprotected because the Government turned its back on them.  Other EU states have <Col N="296" /> dealt with this issue in one way or another.  I am grateful to the Minister for coming to the House to reply to this matter but I wish to remind him that during the Cork by-election the Fine Gael Party in particular promised that it would introduce legislation to control Sunday trading.  There will be more disputes similar to the one at Dunnes Stores and chaos and confusion will continue while this free-for-all prevails.  The Minister refuses to introduce the necessary legislation to regularise Sunday trading and provide statutory protection for part-time workers.</P>
    <P>I wish to put forward proposals in this regard to the Minister.  My first point is that there is a need to control Sunday trading, not ban it.  There is a clear demand from consumers for Sunday trading at certain times of the year.  The case for Sunday trading in tourist areas has been well made and equally good cases have been made for Sunday trading by the family corner shop, filling stations and garden centres.  I understand the Minister has been advised by the Attorney General that it is constitutionally impossible to control Sunday trading.  Will he say if this is the case and, if so, will he publish the legal advice?  The Members are entitled to know the basis for his arguments.</P>
    <P>The second point concerns the issue of zero hour contracts, which was dealt with in the Dunne Stores dispute but must be dealt with by way of legislation. The time has come to make zero hour contracts which do not make a guarantee of a minimum number of working hours illegal.  These contracts are used by shops, hotels, catering firms, contract cleaning companies and nursing.  These contracts can be made illegal within weeks if the Government implements the EU working time directive into Irish law.  This can be brought about through dialogue with the social partners.</P>
    <P>The third point to make is that Sunday is different to other days and a person should not be forced to work on this <Col N="297" /> day.  Under British legislation workers can agree an opt out clause which means they are not obliged to work on Sundays and will not lose their jobs if they do so. Fourth, the Shops Hours of Trading Act, 1938 which requires employers to give starting and finishing times in an hours of work notice needs to be updated.  The sanction for a breach of this rule is a maximum fine of £20 plus a penalty of £4 per day where the offence is a continuing one.  It is clear that this legislation is out of date.</P>
    <P>I put forward those proposals which will provide greater protection for part-time workers to the Minister as I appreciate this is not an easy issue with which to deal.  Part-time employment accounts for approximately 11 per cent of workers compared with the figure of 6.5 per cent in 1985.  I ask the Minister not to expose these workers to the free-for-all atmosphere which prevails today but to face up to his responsibilities and introduce the necessary legislation to protect their rights and working conditions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Kitt for raising this matter and for putting forward proposals in regard to legislative change.  If I am to do justice to the issues he has raised and to be in a position to give authoritative responses then he will have to table a separate question. This matter deals essentially with the Dunnes Stores dispute and the need for intervention.  I am not trying to avoid dealing with the other issues but this is a separate matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current dispute at Dunnes Stores concerns the rates of pay to be applied for Sunday working during the pre-Christmas period.  There was a four week strike in the company during the summer and this was eventually settled on the basis of a Labour Court recommendation. At the time the court's recommendation dealt with a number of <Col N="298" /> issues in dispute, including Sunday trading. This issue arose against a background of an emerging trend by some stores to open on Sundays at times other than at Christmas.  Traditionally the company paid treble time to staff who worked on Sundays during the pre-Christmas period.  However, the management informed the union that it intended to apply the Labour Court formula to all Sunday working, including the pre-Christmas period.  This would involve paying double time to staff employed before October 1994 and time-and-a-half to staff taken on since then.  The union finds this unacceptable on the grounds that there is a long standing agreement on treble time payment for pre-Christmas Sunday trading and the Labour Court recommendation did not alter this agreement.  In a clarification issued to the union the Labour Court confirmed that its recommendation on year-round Sunday opening did not relate to the agreement on pre-Christmas Sunday trading and added that negotiation on Christmas opening was a matter for the parties concerned.</P>
    <P>A conciliation conference was held in the Labour Relations Commission yesterday to try to resolve the dispute but regrettably no agreement was reached. The resolution of any industrial dispute is ultimately a matter for the parties directly involved.  I do not regard it as appropriate for me to intervene directly in industrial disputes.  However, dispute settling services are provided by the State in the form of the Labour Relations Commission and the Labour Court.  Both bodies have well proven track records and considerable experience in dealing with industrial disputes.</P>
    <P>While no agreement was reached during the talks at the Labour Relations Commission yesterday the services of the commission are still available to assist the parties if they so request. Alternatively, if the parties feel that no useful purpose would be served in <Col N="299" /> returning to the Labour Relations Commission they can refer the matter to the Labour Court for investigation and recommendation.  Both services are available on a voluntary basis and it is up to the parties involved to decide whether to avail of them.  Dunnes Stores is a major employer in the retail distribution sector.  It also provides an outlet for many indigenous manufacturing companies.  It would be deeply regrettable not only for the company and its workers but also for the wider general public if its activities were to be seriously curtailed during the peak trading period before Christmas.  Having regard to all the considerations, I call on both sides to resume negotiations immediately.</P>

      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter.  I raise it arising out of a reply I received from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry on 16 November in reply to a question on this topic.  The gist of the reply, which ran to two or three pages, was that there was no crisis in the horseracing industry.  It reminded me of a former Member of this House, unhappily recently deceased, who when faced with the most obvious possible crisis used to ask, &ldquo;what crisis?&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount spent on betting is at its lowest since 1985.  In order to stand still in real terms the amount spent would have had to increase by 3 to 4 per cent per annum.  However, not alone has there been no increase but there has been a decrease over a ten year period. Since the Galway races in July the amount spent on betting has dropped at virtually every meeting.  Everybody involved in the industry is highly critical of the present situation.  The new Irish Horseracing Authority which took over from the Racing Board is certainly not a <Col N="300" /> success.  There is considerable infighting and enormous tensions with the Turf Club and this is detrimental to the industry as a whole.  Everything Deputy Doyle and I said about the industry and about the Bill setting up this new authority, when it was being debated in this House last year, has unfortunately turned out to be true.  The situation which was then bad is, if anything, probably worse now.  Only the 1993 accounts of the Racing Board are available although we are now at the end of 1995. The Racing Board has not provided its accounts within a reasonable period and the format of the accounts is unsatisfactory because they give the minimum information.  What was disclosed by the 1993 accounts shows the situation is even worse than it was in 1992.</P>
    <P>The tote, which should be a major source of income and which is a major source of income for racing in every other country, is still losing close to £1 million each year.  It is quite an achievement that a monopoly totalisator can actually lose money but the Irish monopoly totalisator succeeds in losing money.  The situation will continue to get worse because the deduction from the tote pool seems to have increased recently &mdash; and I would like to know whether the Minister agreed to that increase &mdash; and so far as one can work out from the scanty figures available, the deduction from the pool appears to approach 20 per cent which is scandalous. That is borne out by the fact that dividends on favourites are regularly £1.10 which are odds of ten to one on. How the Irish Horseracing Authority can expect people to continue to bet in those circumstances is beyond me.</P>
    <P>The Government grant in 1993 was £4.3 million.  I cannot get the up-to-date figure exactly, but I understand from somebody who would know that it is now over £6 million.  If that is the case it appears the Government grant or subsidy to the Irish Horseracing Authority is greater than the income it generates <Col N="301" /> from the levy.  It is absolutely disgraceful that it should be so.  In every other country the horseracing authority is able to generate a very substantial income and is able to plough large sums of money back into the industry.  The manner in which it might be done here was advocated by the committee chaired by Lord Killanin which reported several years ago but whose report has been ignored.  The contrast with other racing countries is enormous.  It is particularly regrettable that we should be in these difficulties when we have some of the best horses in the world.  We have always produced and bred the outstanding national hunt horses.  Happily, the outstanding national hunt horses in the world are not just bred in Ireland, they are now owned and trained here as the results in Cheltenham in the past two years show.  This year we have the most outstanding filly in the world, Ridgewood Pearl, bred here by a small breeder who owns her.  She was trained in Ireland and ridden by an Irish jockey and has won group one races all over the world.  With raw material of that kind at our disposal our failure to make a success of the racing industry and to see it decline year by year is grossly disappointing. I am very anxious that the Minister, whom I am sorry is not here tonight, and has an interest in these things would intervene to try to put a stop to this steady and inexorable decline.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy O'Malley for raising this matter.  I appreciate his concern.  He is respected by the racing fraternity and by Members for his expert knowledge of racing.  My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Forestry, Deputy Yates, replied to a parliamentary question from Deputy O'Malley on 16 November 1995 regarding &ldquo;the crisis in Irish racing <Col N="302" /> that is resulting in a severe drop in betting&rdquo;. The position remains as outlined in that reply.  On course betting turnover to 13 November was marginally up on the same period in 1994.  This increase would have been somewhat greater but for the dispute which saw no bookmakers standing at Leopardstown in recent weeks.  I understand from the Irish Horseracing Authority that intensive negotiations with a view to resolving this dispute are on-going and that substantial progress towards a settlement has been made.</P>
      <P>With regard to tote betting I understand that, while turnover has been down this year, the tote will nevertheless return a substantial profit for the year as a whole.  Tote turnover has been affected by some adverse initial reaction to changes made in its operation aimed at improving the service provided for punters.</P>

      <P>I presume I am allowed to finish.  Tote business which is particularly sensitive to reductions in <Col N="303" /> the number of runners, has also been affected by the reduction of about 20 per cent in the average number of runners per meeting during the month of August and September due to the hot dry weather.  With the change in the going in recent weeks, the number of runners has increased substantially and the evidence suggests that tote turnover has been responding positively.</P>
      <P>Total attendances at race meetings, which is another indicator of the state of the industry, have remained at or close to one million for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="304" /> In the circumstances I cannot agree that there is a crisis in Irish horseracing. I recognise that it faces a number of problems but I am satisfied that the Irish Horseracing Authority is addressing these problems in a realistic way and that satisfactory solutions will be found. I am also satisfied that the authority, which is representative of the various interests in the industry, is in the best position to find solutions and to plan and implement a development programme aimed at enabling the industry to prosper in the years ahead.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 24, 32, 35, 47, 49, 66, 67 and 68 together.</P>
      <P>I am conscious of the concerns of exporters to the UK about the impact of the higher exchange rate of the Irish pound against sterling.  As Deputies will be aware, I met the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, IBEC, earlier this year to discuss the effects of the Irish pound's rise in value against sterling. My Department has stayed in touch with IBEC about the matter since.  In addition, various meetings at official and ministerial level will be held as usual with business and farming interests in the coming weeks and I have no doubt that their concerns about the currency situation will be reiterated in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I appreciate these concerns, I think it is necessary to put the currency developments of 1995 in perspective. Over recent years the Irish economy has achieved very strong economic growth <Col N="104" /> and increased employment against a background of low inflation, a balance of payments surplus and firm control of the public finances.  This strong performance has been achieved at a time of significant appreciation of the Irish pound against sterling.  In addition, while the Irish pound has undoubtedly risen more quickly against sterling this year, that appreciation has essentially been produced by the markets themselves and should be providing offsetting benefits for some firms, in terms of lower import costs.  Moreover, the Irish pound has depreciated against the Deutschemark and certain other currencies, a factor which should generally be of advantage to exporters to various EU member states other than the UK.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that a stable exchange rate, flowing from our participation in the zone of stability which the ERM represents, has helped to underpin the policy approach within which low inflation has been achieved in recent years.  This low inflation is central to our longer-term strategy, based on moderate wage developments and continuing improvement in the public finances, to strengthen our employment performance.  At 2.4 per cent year on year, the most recent Irish inflation figure compares favourably with the UK figure of 3.2 per cent and should confer a key competitive advantage on Irish industry.  Low inflation is also very important in the maintenance of low interest rates over time: in this context, I would emphasise that key UK interbank interest rates are about one percentage point above corresponding Irish rates.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have raised the question of setting up a fund to assist exporters, some mentioning a recent ESRI report.  I take it that this is the summer 1995 ESRI quarterly economic commentary, and I quote the relevant extract from that document:</P>
    <P>While the responsibility for protecting themselves against the risk of currency fluctuations lies primarily with the companies concerned, circumstances can be envisaged which <Col N="105" /> could justify a temporary package of government measures to counter any immediate threat to employment.  To permit such a response in the unlikely event that it is needed, and to cover any other unforeseen problems which might arise, it is desirable that some flexibility is retained in the 1996 budget balance.  Preferably, this should be in the form of an explicit contingency reserve, with the hope that it would not prove necessary to use it.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will see from this quotation, the ESRI commentary did not recommend support for exporters disadvantaged by the then current value of the Irish pound against sterling, which was not substantially different from its present level.  Rather the commentary referred to the possibility of a further sterling depreciation in 1996 and said that circumstances could be envisaged which could justify a temporary package of Government measures to counter any immediate threat to employment.  To permit such a response in the unlikely event that it would be needed, and to cover any other unforeseen problems, the commentary recommended the retention of some flexibility in the 1996 budget balance, preferably in the form of an explicit contingency reserve.</P>
    <P>While Deputies will obviously have to await budget day 1996 for details of my 1996 budget, I have no plans to provide for a contingency fund along the lines suggested in the ESRI commentary or to introduce special measures to aid exporters to the UK, either in the form of a renewed market development fund or otherwise.  As the ESRI commentary itself says, the responsibility for protecting themselves against the risks of currency fluctuations lies primarily with the companies concerned.</P>
    <P>In addition, the present circumstances are quite different from those which gave rise to the establishment of the market development fund in 1992.  In particular, I would draw attention to the fact that while at times during the 1992/93 currency crisis Irish interbank interest rates were at extraordinary high levels, they are now significantly below <Col N="106" /> corresponding UK rates.  In any event, establishing either a contingency fund or a market development fund now would involve a significant commitment of funds at a time when the Government has set itself a tight ceiling for expenditure and when commentators including the ESRI, and IBEC, are calling for expenditure restraint.  Finally, it is very likely, to say the least, that the European Commission would, on competition grounds, refuse to agree to the establishment of a State fund specifically aimed at helping exporters.</P>
    <P>In this context, I would refer specifically to Deputy Andrew's proposal that a new market development fund be established under the cohesion definition. In fact such action does not come within the scope of the actions envisaged under the Maastricht Treaty for the promotion of economic and social cohesion which are aimed, and I quote, &ldquo;at reducing disparities between the levels of development of the various regions&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is of course true that the Government has a responsibility for ensuring that the economic environment is as conducive as possible to economic activity, including exporting.  The Government already provides a substantial measure of support in the form of the 10 per cent rate of corporation tax for manufacturing industry, the provision of grants, the activities of An Bord Tráchtála and the implementation of the National Development Plan.  In addition, the present economic climate is characterised by sound public finances, low inflation, interest rates close to historically low levels, wage moderation under the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work</i> and high levels of economic growth.  Furthermore, as Deputies will be aware, the small business loan fund, which was extended this year to a sum of £208 million, in providing business loans for small businesses, including the services sector, at a fixed rate of 6.5 per cent: this measure ought to be of benefit to small firms affected by the exchange rate situation.</P>
    <P>Finally, as the House will be aware, my 1995 budget contained measures, including improvements in income tax, <Col N="107" /> PRSI and corporation tax, which were aimed at further improving the economic climate for industry, including exporters.  These measures were, in part, specifically aimed at helping those indigenous Irish firms with traditional markets in the UK.  The improvements in income tax and employee PRSI serve to underpin the moderate wage developments enshrined in the <i>Programme for Competitiveness and Work.</i> The employer PRSI measure is of special importance to firms in the export sector: the increase in the income threshold below which the lower 9 per cent rate of employer PRSI applies will support some 170,000 existing jobs and will help to reduce labour costs in employment-intensive sectors which are particularly dependent on the UK market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Central Bank has met representatives of the Irish banking sector to discuss the implications which will arise for the Irish banking industry from the introduction of the single currency. There are a number of issues which need to be considered by the Irish banking industry, including loss of income from foreign exchange and related risk management activities and increased competition at European level.  Such losses would of course represent gains for bank customers and the economy as a whole and should be compensated for, to some extent at least, by gains for the banking industry if a larger level of economic activity under Economic and Monetary Union resulted in <Col N="108" /> greater demand for other banking services.</P>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy recently, options in relation to the State banking sector are currently being examined. Until the Government has considered and decided on the options, it would be wrong of me to make detailed statements about the role of any particular financial institution.  The Deputy is, of course, correct in focusing on the role of new technology because technological innovation has been one of the main forces driving the rapid pace of change in banking in recent years.  Together with the progressive dismantling of barriers to the movement of capital, new technology has revolutionised the industry. Any proposals which the Government may bring forward will inevitably have to reckon with this factor.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 26 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="110" /> I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the completion of the Internal Market, in accordance with the provisions of the Single European Act, and in particular the abolition of internal frontier controls, caused considerable staffing, operational and other changes in the Customs and Excise Service.</P>
    <P>Arising out of the completion of the Internal Market, there was a potential staff surplus of approximately 600 departmental Customs and Excise staff. In tackling the surplus situation, the Revenue Commissioners set themselves the objective of providing alternative work for the staff affected in, or close to, their existing locations so as to minimise the disruption to the staff and their families.  Government decisions were made to give the Revenue Commissioners responsibility for the collection of EU trade statistics and the new VAT information exchange system and for the administration of the new motor vehicle registration tax.  The Revenue Commissioners also expanded some existing functions of the Customs and Excise Service, especially the strengthening of the common external border, increased control of drugs and other illicit traffic, improved CAP control and post importation audit work.  Customs and Excise officials have also provided assistance for the Collector-General's Office and Chief Inspector of Taxes Office to improve revenue collection, strengthen enforcement and combat evasion across all tax-heads.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the above position, for a large number of people in the departmental Customs and Excise Service their work changed fundamentally following the completion of the Internal Market, and their duties are now similar to those performed in the general Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The integration of the various grading structures in the office of the Revenue Commissioners has been the policy of the commissioners for some time now. In recent years, the majority of unions representing Revenue staff have also <Col N="111" /> agreed, in principle, to discuss integration as a desirable objective.  The process of translating this policy and objective into reality began some 14 months ago when the commissioners produced a draft document which they proposed as a basis for a negotiated approach to the integration of the departmental Customs and Excise and general service grades.  Following extensive negotiations between the commissioners and the staff representatives concerned, a document setting out the terms of an agreement for the integration of departmental Customs and Excise and general service staff has been produced and is currently being balloted on by staff in the general service and departmental Customs and Excise areas of the office.  The result of this ballot will be available early next week.</P>
    <P>If the proposals to integrate the departmental Customs and Excise and general service grades are accepted, the staff in both these streams will benefit from better career and location opportunities in the following manner: they will have opportunities to experience a much broader range of work; they will have access to a much wider range of posts and locations within Revenue and in other Civil Service offices and Departments and, in the case of departmental Customs and Excise grades, access for the first time to the Government's decentralisation programme for both transfer and promotional purposes; they will have opportunities to have a career in parts of the country that were previously closed off.</P>
    <P>The Revenue Commissioners have assured their staff and their representatives that, in an integrated structure, staff will not be moved from their existing locations and that there is no intention to have large scale movement of staff, within locations, from their existing jobs.</P>
    <P>The commissioners are satisfied that if the proposals to integrate the two grading streams are accepted, it will <Col N="112" /> lead to greater efficiency and effectiveness in the ongoing organisation and management of the work of the office with a positive impact on productivity. It will also enable the commissioners to adapt to ongoing changes and to meet the demands being made on the office by Government, by the European Union and by our customers.</P>

      <P>A joint working group, representative of my Department and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, put forward recommendations last year proposing changes in the annual accounts of Government Departments.  These accounts, the Appropriation Accounts, are presented to the Dáil annually and examined by the Committee of Public Accounts.  The working group's report was referred to the committee, because of their interest in the matter, and the committee, having considered it, accepted the recommendations.  These are to be implemented on a phased basis over a three-year period, starting with the 1994 accounts.  The 1994 accounts, which were published in conjunction with the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General, are now available in the Library.  Paragraph 1 of the reports sets out the main revisions which have been made, while a statement of the accounting policies and principles followed in the preparation and audit of the accounts is also included.</P>
      <P>Since the joint working group reported, the strategic management initiative has been launched and, in that context, further consideration is being given to financial management systems in Government Departments.  In addition, a pilot project on accrual accounting is under way, with the assistance of a commercial accountancy firm, in the Department of Transport, Energy and Communications.  It is expected that the results of this project will be available early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Existing statutory requirements specify that Government accounting shall be <Col N="115" /> on a cash basis.  The changes already introduced and those at present contemplated will enhance the cash information rather than replace it.  Accordingly, no amending legislation has or will be required at this stage.  My Department will keep the House informed, by way of the Committee of Public Accounts, of any further significant changes that may be under consideration.</P>
    <P>With regard to the annual budget, the Deputy can be assured that the preparation and presentation of the budget is reviewed on an ongoing basis as is the publication of the Estimates.  I will continue to monitor the situation with a view to implementing further improvements where necessary.</P>

      <P>As Minister for Finance I have overall responsibility for the operation of the national lottery the surplus proceeds of which are allocated by the Government under the National Lottery Act, 1986.  I would therefore naturally be concerned at any loss of sales to the national lottery as a result of the independent taking of bets on the outcome of the national lottery.  This would reduce the resources available to the beneficiary fund which supports areas such as health, welfare, youth and sport.</P>
      <P>In considering an appropriate response to this betting, I can assure the Deputy that all relevant factors will be taken into account including the revenue implications for the Exchequer, now and in the future, the interests of the betting industry and of those employed in it.</P>

      <P>The disabled drivers and passengers scheme provides a range of tax related benefits for the purchase and operation of vehicles for qualifying individual disabled drivers and passengers and for organisations catering for the disabled whose members qualify under the scheme.</P>
      <P>An extensive and wide ranging review of the operation of the disabled drivers scheme was completed in 1994.  This involved consultation with relevant Government Departments, the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, the Revenue Commissioners, the health boards and relevant organisations catering for the disabled.  The Finance spokespersons of each political party were also consulted.</P>
      <P>The issue of the medical criteria for qualification was looked at in considerable detail in the course of the review, bearing in mind the various representations which had been received seeking the extension of the benefits of the scheme to other medical categories, including to cystic fibrosis sufferers.  The review recommended that the existing specific medical criteria should remain broadly unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current medical criteria for qualification for the scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations, 1994.  The <Col N="117" /> medical criteria are designed so that people who qualify for the scheme do so irrespective of the original cause of their disability.  A move to listing particular disabilities in themselves such as cystic fibrosis, as automatically included in the scheme would change the nature of the scheme from one based on disability in itself which gives rise to severe mobility problems, to one giving reliefs in respect of particular medical conditions regardless of the degree of medical impairment.</P>
    <P>I understand the Deputy's concern in this matter with particular regard to cystic fibrosis.  I have asked my officials to undertake a detailed examination of the issue and to report back to me early in the New Year.</P>

      <Quest>with regard to the recent report by the Association of Higher Civil Servants on the Government's strategic management initiative, if he will respond to the problems identified which include the sprawling remit of his Department and its lack of proper co-ordination with other Departments; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I would point out that the Association of Higher Civil Servants (AHCS) report to which the Deputy refers was a submission made in June of this year in response to a request from the Co-ordinating Group of Secretaries, which was set up to oversee the strategic management initiative, for ideas and suggestions regarding the proposed programme for reform of the civil and public service.  The AHCS submission was not therefore directed specifically at my Department but was concerned with the civil and public service in general.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, this administration clearly stated in its Programme for Government that public service reform would be high on its agenda, and that a number of problems were known to exist which could only be addressed by a systematic programme of action including legislative change.  Earlier this year the Government mandated the Co-ordinating Group of Secretaries to prepare proposals for reform and I understand that the group will submit its proposals to Government very shortly.  In framing its proposals, the group has taken account of the views of the AHCS.  Once it has had an opportunity to consider the group's proposals, the Government will announce details of a reform programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government has not been slow to acknowledge the need for reform within the public service and would share much common ground with the AHCS and other bodies in their assessment of what needs to be done.  The Deputy also adverts to my Department's remit and its co-ordination with other Departments.  The strategic management initiative, which was introduced by the last Government, has resulted in the completion by almost all <Col N="119" /> Departments and offices of a strategic statement setting out their mission and high-level objectives, as well as their principal strategies for achieving those objectives.  My own Department has also completed this exercise in which it addressed a wide range of issues, including the need to increase the quality of co-ordination and communication between it and other Departments. Indeed, this matter received considerable attention and the need for devising suitable mechanisms for addressing it was fully acknowledged.  The work that is now under way is expected to produce a strategy for further improving the quality of co-ordination, thus building upon the significant improvements which have already been made over the past several years.</P>
    <P>I would not agree with the Deputy that my Department's remit is not logically conceived or that it does not fit satisfactorily within a rational framework for public administration in this country.  However, the strategic management initiative is an ongoing process, requiring regular review of the business, organisation and structures of each Department, as well as the Civil Service as a whole, and adjustments in the remit of each must be expected from time to time in line with changing needs and circumstances. This is the whole purpose of the strategic management initiative.</P>

The legislation provides that these thresholds will be index linked in future years.</P>

      <P>Widowed persons are generally given special recognition by the income tax code and are treated more favourably than a single person.  The widowed person's personal tax free allowance currently stands at £3,000.  This is £500 higher than the personal allowance available to a single person which is £2,500.  Furthermore, an additional allowance of £2,000 is available to the widowed person who has dependent children.  This means that the personal allowances of a widowed person with dependent children are brought up to £5,000, the same level as the basic allowance for a married couple.  In the year of bereavement, the widowed person also retained married treatment i.e. double rate bands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a special ceiling on <Col N="121" /> mortgage interest relief for widowed persons, which is currently £3,600 as compared to £2,500 for a single person. In addition where a widowed person is in private rented accommodation and is under 55 years of age a tax free allowance of up to £750 per annum at the standard rate of tax is available, and if the widowed person is aged 55 or over the allowance is up to £1,500 at the taxpayer's marginal rate of tax.  The similar allowances for a single person are £500 and £1,000 respectively.</P>
    <P>Specific recognition is also provided in the tax code for the special difficulties faced by widowed parents in the years immediately following bereavement, through a special transitional allowance introduced in 1991 for widowed parents with dependent children to operate for the first three years following bereavement. This allowance, which is provided in addition to the allowances I have already mentioned, is £1,500 for the first tax year following bereavement, £1,000 for the second and £500 for the third.</P>
    <P>Consequently, I am sure that the Deputy will agree that the income tax code provides particular assistance to widowed persons and especially so in the case of widowed persons with dependent children.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 28, 30 and 46 together.  The timetable for movement to the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union, EMU, is laid down in the Treaty on European Union. The Treaty provides that the decision will be made by the European Council before 31 December 1996 after it has consulted the European Parliament. The European Council will be acting on the findings of the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers, ECOFIN, which itself will be acting on a recommendation from the European Commission. The Treaty requires the ECOFIN Council to assess for each member state whether it fulfils the Treaty conditions for the adoption of a single currency and whether a majority of member states meet these conditions.  For this purpose, the Council will have before it reports from the Commission and the European Monetary Institute on the <Col N="123" /> progress made in the fulfilment by the member states of their obligations regarding the achievement of Economic and Monetary Union.  If a majority of member states meet the conditions, the third stage can begin in 1997; if a date for the start of the third stage has not been set by end 1997, the third stage will begin in 1999.  It is now generally accepted that January 1999, rather than 1997, is the realistic date for commencement of stage three of Economic and Monetary Union.  This has been confirmed by ECOFIN and the European Council in September 1995.  Preparations at European Union and national level are geared to ensuring that the third stage proceeds on 1 January 1999.  As I have indicated in response to previous questions, Ireland currently meets the convergence criteria set out in the Treaty and the Government is committed to ensuring that we continue to fulfil the necessary conditions so that we will be ready to take part in the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union in January 1999.</P>
      <P>Deputy Power referred to recent movements in the exchange rate of the French franc.  Such movements in exchange rate markets are not unusual and reflect market reactions to economic and political events.  Their importance should not be exaggerated.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lynch referred to recent comments attributed to Chancellor Kohl.  I note that the media reports refer to comments which Chancellor Kohl is said to have made privately, and not to any public statements of German Government policy.  Germany has consistently supported the strict implementation of the Treaty provisions on Economic and Monetary Union, including the timetable laid down in the Treaty.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I dealt with the matter of a national forum in my reply to a question from Deputy Michael Ahern on 19 October. On that occasion, I stated that it would be premature to publish a policy paper on Ireland's approach to Economic and Monetary Union or set up a national forum on the issue.  This is still the position.</P>
      <P>I also said that practical planning for Economic and Monetary Union is continuing at both EU and national level. The main focus of our attention remains on the work at EU level.  Following the Cannes European Council meeting in June, two working groups were established at EU level under the auspices of the Monetary Committee to further practical preparations for the single currency. These groups met on a number of occasions and Ireland was fully represented. On 14 November 1995 the European Monetary Institute, of which the Central Bank of Ireland is a member, published a document dealing with the changeover to the single currency. All this work is providing a key input to the draft reference scenario or plan of action which was considered by the Council of Economic and Finance Ministers last Monday and will be considered by the Heads of State and Government at their meeting next month in Madrid.</P>
      <P>I also said that I will be developing our process of consultation further after the reference scenario is agreed.  I can assure the House once again that timely and wide-ranging consultation will take place with the relevant interests on the practicalities of the changeover to the single currency, which is obviously a matter of vital public importance.</P>
      <P>On 22 November the European Monetary Institute published a report on progress towards convergence in member states of the European Union in accordance with Article 7 of its statute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The EMI gave a positive assessment <Col N="125" /> of Ireland's performance on convergence. It acknowledged our good record on inflation, interest rates and the public finances including the fact that Ireland is one of only three member states deemed in 1995 not to have an excessive deficit.  The report also notes that in 1995 Ireland's forecast general government deficit will once again be below the Treaty reference value of 3 per cent of GDP.  In fact Ireland's deficit has been below 3 per cent of GDP every year since and including 1989.  The report also acknowledges the continuing reduction in Ireland's debt-GDP ratio, which is forecast to fall to 86 per cent in 1995.  This represents a decline of almost 32 percentage points since 1986.  Furthermore, Ireland is the only member state which will have a lower debt-GDP ratio this year than in 1991.</P>
    <P>Overall, the report concludes that a majority of member states do not currently satisfy all the criteria and that progress towards convergence is not sufficient. In particular, the report found the public finances in most member states to be far from satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The EMI also addressed, in respect of all member states, the risks affecting future progress towards convergence. On Ireland, it noted that the Irish pound's exchange rate remains below the ERM central parity against the strongest currencies.  The EMI also referred to a possible effect on inflation stemming from our continuing high economic growth.  The EMI also expressed concern about a recent deterioration in cyclically-adjusted budget balances.</P>
    <P>These remarks must be viewed in their proper context.  Ireland was not singled out for criticism.  For example, the EMI also cautions Germany, the EU's strongest economy, on inflation and the budget deficit.  The EMI's comments on fluctuations in our exchange rate reflect the impact on a number of currencies, including the French franc and Danish krone as well as the Irish pound, of US dollar and associated sterling weakness and the appreciation of the Deutsche-Mark.  The Irish pound <Col N="126" /> continues to trade comfortably within the ERM and has actually appreciated modestly in trade-weighted terms this year.</P>
    <P>Regarding the comments on inflation, I would remind Deputies of our excellent record on inflation in recent years, which has been maintained during a period of sustained economic growth.</P>
    <P>The EMI's assessment of our budget deficit is based on figures which include the full cash cost of equal treatment payments in 1995, amounting to £200 million.  While the cyclically-adjusted deficit can be a useful indicator of the conduct of fiscal policy, it is a somewhat controversial measure of fiscal performance and therefore its importance should not be overemphasised.  In this context, we have some reservations about the Commission estimates of Ireland's cyclically-adjusted deficit, on which the EMI assessment is based.</P>

      <P>It is a general principle of taxation that, as far as possible, all income from whatever source should be subject to tax.  In line with the principle most social welfare payments are reckonable as income for tax purposes.  This is essentially a matter of equity so as to treat people on similar income in the same way.  It is, therefore, not proposed to exempt social welfare payments from taxation.</P>
      <P>The extent to which taxation actually arises in a given case depends, of course, on the amount of other income that the social welfare recipient, or the recipient's spouse, has in the particular tax year.  If there is no other income in addition to the social welfare payment, the existing exemption limits and allowances can be expected to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on social welfare income itself.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that six units of the Customs National Drugs Team, CNDT, comprising a total of 15 staff are based in Howth with responsibility for combating drug smuggling along the east coast.  These units consist of one maritime unit, two intelligence units, two operational units and one sniffer-dog unit.  All the units are mobile and can be deployed rapidly to locations on the east coast, as required.  The CNDT units are on duty for a core period of 12 hours a day for six days each week and they operate outside those hours where necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="129" /> The CNDT carries out monitoring and surveillance of the movement of vessels, particularly vessels arriving from abroad.  Continuous monitoring of vessels at Howth itself is not carried out, as this is regarded as unnecessary, but yachts and other vessels have been boarded and searched by Customs from time to time as part of surveillance operations mounted at Howth.  The Naval Service can also be called upon, as required.</P>
    <P>Because of the vital role played by intelligence in combating drug smuggling, the Customs Service has devoted considerable attention to measures to enhance intelligence gathering.  One of these measures is the drugs watch programme under which the assistance of coastal communities and maritime personnel is enlisted by encouraging them to report unusual occurrences in their areas to Customs by freefone or freepost. Information about this programme has been distributed in the Howth area and the local community has responded positively by alerting Customs to suspicious vessel movements.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances I am satisfied with the level of surveillance carried out at Howth Harbour to monitor sea traffic there for the purpose of combating the illegal importation of drugs.</P>

      <P>Under the Strategic Management Initiative, or SMI as it is more commonly known, my Department carried out an in-depth analysis of its mission and objectives during 1994.  Under the SMI, the Department had set itself <Col N="130" /> many ambitious challenges and it was considered appropriate, in view of these challenges, to review the Department's organisation and structures.  This review was carried out earlier this year by management consultants, Price Waterhouse. While being a frank and thorough review of the Department's operations, the consultants' report reflected very favourably on the manner in which the Department discharged its complex and multi-faceted role, its level of performance, and the quality and commitment of staff in all areas of the organisation. The report found widespread evidence in the Department of best practice, the hallmark of which is a proactive approach both to the job on hands and acquiring the basic skills and knowledge required, both of which enhance staff mobility and versatility within the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the challenging and ambitious targets which the Department had set itself under the SMI, the consultants considered that some changes would be desirable, the principal ones being: the creation of a corporate services division, which would include the personnel section and the internal information technology, IT, unit.  The division would be responsible for developing and implementing an appropriate human resource strategy for the Department.  It would also be responsible for co-ordinating the Department's strategic management process and formulating the change programme now under way; the creation of a consultancy unit, comprising the Central IT Services, CITS, the Civil Service Training Centre, CSTC, and the Management Services Unit, MSU.  This unit would be charged with reorganising and refocusing the services which these sections have to date been providing to other Government Departments and offices with a view to putting in place a fully integrated advice and support service directed at the organisational and business development needs of the Civil Service; the establishment of a change management working group to work in <Col N="131" /> tandem with and to support the management committee in designing and planning the changes considered necessary to support the future evolution of the Department.  The group would also support the proposed corporate services division in implementing organisational change generally.</P>
    <P>I think the Deputy will agree that these constitute a comprehensive set of proposals which will take some time to put fully into effect.  However, valuable progress has already been made, for example, the new corporate services division has been set up, the consultancy unit is being established, improved reporting arrangements at senior management level have been set in train, a significant start has been made to implementing increased staff mobility, and a change management working group has been established.  This latter group, apart from assisting with and advising on the change programme generally, will also work closely with the corporate services division in devising a suitable human resource strategy for the Department.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased with progress to date and I am confident that, once the process has had time to take root, the Department will be well situated to address its complex and many faceted objectives and enjoy a solid basis for planning well into the next century.</P>

Of this amount 89.5 MECU, significantly over half of the EU funding approved, has been made available for the six Border counties, and, as in the case of the peace programme, matching funding will come from central Government, local authorities, the private sector and community groups depending on the nature of the project being funded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Expenditure under the peace programme and INTERREG II will be additional to spending in the Border <Col N="133" /> counties under the 1994-99 CSF operational programmes for Ireland and other Community Initiatives.  In order to verify this additionality the Department of Finance has requested Government Departments to compile details of forecast expenditure under each operational programme and Community Initiatives for each of the eight regions. These forecasts, which are now being finalised, will provide the baseline reference data for establishing additionality of expenditure under INTERREG II and the peace programme over the period of these programmes.  Procedures are being put in place to ensure that additionality of funding under INTERREG II and the peace programme will be verifiable and transparent.</P>
    <P>In the context of the peace programme the Department of Finance has asked Departments responsible for CSF operational programmes to examine the possibilities for refocusing these programmes in order to accommodate the new demands and challenges which have arisen following the cessation of violence.  While a major recasting of operational programmes should not prove necessary.  Departments are expected to examine possibilities such as advancing the timing of projects located within the Border region and increased opportunities for cross-Border co-operation.</P>
    <P>An INTERREG office was established in Monaghan last month and an INTERREG development officer has been appointed with the specific remit of assisting with the promotion of this programme on the ground both in the Border counties and Northern Ireland. He will also inform interested groups and individuals on other sources of EU funding for their particular projects.</P>
    <P>Some of the questions imply that the Government is forgoing or will forgo EU Structural Funds in order to keep overall Government spending under control.  This is not Government policy. The Government is committed to keeping public expenditure within the parameters set out in our policy document, <Col N="134" /> A Government of Renewal.  However these parameters are consistent with maximising the drawdown of EU funds under the CSF and Community Initiatives. The actual amount of funds drawn down in any year is of course dependent on the progress being made on project start-up and completion across operational programmes and Community Initiatives.</P>

      <P>In order to address the issue of rising public service pay costs, the Government decided to review the whole system of public service pay determination, to make the system more transparent and to include assessment criteria which strike a balance between the needs of staff, the Government and taxpayers alike.  The first step in implementing this new pay determination process was taken last year when a revised scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service was introduced.  The new features of the scheme include a three-person arbitration board and the introduction of agreed criteria, including the state of the public finances, to be taken into account at all stages of the process. There are new measures to ensure peaceful resolution of disputes and limitations on industrial action in the case of senior staff, those with personnel-management responsibilities and those involved in essential services.  The amended scheme for the Civil Service provides a model for the negotiations in other areas of the public service.  Negotiations are still in progress in the wider public service, and it is expected that revised systems of pay determination will be finalised in the coming months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, improving the competitiveness of the economy as a whole, including the Border counties, is a key element of the Government's economic policy.  Fiscal, monetary, incomes and sectoral policies are geared towards enhancing the economy's ability to compete effectively, so as to increase living standards and maximise employment potential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government recognises that the cessation of violence in Northern Ireland has opened up new opportunities on both sides of the Border. This increased cross-Border trade, and a gradual movement towards an integrated and all-island economy, <Col N="136" /> will benefit communities North and South.</P>
    <P>The new opportunities which exist for North and South form the key message of the book <i>Border Crossings.</i> The message is that opportunities exist, that there are many similarities between North and South, and that the common external challenge has never been greater.  The book argues for greater economic co-operation between Belfast, Dublin, London and Europe.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the Border regions benefit from this process of change, two programmes in particular have been established with the specific objective of providing assistance to the Border region: these are the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG programme 1994-99 and the special programme for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties. These programmes are additional to the CSF operational programmes being implemented in the Border region.</P>
    <P>The objective of the INTERREG programme is to promote the creation and development of networks of co-operation across internal borders of the European Union and assist such internal border areas to overcome development problems arising from their isolation.  All of Northern Ireland with the exception of Belfast, and the six Border counties of Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo are covered by the programme.  The programme is divided into five sub-programmes covering infrastructure, roads, energy, transport, telecommunications; environmental protection, management of water resources and removal of pollutants; natural resources; agriculture, fisheries, forestry; human resources, training and education; and economic development, tourism, community development, and special measures in economic development such as linkages.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="137" /> Under INTERREG a total of 156 million ECU of EU funds has been allocated to the Border counties and Northern Ireland for cross-Border projects. Of this amount 89.5 million ECU, significantly over half of the EU funding approved, has been made available for the six Border counties, and, as in the case of the peace programme, matching funding will come from central Government, local authorities, the private sector and community groups depending on the nature of the project being funded.</P>
    <P>The objective of the special programme for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties is to promote and assist peace and reconciliation in those areas.  The programme provides for actions under five broad themes: urban and rural regeneration; employment; cross-Border development; social inclusion; and productive investment and industrial development.</P>
    <P>The total EU funding available for the initiative will be 300 million ECU, IR£240 million, over three years.  Funding for a further two years is likely subject to a Commission review.  Up to 80 per cent of the funding will be available for activities in Northern Ireland and at least 20 per cent for activities in the Border counties.  At least 15 per cent of the overall amount will be devoted to activities carried out in a cross-Border context.</P>

      <Quest>the gross rise in the public sector wage bill for 1995; the prospects for 1996 in respect of public pay; and the relative increases in public sector pay and inflation in each of the years from 1993 to 1995.</Quest>

      <P>I will provide the Deputy with details in respect of the Exchequer pay and pensions bill which covers the pay and pensions of the Civil Service, the Garda, the Defence Forces, teachers and the pay <Col N="138" /> and pensions elements of grants to the health boards and other health agencies, non-commercial State bodies and third-level colleges.</P>
      <P>The total Exchequer pay and pensions bill figure contained in the revised Estimates volume for 1995 is £4,619 million.  This represents an increase of 6.1 per cent on the 1994 outturn of £4,355 million.  The reasons for this increase can be broken down as follows: pay increases under the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, 1.75 per cent; structural drift, 0.8 per cent; service improvements 3.5 per cent.</P>
      <P>The service improvements referred to include the costs of increased numbers of staff in the education sector, the health services, including acute hospital and childcare services, the Department of Social Welfare and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  Structural drift includes the cost of increments.</P>
      <P>The prospect for 1996 on public service pay is that the general round increases of 1.5 per cent from 1 June 1996 and 1.5 per cent from 1 October 1996 will have to be provided for.  These increases, as well as the carryover cost of the 2 per cent increase from 1 June 1995 will add, on an annualised basis, an additional 2.1 per cent to the Exchequer pay and pensions bill in 1996.  Discussions with a wide range of staff throughout the public service under the local bargaining clause of the public service annex to the Programme for Competitiveness and Work pay agreement are continuing.  At this stage it is not clear what form of agreements will emerge but in any event the cost will have to be within the parameters set out in the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, in the order of 3 per cent during the period of the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards public service numbers, the Deputy will be aware that the Government decided in July 1995 on a restrictive policy on recruitment to all the main areas of public service employment up to 1997.  This policy will result in significant savings to the Exchequer pay and pensions bill in 1996 and 1997. Further consideration is being given to <Col N="139" /> the staffing requirements in the main public service areas as part of the normal annual Estimates process.</P>
    <P>

      <P>Counties Cavan and Monaghan are two of the six counties comprising the Border region, and, as such, benefit from a number of EU funded initiatives specifically aimed at that region.  In addition to expenditure under the Community Support Framework, CSF, operational programmes and from the Community Initiatives in general, the Border region also benefits from the Ireland-Northern Ireland INTERREG Programme 1994-99. I assume, however, that what the Deputy has particularly in mind is the additional funding provided under the programme for peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland and the Border counties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the peace programme a total of 300 MECU, approximately £240, million, of EU funds is being provided over the period 1995-97.  At least 20 per cent of these funds, amounting to approximately £48 million, is being made available for the six Border counties. Under INTERREG II a total of <Col N="141" /> 156 MECU of EU funds has been allocated to the Border counties and Northern Ireland for cross-Border projects in infrastructure, environmental protection, natural resources, human resources and economic development. Of this amount 89.5 MECU, £72 million, significantly over half of the EU funding approved, has been made available for the six Border counties, and, as in the case of the peace programme, matching funding will come from central Government, local authorities, the private sector and community groups depending on the nature of the project being funded.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the Commission does not commit funding on a county by county basis, and individual counties in the Border region will benefit to the extent that project applications put forward meet the objectives of the programmes and achieve a sufficiently high priority.  It will be possible to give a county breakdown when the programmes have been completed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 58 and 70 together.  I have not costed the effect of recent currency fluctuations for Irish exporters generally or over the past six months, because I do not consider that such an exercise would produce satisfactory results.  This is for several reasons. To begin with, the impact of currency changes depends very much on the structure of individual firms.  For example, if a firm is exporting to both the UK and Germany, it is faced with an Irish pound which has increased in value against sterling since last year, but which has during the same period fallen against the Deutsche Mark.  The impact on individual firms will also be influenced by whether their raw materials are sourced in Ireland or elsewhere and their borrowings are denominated in Irish pounds or foreign currency.  In addition, any consideration of the impact of currency movements would also have to take account of other factors which affect and are affected by such movements, for example, interest rates and inflation rates.  In the case of interest rates, the level of indebtedness of the individual firm is again a key consideration. Furthermore, the impact of currency movements can be reduced or offset by financial techniques such as <Col N="144" /> hedging as well as by cost reductions implemented by the companies involved.  In these circumstances, I think the Deputy will accept that the costing exercise he suggests would require very substantial work, but could not produce meaningful results.</P>
      <P>As regards the effect on Irish exports of the value of the Irish pound against sterling over the past six months, I take it that the Deputy is primarily concerned with exports to the UK.  The latest published CSO trade statistics are for June 1995.  They show total Irish exports continuing to perform well. Exports to the UK rose by 11.5 per cent in value in 1994.  In the first six months of 1995 they rose by 15.3 per cent compared to the same period in the previous year.  As in 1994, this growth was concentrated in leading, high technology, sectors.  More detailed quarterly trade statistics on the commodity breakdown of trade with the UK have been published only for the first three months of the year.  They show that the value of exports from the predominantly indigenous non-leading sector industries grew by 3.5 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the same period last year.  This rate of growth is somewhat above the equivalent figure for 1994 as a whole.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that 16 customs officials are assigned to the passenger terminal at Dublin Airport with responsibility, as part of their normal duties, for the detection and prevention of drug smuggling. Two specialist units of the Customs National Drugs Team, that is, an intelligence unit and a sniffer-dog unit are also assigned to the airport and <Col N="145" /> these are engaged exclusively in combating drug smuggling both by air travellers and in commercial cargo.</P>
      <P>Normal Customs checks are applied to passengers and their baggage arriving at Dublin Airport on flights from non-EU countries.  Deputies will be aware, however, that in the Single Market, passengers from other EU countries &mdash; who represent the bulk of passenger traffic at the airport &mdash; cannot be required to clear Customs by entering the red or green channels and subjected to normal Customs checks.  Certain checks on these passengers and their baggage &mdash; in particular, checks to prevent and detect drug smuggling &mdash; may be carried out, but they must be unobtrusive, selective and highly targeted. Similar criteria apply to Customs checks on cargo from other EU countries.</P>
      <P>The Customs Service continuously monitors the movement of passengers and cargo through Dublin Airport and in particular the movement of known or suspected drug smugglers.  Because of the constraints on intra-Community checks to which I have referred, Customs now relies on special measures, including intensive gathering of intelligence, close co-operation with airlines and air courier companies, direct personal and computer links to customs services in other jurisdictions, as well as profiling and risk analysis techniques to pinpoint suspect consignments and to target the smuggler or suspected smuggler.  It also works in close collaboration with the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the nature of the anti-drug smuggling measures now employed at Dublin Airport, the ordinary traveller from an EU country will generally be unaware of Customs activity and surveillance. The measures taken are nonetheless effective, as evidenced by the level of seizures made.  Drugs with an estimated street value of over £1.8 million have been seized at Dublin Airport since 1993 and some of these have been quite substantial.  Individual seizures made so far in 1995 include heroin with a street value of £270,000, cannabis resin <Col N="146" /> with a street value of £150,000 and khat with a street value of £140,000.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I am satisfied with the present level of security at Dublin Airport to combat drug trafficking. Arrangements are, of course, kept under review.</P>

      <P>This matter is being considered in the context of overall proposals for reform of the public service generally which are currently being prepared by the Co-ordinating Group of Secretaries set up to oversee the Strategic Management initiative.  Earlier this year the Government mandated the co-ordinating group to prepare for its consideration such proposals.  I understand that the group will submit its proposals to the Government very shortly.</P>
      <P>Pending completion of the Government's consideration of the group's proposals, I am not in a position to say what the outcome will be in relation to the matter raised by the Deputy.  However, as I stated previously in reply to a question put down by the Deputy on 28 June last, I am positively disposed to the removal of the traditional promotion barriers in the Civil Service and would hope that progress can be made in this area on this occasion.  The Deputy will appreciate that existing promotion arrangements have been agreed with the staff side and any proposed changes will be a matter for discussion with staff interests generally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to comment on the CCI report <i>Government Department Financial Performance Indicators</i> published in August.</P>
      <P>The conventional wisdom among those who would offer advice to Government is that public expenditure in recent years has been rising too rapidly &mdash; much faster than inflation &mdash; but not that it is out of control as the Deputy suggests.</P>
      <P>The CCI report focused on the increases in administration costs for various ministerial Vote groups over the period 1992 to 1995.  It found that 1995 expenditure was 19.18 per cent above the 1992 base year as compared with a CPI increase of about 6.7 per cent over the same period.  Individual performances ranged from a low of -2.98 per cent for the Department of Enterprise and Employment to a high of +75.28 per cent for the Department of Equality and Law Reform.</P>
      <P>Elsewhere in its document, the CCI reports that NCSS expenditure rose at an average annual rate of 8.4 per cent in the period 1990-94, as compared with an average CPI increase of 2.7 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would endorse the CCI's valid concerns about the way in which public expenditure generally &mdash; and not just administration costs &mdash; has grown since 1990.  My main quibble with its report would be where it goes on to suggest that the rate of increase in administration costs for a particular Department is a reflection of its performance, good or poor, or &ldquo;fiscal incontinence&rdquo; as the report says.  This is far too simplistic an approach.  It rests upon a view that <Col N="148" /> Ministers or Departments have considerable discretion as to the amount of administrative resources they can commandeer. This is just not so.</P>
    <P>Where individual Departments' costs have diverged from the average, this is invariable due to a whole range of special factors, such as decentralisation initiatives by the Government which have temporarily boosted staffing numbers and also involved extensive fitting out costs; or decisions to expand existing services or introduce new ones arising from commitments in the programmes for Government of the various Governments over the period; or changes at EU level, such as the CAP reforms which led to new schemes for making support payments to farmers etc.</P>
    <P>As to what I and the Government intend to do about these increasing costs, we are taking a number of initiatives. For instance, last June we took steps to contain the rate of increase in public service numbers and stabilise this situation.  Secondly, we accepted, in our Programme for Government, the need to contain the growth in overall expenditure; in particular the growth in gross current supply services expenditure is to be limited to an average annual rate of 2 per cent in real terms in 1996 and 1997.</P>

    <P>The Group had the following terms of reference:</P>
    <P>(i)  to consider the development of a strategic management process in the Irish Public Service and to make recommendations to Government on any changes &mdash; legislative or otherwise &mdash; which are required to enable individual Secretaries to manage more efficiently and effectively, given the conflicting requirements of control and responsibility;</P>
    <P>(ii)  to facilitate the preparation of strategy statements at the individual departmental level and across Departments in an overall national strategy for the Public Service; and</P>
    <P>(iii)  to oversee the allocation of a fund to assist departments to acquire expertise in strategic planning and organisation development.</P>
    <P>The Group submitted its first report to Government in February 1995.  This report provided an update on progress in the SMI at departmental level and also set down an outline of possible <Col N="153" /><Col N="154" /> management changes.  Following consideration of the first report, the Government on 2 March 1995 mandated the Group to:</P>
    <P>(a)  review existing systems for making decisions, allocating responsibility and ensuring accountability in the Civil Service; and</P>
    <P>(b)  bring forward for Government consideration, by end-June 1995, proposals for an integrated programme to modernise the systems and practices in question and for the consequent modernisation of existing personnel and financial management in the Civil Service.</P>

    <P>To select key themes/policy areas which must be addressed if poverty and social exclusion are to be tackled and set specific targets within each theme against which progress can be addressed.</P>
    <P>To recommend the type of institutional mechanisms and structures which should be put in place to ensure that the issue of reducing poverty and social exclusion is firmly on the agenda of all Government Departments and Agencies, that there is appropriate co-ordination across and between Departments of policy in this area and independent monitoring of progress.</P>
    <P>The Committee will prepare a report, which will form part of the national report on the followup to the Copenhagen Summit for Social Development, to be completed by end 1996, to demonstrate national progress in implementing the UN commitment to eliminate absolute poverty in the developing world and to a substantial reduction of overall poverty and inequalities everywhere.</P>

    <P>1 Including PAYE on employee income of farmers.</P>
    <P>These figures do not include any yields in 1993 and 1994 under the 1993 tax amnesty.  Also excluded from the calculations are tax receipts from deposit interest retention tax because it is not possible to apportion that tax between particular classes of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The amounts paid by each sector must be seen in the context of the relative numbers of taxpayers in the PAYE and farming sectors.  It should also be noted that the amount attributed to the PAYE sector includes the tax paid <Col N="157" /><Col N="158" /> under PAYE on the employee income of farmers.  Such tax is included in the overall collection of PAYE and is not distinguishable until after the income tax returns submitted by farmers have been analysed.</P>
    <P>An analysis of the returns for the <Col N="159" /> income tax year 1992-93, the latest available, indicates that some £56 million in tax was paid by farmers, including farmers who have other trading income, or their spouses, under the PAYE system for that year.</P>
    <P>Farmers are assessable to tax on farming profits on actual income on the same basis as other self-employed taxpayers. The normal self-employed allowances may be offset against farming profits as well as special provisions in relation to stock relief and income averaging.  In common with other self-employed taxpayers, farmers are subject to the various compliance and audit arrangements which apply under the self-assessment system.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the evidence currently available from self-employed audits indicates that the compliance levels of farmers are comparable to those of other self-employed taxpayers.</P>

      <P>The legislation requires that all proposals to amend charges, terms or conditions must be notified to the bank. The bank may direct the licence holder to refrain from implementing any proposal which does not have its prior approval.</P>

      <P>The national debt at 31 October 1995 amounted to £30,246 million.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to say when economic circumstances may exist which would make it possible to achieve the levels of budget surplus required to pay off the national debt.</P>
      <P>This Government's policy is to maintain low budgetary deficits in order to continue downward pressure on the debt burden and meet the fiscal criteria set out in the Maastricht Treaty &mdash; i.e. to adhere to an annual general Government deficit of no more than 3 per cent of GDP and reduce the general Government debt to GDP ratio towards 60 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this context the 1995 budget allowed for an EBR of £813 million or <Col N="160" /> 2.4 per cent of GNP.  This equates to a general Government deficit of 2.7 per cent of GDP which will make 1995 the sixth successive year in which the Maastricht requirement of a maximum 3 per cent has been achieved.</P>
    <P>The national debt to GNP ratio has declined from a peak of 125 per cent in 1987 to 95.5 per cent at the end of 1994. Over the same period gross general Government debt as a percentage of GDP has declined from 116.9 per cent to 91.7 per cent.  It is expected that a further reduction of over 5 per cent will be recorded in these ratios in 1995.</P>

      <P>Any consideration of extending concessions to charities and voluntary organisations in relation to their liability for VAT is constrained by the fact that Irish law in this area must conform to EU VAT law.  The present situation, whereby charities and other voluntary organisations bear VAT on the equipment etc. they purchase, is a direct consequence of the Sixth VAT Directive.  It provides that most charitable activities are exempt from VAT: this means that bodies engaged in such activities do not charge VAT on the services they provide. However, as a necessary corollary, neither are they entitled to recover the tax borne on the goods and services <Col N="162" /> they purchase in the course of these activities.  Generally speaking, VAT can only be recovered by VAT-registered businesses.</P>

      <P>The total EU funding available for the initiative to support the peace process in Northern Ireland and the Border counties, Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Louth, Monaghan and Sligo, will be 300 million ECU, IR£240 million, over three years. Funding for a further two years is likely subject to a Commission review.  Up to 80 per cent of the funding will be available for activities in Northern Ireland and at least 20 per cent for activities in the Border counties.  At least 15 per cent of the overall amount will be devoted to activities carried out in a cross-Border context.</P>

      <P>Grants for remedial and resource teachers are paid to schools in December of each year.  Grants in respect of the 1995-96 school year will issue to schools in the coming weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each remedial and resource teacher post attracts an initial start-up grant of £400.  This is supplemented by an annual top-up grant of £200 to fund the replacement of equipment used through the course of the school year.  The grants in question were increased by 60 per cent in 1994.  The initial start-up grant was increased from £250 to £400 and the <Col N="169" /> annual grant from £125 to £200.  In the context of the many competing demands for extra resources in the special needs area, I am satisfied that the increases referred to constitute a significant response to the needs of the teachers in question.</P>
    <P>I will continue to review the level of grant provided to remedial and resource teachers in the context of overall resource availability.</P>
    <P>The decision to pay grants directly to the base school has been taken to facilitate the efficient operation of the payment process.  While the base schools involved will rarely change, the identity of individual post holders can change quite frequently due to the resignation, retirement or redeployment of the individual teachers involved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 91 to 94, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that, in early 1994, I commissioned a survey by the Service Industries Research Centre of UCD of the post-primary school needs of the Knocklyon-Scholarstown area of Dublin 14.  The research was carried out by Dr. Michael Bannon.  Dr. Bannon took account of the latest available statistical data for the area, including planning permissions for future housing, and concluded that a new post-primary school located in Knocklyon was not warranted.</P>
      <P>I accepted the recommendations of the independent consultant and decided not to proceed with the construction of a post-primary school for that area. Instead, I decided that the demand for school places should be met by providing additional accommodation at Coláiste Éanna, Ballyroan and Templeogue College.</P>
      <P>I have asked that the position be reexamined, at an early date, in the light of the Knocklyon post-primary committee's response to Dr. Bannon's report and the assessment of the report carried out by Mr. Hendrik van der Kamp at the request of the committee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Proinsias De Rossa)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 98 and 99 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To qualify for the old age contributory pension, a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.  This condition has been a feature of the scheme since its introduction in 1961.  The purpose of the condition is to link entitlement to a pension with a reasonable level of contributions to the social insurance fund during the course of a person's career.  This condition applies to self-employed persons in the same way as it applies to all insured people.  Accordingly, self-employed people, who became insured for the first time when social insurance was extended to the self-employed in 1988 and who were then aged 56 or over would not qualify for the old age contributory pension.  They are, of course, <Col N="175" /> covered for survivors' and orphans' pensions.</P>
    <P>However self-employed people in that age group who had been insured as employed contributors for any period prior to age 56 could qualify for the old age contributory pension as such insurance can be combined with insurance as a self-employed contributor for old age pension purposes.</P>
    <P>Refunds of the old age contributory pension element of the contribution may be made to those who entered insurance for the first time less than ten years before pension age and who fail to qualify for either old age contributory or non-contributory pension.</P>
    <P>Detailed consideration has been given by my Department to the possibility of providing for entitlement to the old age contributory pension to persons who entered insurance for the first time as self-employed contributors less than ten years before pension age.  In this regard, costings done in 1989 estimated that the net cost of paying old age contributory pensions to all self-employed contributors, who were aged between 56 and 66 in April 1988 would amount to £756 million over the lifetime of the persons concerned.  The extra rate of contribution which would need to be paid by self-employed contributors generally to finance such an extension would be 2.4 per cent over a 50-year period. Allowing self-employed persons to buy pension rights by paying the outstanding years contributions in order to qualify for an old age (contributory) pension would also be very costly to the Exchequer unless the payments made by the individual self-employed contributors were calculated on an actuarial basis.  The cost to an individual contributor of buying rights on this basis would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>The National Pensions Board in its final report Developing the National Pension System puts forward, <i>inter alia</i>, a number of recommendations relating to eligibility for old age pensions, including proposals for a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions related to the average <Col N="176" /> number of contributions over an insured's lifetime.  However, it also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for an old age (contributory) pension be increased from 156, three years, to 520, ten years, contributions.  The report and its recommendations are being studied within my Department at present.</P>
    <P>While I, in principle, favour a <i>pro-rata</i> pensions approach, I have no plans to relax the requirement that a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before pension age.</P>

      <Quest>the plans, if any, he has to implement a recommendation of the National Pensions Board final report entitled Developing the National Pension System, that a wider range of pro-rata pensions related to the average number of contributions over an insured person's lifetime would be payable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</Quest>

      <P>To qualify for an old age contributory pension a person must have entered insurance at least ten years before reaching pension age, have at least 156 contributions paid and a yearly average of at least 20 contributions, or 24 in the case of a retirement pension, registered since January 1953 (when the unified system of social insurance came into effect, or the time they started insurable employment, if later.</P>
      <P>The yearly average condition gives rise to particular problems for people with gaps in their insurance records. While a number of these problems have been addressed by my Department in recent years, the National Pensions Board, NPB, report recommended a <i>pro-rata</i> pensions scheme which, in its view, would resolve the problems arising from gaps in coverage in a more comprehensive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It recommended, <i>inter alia</i>, a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions related to the average number of contributions over <Col N="177" /> an insured's lifetime, where, for example an average of 45 or over, as against 48 at present, would qualify a person for the maximum rate of pension while a minimum 30 per cent of full rate pension would be payable for an average of ten to 14 contributions.  It also recommended that the number of paid contributions to qualify for retirement and old age contributory pension be increased from 156, three years, to 520 contributions, ten years.  As such proposals could lead to a reduction in entitlement for future pensioners, when compared with present arrangements, they have to be evaluated very carefully.</P>
    <P>These proposals which relate to a wider range of <i>pro-rata</i> pensions, require careful consideration before specific provisions are brought forward. Furthermore, the additional resources required would have to be examined in the context of the overall future funding of pensions.  I am not yet, therefore, in a position to indicate precisely when these provisions are likely to be introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Enterprise and Employment (Mr. R. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Intellectual Property Unit, IPU, of my Department is actively engaged in a comprehensive review of Irish copyright law.  The review is taking account of:</P>
      <P>(i)  our international obligations under the Berne Convention for the protection of literary and artistic works and the Rome Convention for the protection of performers, producers of phonograms and broadcasting organisations;</P>
      <P>(ii)  EU legislation on, <i>inter alia</i>, rental and lending, cable and satellite, broadcasting and duration;</P>
      <P>(iii)  technological developments;</P>
      <P>(iv)  the legitimate interests of both suppliers and users of copyright material and</P>
      <P>(v)  the need to ensure that copyright law does not impede legitimate creative activity.</P>
      <P>In the initial stages of its review the IPU received a substantial number of comprehensive written submissions from interested parties and afforded each group which made a submission an opportunity to add to the written material orally.  The IPU has recently completed this phase of the review process and commenced drafting the heads of consolidating legislation in this extremely difficult and technical area.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that copyright involves private property rights and that any legislation that expands the rights of one group will lead to additional demands on others.  Accordingly, there is a need to ensure that the Bill, when complete, strikes a balance between the interests of rights owners on the one hand and users on the other, whilst encouraging creativity in all spheres of economic life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> It is my intention to bring forward this legislation as soon as possible but the Deputy will appreciate that given the difficulties and technical issues involved, the importance of the legal rights provided for and the nature of our international obligations, we must proceed cautiously.  The Deputy can be assured, however, that there will be no delay in processing the legislation and that I will make every effort to expedite it.</P>

      <P>A scheme for the disposal of the remnants of the Joyce and Turner Estate, CDB 9965, was prepared in 1993.  Work on the scheme was temporarily delayed following the deployment in 1993 of staff from Lands Services Division of my Department to operate the area aid, general scheme.</P>
      <P>As I outlined in my reply to another question from the Deputy (No. 159 of 8 November 1995), staff were recently redeployed to Lands Services Division. This has enabled the scheme which had been prepared in 1993 to be re-examined. An investigation with the Land Registry Office of the lands proposed for resale was carried out.  This investigation showed that a number of the holdings included in the scheme have since been registered.  As a result, it is now necessary to prepare a revised scheme, which will exclude those lands which were registered since the original scheme was prepared.  All the relevant documents have been referred back to the local inspectorate so that they can commence work on a new scheme without delay.  The new scheme will be completed as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>Of the 44,026 1995 livestock aid applications recorded to date as having been received from Galway farmers under schemes that are subject to area aid application requirements some 2.75 per cent or 1,222 are not being paid because of area aid problems. It is estimated that the number of farmers who have such problems is about 400 out of approx.  15,700 livestock farmers in the county.</P>
      <P>I have asked my Department to take up with the European Commission the problems of non-submission and late submission of area aid applications in 1995 to see if it might be possible to resolve those problems.</P>

      <P>There have been two unsuccessful tendering procedures under the Essential Air Services Programme for the Dublin/ Sligo/Dublin and Dublin/Donegal/ Dublin routes.  Strict criteria are laid down, in accordance with European Regulations, with which applicant airlines have to comply.  The tenders received in response to the previous invitations were assessed at length in my Department in consultation with the European Commission.  Unfortunately, these tenders presented serious difficulties, for both the Department and the Commission, in relation to the suitability of the airlines and the scale of the financial compensation sought for operating the services.  I cannot be any more precise for confidentiality reasons.</P>
      <P>I am arranging for a further call for tenders for these two routes to be inserted in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department is consulting closely with both Sligo and Donegal Airport <Col N="186" /> managements and with the European Commission about changes in the specifications for the essential services in order to enhance the prospect of a successful outcome to this third attempt to secure suitable applicants.</P>
    <P>If the outcome is successful, it is hoped to award operating contracts in time for the 1996 season.</P>

      <P>Ireland now has 16 licensed carriers, only three of which, Aer Lingus, Ryanair and CityJet, operate international scheduled services. The bulk of their operations are within the European Economic Area (EEA) with only Aer Lingus operating to the US.</P>
      <P>There have been major regulatory changes associated with the liberalisation of international air transport in recent years.  As part of this liberalisation process, the role of Governments in controlling and regulating air transport has been progressively reduced.</P>
      <P>Within the EEA carriers are licensed in accordance with common rules and all such carriers are free to provide air services on any international route in the EEA without Government approval, provided slots are available at airports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Outside the EEA, traffic rights for air services are negotiated within the framework of bilateral air transport agreements.  Most of Ireland's bilateral air transport agreements provide for multiple designation of airlines from either country to service the routes specified in these agreements.  However, apart from the US, Irish airlines have <Col N="187" /> shown little interest in operating scheduled services to countries outside the EEA.</P>
    <P>In relation to the US Irish airlines have rights to four access points i.e. New York, Boston, Chicago and Los Angeles.  Currently, Aer Lingus operate to New York and Boston and plan to add services to Chicago in 1996.  Translift Airways, who have not operated any scheduled services for some time, operated to Los Angeles during the period May to September 1993.  There are at present no services to Los Angeles.</P>
    <P>It has been the general policy up to now to limit access on Ireland/US services to one Irish carrier per route.  This policy would be reviewed in the event of any approach by an Irish airline to operate new services to the US to any point served by another Irish airline, taking account, <i>inter alia</i>, of the need to develop more access capacity from our major tourism markets and the long-term need to maintain viable air services to and from the US.</P>

      <P>A scheme of improvements at a cost of £60,000 is at present being completed at Derryinver.  The investment now under way will enhance facilities available for local fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Galway County Council has forwarded proposals for further investment in the pier which have been drawn up by the local development committee. Given the level of funding available and the current priorities for essential works at a number of major fishery harbours I regret that I am not in a position at this <Col N="188" /> time to contemplate the provision of additional funding at Derryinver.</P>
